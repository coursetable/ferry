            "\u00a0The class was a great introduction to the concept of green engineering and sustainable design. You get to learn about the ideas behind the two and practice them in a supportive environment. It's a brief but good introduction to skills such as CAD and arduino constructing in relation to those two as well. ",
            "\u00a0Principals of sustainable design, life cycle analysis, how to give an effective pitch, innovating thinking and problem solving ",

            "\u00a0Understanding of green evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0This course challenges you to be a thinker and teaches step by step how to turn ideas into action through innovation ",
            "\u00a0I learned the process of determining what makes something sustainable based on the 12 principles of green engineering, and life cycle assessment. The final design project of the class was challenging and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the principles of green engineering and the circular economy. It gave me an insight into how we need to fundamentally change the process of design. ",
            "\u00a0Life cycle analysis and MCDA, Biomimicry. Principles of green engineering , the importance of challenging the status quo when it comes to the way that products are made to consider more sustainable and environmentally friendly products ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a systems perspective on sustainability, and an appreciation for the combination of obsurdity and obscenity that is the status quo. We learned valuable skills about the design process: we learned to empathize and understand issues through ethnography; to ideate with teams of diverse skill-sets; to make decisions with Life Cycle Analyses and Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis; to prototype with CAD and Arduino; to deliver an effective pitch to venture capitalists. This course gave us an awareness of the challenges we face in shaping a greener future, and inspired us to look to nature for solutions. One of the most important courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I went from knowing almost nothing about design-style thinking to feeling competent in that skill set. I learned the appropriate steps and developed the necessary resilience to be able to ideate, watch some things fail, and make difficult decisions undertaking a variety of criteria. I also learned how to assess whether something is sustainable using life cycle assessment tools and the 12 Principles of Green Engineering. ",

            "\u00a0The class does a great job of engaging students with active lessons. The material itself is interesting and important, and the professors and TFs that teach it are excellent. Sometimes expectations weren't exactly clear, and it was occasionally frustrating since students with stronger engineering backgrounds had a much better grasp of things like CAD. Overall, though, a worthwhile class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun and exciting class, good projects, interesting guest lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: not enough support in final project, not enough feedback given throughout the course ",
            "\u00a0This class asks for a lot. The final project seemed like it was asking more of us than we were prepared for. Its cool to see a solution you made though. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting course material, new perspective on how to evaluate the sustainability of products. Lots of excellent guest speakers. Lack of assistance in the engineering design component. All other design courses based in the CEID had extensive office / design hours to help students develop their products, this course had limited office hours by appointment during the day when students are in classes. I didn't feel my learning was supported. The design/prototyping aspect of the course was the worst organized I have seen out of all other courses in the CEID. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Guidance always available when asked for, always helpful and honest. ",
            "\u00a0The class challenges you to think outside of the box and requires you to think differently than in a normal lecture class. I liked how hands-on the class was and that we were able to spend a lot of time designing in the CEID. I also really liked the guest speakers and the trip to the Toy Fair! ",
            "\u00a0Great hands on experience working on the projects in the CEID. I found working in groups quite a challenge. It could have been nice to spend more time working in a range of groups before the main group project and have in class skills like laser cutting as it was very hard to get in. ",
            "\u00a0We had a lot of independence to carry out the projects that we were assigned. We received a lot of feedback and it was fun trying to design something to solve a specific problem. I think the weakness of the class is that we did not discuss a lot of material or learn about more environmental tools like carbon foot printing. I think it would be great to incorporate other units in the class because although I enjoyed working on the projects, I felt that we did that for so long, it felt very stretched. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and gives us a proficiency to conduct our own design process to develop sustainable solutions to complex problems. Each class gave us valuable perspectives or skills, and I especially appreciated when speakers came to talk about their work and give advice. The TAs were very responsive and helpful for our midterm and final projects. I appreciated our field trip to the NY Toy Fair, which put into perspective how much work remains in gearing the status quo on a more sustainable path. At the beginning of the semester, students have an opportunity to pitch a solution they would like to address, and I wish it had been more clear that these ideas were also possibilities for the final project topic (and not just an exercise). I would have also liked to hear more about Professor Anastas and Zimmermans research in class, and discussion of what potential careers exist for those interested in the field (given that it is changing greatly). I appreciated the phenomenal speakers that came towards the end of the semester, and would have gladly welcomed the idea of having more speakers throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that it changes how you see everything in life and inspires thinking on a deeper and more applicable level than memorization. I can't think of any weaknesses. There were many challenges, but they were all worthwhile. It would be nice if we had a lesson on how to work effectively in teams, as the group dynamics of working with 2-4 other people for the majority of the semester could be difficult to negotiate (even if one has an incredible team). ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped me improve my belief in my ability to do things engineer related and how to use my hands. "

            "\u00a0I was looking for an interesting elective for the mech e major (bs12), and this did the trick. Considering the sustainability of products in the market is critical in today's environment. This class set a foundation for making judgements of this characteristic and for taking action to improve it. Workload was very light in the first 2/3 of the class, but then picked up for the midterm project and the final. For the final, the class was mostly work sessions and occasional guest speaker events. The final project was very interesting, engaging, and multi-disciplinary. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a great class for anyone interested in what being green means in the corporate world, or who wants to learn what a sustainable product is. It's great especially for people with less of a strong engineering background, but also frustrating for them because it only briefly introduces things like CAD and arduino, and it can feel like there's a lot to catch up on. The project definitely takes time and can become stressful near the end of the semester, but working on a large group project like it is definitely a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a really fun class that addresses a critical issue in our world today ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to put in the time to a group project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in sustainability you should take this course! The design aspect of the class is very fun and rewarding! ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was great to do a hands on project. Very different to any other classes at Yale. It was quite stressful at the end and sometimes it hard to get the group to fully cooperate ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course enough for the awareness and design & systems thinking that it teaches. We become more critical thinkers and doers through action, and I have not seen any other courses like this one (if there are I would gladly take them). The perspectives the class teaches are invaluable for anyone interested in creating impact. Definitely take it if you are able to get a spot in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! It is probably my favorite class that I have taken at Yale. ",
