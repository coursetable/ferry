            "\u00a0An introduction to the social theory of social movements. I read the works of contemporary sociologists on varying topics such as policing and social movements, media and social movements, emotions and social movements etc. I wrote my first sociological research report where I had to conduct an interview and write down observations from a site. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about specific social movements, as well as how to broadly conceptualize them ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a solid foundation in the study of social movements. We explored the topics of leadership, tactics, recruitment, policing, history, conflict, information sharing, privacy, the media, and trans-nationalization. This course also served as an introduction to sociological research and bolstered my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course leads you to analyze social movements from a sociological perspective, and can almost be seen as a sort of \"How to\" for social movements.  You will look at the tactics, leadership, institutions, social and political context of social movements as case studies and through more theoretical/analytical papers and discuss them in class with Professor Bajc.  This is a class that is the kind that marinates in your brain.  Professor Bajc approaches this class with a great passion. "

            "\u00a0The course is almost entirely about the Civil Rights Movement. While this is obviously fertile ground for discussion of social movements, the course should have included a broader range of topics. Also, given the size of the class, the course should have been more discussion-based instead of lecture or presentation based. I would also eliminate the memos. ",
            "\u00a0I know that there isn't really a good textbook for this course, but I would rather not have the Blackwell Companion to Social Movements as the assigned reading for the course. The articles are too long to be able to get that much out of them and not that up-to-date. Having a documentary series to watch while we used the Civil Rights Movement as a case study of a social movement was really well thought of. I enjoyed the Micah White book, and I wish we could discuss that more. \r\nThe biggest weakness and cause of frustration of the class is the lack of structure and certainty. I didn't know what I need to do for the assignments. Things were worded very ambiguously in the syllabus and most times, I felt lost. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is its flipped-classroom style. Students were assigned topics to research extensively, then prepared and delivered a presentation to the class. This structure placed strong emphasis on creativity and analytical thinking, as students were encouraged to engage in weekly conversation and debate. The assignments were evenly spaced throughout the semester, and weekly memos served as check-ins to ensure that students were on track. The most notable weaknesses of the class were its redundancy in reading materials and extreme focus on the Civil Rights Movement. The class can be improved by expanding the curriculum to include a greater number of case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting analysis of social movements, you will walk out of class with an ability to analyze tactics, state responses, political contexts, etc. of Social Movements.  Very interesting to heavily analyze the Civil Rights Era with a professor who is not American.  While this class is most relevant for social movements, the lessons and analysis from this class is very applicable for a variety of institutions.  The final project is very engaging and interesting.  Feedback is pretty good. Professor Bajc is an engaging and engaged professor who loves to talk with her students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Guidelines can be unclear.  When it comes to the syllabus, the word limit and the tasks often do not line up. "

            "\u00a0If the course remains the way it is, I do not recommend the course for upperclasspeople. The level of discussion and challenge was well suited for a first or second year student. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good introduction to social movements and sociology course. You learn lots of new things and the discussions with Dr. Bajc are very fruitful. However, if receiving feedback and knowing what you need to be doing for an assignment are important to you, you might feel a little too much frustrated with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they were aware and expecting to write at least twice as much for each of the responses, including the weekly memos and the midterm and final. The word counts suggested on the syllabus are way too low to include everything required ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The workload is manageable, and the discussion topics are intriguing. The professor is kind, patient, and understanding, but she also expects the best from her students. Be ready to complete a decent amount of research on your own time and engage in conversation every week. While the flipped-classroom style was enjoyable, it often left something to be desired. I sometimes felt that I was not learning concrete information, and I did not pay close attention to certain presentations as a result. However, this lack of core structure may be appealing to some students. This class is the raw definition of a seminar. If you are interested in activism, it's a must! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  Professor Bajc is very passionate about the subject.  It is definitely a sociological class, but it most certainly does not require a sociological background.  The class was always very interesting, with a good amount of participation.  Work is not too intense and generally interesting, especially the weekly case-studies.  As long as your final project is reasonable, it is very interesting to dive in on your own--you will get a lot out of this class. "
