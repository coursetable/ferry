            "\u00a0In this class, we covered many of the important creative choices, characters, directors, actors, and general trends in Classical Hollywood (many of which still influence today's major films).   After taking this class, I can see where many modern films and storylines got their inspiration, and how the culture of early Hollywood set a difficult precedent for power dynamics which people are now struggling to upheave. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge related to a filed of history I knew absolutely nothing about before starting this course. I now feel as though I understand the history of Hollywood in the first half of the twentieth century extremely well. ",

            "\u00a0You learn so much about the beginnings of Hollywood and how movies have evolved! It also gives a perspective on how many \"layers\" there are to a movies: before the lecture Prof. Thomasson would usually play the soundtrack from a movie related to that week, we'd learn the names of cinematographers, costume designers and stuntmen, and we'd discuss movies in the historical context.

            "\u00a0The professor is one of the best ones I've had at Yale. Prof. Thomasson is very knowledgeable, very well-prepared for the class and very passionate. She teaches with such care to her students, even remembering almost the names of all students in her class. ",

            "\u00a0Best course & professor combo at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This class contained an abundance of interesting information, which was all taught in an interesting way.  Sometimes, though, I felt that it was difficult to retain all of the names of directors, films, and actors that we learned at one time. ",
            "\u00a0The class was outstanding. Each lecture was fun, informative, and engaging. I cannot think of any improvements. ",
            "\u00a0Camille Thomason and my TF, Carolyn Jacobs, honestly are both Yale angels. They are brilliant, engaging, kind women who are truly invested in enlightening their students of the magic and the downfalls of classical Hollywood. Professor Thomasson taught a variety of movies with enthusiasm and grace. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomasson is one of the best people at Yale. I am so grateful to have had the privilege of listening to her impeccably crafted and thoughtful lectures. I love seeing her around campus now. She encourages you to pursue what you love in paper topics. ",

            "\u00a0The only thing I would change about this class is I'd have the lecture notes posted online just because they are so well written I'd like to be able to read them agin. The class is otherwise impeccable. The lectures and incredibly well thought out and would always leave me smiling, the assignments encourage you to do something you love and the sections are a good opportunity to discuss the things that have caught your attention in that week's screening.

            "\u00a0This was truly the best class I've taken in my four years at Yale. Camille is an unbelievable lecturer who puts all of herself into each class, and invests deeply in the experience of each student in the course. I cannot recommend this class highly enough, no matter how experienced or inexperienced you are with film courses. Camille is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of professor. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. One of my favorite, if not my favorite, courses I've taken at Yale. Professor Thomasson's lectures are so engaging and you come out with a good understanding of film and exposure to a lot of different classic movies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great introduction to the wonderful world of film and the intellectual delights available if you scratch beneath the surface of your regular movie-going experience. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely-- I think the topics covered in this class are important things for any student to know.  I don't plan on being a film major, but this class gave me an important perspective on the influence of film over the past century (including modern Hollywood). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! No matter their engagement in film, anyone who enjoys watching movies and wants to learn about a history rarely covered in the classroom should take this class. Camille is honestly one of the best lecturers at Yale. Her style is truly unique and you won't want to miss any of her classes. If you have the chance to take this course, do! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to every Yale student. It was a joy to go to lecture and all of the assignments were fun, manageable, and intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the material is really interesting. The first two classes are not representative of the whole semester. It is a fun and stimulating class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who can fit it in their schedules. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you haven't taken any film courses, Classical Hollywood Narrative is a great introduction, and if you have, the subject is so interesting that there is plenty to gain from it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, yes. The goal of this course was to make everyone understand how Old Hollywood worked and fall in love with the films of that era - it 100% succeeded for me. I'd previously seen some classical Hollywood films, but not tons, and now I just want to keep watching them. I also loved learning about how the films were made, the people that made the films happen, the issues in Hollywood at the time, the structure of the storylines... it was all great. I knew going into this course that those were subjects I was interested in, but what really makes this class incredible for absolutely anyone is Camille Thomasson. She is clearly in love with the course material and makes that love felt in every lecture she teaches. This is the best class I've taken at Yale and Camille is the best professor I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student -- it's a really fun way to learn about film and the history around film. You get a writing credit, a fun discussion section, and weekly movie screenings. Take this class!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any person who thinks they may have any interest in classical hollywood. The class is extremely engaging, and the films are very interesting to watch. There was never a class that I didn't look forward to, and each class completely lived up to expectation. ",
            "\u00a0I can't emphasize just how good this class is! I'm a STEM major and I was just looking for a Hu class, and finding this class might have been the best accident of my time at Yale. I would always leave lecture feeling so much joy (OK, sometimes sadness when we were talking about sexual exploitation) and just wishing it had been longer. Prof. Thomasson is probably the most amazing professor you'll ever encounter and you'd be missing out if you don't take this class. "
