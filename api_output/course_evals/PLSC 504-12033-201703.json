            "\u00a0I liked the coverage of propensity scores/matching and sensitivity analysis, which were largely new topics for me. Other material in the course had been covered in the other stats courses and so was not very new. The problem sets did not involve very challenging programming, so I did not gain R skills either. ",

            "\u00a0I think the main points for improvement would be, first, integrating some examples, if only in 1-minute shallow explanations to make the theoretical discussions more concrete, and second, not going as much into depth on proofs. For students who mostly want to do applied work, some of the theoretical discussions were not very useful and took up time that could have gone to discussing other concepts. Ultimately, we just need enough familiarity with most of these methods so that we know what is out there, what its strengths and weaknesses are, and who we should read/talk to when we find a possible application in the real world. Knowing how to prove unbiasedness and so forth is important, but it was given a little too much attention I think. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: very focused presentation of material ",
            "\u00a0The discussion of assumptions was useful and I enjoyed the visuals used to illustrate points.  I missed a mathematical approach, as many points felt hand-wavy.  Fredrik did a good job in lecture but he reviewed too much each class.  The first 15-20 mins was always a review, so he never finished the material for the day.  In the end, we didn't cover many of the specific subjects I was excited to discuss.  We also spent too much time discussing the theory of causality.  I find this material interesting, but it can be condensed from a month to two weeks max.  I did enjoy how homeworks clearly demonstrated specific points and had an overlapping narrative.  It made it interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Well-planned lectures, introduction to big ideas. \r\n\r\nThere was a lot of repetition and lesser of a focus on revision. \r\nThere were many very technical details we got lost in. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Fredrik's initial approach of delving deep into the theoretical foundations was warranted and great. He listened to class feedback that they wanted more applied content, but I was enjoying the theoretical grounding that Fredrik emphasized. It could be improved by giving more homework. ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n-- I thought the textbook was great and the professor's lectures were well-prepared and clear. I thought the balance between explanation through broader conceptual discussions and then through more intense, formal mathematical notation was appropriate\r\n\r\n-- The final paper allowed us to have a more in-depth exploration of a topic that we found particularly interesting/applicable to our research\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n-- too much discussion about philosophies of causation at the beginning of the class\r\n \r\n-- not enough discussion of applications to social science research (would have been nice to incorporate replication exercises into problem sets - i.e. retrieve results that scholars reported in a particular paper, using their data)\r\n\r\n-- problem sets could have been longer/more intense; supplemental quizzes might have been helpful as well in getting us to memorize basic things we were learning in the class\r\n\r\n-- there were lots of papers/chapters assigned each week but we didn't directly discuss most of them; it would have been nice to delve into those a bit more ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in formulating the process by which one could approach the general topic of quantitative methods (i.e. the flow charts at the beginning of the semester were very useful for framing). That said, it was a bit unclear how this class theoretically should have differed from PLSC503. There was a bit more rigor in the homeworks (which were very well-curated to the lectures), but the topics seemed to have a great overlap. ",
            "\u00a0We received fairly regular feedback on our problem sets (via personal feedback and answer keys) so that we could correct any of our errors earlier than later.  Both the TA and instructor were very receptive to meeting and providing additional support for problem sets and projects.  Fredrik, the instructor, met with all of the students in the course to give us input on our final projects. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne weakness I found was that when we would review proofs on the board, they were not always easy to follow.  If we did not record the proofs perfectly, there was no readily-available text or lecture notes that we could refer to to practice these proofs. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong on the theory and conceptualization of the concepts mentioned above. Fredrik does a good job make them formal enough to be rigorous but still accessible to students with prior preparation but who are not experts.\r\n\r\nThe course needs more applied examples to help illustrate its concepts. I consistently understood topics when Fredrik or Kyle provided examples (even silly or toy ones such as tiny datasets or questions about dog vs. cat intelligence). I found some of the topics that were not attached to hypothetical or real empirical settings much more difficult to follow. If the course used a few simple, recurring settings (such as the asprin example from class or the civics lesson example from problem sets) and put each concept in that context, it would be much easier to follow.\r\n\r\nOn the below scale, I would say the course started out as just \"fair\" due to the difficulty in following some of the more abstract material and ended as \"very good,\" perhaps simply as Fredrik found his rhythm and settled in. I give it a \"good\" rating as an overall average but think it was definitely on the up at the end. ",

            "\u00a0more application will be helpful ",
            "\u00a0Right amount of assignments that were carefully selected, didn't feel like we were made to do busy work for the sake of it.  Problem sets were interesting and gave a taste for how to go about some of the concepts and techniques we were learning about but would have been good to actually practice application for relevant research. Course could generally have been more applied. A lot of time was spent on theory. Great that we received feedback on time and in detail thanks to professor and TA who were responsive and committed to students' progress. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved by reducing the amount of overlap the course had with previous courses in the quantitative methods sequence. This would allow the course to cover a few new topics which would be helpful for those students who are more interested in quantitative research designs. "
