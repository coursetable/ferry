            "\u00a0I developed stornger skills in Spanish comprehension and speaking. I now understand particular grammar rules that I was once vaguely familiar with and questioned. ",
            "\u00a0Learned several new conjugations, lots of new vocab, and useful other useful phrases or grammatical structures. This class definitely improved my Spanish in all aspects - writing, reading, listening (especially), speaking ",
            "\u00a0Got a lot of practice with Spanish and became much more conversational. The course is in large part reviewing vocabulary and grammar and more geared toward applying what we already know. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught a lot of vocabulary and Spanish grammar primarily. I also feel much more confident to read Spanish articles/literature as well as a very noticeable increase in my listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0I felt more comfortable listening to and speaking spanish.  I can understand the language if necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conjugate Spanish verbs in the present indicative, subjunctive, and command form, as well as preterite indicative and subjunctive form. I also learned new vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Intense knowledge about vocabulary, grammar, especially subjunctive tenses; difference in imperfect and preterite and how to use them; differences in para and por; making comparative statements. By the end of this course, I have also begun to be quite competitive in listening to and understanding conversational Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This course has expanded my Spanish vocabulary and increased my proficiency in speaking Spanish. I also learned new verb tenses and how to properly use them. ",
            "\u00a0L3 definitely puts more emphasis on the past tense/conditional/subjunctive, so I got a bit of a refresher in those topics but then we got more in depth in the latter half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class really strengthened my writing and conversation skills in Spanish. The subjects covered allowed me to diversify my speaking and add a lit lot more complexity. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths were that the professor was very good and consistently spoke and Spanish and extended help towards me and my peers. The weakness is the cost of the textbook and the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learning to converse in class. Pilar was very engaging and funny in class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lengthy online homework that did not help me learn as much as other assignments ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is Pilar. She is absolutely amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pilar is the best thing about the course without a doubt. She made every day worth coming to class. The weakness if this course was an overwhelming amount of work that I felt like mostly didn't help me. The tests and quizzes were super difficult. Finally, I feel like the course doesn't help you improve your speaking very well. There were many people in my section, and it made it difficult to practice speaking when a few people dominated class always. I would suggest cutting back on some of the busywork and instead focusing more on test preparation, practice, and oral practice. The texts/movies we read/watched were great. ",
            "\u00a0While it is a total hastle, I understand having spanish meet everyday.  However, having homework do everyday is unmanageable and highly stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how many opportunities there were to participate in this class. ",
            "\u00a0strength: Pilar is the best professor! She is kind, patient, and super engaged in students' learning process. ",
            "\u00a0The importance of the homework was not stressed and I missed several assignments because I did not see them in the syllabus. There are both internet software-based and workbook-based assignments. I think that the course needs sections so that students can interact with each other in Spanish more often and so that they can collaborate on the homework assignments. \r\n\r\nAlso, the tests are weighted as 10% of the grade each, and there are only 3 of these. There are 2 quizzes each worth 9% of the total grade. I do not believe that this rubric is equitable. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is very expensive for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teacher (Prof. Pilar) was super engaging and willing to meet with you whenever you need help. This won't be true for every class, but my class had really good chemistry and we would often bounce ideas/conversations off of each other. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TESTING. It was super, super detailed. The speaking assessments and essays weren't that bad, but the actual tests were pretty difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The major strengths were my teachers communication to students in class and all the writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0There was a good amount of exercises that help improve conversational Spanish, but the many readings that are assigned are often pejorative and offensive to groups of people. Hopeful, these disturbing readings will be removed, but nevertheless, the class was decent in helping to improve Spanish. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you really desire to improve your level of Spanish comprehension and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, but only if you have a real interest in improving your Spanish to become fluent or almost fluent by the end of your Spanish education ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn more Spanish grammar and vocabulary, by all means take it. However, know that unless you are in a small class, you may not get very much speaking practice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have to take it. It's a lot of work but can be rewarding. Study for the tests because they are very, very difficult without extreme preparation. Take the class with Pilar! She is the most amazing professor; she is hilarious, sassy, and really cares about her students. There is likely no other professor I have taken a class with that is as understanding as Pilar. She will cut you some slack if you fall behind on some assignments because she knows the schedule is crazy. An overall okay course that could be improved by reducing the course load and focusing more on test preparation/oral practice. ",
