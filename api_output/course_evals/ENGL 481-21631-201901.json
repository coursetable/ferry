            "\u00a0So so so so much. I don't even know where to begin. Part of me doesn't want to recommend this class because I don't want it to become one of those creative writing classes that 1000000 people shop each semester and it's impossible to get into (*cough* *cough* @writing humor), but I would be being ingenuine if I said anything less than this class changed my entire academic and writing perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class about theatre, writing, and life in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much beautiful and important stuff about what it means to write a play. I am a better writer and artist than I was before this class. ",
            "\u00a0How to tap into your own emotions and experiences and bring them to life through theater writing. This class is not just about writing a working draft; it's about learning to better understand yourself and how you express yourself through writing ",
            "\u00a0This playwriting class teaches you how to find a passion you want to speak to in your writing and then, of course, write to it. Through in-class readings, you hear your work and what it needs, and feedback from others and the professor allows you to feel like a professional playwright workshopping their scenes. ",
            "\u00a0I got to spend a lot of time focused on my own artistic process and learn from the artistic process of others in playwriting. ",
            "\u00a0how to think about plays, how to think and restructure ideas in theater, how to have a dialogue with yourself and others in a creative community ",

            "\u00a0It's great. Keep doing what you do, Deb ",
            "\u00a0This writing process asks you to open yourself up to finding a desire and conflict of the heart, and you write scenes and portions of the play to that desire as the feeling comes to you; it's a process that doesn't have very formal deadlines but asks you to commit yourself and your life to daily writing. It's a process that has no formal deadlines except for \"write half a play before spring break\" and \"write the rest of the play (to a working final draft stage) by the end of the year,\" so if you're not ready for that style of class, you might not be ready for this artistic devotion process. ",
            "\u00a0It's very open ended which can be good for some students and not as good for others. I think having some outside reading in addition to the writing might have been helpful for me personally though I don't know if that would be valuable for other students. ",
            "\u00a0This course can't really be improved upon. Every component of it is integral to the experience  Deb, the community, the sharing, independent work and communal at the same time ",

She cares deeply for all of her students, and creates a real sense of community in the classroom. Her advice on writing is specific to each individual needs, and it is incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you want to write a play. Deb is brilliant, wonderful, funny, an inspiration. This class is unlike other classes at Yale--  you get to be a part of a truly nurturing community of writers. ",
            "\u00a0OH YEAH\r\nHonestly, just go in and sit in the class even if you don't get in. Meet Deb Margolin; get to know her; she's so happy to know you in return. This class has enlightened me about myself and how I want to write. So if that's what you're looking for, take the class ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who has a desire or conflict of the heart to which they have not been able to express yet, I would recommend this class and this artistic process, especially if you are a playwright and are looking to try a new style of writing that might be different than a normal \"write scene 1 then 2 then 3...etc.\" process. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you just want to explore an alternative method of thinking and approaching the world, playwriting as we've studied in this class can be mind changing ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in any type of writing whatsover Deb teaches you playwrighting but also just teaches you the basics of how to write truthfully. This is necessary for anyone who would like to put words down on a page and call it something. "
