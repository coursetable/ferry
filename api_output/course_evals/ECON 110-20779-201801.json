            "\u00a0We often went off topic in class with the consequence that we didn't finish the material in the textbook and often didn't go into great detail on the chapters we did learn. I had to teach myself a good amount. ",
            "\u00a0It was fun and decently taught ",
            "\u00a0Improve the explanation of the mathy bits. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course material builds over the course of the semester, so it's easy to build connections between old material and new material. I like that Tolga made a point of giving examples along the way and critiquing each economic model.\r\nWeaknesses: Everything was so theoretical and based on many assumptions. Although, the examples definitely helped. I guess my quarrel is with microeconomics in general. ",
            "\u00a0The particular section that I was in was weird because it was supposed to be a seminar but we ended up having about 40 people in the class. This was a weird size: the point of a seminar is to be able to have small class discussions. I thought the content was good and I liked the textbook that we used. ",

            "\u00a0I think the textbook was very clear and much better than the one used for the lecture class. The seminar format really helped me understand the material by keeping me engaged in the class. I liked the psets and i never felt like we were doing extraneous or irrelevant work. I also think the video lectures available online were very helpful. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: professor is fun and friendly, textbook feels mostly accessible \r\nweaknesses: lectures and textbook sometimes did not match so it was difficult to determine what was needed to be understood; math was done extremely quickly during class so people who couldn't do the math as quickly as everyone else struggled hardcore; class size, despite seminar status, made it too difficult to access professor personally and ask questions ",
            "\u00a0More time spent on applications from the book ",
            "\u00a0This seminar ended up being over enrolled so it ended up being more of a lecture. Tolga was good at teaching the material but sometimes it was hard find time to ask questions one on one (his office hours were always full) ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot during lecture, but sometimes Tolga would digress and talk about his stories, which would leave 10 minutes at the end of the class to rush through complicated concepts. I think if he saves the stories and applications until the end, it would be a lot easier for students to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is well organized and Tolga has obviously practiced the delivery of many of the lessons year after year. However, he sometimes struggles a bit with time management and isn't able to finish the lessons fully. Overall I don't necessarily feel that I gained a huge amount to knowledge or an understanding of/way of looking at modern economic issues. That may be something that you need higher level classes in order to grasp. ",
            "\u00a0The curve in this class is absolutely brutal (although it is just the normal econ department curve; it's the class's small size that is the problem) and takes some of the enjoyment out of it because you can feel the competition between everyone. However, forcing everyone to work incredibly hard was also a strength of the class; I do feel like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-taught and well-structured. I just wish that more study tools were available at times, as often the textbook examples didn't match what we were covering in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Its such a classic yale course ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It can be a bit dull and pseudo-sciency at times, but I learned a lot about basic economics and what makes trade tick. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good intro course for getting into economics. It's very theoretical and makes a lot of assumptions, but the ideas are interesting and self-consistent when you put them into graphs. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. No matter what you want to major in, this class is a good thing to take. Understanding the basic functions of the economy can help you understand a lot about policy and make rational decisions about your own finances. It's a really good and useful QR credit. Tolga is also just a great guy. If you can get into his section, take it with him. I suck at math (placed into 110 and didn't take it) and I was fine. All you need is basic algebra and the ability to take simple derivatives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good introduction and I think a good way to determine whether or not you are interested in persuing econ further ",

            "\u00a0This class gave me a great background on microeconomics, a class I had never taken before. I would recommend it to anyone who had never taken an economics class before. ",

            "\u00a0If you're a prospective econ major and need intro micro, this is a great option, or if you really want a very good foundation in econ. Otherwise stick with the lecture, as it will be less stress grade-wise. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It was incredibly educational while also never being boring due to all of the real-life applications. "
