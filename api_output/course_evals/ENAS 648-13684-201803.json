I like that the exams were not cumulative and focused on different aspects. \r\nThe only problem I had during my study was to correct the mistakes in my homework because I usually discussed the homework problems with TF or other students before I turned in and I thought I already made my best answers. I think I should be more active to ask for help to correct my answers but maybe it's also helpful for the TF or instructor to post standard answers online. ",
