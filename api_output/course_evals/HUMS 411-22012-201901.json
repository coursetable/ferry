            "\u00a0I developed many insights about my own personal priorities and how people from various traditions evaluate the world around them and their own lives within it. ",
            "\u00a0More knowledge on some of the traditions that say something about how to live, and therefore a better ability to form questions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned frameworks for evaluating the normative questions of life: What is our purpose? What is the meaning of life? I also learned how other people from varying backgrounds approach and answer these questions. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me the three forms of flourishing in life: life going well, life led well, and life feeling good. I learned about how other traditions approach these questions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate different visions of life worth living espoused by various religions. I learned how to say No to a vision of good life that you may partially agree with, but some of those vision is also in conflict with your own personal moral compass. ",
            "\u00a0Insights into various traditions and some of the values and assumptions within them ",
            "\u00a0Like any humanities course, through Life Worth Living (LWL) everyone improves their critical reading skills and writing abilities. However, while other humanities courses might implicitly cause you to reflect on your life, your future, and your role in the world through the process of understanding different timeless aspects of the human experience, historical patterns, philosophical concepts, and other perspectives, LWL is perhaps the Yale class that is most directly structured towards providing the space for you to delve deeply into the big question of what makes your life worth living. Through the syllabus, LWL could be understood as a survey class on what some of the major religious and philosophical traditions have to say on what constitutes a life worth living, but it is also balanced well to provide you with space to think about the personal relevance of the traditions to your own life. This course will not provide you with the answers for how to live your life, but it will provide you with a structure that can be very helpful in guiding you towards some of the most important questions and providing you with context for what some of the most influential answers have been in the past. All this said, like any course you get out of it roughly what you put in, so if you do decide to take it make sure to apply at a time when you are ready to think deeply. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to ask questions about my values and beliefs, and I learned how to start thinking critically about what makes my life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking about lifes most important questions ",
            "\u00a0Life worth living gave me the vocabulary to articulate my views and perspectives on life, and exposed to different philosophies of living that has caused me to change my own. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me very specific and hand-selected traditions and practices that involved both religious and secular thought. More specifically, we used a framework of three questions to look at certain aspects of religions. I was able to develop skills in finding holes/misunderstandings in arguments and how to discuss them as a group. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great content, interesting lectures, fabulous mission\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion sections didn't always ensure that the key takeaways from each reading set were understood by everyone in the course; could have done more on the skills development front (how to read charitably, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0The section with Ryan McAnnally-Linz was fantastic because we skipped a lot of the superficial ways to read the text and got to the big questions quickly. The lectures were often informative and beautiful. The retreat was important. Biggest weakness of the course seems to be how differently each section is run. While I was very happy with my section because I am more attracted to the bigger philosophical questions, I suspect some people were put of by those discussions. Similarly, other sections were much more practical, which i would not have appreciated and others did. I would hope there was more clarity about that. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture could be during a time that does not conflict with varsity athletic practices. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging, personal, seminar was always fun and people were always eager to share, very organized\r\nWeaknesses: the timeline to get the reading done was too short ",
            "\u00a0this course seems to be taught entirely by white Christian(?)'s, which does not inherently harm the course, particularly since the guest lecturers are very diverse. But I wonder if having a more diverse teaching staff could alter any tones of discussion in doing readings or even selecting guest lecturers ",
            "\u00a0Overall I thought the strengths of the course far outweighed the weaknesses. The instructors are all very intelligent, passionate and caring, I personally found all of the readings very interesting, and the essays were well structured to prompt reflection. The guest speakers were all actually very cool and interesting to listen to. I'm not sure if this is a popular opinion but honestly I feel like the course could have been improved by the very simple step of allowing longer word limits on the reading responses and the essays. The reading response word limits were all 200 words per week while the essays were only 750, 1000, and 1250 words, and there wasn't anything I wrote for this class that I didn't feel like to could have been much, much longer. Even if the reading responses were increased simply from 200 to 300 words and the essay word limits were increased by 250 words each that would be a good start in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Brilliantly designed course ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are its breadth of topics, and its sensitivity to the different backgrounds and perspectives each person holds when coming into the course. The lecture guests could be a hit-or-miss. Overall, it was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is structured in a way that, although a bit limiting, allows for discussion to be focused every week. I also appreciate that each week involves a hyper-specific focus on an element/thought within each tradition. Some of the guest speakers were really cool too! I think the course could be improved through a more diverse faculty and perhaps engaging with the traditions a bit more through organizing around things like Slifka's shabbat dinners or a Buddhist Sangha event. I also wish we could have a bit more clear feedback on our writing. "

            "\u00a0Yes, what makes life worth living is an important question to ask as you make decisions throughout your educational career about what path your own life should take. It will help you understand yourself better, as well as develop empathy and understanding for others. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I was bale to form a view of a life worth living that I would not have been able to without the course's papers and readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This is the best course I have taken at Yale. No other course answers or at least considers the deepest questions of life like this course does. The readings and class discussions are fascinating and deep. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great opportunity to start reflecting on your values. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0yes definitely, but only if you are genuinely interested in pursuing the questions asked, in doing the readings and learning as much as you can about perspectives on life outside your own. it's possible to get very little out of this course if you take it as a gut or cr/d, which is not an irrational thing to do since grading is generous, but which undermines the potential for education! there are other classes you can take that will force you to learn more ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone. Honestly this is my favorite course that I've taken at Yale so far, and I believe that anyone could get a lot out of it if they go into it with the right honest, curious, and humble attitude. If someone were only interested in this class because they thought it would be easy then I don't think this is the right reason to take it, but if you are interested in using it as a means of reflecting on your life then I would highly recommend it. That said, if you look at the syllabus and read reviews and you think that there are other humanities classes that would be a better fit for getting you thinking, then by all means go and take those. The class LWL is not the end all be all, although the questions it addresses might be.... ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! I'd especially recommend it to seniors thinking about their values/priorities/how they want to structure their lives after college, but I imagine it would be a really enriching and rewarding experience for underclasspeople as well. It gave me a framework for asking questions about what is meaningful and valuable to me (and why) that I imagine I'll be relying upon next year (and beyond). ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, although strongly reccomend taking later in their academic career ",
            "\u00a0This course is an opportunity for self-reflection, and a delve into other visions and philosophies of life one may not have the opportunity to be exposed to. I'll definitely recommend this course as a foundational class to your Yale journey, forcing you to figure out what is important to you and what is not. Even if the actual material may not be impactful, the opportunity for discussions that seminars offers itself is valuable. ",
            "\u00a0If the questions of a life worth living are questions you haven't asked yourself, this is a nice and structured way to approach them. However, if you've already thought these through extensively, I don't think this course will necessarily challenge or inspire you, although it's always interesting to hear what peers are thinking/going through.
