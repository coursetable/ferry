            "\u00a0Not only did I learn how to quickly read modern Hebrew, but I also learned how to quickly identify if an article would be helpful for my own research. I also think that learning modern has helped me with my classical Hebrew. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to deconstruct larger and more elaborate academic sentences in Hebrew into manageable pieces; to determine what to translate and what is superfluous when skimming; to recognize common conventions, idiomatic expressions, linking words so as to make reading much easier; to read citations and locate them in the endnotes. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of the class was the variety of material, engagements, and student interests because it served a secondary function of exposing me to a lot of Jewish and Israeli things which I do not get in my normal program. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed basically every aspect of this course, although it's possible that more quizzes along the way could have given us more benchmarks to figure out how we were doing on a more regular basis. "

            "\u00a0Yes but I would recommend they take it pass/fail like the other reading language courses that I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I think it's a fantastic introduction to any student with some biblical Hebrew background and some modern Hebrew exposure. I think students who do not possess a familiarity with modern Hebrew will have to work much harder to acquire the vocabulary not present in the biblical corpora. With that said, Dina is very encouraging, her comments are extremely helpful, and the class, itself, is extremely rewarding. To have translated an entire academic article is a feat that I can say I am very proud of. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they had the specific goal of learning academic Hebrew in mind. One of the things that I learned from taking this class was just how different the different styles and uses of one language can be, while still maintaining much of the same basic vocabulary and grammatical structure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone with a need for academic Hebrew reading. "
