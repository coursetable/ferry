            "\u00a0How to closely read and evaluate arguments presented (specifically those relating to hip culture). How to research, write about, and construct arguments concerning different facets of culture. ",
            "\u00a0I developed incredible knowledge of historiography and really developed my research skills. Furthermore, I definitely found a passion for the material, and the course as a whole truly reinvigorated my passion for learning and academic work. Cannot stress enough how inspiring and incredible this class was in my development as a student. ",
            "\u00a0Where do I start? I learned how to look at esoteric texts with curiosity, patience, and an open mind; I learned about the various forms religion has taken in American society; I learned about the interconnectedness of spirituality and pop culture; I learned how to write a scholarly research paper on a topic that might be considered unscholarly by some. I also learned a lot of fun facts about minority religions, obscure experimental films, and the like. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my writing skills because of clear feedback. ",
            "\u00a0A useful and productive introduction to religious heterodoxy in America since 1945. I was amazed by the sheer number and quality of primary sources the instructor was able to track down, considering that many of these groups didn't leave many written records. I gained an appreciation for the fact that many interesting things were happening at the \"margins\" of society at this time and that those \"marginal\" groups deserve scholarly study and historical inquiry. I learned that we cannot truly separate the youth movements of the fifties and sixties in America from religion and spirituality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about lesser-known religions and spiritual movements in post-war America. It was an insanely interesting course that taught things I would have never even heard of. It focuses on really esoteric things, which is sooo interesting. I learned about everything from Kerouac and Zen Buddhism to acid churches in the 80s to the idea of selling out to mass-media and mass culture to what it means to be hip. It really changed the way I think about academia and what subjects deserve to be studied. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned a ton about the unique, hip-centered religious movements from the 1950s - early 2000s. Throughout, much of the conversation focused on both understanding these countercultural movements as religious and as not actually very countercultural (but instead embedded in the mainstream). I found this to be extremely enlightening. The class discussions were great, and reading material ranged from primary sources (like the Boo-Hoo Bible), literary sources like the poems of Diana di Prima, and scholarly sources/journal articles. ",
            "\u00a0SO much information. Seriously, SO much. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging format, diverse readings, enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor. ",
            "\u00a0More in class discussions / debates ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class definitely include the fascinating material, the incredibly passionate professor and a great seminar setting to discuss some really interesting philosophical and ideological ideas. I would perhaps have like to seen one more alternate project in addition to the papers so that I could have produced more tangible work from the fantastic class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating, rare texts. Wealth of opportunities for open discussion. Assignments are flexible and can be tailored to your interests. Reasonable amount of reading assigned each week.\r\nWeakness: Not too many quintessential Beat texts were assigned; it would have been nice to start with the basics before driving into more esoteric material. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions and presentations were great. I do wish it didn't veer into lecture territory quite so often, though. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Greer's enthusiasm and passion was a great strength of \"Holy Hipsters.\" It is clear he loves what he teaches, which is infectious. You can't help but enjoy and engage with the material when it is taught so dynamically. I found classmate presentations to be a strength, and I learned a lot from the subject material as mediated by their perspectives. The class material was also interesting - I've never heard of a class that covers this material so comprehensively or unflinchingly. Prof Greer's syllabus balanced the serious, academic scholars with lighthearted and just plain fun/weird content. I particularly enjoyed the primary sources and the \"mixed media\" nights, though I wasn't able to attend many.\r\n\r\nWhat I missed from the class was more true seminar-style discussion. Because we had one (or even two) presentations a class, much of our time was filled with presentation. Though I enjoyed getting to hear about new books at the beginning of class, I felt that part of announcements ate into our class time. I always thought we ran out of time to answer each other's questions, an aspect of the class that wasn't as incorporated as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the amount of sources we have from a diverse array of different religious movements from the time.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that sometimes our readings seemed too esoteric, and this came at the expense of learning some of the more well-known Beat writers. I think the instructor possibly assumed that we had more background with folks like Kerouac and Ginsberg than we actually did. Maybe working in some of the more orthodox Beat writers would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is that its one of the most interesting semesters you will ever have. The readings are great, the papers are really fun to write (you can choose whatever topic you want thats even slightly related to the class). You have very interesting class discussions. The class is also organized well and facilitates learning very well, what with in-class presentations where someone literally tells you what the text says. I wish we read a little more literature, as most of was history and theory texts. But other than that I have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0At times, there may have been a bit too much reading per week, which meant that not every reading was actually discussed in depth. While this made sense in some cases because the primary sources and literary works were needed to understand the scholarly interpretations, but other times it was difficult to figure out what parts of the class were most important to understand. ",
            "\u00a0This course evoked the passions of both teachers and students alike, and was thoroughly enjoyable. At times, it was a little disorganized, but the disorder felt in spirit with the nature of the class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Greer is probably the leading scholar on this material, but what is so much more important is his passion for the material. He understands learning in ways that most professors are not interested. He went above and beyond to turn the class into a semester-long experience. Holy Hipsters overpowered my four other classes to become the dominant narrative of my entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you ever have the chance to take this course, youd be stupid not to. Really paints an alternate picture of American history that will stick with me for years to come. A great intellectual journey. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Holy Hipsters taught me all about the weird historical footnotes I enjoy Googling at 2 AM, from a scholarly perspective. The coursework is manageable, opportunities for extra credit abound, and assignments can be tailored to your interests, so youll never have to turn in something that bores you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was fascinating and so much fun. Great discussion and very helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class! Yale is the time to explore subject material that interests you, and material you might not get to actually devote serious academic study to afterwards. It is really wonderful to get to see the world through history's alternative (and very alternative) mindsets, and I think everyone should take a class that makes them at least consider why the world works the way it works and how counterculture can create totally new social spheres. You'll have to have an open mind about some of the more eclectic material but it all fits into the overarching theme of heterodoxy. Professor Greer is also a teacher who can't be missed! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Any students mildly interested in history or Beat philosophy should consider taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Beat literature, religion,  the 60s, the hippie movement, alternative lifestyles esotericism, and magic. It is fun, by no means difficult, the grading isnt bad at all. There are fun media and film sessions where we watch movies and stuff together as a class. You can do poetry recitations for extra credit, which is sick. Professor Greer is amazing. It is such an interesting course and I guarantee you will have taken and probably wont take anything like it at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in the counterculture, religion, Beat literature, or even just having fascinating discussions with a unique group of other students. Our class had some of the best discussions I have had in seminar at Yale because everyone was incredibly engaged in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, one of my favorite classes i have taken at Yale so far. "
