            "\u00a0Whether or not you receive valuable advice really depends on your thesis advisor. Although my advisor had several other students to support throughout the year, I personally did not mind being afforded more autonomy to complete the paper on my own terms. That being said, if feedback had not been positive, there would likely not have been enough time to consult with him to make substantial changes prior to the deadline. So, if you know beforehand that you are going to need a lot of individualized attention on the part of your advisor, make sure to choose him or her wisely. ",

            "\u00a0I think the senior essay would improve with:\r\n- clearer style guidelines in the handbook (example cover page would be great, and specifics on what counts for the word count)\r\n- discouraging advisors from meeting with students in groupsindividual meetings are more effective\r\n- tutoring on using Zotero for history majors early in their Yale careers ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the History department set deadlines for assignments along the way including the 10 page deadline by December. I liked how I could meet with my adviser when it best suited me and to have the deadlines also kept me on track. ",

            "\u00a0Excellently well organised, although binding the senior essay was stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I love the freedom I had. \r\n\r\nWeakness- perhaps more demanding benchmarks for the fall? ",
            "\u00a0Students could be given greater warning in advance about the fact that little attention is paid in grade determination to the story told and much is given to historiography, source thoroughness, and all the other \"academic\" and not intellectual criteria. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good structure, providing students with the space and room to do their own work, but some deadlines to keep them on track.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the department could do a better job explaining what exactly it's looking for in a thesis. This means producing a clear, concise statement that describes the function of a thesis. Right now, the handbook is much too open-ended, which I understand can be necessary to encompass a variety of topics, but this can leave the purpose and breadth of the assignment undefinied. Only after a few conversations with my advisor did she help me realize that the assignment does not have to revolutionize a field, but should make a contributionusing original research and thoughtto discussions that have no been settled or even opened yet. ",
            "\u00a0I found the organization of the course to be thoroughly unsuited toward the task.  The entire first semester was filled with small and unhelpful assignments that required us to have very fully formed ideas of our thesis, when I didn't have any sense of what my thesis was really going to be about until I started writing.  I think the types of assignments we completed in the first semester should have been geared toward facilitating research, e.g. including deadlines of a certain amount of completed notes/research so that students are kept on track.  When you have three to four other classes and are working on a yearlong project, it is hard to remain motivated to do independent work.  If there are going to be frequent assignments and due dates, as there were with the thesis, they should actually help the working process - none of the assignments I submitted first semester ended up being incorporated in my thesis or helping my process in any way.  Second semester, there absolutely should have been a similar due date structure attached to turning in portions of the draft, e.g. 10 pages every two weeks or so to keep people on track.  It would eliminate the burden of grading the entire thesis as quickly as possible on the part of the advisor and incentivize students to be working at a consistent pace rather than all at once as many students did.  It would also make for better theses across the board. ",
            "\u00a0Thesis requirements were listed in a guidebook PDF that was really annoying to navigate. Communication to history majors about the grading rubric should be clearer (just post a rubric). It was also difficult for me to get helpful feedback from my advisor even though I went to his office hours every month, and it seemed like he wasn't incentivized to read any of my drafts. The submission process was also costly, and printing and binding multiple copies should be covered by Yale if it's a requirement for the major. \r\nWhile I loved the research that I did, I had significant issues with how the thesis writing process was managed. ",
            "\u00a0- ",
            "\u00a0There is not enough infrastructure for the history senior essay. Other departments have colloquia, and it was hard to stay on top of the work without a group of students to keep me accountable. History seniors should have the opportunity to meet bi-monthly with a group of students and a grad student colloquium leader to discuss research progress and writing strategies.\r\n\r\nHistory majors should not have to print their own theses. It was too expensive. ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy the structure of the year-long essay at all. I thought that our early assignments did nothing to keep me on track or help me form a better vision of my project. I also thought that the end completely snuck up on most of the history majors I communicate with, forcing us to cram most of our writing into a couple of feverish weeks. I understand that part of the point of this project is to have us demonstrate self-sufficiency, but since no graduating senior has written anything like the thesis before, it doesn't make much sense to give us practically free reign over the writing process. Just a few writing deadlines - say, biweekly research notes in the first semester and five pages a week in the second - would go a long way in adding some much appreciated structure to what ended up feeling like an unmanageable blob of a course. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - no structure. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is having students and their advisors determine the level of engagement with each other based on their preferences. This allows some students to meet often with their advisors for short periods of time while others meet less frequently for longer periods of time. \r\nI think an initial weakness of the course is having students who do not have a particularly strong relationship with a professor find an advisor. Since this process has to begin before the project is started and thus the idea of a thesis is still daunting, the advisor process caused unnecessary stress for many students. \r\nMy advisor, Travis Ross, was a major factor in my positive experience as he gave me both great freedom in my research and writing while also providing extensive feedback that substantially improved my writing style and content.

It's a requirement of the major, but I do think that students going into this process should find an advisor who is going to advocate for them, and if/when they are unable to, they should make certain demands of the department (ask for the grading rubric that their assigned reader is going to use) if they are going to be putting two semesters of work into an assignment.

It's the culmination of your Yale education, a testament to just how much you've grown as a student and a historian. It's hard work, but the most rewarding experiences usually demand that. Just make sure to pick a good topic, stay on track, and regularly consult your advisor. Do those things, and you won't dread working on your thesis. In fact, you might love it! ",
            "\u00a0For any history major, I definitely recommend a year long senior essay over a semester long one as such gives you proper time to gather ample research and write a cohesive thesis. I am very happy I did a thesis because it was really nice to dedicate such time to a project largely focused around my own academic interests. "
