I felt that writing and reading preparation was strong.\r\n\r\nI wished we could have done more listening practice as I still really struggle with that. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed this class. The workload was less than other classes because you do so much work in the class which makes the class itself feel worthwhile as opposed to just being a place to demonstrate knowledge you acquired elsewhere. I really liked coming into class and experimenting with the language. It was probably my favorite class. ",
            "\u00a0Depending on the students interestes in learning swahili - this is the place to do that ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it's fun and easy to learn.  But the class could be so much better; we barely speak in Swahili.  We need to speak in Swahili every class.  I would recommend we start every class with a 10 minute conversation with the person sitting next to us, all in Swahili, where we answer some question or just talk about what we did yesterday.  That would make this course so much better. "
