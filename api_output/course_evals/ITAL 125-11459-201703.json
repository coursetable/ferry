            "\u00a0I became proficient in Italian. I learned most of the necessary grammar structures and about 1200 vocabulary words. I also watched several Italian films and learned about the nation's unique culture. "

            "\u00a0This course would be improved if it were an hour and a half a day instead of nearly two hours, which is unbearable. None of us could concentrate for that long. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nNot a huge work load outside of the classroom and small classroom size (5 people Fall 2017) make it a very good opportunity to learn a language with a great professor. The class really becomes very personal.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nHigh intensity during class and tests often, but that's to be expected with an intensive language "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are really determined to become fluent in Italian in as little time as possible. This class is two credits for a reason! Be prepared to spend almost two hours a day in class, and each week to do online homework, memorize about 120 vocabulary words and a couple of grammar concepts, and write a short essay (a couple of paragraphs). Since I love languages and really wanted to learn Italian, I had a lot of fun, but definitely had to put in the effort to prepare for all the exams-- ten regular exams and the 3-hour final. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic but only if you're willing to put in the work to study for it. This is a class where you get out of it what you put into it, but Professor Iacovella is there to guide you through everything. I highly recommend it because of how small the class is and how personalized it becomes, something that's very beneficial to have in a language class. "
