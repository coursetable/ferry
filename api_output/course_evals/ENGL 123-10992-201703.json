            "\u00a0My awareness for the nuanced differences between fiction, poetry and drama has significantly increased as a result of taking this course. I have a greater appreciation for the art behind each style, and am more equipped to digest what I read in a way that can help me take what I want from it and appreciate the work that went into it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write short stories, poems, and dramatic scenes with more skill than I ever have before. I learned to edit and revise constructively and with a lot of attention to detail. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a tremendous appreciation for the craft of writing. Not only did I learn more about how to analyze the moving parts of a creative piece, but I also learned how to be inspired by, imitate, and draw from techniques present in great works. I also felt regularly challenged. I also practiced how to operate in critiquing a friends work, and workshopped the skills of workshopping. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from the different texts we read that shaped my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to get feedback on my writing and hear what my peers were writing, which was very helpful. I got a better idea of what a voice should be in a piece. ",

            "\u00a0Firstly, the use of workshops is a strength of the course. Being able to hear how others interpret your writing is so impactful on how you then approach your writing, and there aren't many spaces that can allow for that opportunity. This class utilized workshops very well. \r\nSecondly, the guest speakers also were a treasure. Being able to hear the stories of the authors we were reading in person nonetheless was incredible; some of the greatest things I learned this semester came through this experience. It was also interesting to see how different each speaker was from the last, and it ultimately widened our view of the writing world as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome. So fun to read and write and receive feedback on your work. I honestly think we could do more writing (if there were only more time). In-class workshop sessions were awesome and really helped with improving writing. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of weaknesses. There are many strengths. Perhaps some of the guest lectures were less inspiring than they could have been. ",
            "\u00a0I don't feel like these courses give a good presentation of writing techniques. I would like to have learnt about, for fiction, the elements of good storytelling, how to build characters, how to build tension, and so forth. I felt like we got fairly disconnected assignments that didn't build off of each other (especially for poetry). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great feedback - really helpful stuff, and so thorough. I'll talk about that a little more later! \r\nVery interesting material, both reading and writing. It covered a lot in a semester and offered a little something for everyone with a lot of freedom in writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the writing exercises were kind of not helpful - the homophonic poem one was honestly a waste of time, and the fiction exercises before the final story felt really limiting, since they all revolved around a very specific first story. \r\n\r\nI would have loved to do some creative writing in class, at least just a 5 or 10 min free write! To force an idea to come, to write on the spot, to write without overthinking, etc. \r\n\r\nAlso, we would discuss one writing piece (or even line) for most of the class and then not talk about assigned reading at all. :( But in general, I started to love this class towards the later half of the semester, as I think the group really came together and worked much better together then. A way to make this happen earlier? ",
            "\u00a0Deming is an amazing teacher and does an amazing job with this course! I really can't think of any weaknesses. Going to his office hours was so helpful. ",
            "\u00a0There was this one annoying guy in the class that kind of put a damper on things for me - making stupid comments about his ex-girlfriends, commenting on my skirt, asking to read my work outright, etc. He got better grades than me, which is fine, I'm just bitter. Maybe it would have been nice if Professor Deming had noticed and addressed his behavior - it's not often that professors notice when guys are making women uncomfortable, so I understand the silence. Maybe a bit more attention and curiosity towards how male students interact with female students in the classroom would be good.\r\n\r\nAside, this course was great! The people in it were wonderful, Professor Deming was a discerning and funny teacher. We read a variety of wonderful works, and for some of them we got to hear the actual authors speak. Great course.

            "\u00a0If another student was interested in being exposed to writing, then yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It's very interesting and absolutely made me love creative writing more than I already did. It's very fun and I learned a lot. Received great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend the course to anyone who has an interest in exploring what they have to say as a writer, and how they can best say it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would recommend that they try to apply for an upper level English writing class; this course does not seem to be designed for any kind of student. If you're completely new to the world of creative writing, this class does not do enough to teach you the skills to begin crafting stories and poetry, and if you're a more developed amateur writer, you'd be better off with the more serious and critical commentary found in upper-level English writing courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in trying out a wide variety of creative writing styles and getting basically a survey of creative writing. It's fun, and we don't do enough creative writing in life! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! BE sure to go to office hours if you take the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone who enjoys writing should take this course. The exercises and assignments will vastly improve your writing abilities and the readings and discussions will allow you to better dissect and analyze poetry and works of fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
