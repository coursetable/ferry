            "\u00a0This course provided an in-depth look at authoritarian, totalitarian, fascist, and democratic regimes with anti-democratic elements, focusing primarily on Nazi Germany and contemporary states like Russia, Poland, Turkey, and Hungary. I gained insights into the economic and social conditions necessary for democracies to transition into authoritarian states, and could better understand how fascism and populism appeal to so many voters around the world today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the literature that surrounds the terms authoritarian and totalitarian, and learned how to put that into conversation with present day issues. ",
            "\u00a0comprehensive understanding of non-democratic regimes, authoritarian and totalitarian, their origins, structures, similarities and differences ",
            "\u00a0A theoretical foundation on the different ways in which authoritarianism, totalitarianism, and fascism manifest, with case studies of different countries to put these theories into practice! It's wonderful that we are able to take the assignments into our own directions and interests. "

        [
            "\u00a0Each class meeting is a deep, thought-provoking discussion about the week's readings. The inclusion of graduate students in the class was extremely beneficial to my learning, since their insights and reflections made the sometimes esoteric, dense readings more accessible. The course mostly focused on European states, and it would have been interesting to read about and discuss the nature of authoritarianism and fascism in the East, like in China, North Korea, and the Philippines. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting readings, I think the weakness was that many grad students tended to take over the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0very good course ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the readings are very well chosen and Professor Candas' contributions, anecdotes, and reflections are always incredibly interesting to engage with and discuss. The weaknesses of the course are that the theoretical materials are a little dense for undergrads and we were not given very much guidance on how to write a good paper (what to include, how to structure it, etc.) Professor Candas is a wonderful, friendly, and kind professor to learn from! "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seeking to understand authoritarian and totalitarian movements from a political standpoint. Engaging with the different views of political scientists and thinkers over the years will lend great insights into how these movements were even historically possible. The readings are fascinating, and the discussions are equally stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you havent read literature that surrounds the topic. I think its a great supplement course to anyone studying European history and wants to relate that history to present day, in conversation with intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely\r\nanyone studying political science with an international focus especially should have a strong and nuanced understanding of non-democratic regimes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A rather chill cross-listed class which allows you to learn with and from grad students. Don't let the complexity of the theoretical readings scare you, and Professor Candas is always willing to go through them one-on-one during office hours which is incredibly helpful! Also don't be discouraged by Professor Candas furrowing her eyebrows when you speak, she is just listening attentively! "
