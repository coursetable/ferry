            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Old Testament and its complexities and nuances. ",
            "\u00a0Wow  I learned SO MUCH about the Bible in this class. Ancient Near Eastern context, ancient and modern assumptions in interpretation, approaches to Biblical criticism, and of course simply the challenge of reading the Bible on its own terms. ",
            "\u00a0This class addresses the Bible as a historical and literary document. I came away with immensely more structural knowledge than I had had before, but more importantly, with an understanding of how to analyze it in historical context. I think this is really foundational to Western culture regardless of other academic interests or religious affiliations. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about reading the Bible as a literary text and Prof. Hayes made sure we trained ourselves not to approach it with any presuppositions. This course is as much historical as it is literature but that only made me appreciate the reading so much more. Basically it is an overview of Israelite history and how various sides in that history compiled an anthology of texts that often contradict one another into a library of books we call the Bible. ",
            "\u00a0- I learned that there are a multiplicity of ways to read the Bible: reading it at a farrago of different sources; reading it as a deliberate, artfully edited whole; the difference between reading horizontally (\"scripture illuminates scripture\") versus reading vertically (scripture that points up, which is allegory, or ahead, which is typology)\r\n- The Bible not as a book but an ANTHOLOGY\r\n- Reading carefully for inconsistencies, doublings, apparent repetitions, moments of silence when you as a reader need information the most\r\n- Learning how to read a book where irony emerges in generational time -- in order to understand the humor of what befalls the protagonist, you have to remember who his ancestors were ",
            "\u00a0How to read a book as complicated and challenging as the bible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the Hebrew Bible !!! I learned how to interpret a text properly. I even learned how to act out parts of the Bible (i.e the Book of Job with the rest of the class). I got rid of the many misconceptions I had about the Bible, and I read the text with a fresh pair of eyes. It was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course! Learned a lot of history of the ancient near east and the time of the Israelites, and also a lot of history of the Bible itself. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course! I was exposed to reading the Bible in a deep, analytical way and learning to truly appreciate the text without theological presuppositions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained familiarity with the contents of the Hebrew Bible and gained a new appreciation for the text. I was able to see how various interpretations arose from different points of tension within the text. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. It completely changed the way I view the Bible, gave me a way better knowledge about whats in the Bible, and introduced me to some basic forms of biblical history and interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0A very well-rounded look into the formation of the Bible. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible intro to Biblical Criticism, source theory and redaction theory and just a generally great introduction to the Hebrew Bible. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its interpretation. "

            "\u00a0This was a brilliant class full of interesting lectures and readings. However, I wish the first part of the class was a little sped up so the end didn't seem as rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is incredibly well-organized, and class always went by quickly because of how much there was to cover. Professor Hayes and Emilie were wonderful discussion leaders.\r\nWeakness: I think less reading would have improved the course  Bible readings, a 50 minute lecture, plus supplementary reading was often a huge load. I honestly think doing all of the work (if there were Bible readings, lecture, plus supplementary reading) would take me as much time as all three of my other courses combined this semester  certainly upwards of 2-3 hours. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom is a phenomenal idea since you can go into class knowing exactly what will be discussed, and you can always catch up if you fall behind. I wished we had more time devoted to discussion in class as Prof. Hayes tends to go over what was already discussed in lecture, but I think her re-emphasis on certain concepts definitely helped me learn it all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Loved the way Professor Hayes front loaded the class with secondary readings so we could learn a variety of ways to read the Bible -- and then we got to practice for the rest of the semester\r\n- The final paper was a joy to write. The prompt was so artful in and of itself -- a model of how to ask questions so incisive that ideas start spurting out at geyser velocities. I really appreciated the way Professor Hayes held a discussion during Reading Week in order to exfoliate possible interpretations so that we had some readings to argue against as we wrote\r\n- Loved the way that the class combined reassuring predictability (Tuesdays was elaboration on the lecture, Thursdays was discussion) and surprise (subdividing the class in new groups, staging , Professor Hayes mock defense of David, the courtroom drama of Job in which she knew our class well enough to cast us!)\r\n- Loved the flipped classroom -- homework felt like watching a show on the History Channel that I've always wanted to see\r\n\r\nOpportunity for improvement:\r\n- Because Professor Hayes is such a treasure trove, I wish we could have devoted more class time to exploration and speculation, airing questions that came up for us as we read rather than just rehearsing the lectures. I appreciated her sense of purpose and momentum, but because of this, sometimes I felt like any question I asked would be a distraction ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the teaching (Professor Hayes and Emilie), the structure (and the material obviously!). Christine Hayes has a plan for every lecture - there is always something interesting going on: a small group discussion, an activity (i.e acting out parts of the text) etc. It's not so much a weakness but be prepared to do the readings (there is a lot of reading) - I didn't always have the time and now I regret in retrospect. The reading is super important for the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting material, the professor is so knowledgeable, flipped classroom was helpful because I could take notes on the online lectures at my own pace, the professor and TF do a great job guiding students through the exams and the final paper \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: So much material and not even close to all of it was necessary for the paper or two exams. I can see how flipped classroom might not work for some people because it increases the total time you spend on the courseyou have to watch/read lectures before class, go to class, and do readings. The pacing of the course could be improved. We spent the first few weeks on just a few chapters of Genesis and then really rushed through everything in the latter half of the semester, and I personally found the material from the latter half of the semester more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely excellent and Prof. Hayes is an excellent professor! ",
            "\u00a0Class was really interesting, and Professor Hayes was great at painting the bigger picture and analyzing the texts from many different angles. I didn't like that every class required watching an online lecture - it was supposed to be a sort of flipped classroom with \"section\" in class, but it was mostly just more lecture. It felt like the online lectures were a way of just doubling the amount of lecture time outside of the class time allotted by Yale for a regular course. Additionally, they were interesting and well-taught, but were a little longer than necessary to convey the main ideas that we then elaborated on in class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great in that it gives you a solid background in the text of the Hebrew Bible but also provides a critical range of perspectives from which to view it. At points the reading gets pretty heavy and at other points the reading is light, so I feel it could have been more consistent from that standpoint. ",
            "\u00a0The pace it sometimes rough. There were days where the reading was too much: I think we were supposed to read all of first and second Samuel and some of kings for one class which wasnt very practical but then if you didnt you got behind. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty incredible. I think everyone has misconceptions about what the Bible IS based on what we think it SHOULD BE, and it was so interesting to have that all laid bare. The one issue I had with the course was that it was sort of call-and-response, to make a church joke. There's so much to learn, so we have little time to discuss the material, and the questioned asked in lecture and most discussion time was just regurgitating what we read in the readings. I think you have to crawl before you can walk though, so I understand the approach. ",
            "\u00a0Hard to think of a weakness here. Christine is the best Yale has to offer; it's hard to imagine a better lecturer. "

            "\u00a0Yes to anyone who is interested in learning more about where the Abrahamic religions come from. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student at Yale. Professor Hayes cares a lot about this course and is pedagogically a really strong instructor. This class is definitely a lot of work and can feel like drinking from a fire hose at times, but it's worth it! For Christian students, people might caution you against taking this class, but I think it's important to take classes that expose you to how Biblical interpretation and criticism have functioned across centuries. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. It's one of the best classes I've ever taken. This class addresses the Bible as a historical and literary document. I came away with immensely more structural knowledge about the Bible than I had had before, but more importantly, with an understanding of how to analyze it in historical context. I think this is really foundational to Western culture regardless of other academic interests or religious affiliations. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely best and most worthwhile course I've taken at Yale, if only because it forces you to reconsider all the assumptions you had about the Bible and you can begin to appreciate it for what it is as opposed to how people have interpreted it to frame modern day society. ",
            "\u00a0ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE EVER TAKEN. Hands down, no questions asked. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is the best-organized small lecture class I have ever taken, and every class leaves you with such great insights! The flipped classroom kind of thing really works if you keep up with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0YES !!!!!! When else are you going to learn about the Bible with the best professor and TA out there ? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Fascinating material and a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course! If you want a deep and intellectual introduction to the Bible taught by a star professor you've come to the right place! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. Professor Hayes is a great lecturer and presents the material in an interesting way. The material is pretty accessible for people with not much background in the Bible, although it does go through basically the entire Old Testament in one semester (although not in huge amounts of detail for large parts, of course), so it's naturally easier for people with a little more familiarity with some of the stories. That being said, the only things expected to know are things that were covered in class and lectures, so it's not necessary to be familiar at all with the text. Also, for those who are familiar, the class focuses on different types of criticism of the text (literary, source, etc.) and placing the text within its Mid-East context, so it never felt repetitive or like I'd already learned anything. There's a midterm, final, and 10 page final paper. The final paper was really fun; we had to write our own interpretation of a Biblical story (we had 3 options), using the interpretive skills we learned in class. \r\n\r\nThere are online lectures that you have to watch before each class - each is around 40 minutes. Most of the main things in the lectures are talked about in class, too. However, there are some identifications and key points that will be mentioned in the lectures that will be on the tests without really being talked about in class, so I'd recommend either watching the lectures or having an awesome friend go over the lecture material with you before the tests. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. You learn a ton of material but also learn how to critically approach one of the most important texts in the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But only if theyre prepared for it to be hard, its not just a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend this course especially to students with interests in religion. For others, it's still super relevant because the Bible is everywhere today. This course will challenge you and what you think you know. It's an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0Oh God yes. Take it. ",
