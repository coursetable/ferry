            "\u00a0You work on all aspects of public speaking -- ultimately the class is focused more on the physical/vocal elements than the content (though you do get practice with speaking on different topics -- a speech to teach, a speech to initiate action, a speech to change an attitude, etc.). The class also had interesting discussions on the intersections of race and gender with communication. ",
            "\u00a0learning to use hand gestures and have confidence in front of a group in addition to the different ways to prepare for a speech has improved my public speaking confidence. ",

            "\u00a0This class helped me to become a more confident speaker, both in a formal speech-giving setting as well as in interpersonal conversations and in class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be aware of my body while speaking, how to incorporate gestures into speeches, and how to sound and look confident while delivering a speech. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about my strengths and weaknesses as a public speaker, as well as tips and tricks for getting around unhelpful speaking habits. I also learned to push myself out of my comfort zone, time after time, by getting up and speaking in front of people. I also learned about Aristotle's logos, ethos, and pathos, and how to weave all three elements effectively into a speech. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a more confident public speaker, how to calm my nerves when in front of a crowd, and also more about myself and what my speaking quirks are. I learned what I am naturally good at and where there are areas for improvement. ",

            "\u00a0Excellent course; really enjoyed the speech modules, could have more speeches given in front of the entire class but understandably split due to class size. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- the class is broken up into sections so we each get more attention and can form a closer bond with the people who are in our section\r\nweaknesses- the TAs were not as good as Dr. Morrison in terms of teaching public speaking, but Dr. Morrison made sure to see everyone talk at least once ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Just look at all the other reviews.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs, although great, do not give quite as good feedback as the professor. ",
            "\u00a0This class benefited from being split into sections because we got well-acquainted with our classmates and got meaningful feedback on our speeches because of that. However, I wish that we had had more time to get individual feedback from Professor Morrison on our speeches. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent professor, engaged and understanding TA's, variety of assignments, emphasis on speaking rather than just studying speeches, comradery in section.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes instructions weren't that clear, would have been nice to be given back our grades for each assignment, or have them posted on canvas. ",
            "\u00a0The course was exceptionally well organized and well taught. I loved the small class size and individualized attention for each student. I don't have any recommendations for improving the course at this time. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course! Could add more practice and less talking about the texts because I think most of us didn't read the texts throughout and in detail so the discussion is not that helpful. Analyzing speeches and ads are helpful tho!\r\n\r\nCould consider doing more practice topics? like impromptu? "

            "\u00a0Take this course!! This was the first semester THST 343 branched out into accepting more students and dividing the group into sections (which I was initially nervous about). However, my group still grew incredibly close over the course of the semester, and I truly think I've gained much more confidence in public speaking because of the class. Everyone in the class came from different levels of comfort/experience in public speaking, but were ultimately supportive, non-judgemental, and very helpful in providing constructive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student - I think it should be a mandatory requirement of all students. It teaches you the basics of public speaking while providing a forum to practice giving actual speeches - something that many students otherwise would not have. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: I learned a lot in the course but I would not say it drastically improved my public speaking skills if you are coming in with experience. ",
            "\u00a0YES, MOST PRACTICAL CLASS AT YALE ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Regardless of your public speaking experience, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an amazing class and would be useful to anyone going into any field! Public speaking is something we do on a daily basis and this class makes you aware of how you present yourself. You get constant feedback and everyone in the class is super supportive. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Best class at Yale by far ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wishes to be a stronger public speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely yes. Everyone should take a public speaking course. Everyone has to do some public speaking at some point in the life, and this class really drilled you on things like posture, projecting, engagement, etc. I am very glad that I took this as a Sophomore because I now feel more confident going into other classes where giving presentations is part of the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Everything involves talking in front of large groups and this class will make you a much better speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, 100% yes! Regardless if you're a seasoned public speaker or terrified of getting up in front of people and saying something, this course has something to offer you. In the comfortable and friendly space of your section you learn about your speaking strengths and weaknesses and actively work on improving and strengthening them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was one of my favorite academic experiences at Yale. I had never taken a public speaking course before, and this class really helped me hone my speaking skills and learn more about myself. Dr. Morrison is an amazing Professor who cares deeply about her students. Regardless if you have experience in public speaking or not, if this topic interests you, you will learn a great deal from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! Public speaking is a great skill to have and Professor Morrison has amazing knowledge on this and can give you valuable advice on improving "
