            "\u00a0Knowledge of major works of Western literature and improved writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to read and write about literature. I also learned about the western cannon of literature in general, and considered common themes of the inadequacy of language, courtly love, and the path towards human fulfillment. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking. Text analysis. Improved writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about trends in literature from the middle ages to modern era. ",

            "\u00a0This course could have been improved the most if there were more opportunities for student participation, and if more of the students participated in an engaging, meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-organized. DS in general has very few issues because they've had 50 years to perfect the curriculum. The work is well distributed across the semester, the discussion format is good, and the works of literature are well chosen. No complaints really. ",
            "\u00a0Overall well-organized, but Id have liked more instruction on the process of analyzing texts instead of just discussing the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. I would have loved to have read more Russian literature (War and Peace, Brothers Karamazov, etc) as well as more French novels. ",
            "\u00a0There are some really really enjoyable works-- to the lighthouse, Don Quixote, Wordsworth, and Lear were some of my favorites-- but I think there was often a higher reading volume to class ratio, which meant that we really wouldn't go very in depth with analyzing and discussing the text. That said, we had many interesting conversations. I think the course could be improved by better structure-- maybe having someone bring in a few questions or discussion questions each class-- to ensure that we don't get off track or forget To discuss the more important parts. ",
            "\u00a0The course has interesting books. There is truly not enough time to read all the material. Disappointing. It would have been much more beneficial to have a bit more time and/or less reading per book. Simply cannot enjoy the classic when youre forced to skim. ",
            "\u00a0More time distributed for readings, more organized discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading load needs to be reducedassign sections of novels instead of the entire novel. When students don't come to class prepared, the discussion suffers, but it's simply impractical to require students to read 300 pages a week for literature alone some weeks when the other classes in DS also assign a heavy reading load.

            "\u00a0Perhaps, the books are interesting but discussions were really boring, so overall it was a mixed bag. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you take DS, you have to take this course but it's a good supplement to HP and Philosophy, which are generally more philosophical, while Literature often takes a different perspective of the time period. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It turns out people have been thinking about common human questions for centuries, and literature is one of the most important competing methods for finding answers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. DS is an amazing program that renders you culturally and intellectually fulfilled. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, esp. those interested in DS and reading/understanding the history of the literary western canon. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't enjoy this as much as I anticipated because Professor Bloch didn't encourage the kind of literature discussion that's centered on reader experience. I love discussion literature from an interior perspective, that is, examining the work by starting with what it made me feel, and seizing on the more academic points from there. I felt like our class took a solely academic approach that resulted in dry discussions and sucked the life out of literature for me. "
