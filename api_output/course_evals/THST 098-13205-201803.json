            "\u00a0I grew as a writer especially as a result of this class. I learned about how to craft a one person play and what performance methods are most effective. ",
            "\u00a0I exited this course not only with an incredible body of knowledge about one-person plays, acting, writing, and performance, but a more concrete understanding and approach to my own artistic identity. This class has helped to strengthen my voice as a playwright and performer, and to overcome creative obstacles of all kinds. I entered with almost no acting / theater experience, and by the end could create and perform a ten-minute play that I am very proud of, nearly from scratch. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't know much about the art of the one-person play prior to this course, but by now I've learned how incredibly interesting and rich with opportunity the genre can be. I learned how to be a more confident performer and a more engaging storyteller. ",
            "\u00a0i feel like i learned a lot about acting and theater and also a lot about larger questions of truth and emotion ",
            "\u00a0I was able to greatly enhance both my artistic and acting skills. Not only did we have numerous exercises, but Hal did a great job at directing and assigning relevant readings and plays that helped us with the process of creating a play, analyzing a play, and ultimately performing it. At the same time, we had an amazing class (awesome students) that would promote camaraderie and community; Hal even took us to New York to watch a One Person Play. We were able to talk with the actual director and actor, afterwards. Pretty awesome. ",
            "\u00a0This course really gave me a new perspective on what the purpose of art is. It allowed me to explore my own identity as an artist and really helped me discover new ways of thinking about myself. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new ways to approach the creative process, and I learned new techniques to better any public performance I might give. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the one person play and what makes a one person play unique/ the different approaches to the one person play ",
            "\u00a0Learned about how to compose a play, what technical elements made for a good conpisition, but also how to physically and emotionally represent the character. Concepts but also specific methods were blended together to inform the student. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I developed many insights and skills that challenged preconceived notions of acting and the one-person play.  I learned that there are many different techniques and methods used in storytelling such as casting the audience and assigning a particular stance to each different character. "

            "\u00a0This course offers a lot of material in a manner that is not too overwhelming. That being said, I wish we had done a little more of our exercises in class and a little less discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is incredibly fun and engaging, but it also feels concrete~ I am exiting with real skills and a body of knowledge in theater that I did not have before I took the class. The teacher is fantastic and the flow of the class builds on itself. Without a doubt one of my two favorite Yale courses so far. \r\nI think that the class could have handled more readings and video assignments to process outside of class; I would have wanted more examples to search through and process. But the ones we analyzed were crucial to understanding and developing our own plays, and it worked out to be enough. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course was the variety of texts/media sources we engaged with and the variety of exercises we were assigned. The course made the one-person play, and even believable acting, seem trainable and achievable. We also got the opportunity to go to New York to see a one-person play as a classwhich was a pretty amazing opportunity.\r\n\r\nI do think the course could be improved by allowing for more opportunities to check in as a class about our midterm/final projects. The nature of our class times didn't allow everyone to try out their work with the class before the midterm, and I think we would have all benefited from more time to get feedback from our classmates. ",
            "\u00a0maybe like if people paired up more! the pairs work i thought was super helpful and we could have done a little more of it ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Intimate classroom setting. Great discussions on readings and plays. Insightful feedback. Acting exercises and improvisation.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, during class, students would tend to feel pressured to engage or participate; maybe there could be some subtle way to make the classroom more comfortable. This was not a huge problem, however; everyone, for the most part, always felt comfortable and engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and welcoming. The strength is Hal Brooks, who has so much experience to share with the students. The weakness is that the course doesn't offer much time for helping those who have little to no background in acting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Acting in class, evaluating performances from professional one person players\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough time for everyone to get the chance to act regularly ",
            "\u00a0The professor is an amazing teacher that uses different approaches to learning such as asking us to see shows, read shows, and create our own. He is very accessible and open to feedback ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps a bit more structure could assist the course, sometimes it felt as if not all of the class time was used optimally. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by possibly meeting twice during the week and allowing more students to participate in the excersises. "

            "\u00a0I would. I gained a strong community from this course and also developed new skills I never pictured myself having. I also found the material we were assigned very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who has an interest in theatre and playwriting. It was an excellent first-year seminar, I've created lasting bonds with all of my classmates, and I have come out of the course a better performer and writer. ",
            "\u00a0yes absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to ALL First Years. We had students from all types of backgrounds, not only actors. It's such a fun and engaging course that allows you to work hands-on with an actual director. You learn from all of the kids in the class, and you're also able to develop yourself artistically and as a person. By composing and performing a One Person Play, you're able to: increase memorization, confidence, performing ability, speaking ability, writing ability, critical thinking ability, all the while making meaningful friends. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I found this course to be a fun opportunity to explore my creative side. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I'm not going to major in Theater Studies, but taking this class was a fun challenge, and I have no regrets about choosing it as my First Year Seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even for those not interested in theater ",
            "\u00a0If they have acting experience prior, then yes. I think first-time actors wont get as much out of the course as someone who has acted before, but theyll still learn. The course is what you make of it and what you attempt with your play, so Id recommend it to students who are passionate about acting and want to attempt something a bit more thematically substantial than an autobiographical piece. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great class that opened up a new world for me, and our class really got to bond over the semester. Hals a great guy - talking with him over office hours have been especially helpful. However it is not an easy class. I really enjoyed it, but still took it credit/d/fail. Some people found it easy though, so I think it also depends on talent and experience to a certain extent. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student!  Its fun intellectually challenging and the tips and techniques taught could be used in your everyday life to better communicate ideas. "
