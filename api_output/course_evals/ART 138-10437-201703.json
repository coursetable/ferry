            "\u00a0Basics of photography focusing on how to utilize the camera in manual mode and an introduction to digital print making. You will also learn more in depth editing techniques that go far beyond global adjustments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to use a dslr camera and to use photoshop and camera raw ",
            "\u00a0Digital Photography greatly improved my skills with a DSLR. It's a great course that provides a basic understanding of your camera and its intricacies. You first learn about the camera itself and how to set settings (aperture, ISO, exposure, etc.) to produce good pictures. We then worked in Photoshop and camera RAW to optimize images and edit them in post. We then learned how to make physical prints of these images. ",
            "\u00a0Photoshop and Bridge skills; critiquing skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use a digital camera, gained an understanding about photography and historically significant artists, and an introductory level understanding of photoshop. ",

            "\u00a0The basics of photography (adjusting a camera in manual mode and adjusting aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.). as well as a basic understanding of learning to use photoshop. I also gained a skill in evaluating photos -- and art in general -- that I thought was really useful. ",

            "\u00a0Ted is a great instructor, but you do have to approach him individually if you want consistent feedback on your work. He provides a great introduction to looking at photography and analyzing it,  however the class lacks building technical skills and learning the \"rules\" of photography. If you're interested in learning specific photographic techniques, then this class is probably not for you. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be more discussion of artistic purpose and more honest peer feedback i.e. the instructor should encourage people to say what they don't like just as much as what they like. ",
            "\u00a0We were exposed to a lot of different photographers and this was helpful to see all the different types of photography and printing styles.  That being said, the class was oftentimes very boring because we would be spending an hour and fifty minutes in a dark room talking about photos. ",
            "\u00a0If you're not an artist, it might be hard to understand things, which don't make sense sometimes. But I don't think they should make sense, so that's not necessarily a weakness. The class is really chill and the professor is really nice. You do get a lot of practice with photography and it's not a lot of work. The class is more about looking at photography than anything else, so don't expect to learn a lot od the technical stuff ",
            "\u00a0It was great to have a relatively small class so we could get individual feedback. The weekly photo requirement led me to constantly think about photography and how I could improve my skills.\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice if the class was a little more structured toward the beginning in terms of giving assignments of what to take pictures of. This would have maybe helped me explore types of photography outside my comfort zone. There are benefits, though, of having more liberty in choosing what to take pictures of--you develop more of a personal style the way we did it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really beneficial for students who had little to no former photography or art exposure. I think the freedom of the class allowed for students to focus on their particular interests in the class, which was very valuable. \r\nHowever, I did find myself wishing we had a stronger focus on photoshop in the class. I felt as though we could have spent a few more classes focusing on building a greater photoshop skillset. While the field trips to look at other art was valuable, I do think that spending as much time in the lab as possible would have been appreciated by most students. Finally, I felt there was a great deal of ambiguity in the grading and sometimes even the feedback that was given to students. ",
            "\u00a0There is not enough instructions on techniques in photography. We were not taught various ways of dealing with light, received no instructions on exactly what to do in different situations or to get desired effects. We were not taught how to pose subjects if we wished to design the setting for a photo. Even when we looked at works by famous photographers, we heard a lot more from students than the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0It's a nice intro photography class. Strengths are how flexible it's run, and the vast amount of exposure you get in terms of artists, types of photography, and looking at art and commenting on it. Weaknesses are how \"hands off\" it felt--I wished I had learned more about how to use my camera, how to think about light, how to think about taking certain types of photographs (i.e. what should I think about when taking a landscape vs. a portrait, etc.), and how loosely structured it felt. I also wished we were able to learn more about photoshop--I felt like I learned a bulk of photoshop skills from googling questions than actually learning from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that Ted and Dan (my TA) were great. The class focused a lot on composition, color, and form. However, I wish that we spent a little more time learning about photoshop. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I learned a lot in this class and really appreciate getting feedback from the Dan, the MFA TA and Ted who is actually a faculty member in the School of Art. Unlike theatre studies, you get to take classes from the actual professors in the art school, which is insane for an intro photo class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would, you learn valuable skills and Ted is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in photography and want to get involved in it, this is the class for you, but expect to figure out a lot by yourself or by the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's really easy and fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in photography. I learned much about the fundamentals of the camera and how to create great pictures. You begin to develop your own style that improves throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nThe class is also a nice break from other coursework at Yale. Taking pictures is, in my opinion, much more interesting and fun than doing psets or studying for midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially good if you're very new to photography. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think if a student wanted to gain an understanding of digital photography and get some exposure to photoshop, this would be the right course for them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Its a great way to better under photography and image making. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great intro photography class that forces you to take the time to consistently take photographs and edit them each week. You learn basic skills and are exposed to lots of different types of photographs, which is really cool and useful to see how other artists think about photography. It's not a class that will necessarily teach you how to photograph (i.e. there are no tutorials on \"how to photograph landscapes\" etc.) and you will end up figuring out a lot of things yourself. The class is really open-ended and flexible. I'd recommend taking it if you're interested in photography and want to get your feet wet. ",
