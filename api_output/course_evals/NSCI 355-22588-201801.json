            "\u00a0Wow, I learned so so much in this class. I have such a better understanding of not just the basics of social neuroscience but also how the whole field works. I think I have a very up to date understanding of current theories and know so much more about the brain. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the brain and how it activates in response to various social experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Social Neuroscience delved deep into the brain to investigate the relationships between certain emotions, feelings, or intuitions and their corresponding neural correlates and processes. ",
            "\u00a0I can't even begin to describe how amazing this course is. I learned so many fascinating things about this relatively new and rapidly growing field, and it left me only wanting to know more. I have a strong grasp on the mechanisms of the social brain and how they lead to social behaviors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the way aspects of our social lives are correlated with different neural processes. ",
            "\u00a0How to integrate social psychology knowledge with new neuroscience knowledge, understanding of neural mechanisms underlying social relations such as cooperation, morality, punishment etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt more about the neuroscience behind our social life, the interconnectedness of the content, applicability of the neuroscience to real life. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me about neuroscience in social aspects; the structure and function during different types of interactions and how they changed depending on circumstances and factors. It also taught me how the brain is intricate and yet so responsive and easy to manipulate but difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the neuroscience behind our social interactions. This included moral decision-making, trusting, our reward system, and many more. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about a lot of experiments ",
            "\u00a0Overall knowledge of neuroscience research method, data analysis, and current experiment trends. Compared to my previous neuroscience/cognitive psychology courses, this course aims more on practical applications of cognitive science and fundamentals of neuroscience.\r\nEspecially this class helped me to understand neurological basis of human morality, which can be juxtaposed with my background, which are philosophical and theological aspect of human morality. Despite of my potential grades (due to short examination time, I wasn't able to finish both mid-term and finals), I am hoping to continue study neuroscience on morality, which is Dr. Crockett's specialty. ",
            "\u00a0That I should not have taken this course ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful survey course in social neuroscience. Not only did I gain a strong understanding of the breadth of the field, I also gained depth in critical thinking regarding the studies in the course as well as possible future studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various parts of the brain, the different networks, and how they all relate to individuals and societies. I enjoyed the order of the course and there seemed to be a logical flow. ",
            "\u00a0In depth knowledge of the neuroscience of impression formation, relationship formation, cooperation, fairness, intergroup relations, communication, and morality. ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly increased my knowledge on a wide range of neuroscience topics, particularly as they relate to social processes. It also increased my skills in terms of being able to read and understand scientific papers, study large amounts of information, and identifying anatomical brain regions. ",

            "\u00a0I developed the knowledge of a variety of brain areas and how their activation is implicated in a variety of social processes. I also learned about the common currency vs social currency schema in brain activation and how to understand evidence supporting either one. Lastly, I developed the skills to analyze whether a scientist has made a reverse inference in conducting a study and making conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to learn about social interaction and phenomena from a neuroscience lens. We also discussed potential implications of these findings. ",
            "\u00a0For me, this course was a learning experience every day. Firstly, I learned how researchers approach their work, how they analyze data, and how they often criticize other people's data and experiments. I also learned how to read and analyze scientific research papers, something that I had never done before. In this sense, it was very useful in getting to know how proper research is conducted. Overall, this class made me think more critically about the world around me, a crucial skill if you want to get involved with any sort of research. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a comprehensive and challenging insight into the world of social neuroscience, meaning the neural mechanisms involved in social thinking. This includes first impressions of others, moral thought processing, implicit racism, overt racism, intergroup relations, revenge, punishment, self-regulation and many other topics. ",
            "\u00a0I have a solid understanding of the neural substrates and major brain networks related to processes like empathy, reward, trust, and stereotypes. Aside from learning about a bunch of interesting studies, I have a better idea of the methods and processes of neuroscience overall, especially of how experimenters probe social processes through research.

            "\u00a0At first this class was very very fast paced and information packed but after the midterm evaluations Proffessor Crockett adjusted the pace and quantity of material really well. I really enjoyed most of the papers and really really loved the lectures. The lectures were always entertaining, engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of material all the time. It became difficult at times to fully process the information because there was so much being present all at once. The slides were also tough to follow later on to better understand the material because there was no info explaining things like graphs or images. It can be improved by slowing down the amount of material being presented every lecture or to reduce the amount of material that the professor hopes to get through in the course. I felt like I was learning two sets of material most of the time: the social aspects and then the brain/neural activation. It was at times tough to connect the two into an overall picture. ",
            "\u00a0The class is not too hard IF you've taken other neuroscience classes and is very interesting, but the workload is too much! ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful, amazing, fascinating, interesting, and exciting course that literally should not be changed at all ever. Anyone even vaguely interested in the brain should take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Too many course readings were assigned. In particular, I found the assigned reviews to be unhelpful and excessively long. \r\n\r\nExams were generally fair and appropriate. The final paper was exciting and instructive to write. Lectures were well-paced in the second half of the course. Material was pitched at an appropriate level (engaging but not too complex). ",
            "\u00a0This year was the first year the course had been taught, so we weren't really sure what to expect in terms of testing and grading. However, Professor Crockett was really helpful and understanding, allowing us extra credit for doing midterm course evaluations and adjusting the second half of the course according to those evaluations. I think implementing those adjustments immediately next time (like making less crucial course readings optional or spending more time on each subject) will make the course really great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Crockett is incredibly thorough with her research and slides--I really enjoyed the breadth of the course, the essay was very fun to write, I left with a better appreciation for social neuroscience \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures could be dry, there was a lot of focus on the study methodology...I found the reasoning behind the studies (hypotheses, questions they wanted to answer) more applicable to the test ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly interesting material, very well-done lectures, possibly too many readings (though they were honestly not necessary to do well) ",
            "\u00a0I think the course has a lot of potential to be amazing; I really enjoyed the material and the information that was taught, but it was a lot of information t take in and the readings were long and dense at times. I think it could benefit from having less readings and slowing down lecture. I also think taking more time at the beginning to help students really know the areas of the brain that will be most widely used in the course would help facilitate learning. ",
            "\u00a0Really cool content throughout but it was a lot of information that we were expected to memorize. If there were 3 or 4 smaller tests instead of 2 big ones, it'd allow for students to better retain the information. REALLY cool class though ",
            "\u00a0Maybe not focused enough ",
            "\u00a0The course material was fascinating -- with very interesting implications and applications. I really enjoyed the lectures and I'm happy with the knowledge I took away. However, I think Professor Crockett could have done a better job clarifying what was expected from all of the assignments and assessments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: quality of Professor Crockett's teaching, the teaching team's receptiveness to student feedback, breadth of content\r\nWeaknesses: relevance of reading assignments to lecture content ",
            "\u00a0This course should have been taught with a discussion section and with shorter lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nMany new things (I assume Dr. Crockett was so excited to teach and share what she knows in this class) to learn and read. \r\nSystematized analysis of social neuroscience, from basic research method and basic neurostructural survey to higher neurological/cognitive topics. \r\nThe course addressed well on social Neuroscience's specialty, which is multi-disciplinary studies - neurological, cognitive, and social.\r\nGreat feedback from Professor and TAs (after class Q/A was good. And please keep Wednesday reflection till 9am).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nMany new things (I assume Dr. Crockett was so excited to teach and share what she knows in this class) to learn and read. \r\nSyllabus revision made students confusing to follow throughout the course.\r\nToo short time for taking exams; From English as a second language student perspective, 1 hour and 20 minutes was so short to formulate my thinking and knowledge into the exam sheet. So I wasn't able to finish both my mid-term and finals (hoping at least finals could be 2.5-3 hours).\r\nPlease do not limit paper length; I saw Piazza feedback that there will be deductions for too short & too long papers than 2500 word (3000 words for grad students). My original plan was to write first half with several pros and cons of social media from neurological perspective, and then spend second half with using philosophical and theological analysis and reflections (To answer social media issues, such as distorted view on self/others, addiction, political polarizing etc., neurological answers are still limited, and it requires interdisciplinary approaches). Despite I was not able to finish my paper based on my original plan (I should remove my second half of my paper because of the limitation), I will continue research by myself to submit my full paper on interdisciplinary conference on science and theology next November. ",
            "\u00a0This class needs to be structured and focused on actually teaching ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Crockett was an amazing lecturer as well as an extremely engaged teacher. She really took into consideration our feedback and created strong iterations of the course with expansive content. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting however the first quarter of the semester was harder to enjoy since I hadn't taken the human brain class prior to taking this class so I was confused as to how to memorize the parts of the brain in association to the different social situations. However once I got the hang of the different parts of the brain, the class became more enjoyable and I was able to be more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging lectures, lots of informative material & readings. ",
            "\u00a0The summaries added later in the course were very helpful in terms of ensuring that everyone was on the same page in understanding the main take-away points of the lectures. I also valued the inclusion of so many primary sources in the forms of studies discussed in the lectures and papers assigned for readings. In general, I felt that the biggest difficulty the class posed was memorizing the sheer amount of information required. ",
            "\u00a0The cases and readings we went over in this course were very interesting! I really enjoyed Professor Crockett's lecture style because it was very clear and engaging. She is also really receptive to the feedback we gave her in the middle of semester. ",
            "\u00a0So much information but the class is very well constructed and so fascinating ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that there are extremely interesting topics to discuss within the realm of social neuroscience, like the neural reason behind cooperation in society, for instance, and there are real-life implications of these conversations. Also, by the end of the course we develop an intimate knowledge of which brain activations commonly occur for certain processes. However, a major weakness is that the course primarily involves the memorization and regurgitation of scientific studies, as opposed to any kind of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really interesting, but it definitely was too jam-packed and fast-paced in the first half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Crockett and the TA's made a number of adjustments to the course after the midterm evaluation that improved the class greatly. This included making the lecture slides more comprehensive and easier to follow, making some of the readings optional to decrease the workload of the class and adjusting the due dates of some of the assignments. \r\nWith that said, while the skills you learn in the course are very useful, the course material itself is not very practical in the real world. Also, lecture always seemed too long, I would consistently get tired after about 50 minutes, maybe because there was too much information in the slideshow. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely fascinating, relevant and very engaging in terms of content and lecture style. This course could be improved by adding a section or assigning fewer readings. Due to the volume of reading assigned and lack of sections it is very difficult to engage with and understand all of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the awesome (and super relevant/applicable) subject matter and Professor Crockett's brilliant and enthusiastic relationship with the material. One major weakness is the readings; the ones that aren't empirical papers are very forgettable and don't do much to advance your understanding of the material. The first half of the semester, another weakness was the pacing. The lectures moved super quickly, it was unclear what material we were responsible for, and there was just a ton of disjointed material to memorize. Professor Crockett fixed this for the second half of the semester (it was her first time teaching the class) and made the class far more enjoyable to take. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the class was too much material in too little time, but after Professor Crockett altered the syllabus, the class was much more enjoyable and manageable. ",

            "\u00a0Definitley! While it is a tough class and full of information that kind of just has to be memorized- it has been my favorite class at Yale so far. I learned so much and really really loved Proffessor Crockett as a lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0It wasn't amazing but it wasn't terrible either. I didn't love it because I didn't find the material interesting, but I know others who were much more engaged. It's not super challenging either but it's definitely not a gut. Not a bad option for your psych science credit though. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome! I learning so many interesting things, would highly recommend. You do have to study hard for the two tests, but if you do, then they're totally fine. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0YES. My only caution: make sure you have taken Human Brain first. That should really be a pre-req. Other than that, YES! Take this amazing class as soon as you possibly can. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- would highly recommend to another student. Coming from a more molecular neuroscience background, it was very exciting and interesting to be exposed to human and functional imaging studies. The course structure gives an overview of many different subfields of social neuroscience and gives important exposure to techniques/methods in social neuroscience. Course is well-organized and has a very reasonable amount of work that only serves to reinforce understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- this is a good Psych natural science (or regular science) credit if you're willing to do a little work! It is not as difficult as I expected and the material is really interesting. ",

            "\u00a0I think if people are able to take on a difficult, interesting course on human brain and specifically its involvement with social interactions, this class would be amazing for others. I do think its a challenging course so I don't know that I would recommend it to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend! The stuff you learn in this class is so cool and will make you think more critically about your social interactions. Although there was a lot of information to memorize, I think that Molly is going to reduce the rigor of the course after hearing feedback this year, since she removed some things off the syllabus after receiving feedback from the students post-midterm. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very good class that strikes a nice balance of academic rigor with approachability. Professor Crockett is an exceptional teacher who clearly understands the field, and she was very accommodating in responding to student feedback and making changes to her teaching style. I would strongly advise taking Human Brain before taking this class, and expect the level of neuroscience to be about the same as that class. Definitely would recommend for CogSci majors with themes that overlap with social relationships and neuroscience ",

            "\u00a0Hands down one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Learning about social neuroscience will change not just the way you view yourself (in terms of behavior, emotions, and cognition) but also (more importantly) the way you view the social world around you. As someone who procrastinated taking anything remotely related to cognitive neuroscience, I sure wish I had explore this field earlier in my Yale career. Professor Crockett does a fantastic job synthesizing material from many empirical studies and she is very objective with her presentation of various studies' strengths and weakness. Her involvement in numerous subfields of social neuroscience research made taking the class that much cooler. That said, having taken Human Brain and Neurobiology helped me tremendously in the class, and those who hadn't taken intro classes in psychology or neuroscience might struggle a bit at the beginning. But if you have any hesitation at all, just take it take it take it! You will not regret the decision! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, but mostly if you are interested in neuroscience or think you might be interested in a career in neuroscience. The material learned isn't very useful if you are not considering neuroscience as an interest. ",

            "\u00a0Very great human brain and psychology class ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this for someone who is interested in the field of neuroscience. It is definitely rewarding in helping you learn more about the brain in an interesting way. However, I would not recommend it to someone studying other fields, as it is difficult to learn about these brain areas and concepts without having a strong interest in them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although only if you're interested in the subject and prepared to study the material in depth. I think many students went into this class thinking that it was a social psych class, but neuroscience methods, studies, and findings were the majority of the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to people who are interested in neuroscience or perhaps clinical research in a medical field. It is not a psychology course, and it is based heavily on scientific literature. There is also a lot of memorization required for the exams, and the readings are very dense. ",

I am a prospective psychology major, and I think this is just about the best science credit I could have taken. The material is really applicable to everyday life, and the work is all reasonable as long as you keep up. ",
