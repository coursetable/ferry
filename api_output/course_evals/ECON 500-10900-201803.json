            "\u00a0In the first half I learned about the economic theory of individual decision making. It improved tremendously my ability with mathematical proofs and how to think about individuals behaving in the economy. \r\n\r\nThe second half taught me about how to think about equilibrium that arises from many individuals acting as stipulated by the first half of the course. It also sharpened my mathematical abilities and honed my intuition for how to model and think about the interactions between many economic agents. ",

            "\u00a0In the first quarter, I think I gained insight on many of the fundamentals of microeconomics and the basic assumptions underlying much of our work. This helped me think more carefully and with more precision about mathematical facets of microeconomic theory.\r\n\r\nThe second quarter helped my familiarity with general equilibrium. This section felt more familiar to me, and so I feel like I learned less. However, I did gain some insight into the properties of general equilibrium. In the last part of the second quarter, I learned about financial assets and gained insight into how these affect welfare. ",

            "\u00a0I gained a foundation in microeconomic theory (consumer and producer theory as well as general equilibrium). I had very little background in economic theory since I have a background in biology and only a handful of courses in applied economics. \r\n\r\nI gained the ability to understand, develop and extend simple proofs of basic economic concepts. I also filled in many gaps that existed in my microeconomic foundation. "

            "\u00a0The strength of the course depended crucially on who the instructor was. Overall, I would appreciate a deeper engagement and discussion of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to relate it more to the real world, such as when the assumptions are realistic and when not, what one can do with the results (this especially for the GE part), etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides substantially important knowledge about fundamental microeconomics. I think the second half of this course in this semester is a little bit messy, due to frequent changes of instructors. Do hope that this course could have better consistency in instructor choice. ",
            "\u00a0The first half is very well-organized but the second is less organized, partly because we have two instructors for the second half. ",
            "\u00a0Well organized. Tremendously clear. The length of the homework could be reduced. Some students may want to have time to think independently rather than spending most of the time on the problem set. ",

            "\u00a0The first half of the course was well-structured but the second half was not. I am still unsure what concepts from this second half I should master. Importantly, I do not blame the professors, in fact Im very grateful to John and Eduardo for putting together this course on such a short notice. However, it was evident throughout that they did not have enough time to prepare the course. Im sure it will be better next year. ",
            "\u00a0The first half strengths of this course were the clarity of the exposition of the material, its block-by-block building up of the material which makes it easy to follow, and how the problem sets push one to really understand the material.\r\n\r\nThe second-half strengths were the exposure to applied theory and the problem sets that helped guide one through the difficult concepts presented in class. The weakness was that it didn't flow well, but that is understandable given the change in professors half way through. ",
            "\u00a0The contents are very useful. The second part can be more structured ",
            "\u00a0For the first quarter, the course was very challenging. Perhaps it was a bit too challenging, and I certainly wouldn't make it any harder, but looking back I appreciate being pushed with the material.\r\n\r\nThe second quarter was easier, but I think we still learned what we were supposed to. It could maybe be improved by spending less time on the things that are faster to understand (like finding general equilibrium with two countries trading) and more time with the extensions of the model (financial constraints etc.) ",
            "\u00a0The second part of the course felt sort of rushed and sometimes I felt there was not a clear roadmap, which was completely understandable due to the changes in the lecturers of the course.\r\n\r\nThe first part was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: high quality of the problem sets, lecture notes, and the course efficiency to deliver its main takeaway: a rigorous formalization of microeconomics' foundations.\r\nWeakness: In the second part of the course we had two Professors. I got the impression that each of them had a little number of lectures and could not develop the topics as complete as they (and the students) wanted. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the first quarter taught by Dr. Samuelson (although his assignments are soul-crushingly long). The second quarter was a bit frenetic with the division of time between Dr. Geanakoplos and Dr. Davila. Although, It seems our years was a bit of an anomaly and that this won't occur again, so I don't imagine future classes will have any issue as Dr. Davila takes over the teaching of this second quarter in a more official manner. \r\n\r\nThe TA sessions were *very* helpful in the first quarter as I learned to wrap my head around the mathematical logic required to understand and develop proofs. The assignments were well designed to help us slog through the material and gain a comprehensive understanding of it. At the time, though, the length of them was miserable. In hindsight, I appreciate the knowledge gained through their completion. \r\n\r\nThe assignments in the second quarter of the course were also really helpful in understanding general equilibrium theory. While they were much more algebraic in nature than the assignments of the first quarter, I found this very useful as I had never done GE before and was not taking macroeconomics simultaneously. "
