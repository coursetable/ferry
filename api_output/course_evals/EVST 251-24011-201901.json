            "\u00a0I liked the format of this course, and the day-to-day structure. It would be helpful if before the exams there was more clear instruction on what they were looking for exactly. ",
            "\u00a0The topics covered were generally interesting, and there was a lot of relevant interdisciplinary overlap that helped contextualize the content. Workload was very manageable, assignments were graded fairly and on time, and expectations were clear. The professors did an excellent job of working with student feedback to make lectures as successful as possible. Lectures and assignments were varied, with a nice mix of videos, discussion activities, guest lecturers, and trips to keep things engaging. The level of intellectual challenge is what you would expect from an introductory elective with no prerequisites. Discussions were sometimes hit-or-miss, one class the questions would be very involved and engaging, while other classes you would just restate the lecture material and then stall with your group. That's nitpicking, though, as overall the class experience was very successful. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class as a once a weak seminar was perfect. I was very engaged because we were rewarded for participation, so we learned the material without stressing. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great overview of pests, parasites, and pathogens, and their effects inside of ecosystems. The structure of the course (lecture followed by discussion) was great. Toward the end of the semester, I felt the lectures became a bit less interesting, and much more derivative of other ecology courses I've taken, but overall Andrew did a great job explaining information. \r\n\r\nI think the project at the end of the semester was a good way for me to synthesize a lot of what we were learning, but the short presentations didn't do it justice (not Andrew's fault just a fault of having so much interest in the course) \r\n\r\nOverall, I think a course like this could benefit undergrads in EVST or E&EB, but would recommend the last couple weeks of the course to be reimagined. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most organized classes I've ever taken! Everything was planned out and prepared really well. Andrew became a really great lecturer, and he improved greatly from the beginning of the course to the end. I liked the group projects, but they became a little short on time towards the end of the semester - which wasn't great because they got more interesting towards the end of the semester. Exams were fair, and I liked the post-class quiz format. I think this course could be improved by changing from a seminar format to a T/Th lecture, where Tues are lectures and Thursdays are \"lab\" activities/guest lectures. Guest lecturers were awesome! The potato museum field trip was interesting, but I did feel like we might have been better served by having another lecture concept and perhaps scheduling the museum trip outside of class/not going. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great because it is relatively low workload but super interesting, so I always really enjoyed doing the readings and going to class. The topics were very fun. ",
            "\u00a0clear instruction, helpful teacher/s\r\n\r\ncon: not as in-depth on each thing ",
            "\u00a0This class is potentially my favorite I've taken at Yale. The class layout was very easy to follow and everything was explained very concisely. The structure of the class, with a lecture followed by discussion and an online quizz made it easy to process the information. The content was novel and thoroughly intriguing. There was not too much work which gave you time to explore aspects which interested you the most which I think is very important. The only thing I struggled with was the timing of the class being into the afternoon as I got tired. It would have also been great to do field trips (other than to a museum) such as to local forests or the ocean. ",
            "\u00a0It was a nice once a week course that was catered for all skill levels and backgrounds of ecology/environmental studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class is nice because it only meets one time per week. This is both a blessing and a curse because one tends to forget some of the information over the course of an entire week. The powerpoints are easily accessible and provide a good fill-in solution, though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that it was organized and the material is really interesting. I was taking it as a science major, but it's very easily accessible even to people without a science background, and there were even a few high school students in the class as well. I especially enjoyed our field trip to the Irish Hunger museum over in Hamden, and I appreciated that there were connections made to the social and cultural implications of pests, parasties and pathogens. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the organization of the course was a major strength! I really liked the weekly quizzes: easy A if you paid attention during the lecture, also makes you go back and look at the slides, which have a lot of information, and make sure you understand the key concepts. Great weekly check! The weekly paper assignments were also good in a way in that I learned how to effectively find the needed information in scientific papers. Finally, the project and the presentation. I was really nervous about it because research and papers are definetely not my strength. But having really put in the work, I was very happy with the overall result. It was also a great way to apply the knowledge that we gained in the course. \r\n\r\nWeakness: sometimes the lectures were a little confusing with the examples incorporating multiple concepts. The participation tasks were a little confusing sometimes. However, the overall structure definetely made up for these two, and the instructor was always there to clarify anything we didn't understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths would include the lectures and class content, both were very engaging. Group discussion topics were also interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it was really interesting and did a good job of making science relevant to the social. Its weaknesses were that it required minimal amounts of student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very well balanced course! I loved the layout and types of assignments. I thought the field trip, guest speaker, and presentation were great to add to a course. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness was that it was a very easy course. I do understand that this is tailored to students with little science background, but the assignments could be a bit more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were put together well. I liked the split of lecture and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course was long and the subject was repetitive. Less material per class would have been nice, also teaching with mediums that differ from standard lecture slides, perhaps. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, especially for non-stem majors looking for a science credit. Very accessible course for all. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this to someone who is genuinely interested in the topic, regardless of whether it is from a social, health, or ecological perspective. The interdisciplinary overlap in the content ensures that you'll find something in every lecture to care about, regardless of your background. This course is also great for someone looking for insight into basic ecological themes and principles, from the perspective of some very unique and interesting organisms. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class is amazing. You actually learn interesting environmental science concepts, but in a very chill way. It also connected the material to humanities subjects which was great as a non-Science major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. I think the 3 P's are an extremely valuable, yet overlooked, component to ecosystems. I loved learning a broad range of ecological concepts from which to appreciate the roles of unapparent organisms. \r\n\r\nThis is also easy enough to be a Science credit for non-STEM majors (in my mind, this might have been one of the faults of the course but definitely made it very approachable for people with less of an ecology background) ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you're looking for a science credit and are not a science person but have always been interested in ecology and epidemiology, or are a science person but want to go deeper into the life cycle and effects of pests, parasites, and pathogens, this is the course for you! I have no idea if they will ever offer it again, but if they do it's a must take. You'll have weekly readings, reading responses, and quizzes, as well as a midterm, final, and final project, but nothing will be inaccessible to a non-stem major. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If this class is ever offered again I would definitely recommend it to others (and I already have). ",
            "\u00a0sure, you learn something, nice teacher, not very hard. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The content is truly fascinating and I think it would appeal to a huge range of people as it covers human disease, environmental conservation, historical cases of disease, agriculture and allsorts more. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course for an easy science credit. Its a very chill class overall, low workload, and decently interesting if you have any interest in ecology/disease. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to people looking for a good science credit or to those who have a profound interest in pests, parasites, and pathogens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone looking for an interesting take on ecology. ",
            "\u00a0I would if it all interested in disease from a more ecological perspective. It isn't necessarily the most challenging course, and I sometimes wish we went a bit more in depth on some topics. But, regardless, I still found it a really engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definetely recommend this course to another student because it was very well-organized and fairly assessed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes (if it is ever run again in the future). The content of the course was extremely relevant to current events and environmental issues, youll come out with a greater understanding of the role of pests, pathogens, and parasites. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to anyone with public health or conservation interests. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you like ecology and don't know much about what it means for something to be a parasite, then take this class. It is not a ton of work, but you will still learn quite a bit. The classes are split into lecture and discussion. Andrew was a great instructor and had lots of enthusiasm. This was one of the most enjoyable courses I've found at Yale. ",
