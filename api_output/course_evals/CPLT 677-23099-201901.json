            "\u00a0I engaged with readings about early Russian 20th cent drama, deepening my knowledge of Stanislavksy's and Meyerhold's methods. I was also introduced to more work by Kharms, Shostakovich, and Blok, among others. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me a great deal about performing arts in Silver Age Russia. I especially liked the primary sources we have read, as well as the discussion of major theatrical theories of the time. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus of the course is incredibly rich. I would spend more time on literature than ballet personally, investigating the history of the theater from 1900-1930 a bit more closely. ",
            "\u00a0The course strength is its interdisciplinary approach that covers many art form often neglected in other courses. The course weakness was its vast time scope, which made it difficult to equally engage with all the materials. "
