We learned about the various ways a mechanical structure can fail (due to normal stress, shear stress, bending, buckling, torsion) under different forms of applied loadings. We also considered how different building materials and properties can affect the way a structure fails. ",

I felt like a lot of the material was wishy washy estimation (since it's hard to simplify those materials down to equations that we can work with) but I think I learned enough to be able to work with it in the future. After I took the final exam, whenever I look at a column or beam I think of buckling under applied load and deflection.\r\nI did feel like this was basically a more specific physics class for a narrow subset of cases. We just learned how to use formulas in specific situations. ",

            "\u00a0There is so much material to be covered that the lectures would only cover each topic in a pretty basic way. This meant you had a solid foundation but it was a bit jarring to then do much more complicated  problems in the pset. I wish the easier material would have been covered faster so that the harder stuff could have more time. ",

            "\u00a0The course is good because of how linear and how ideas progress one after another and are generally easy to follow conceptually.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course could be how the instructor decides to teach it. Because some of the results are unintuitive, it would help if the instructor spent more time making sure the students knew which formulas applied when and going through likely problems. ",
            "\u00a0Covered a ton of material in too short a time. But I also learned a lot. I really liked Professor Brown as well, he was a good teacher ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -  The weekly section is a very helpful to learn the material - you work in groups to solve questions similar to those on the pset which sets you up pretty nicely to do the homework\r\n\r\nWeakness - the p-sets are graded kinda harshly - you can get points off for leaving small things off like units and labels on free body diagrams\r\n- not many example problems in lecture so you need to go to section if you want practice on problems ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, clear lectures, the professor is very clear about his expectations ",
            "\u00a0The material is engaging and interesting and the lectures were generally helpful.  The required discussion section often felt pointless or rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Good book, not best lectures. Tests are fair. ",
            "\u00a0Boring, uninteresting, and the professor was absolutely terrible at teaching or grading. Grading was unnecessarily harsh, and points were taken off for incredible stupid things. If you took off points for all the possible mistakes you would end up in the negatives. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are challenging but really force you to understand the material - they really helped me learn. The lectures were quite clear most of the time and the problem sessions were quite helpful to guide us through getting a handle on the problem solving process. The exams were quite fair, but be warned that the final was quite challenging. The class gets more challenging as it goes on - I think it would be helpful to have more resources later on as things get harder, like maybe an extra \"challenge\" problem session where we could've dived into a harder question or two to really see the ways things can get tricky and how to deal with it. I feel like I understand how to analyze certain situations but I would probably still be thrown off by something a little more complicated in real life. ",
            "\u00a0lectures can feel as though they are dragging on sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0You basically have to go to office hours to succeed (in order to make sure your problem set answers are correct.) It is very punishing to make some mistakes on problem sets, because they are worth a significant % of the final grade. \r\nAs with all math/problem classes, we just go over examples the entire class which goes a long way towards putting me asleep. There's not much to do besides copying down the notes by rote. \r\nProf. Brown brought some physical examples in (for bending, stretching, etc.) that did help to understand the material. \r\nThe problem sessions were very helpful for getting started on completing the problem sets, but sometimes the problem sets just throw something at you completely out of left field. ",
            "\u00a0The psets always thoroughly covered the content of the class and were reasonable in difficulty and length. Theres a problem session every week that in theory are very helpful, but in reality theyre poorly run and students are left alone to do their work and then leave the first minute they can. Improving the problem session structure would improve the class a lot ",
            "\u00a0The course tries to fit way too much into a single semester; if we were to take more time on each subject I'm sure it would yield better results ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a lot of useful knowledge and helps to show what is helpful in real applications of the ideas. It would have been helpful to have more time with the end of semester material in which multiple concepts are added together. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class is very organized. There's a PSET every week with multiple peer tutor sessions for help. Prof. Brown also holds office hours which were very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the opportunities for extra credit by completing machining projects. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the lectures were very organized, the psets supported what we'd learned in lecture and the exams were appropriate in testing our knowledge. I can think of two concrete changes I might make. First, sometimes in the psets there would be a very complicated integral to solve, such as some area moment, obviously too complex for the course, and I wasn't sure whether I was allowed or supposed to look it up in the textbook or online. Making that more clear would be nice. Otherwise, I would say the lectures started moving a bit too quickly once in a while during the second quarter, and there would be so much information in one class I wouldn't know quite what to do with it, or how much of it I was supposed to know. Maybe some lectures would benefit from a bit of trimming in that respect. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that both the difficulty of the topics covered and the pace at which we covered them increased as the course progressed. At the beginning of the semester we spent multiple lectures going through simple truss problems and the class often felt slow, but towards the end of the semester we would often cover challenging topics in the span of one lecture. It would be helpful to even out the pace of the course to match the difficulty of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is taught well, but I felt that problem sessions were excessive and could be more useful if it were mandatory time to work on problem sets with other students, instead of other practice problems. "

            "\u00a0If you have to for MechE, otherwise not worth it. Fine in terms of workload, although the psets can be difficult, but lectures are boring and the information isn't really applicable if you're not going to be an engineer. Be prepared to teach yourself a lot on the psets because they are a lot harder than the trivial examples in class. Also be aware that you will have no idea what your grade is the entire semester because while you get psets and midterms back in decent time, nothing is on canvas so you don't know where you stand in a curved class. Prof. Brown doesn't really help with this, he's vague about grades and altogether not very empathetic towards his students. Not a terrible class but not a good one either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because of its necessity for the major and its introduction to useful concepts in myriad fields. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. I'm not even a mechanical engineering major, but I learned so much about problem solving as well as the principles of statics and mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this is a chill and doable course for the Mech-E major. Class is light, p-sets are manageable and the professor/tutors are helpful. You shouldn't have a problem if you apply yourself and go to class. There's a fun bridge building project/competition at the end where you try to apply all you've learned to build the strongest bridge in the class. ",

It is taught reasonably well and I have no problems with the course organization. That being said do not take this course if it is not for you major. I am a mechanical engineering major and even I felt my joy slowly being sucked away from me. I will use everything I learned in this class, but it was boring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It can be hard, and not the most interesting thing in the world at times. But even in the hard weeks I was always able to step back and say \"man the questions on this pset are actually interesting, how cool that I'm learning how to do this stuff!\" Very applied and practical and useful things. Manageable challenge level. Makes me excited for learning more! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are a mechanical engineering major because it's a very important foundational class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! You probably have to take this class but Strength and Def was one of my favorite MechE classes. Brown was a great professor. His lectures were very clear and were well correlated with what we saw on the PSETs and on the exams. His door was always open to help students even if it was not during specified office hours. The problem sessions were also well organized. The first two exams were very similar to the PSETs but after this his lectures got a tad bit more disorganized. The final was genuinely difficult and nothing like the first two midterms so beware. Other than this I really enjoyed learning with Professor Brown. We also had to build a truss bridge that was tested in a design competition where groups got various forms of extra credit. That was one of the best parts of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're interested in mechanical engineering or civil engineering, but it would probably be better to take a more general physics/materials class if you are just interested in the concepts behind it. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless required by major. Difficult class and hard to track often ",
            "\u00a0The content of the class is really interesting and clearly applicable in the real world. Lectures can sometimes be dry, but overall you learn a lot of useful info. I would recommend this class (even though youre likely taking it as a required class). ",
            "\u00a0I took this class as an elective for BME, but it's typically taken by sophomores in MechE. Personally I enjoyed the challenge of the class a lot. There were plenty of office hours between peer tutors and Prof. Brown for help when you were stuck on the homework. The PSETs typically have 7 problems each, and the problems are very manageable between going to office hours and reading the book. The overall difficulty of learning the material is not too bad, but it definitely picks up towards the final third of the course. There's two midterms and a final. The midterms are very straightforward with problems that are very similar to those in the book and PSETs. The final was honestly a lot tougher where they combined concepts and had to figure out what kind of problem you were solving. The extra credit opportunity with the candlestick holder was actually kind of fun. And there's a final group project where you build a bridge out of balsa wood, which you'll need to set aside some time to do. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it! It might even be fun for non-majors, but I'm not sure I would want to take this course if I didn't like it; i.e., if I weren't a mech E major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who needs it for their mechanical engineering major, or if someone really like the FBD application of the mechanics portion of physics. "
