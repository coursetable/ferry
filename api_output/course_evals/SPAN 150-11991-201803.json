            "\u00a0Youre able to apply Spanish frequently through writing assignments, essays, oral evaluations, out of class recordings, etc. I grew immensely in my confidence to communicate in Spanish after taking this class. ",

            "\u00a0I improved my writing and conversational spanish, but also my daily academic/study habits. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing and speaking skills. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if a student wants to better their ability and confidence to communicate in a Spanish, this course is  needed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if willing to put in some work. There are easier and more interesting L5s but I really wanted to improve my speaking skills, and I think I was able to do that in 150. A lecture will never do that for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Totally - a really good way to get consistent Spanish conversation in throughout the semester without overextending. Good if you can communicate complex ideas in Spanish but want to increase fluency. I liked my classmates and so enjoyed the small group discussions. "
