Many of the lectures would have been more understandable if they had provided an introduction to the topic instead of making it an open-ended discussion about topics we did not understand yet. There was a broad range of topics covered but I would have preferred more of a systematic introduction to the field. ",

The class was too large to foster any meaningful one-on-one interactions with the experts that were brought on board. It will be an excellent course if the class is reduced to 30! ",

It ended up being larger than anticipated but that does not change the fact that it was not organized to encourage or really enable student learning or engagement. Attempts to break up lectures with group discussions did not do much because the groups were so large and the questions vague it was often not an effective way to discuss the material in any depth. ",

I really liked group work and that the overall workload was manageable. My one suggestion: I wish we would have recorded attendance somehow, to encourage people to come to class (maybe QR code?). It was annoying when people wouldn't show up... it happens in every class where they don't take attendance. ",
            "\u00a0A great intro course. \r\n\r\nThat said, coming from the Wall Street, I've come to the conclusion that public health people need to learn to present their materials better.  The toxicology professor's slide work was the best, but otherwise, this is a serious issue that public health experts can't effectively disseminate the information or educate others.  Everyone in the field should take some basic presentation course.  Slides are not your summary notes.  They are visual effects to make your points.  Don't use small fonts.  Don't show many pieces of information at the same time.  Show one line at a time.  Public health can be more effective! ",

Only weaknesses was the class starting on time and the coordination with a larger class size. While an auditorium may have been the best fit for the size of the class, it didn't allow for great group interaction. Despite the negative comments about the overall class size from the instructors, I thought that a bigger group didn't take away from the dynamic and ability to work together in group exercises, merely the room itself was the main hindrance.

The speakers of the class were great, you can tell that they are passionate on what they are doing/they have done. It's great to hear stories from different occupations related to health. It's a regret that we could not make the tour to work sites. I wish next year, they can be more prepared and make a way to continue the visits. ",

Usually they take students on a site visit, which did not happen this semester due to the larger class size.  We were also in Harkness Auditorium, which was much too large of a space for what was supposed to be more of a seminar/discussion based class. ",
