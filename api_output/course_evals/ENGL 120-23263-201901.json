            "\u00a0I learned a lot about my writing style. I got a lot better at reading, writing, and revising. ",
            "\u00a0HOW TO WRITE! For real!. In ENGL 120 you get the opportunity to explore new writing genres and improve the way you approach writing. From writing quick/short/impromptu pieces to outlining essays before starting out, you get the chance to explore what writing structure/process works best for you. We read many great works of literature to use as inspiration/guides to improving our writing. By reading and discussing the works of other writers you get a chance to observe multiple lenses/ways to put a piece of literature together. The course is great! ",
            "\u00a0A broad scope of approaches to creative nonfiction, style, grammar, delivery... ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to craft my writing and really make it mine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more personal essays and become a better writer in general. This class definitely helped me develop my writing skills and I learned some specific techniques to improve my writing. There is a lot of writing in this course and because of that I have become better at writing quickly and just jotting down my ideas without regard to grammar, structure, etc. There is a lot of time spent on revision so I also learned how to revise my essays and find obvious mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing style and technique. I gained insights into my own writing and the writing styles of my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I learned exactly what creative nonfiction was and the different genres/types of writing in it. I also learned how to compose these types of writings myself: personal profile, interview, cultural criticism, open letter/manifesto, and speech. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better pay attention to not just the structure of an entire piece, but even the structure within the single sentences and paragraphs that you right. I learned more about myself in the exploration of different areas through my writing, I learned new perspectives from the writers that we observed and generally improved my reading eye and writing capability. "

        [
            "\u00a0There's a whole lot of writing. That's both the strength and weakness. Expect to spend many hours writing and revising not only your essays but your classmates' as well. But because I did so much of it, I'm now a much better writer. I used to see writing as a painful chore, but this class changed my perspectiveI now see writing as maybe not fun but probably neutral. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: ENGL 120 is a very engaging writing course where you learned to improve your writing style through self-selected essays (ie. you can write about whatever you want in the context of the writing genre being covered), peer reviews and workshops and one-on-one instructor feedback. The peer-review based framework of the class, makes it a very intimate experience where you learn about your classmates through their essays and then collectively work to improve the stylistic/technically parts of the writing as a writing club/family.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: NONE! This course is great to improve your writing in a fun and rewarding way! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the way David structured the class was great. I can see how the success of the class would depend on the class itself, but luckily we had a great class and teacher. ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include that fact that it is a small seminar and the group becomes a small community of writers. I felt like I got to know my classmates fairly well just through coming to class everyday and reading everyone's essays and their stories. It's a very positive environment for people who might be uncomfortable with sharing their writing at first. The professor always gives substantial feedback because of the way this class is structured so that's also a big plus. A possible weakness of this course is the fact that there is so much writing. You have to spend a good amount of time every week writing and revising your essays but over time I didn't really see this as a drawback of the course. I felt that it was beneficial for me to have to write so much every week because that's the best way to improve your writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the seminar context. Talking with the other students and workshopping each others' papers was a great way to spur discussion and come up with actionable steps to improve from one draft to the next. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well structured in terms of faciliating students to engage in the class and learn. I liked the intimate, 11-person seminar-style teaching, where everyone could contribute thoughts and information. I liked how we went over the readings every class to analyze them; I also loved how Professor de Leon at the end of the semester took us outside for our last speech class.\r\n\r\nThe little freewrites that David de Leon implemented occasionally were also liberating and helpful in terms of moving forward from writer's block. He once let us write our thoughts about a houseplant sitting on the table, and that was both fun and interesting.\r\n\r\nThere were very few weaknesses of the course! ",
            "\u00a0The biggest \"weakness\" of the course felt like the lack of sufficient time. Sometimes classes didn't feel long enough to engage with all of the readings to the degree that I may have wanted. In addition, sometimes the turnaround for essays felt too short to adequately devote as much care as I may have wanted (such as having an essay due and then the new one due in 6 days afterwards. As for strengths, the reading material was engaging, David was a joy to work with, the feedback was constructive, and I felt very happy to come to class. "

            "\u00a0Of course. If you want to improve your writing, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'd definitely recommend ENGL 12. It's a great class to earn your WR credit, but even a better class just to improve your writing skills and learn how to approach writing in different genres ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. As a STEMmy person I was nervous coming into this class, but I can confidently say my approach and confidence in my writing has improved tenfold. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it improves your writing immensely. ",
            "\u00a0YES! For sure I would recommend this course. As a STEM major, I took this class for a writing credit and was a bit scared going in because I never thought of myself as much of a writer. However, it became my favorite class this semester and it felt good to be able to write more personal essays instead of academic papers. Professor de Leon is really helpful and generates really interesting discussions in class so I would definitely recommend him as well. I feel like I improved my writing skills a significant amount through this course and I'm very glad I took it. Some of the essays were really satisfying to write. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE!!! Not only will you improve as a writer, but you will genuinely enjoy this class. I guarantee it. In our group discussions, nobody was putting on a show, and as classmates we got really close. I would highly highly recommend taking it.  Just take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The seminar context means you have to work harder than you would have to in a lecture class, but the class is very rewarding if you put in the work. I loved workshopping my classmates' papers and having my papers workshopped. I learned a lot about myself and my classmates through the creative nonfiction writing process, and I think all of us dramatically improved our writing styles. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely, definitely recommend this course to another student. David de Leon was a wonderful, culturally sensitive \"woke\" instructor who is excited to see his students learn. You will learn a lot from the course and most importantly, you will have fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any person regardless of major, interests, whatever it may be. Writing can help you in whatever field you may choose to endeavor in, and even if not for the practical skills, the self learning you may experience through the act of writing is invaluable. "
