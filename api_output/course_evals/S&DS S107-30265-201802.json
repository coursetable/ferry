The combination of computer programming and data analysis is the surprise that I encounter in the course. Thus, the statistical thinking with the aid of computer programming is the most significant skills that I have developed. ",

The course also taught me to master the art of coding (R-Code) which is something I did not expect to come across in a statistics course.

I think the difficulty of the course could be adjusted to be more consistent.\r\nIn addition, the office hours of my instructor are usually conflicted with my other courses, so it could possibly be coordinated with other course time although it is difficult.
