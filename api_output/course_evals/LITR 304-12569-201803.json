            "\u00a0I learned useful reading skills for approaching large readings. I gained insight on which parts of a large novel can be skimmed and which should be read more carefully. \r\nI learned a great deal about Latin American history. For every novel we read, the professor presented a historical mini-lesson to give the novel context. Learning about the historical aspect that influenced each novel helped understand both the content and style of writing. \r\nI also learned much about the Roman legal tradition which serves as the base for Latin American law.

            "\u00a0The freedom given to students to choose what to write about in their essays was definetely a positive, as it gave us the opportunity to explore the specific subtopics of the course that we found most interesting. The emphasis placed on both thematic and literary analysis was also a strength, as it helped hone multiple skills.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course was perhaps the volume of reading. At times it felt that we were not spending enough time on certain novels, and I sometimes felt that I did not have enough time to read all the novels carefully enough to fully grasp all the important content.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. However, said student must be very interested in learning about Latin American history and culture, as well as studying the origins and formations of Roman law. If these topics do not seem interesting to the student, then maybe this course would not be appropriate because much of the work and analysis revolved around these topics, which I personally liked learning about.
