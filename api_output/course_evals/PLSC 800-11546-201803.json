            "\u00a0Greatly enhanced my understanding of research designs -- usual critiques of them (not accounting for selection effects, not acknowledging measurement error and likely bias direction, etc.) and types of good ones (regression discontinuities, in appropriate context, within-unit change pre-/post-treatment). Papers were a chance to explore some ideas to potentially use in research one day. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my familiarity with the core American Politics literature. This class also strengthened my ability to critique scholarship while motivating my own research questions for future inquiry. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great! Got to learn a ton about the various ways Americanists go about research. Really think I developed my capacity to critique in this course. More so than in any academic environment I've been in, I think, I really felt like we all had smart feedback on the papers/books we discussed. ",

            "\u00a0Combo of Greg's bit of lecture with mostly discussion seemed quite effective. Not too much reading, though sometimes a serious amount (but never too much). I like the 5-paper model (and not having a final is pretty nice...). ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was excellent. I recommend mostly keeping it as it is. ",
