            "\u00a0I loved how informal the course was. The focus was on developing our own craft as artists, rather than becoming the best at drawing as possible. We were given a lot of creative freedom, and the classroom environment was very relaxed. I did wish, however, that we got more opportunities to look at art in galleries, museums, etc. ",

            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was that it was taught by Samuel Messer. I'm not sure how the course would have worked if not for him. Sam doesn't print syllabuses, and dynamically readjusts the course to the needs of the class. I imagine the strengths and weaknesses of the course would be very different with different structure, but my experience was that the class was very relaxed, with a low workload, but high engagement, dedication, and a great opportunity to focus on a skill that Yale doesn't always value so highly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is an enjoyable course from which you get to learn about the basics of drawing. The course mainly deals with charcoal/graphite drawings, so color isn't really touched on through the course material. Because there's so much already to be learned with using just charcoal, I would say it's pretty reasonable that the class does not do color. ",

I appreciated that there was very little work outside of the class and that the environment of the class was very supportive. I felt encouraged to take risks, and to do the necessary work of the projects that I personally committed myself to. ",
