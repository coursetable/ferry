            "\u00a0I gained a good overview of the main topics and thinkers working on questions of development and conservation in anthropology. Through the lectures and discussions, I learned to apply these thinkers to a variety of contemporary issues and incorporate other thinkers frameworks into my own research ",
            "\u00a0This course was helpful in exposing me to a depth of thinking about global supply chains, and the way that money and power operate in the global scale. Often, at FES, we talk about why development or conservation agencies are problematic, but this course really helped me understand the nuance of why, and the historical context of how these inequalities have been built.

            "\u00a0The material and the class overall exceeded all of my expectations. I did not really know what the class would be about when I decided to enroll, but I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the material ",
            "\u00a0I was pleased with the breadth of information we covered, and the types of background knowledge I received from the class. I would say the class is very much tailored for qualitative researchers and Anthropology/Social Science focused students. Although the discussions were often applied, the readings and the assignments felt more academic in nature than many FES courses. "

            "\u00a0I think the structure of the course is one of its greatest strengths. The process of submitting thesis sentences, having a lecture, and then a discussion works very well. I think the lecture gets everyone on the same page, and really opens up the seminar for a good conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that it gave students an introduction to many ways of thinking about the power relations operating behind our globalized economy, and how those relations came to be. The weakness is that the readings are very academic in nature, and there was sometimes a disconnect between the content of the readings and the content of the discussions. "

            "\u00a0I would say that you will get out whatever you decide to put in to this course. If you put a lot of time and thought into the material, it will be an engaging and rewarding class ",
            "\u00a0This is very much an anthropology course, and the texts you'll read are quite academic in nature. That said, it's a really helpful background for those who are considering working on international issues, especially in conservation and development, to question how our current global economy operates.
