            "\u00a0I think the course did a good job of surveying all of the body systems in a semester. However, many times it was confusing to what level of detail we needed to know for exams. In addition, Professor Boulpaep was truly hard to understand, even though they are quite clearly an expert in their field. ",
            "\u00a0This class could easily be the best class within the MCDB department, yet sadly it is not. Boulpaep, who teaches the heart section of the class, goes into way too much detail and is honestly not very clear on what he expects you to know. The slides presented in class usually don't have enough information to study off of, and so you need to refer to the book/google (except for Aronson's lectures- he teaches the kidney and that is relatively comprehensive). The tests are random and unfair - Saltzsman pulls questions from a test bank that he repeatedly uses, and they seem to test very fine details within systems rather than the bigger picture which I believe is more important. I would never know what to expect going into a test. The test also assigns three points to multiple choice and one to true false, and the short answer section was worth less than half the points  (sometimes much less than half), which doesn't make sense. The tests should be centered on short answer since that's how students can really show that they understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized. I also liked having different professors come in to talk about their fieldsalthough I will say that some of them were better lecturers than others. For that reason, each section of the course had its own strengths and weaknesses. For example, the lecture handouts we were provided when we covered the renal system were helpful and the clinical vignettes we were given for the endocrine system were interesting. The unit on the cardiovascular system was confusing and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Too much content was crammed into too little time such that I never could take away the major concepts, but rather felt like I was always skimming the surface of a variety of topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course should not be taught with the graduate school course, the undergrad version should have material in less detail ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized, and each instructor brought their unique teaching style to the class. While a lot of detail was covered, exams focused on central concepts and general understanding over rote memorization, which was refreshing. The only thing I would say is that I would have liked the endocrine lectures to be a little more organized -- some more charts or summary diagrams would have been helpful to better visualize the interplay between different hormones and signalling pathways. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized by system and specialty guest lecturers. Sections were also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This could be one of the best classes offered in MCDB at Yale, except for some serious gaps in teaching. About half of the course was taught by Professor Saltzman, who does an all right job at covering the material, but isn't always clear about how much detail you're expected to know (he also simplifies a lot of concepts when he's teaching, making them sound deceptively easy despite your needing to know more). Professor Aronson (renal lectures) and Holt (endocrine lectures) are definitely the best - you'll come to appreciate your kidneys and pituitaries so much more afterwards! But Professor Boulpaep's cardio lectures (which I'd argue is the most complicated and non-intuitive body system we learned) are terrible - way too complex and quick to make any of the information synthesizable. Cardio became the topic that everyone feared, which is really sad considering how important of a system it is. \r\n\r\nThe semester workload is relatively low, except for around the two midterms. The midterms are time crunches - around 50 total multiple choice and true/false and two 4-5-part short answers. The MC and T/F are worth almost 75% of the exam (which is unexpected). You'll be working up to the end, and need to straight up memorize a lot of the details on slides. Some questions are nitty-gritty while others are larger concepts, so you really don't know what they'll be going for. \r\n\r\nThe final exam was definitely cumulative and requires a lot of studying. It's not the best idea to take this course along with a lot of other time-intensive courses - also check when the exam is in comparison to your other courses, as it's pretty terrible if you have a lot of back-to-back exams surrounding this one. Plan ahead! The exam tests on both broad and specific concepts, so don't leave details out when you're studying. You'll probably be asked to relate how different effects of different body systems then affect one another. There is a ton of information to be memorized. ",
            "\u00a0There is so much content to learn and I feel like we kept getting tested on the same things. They should have been more explicit about what is super important and what isn't super important. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professors were all very knowledgeable about the topics they were teaching. My TA also was very helpful in making sure that we understood the concepts that were being presented.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Because most of the exam is mostly multiple choice and true/false, I feel like I cannot accurately show what I know and what I don't know. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that it is very well structured with no problem sets but rather a weekly quiz that is fairly generous and two midterms plus a final. The class is reasonable in terms of the workload during the semester, and systems are in place to make sure that a student with a question will be able to find an answer. The biggest weakness of the class is that it emphasizes brute memorization as opposed to conceptual understanding, and the exams are basically a test of how much you remember, especially the multiple choice and true/false answers. This got to be overwhelming towards the end of the class as there was so many facts flying around that it was hard to keep them all straight. Another large weakness with the class is the text, as it is simply too much presented in too dense a format. The text has all the answers, as well as about 50 you didn't want for every question. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the lectures were incredibly clear (with the exception of the cardiac lectures) but the assigned textbook didn't really help. It was too dense, in my opinion. The tests were very fair and section was helpful; the peer tutors were incredible and their review sessions were amazing--they deserve so much credit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the presentation of material and focus on homeostasis for each system. I liked how parallels between different systems were made clear. The course could be improved by not adhering so closely to the textbook figures so much. ",
            "\u00a0Too much material, but very interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Too fast-paced and professors routinely overestimated how much they could get through during each class period, so they would either race through material or try and insert missed slides into the next lecture to be quickly gone over. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely well organized, and I think I really appreciated the order in which the systems were presented. I think it was extremely important that the nervous system and action potential mechanism was introduced first, because that was the basis for so much of what we learned later. I also appreciated how thorough Prof. Saltzman was about explaining it and grounding the concepts for us in mathematical equations, etc.\r\nI thought that most frustrating part of the course was the way the exams were written, though, particularly the multiple choice and T/F questions. For example, even if I understood renal physiology very well but mixed up in which tubule Na+ was primarily reabsorbed, I would miss a point on the exam. That was quite frustrating for me, and I felt the material was better suited to all short-answer format questions.\r\nLastly, I felt that the TAs were extremely uneven in their knowledge of the material and ability to help students. Some TAs were extremely competent and synthesized material in an extremely helpful way, but others were not able to answer any questions during section and would have to refer to another TA. Perhaps there would be a way to make sure that all TAs had some knowledge of common questions students would have? ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed how the course was split up into the different sections and how Professor Saltzman would have different doctors give the lectures that pertained to their respective fields. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest lectures and the way the class was taught in terms of system sequence. The sequence was different than in past years, but I thought it flowed very well. I think the class would benefit, however, if Boulpaep and Holt were not lecturers. Their slides were full of too much information and they did not teach on a systems level. They rather just stated facts, which makes understanding how the facts relate to function much harder. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was bringing in experts in the different systems to lecture. I really enjoyed having new professors every few weeks and getting to learn from people who are the top in their fields and who have a lot of enthusiasm for the work they do. However, there were definitely a few professors who I didn't think did a very good job at explaining things, so I was more grateful for some than others. One weakness of the course is that it wasn't always that clear how much detail we should know about certain things, especially since the tests were both short answer and multiple choice. ",
            "\u00a0Super relevant material\r\n\r\nSome lecturers more confusing\r\nSometimes not enough physics background given in lecture to biology students\r\nFocus on small details in lecture, without summarizing to big picture\r\nWording of exam questions ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it provides a strong overview of much of the body. The downside is that it tries to cover a lot of dense material in one semester which means it's hard to learn everything to the extent they require. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though the multiple choice questions on the exams were very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the different professors that teach topics that they are passionate about. The weakness is that some of the professors are far better lecturers than others and thus some topics or systems in the body end up becoming much more confusing to understand. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of support and the materials are easy to digest. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this course is very well taught by a variety of professors with specializations in the material that they cover. I don't know that there were many weaknesses of the course, as it was very fair, with all of the tests being reasonable. There was simply a lot of material to study, but if you had your study habits in check, you should have no problem. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the organization of the weekly quizzes and sections. These help students to stay on top of the massive amounts of information presented each week and to solidify their understanding of the most important concepts before moving forward. The main weakness is the sheer amount of detail taught and expected of students on exams. The exams are the only true determinant of students' grades, and the exams often test somewhat obscure details without also allowing students to demonstrate their understanding of main concepts. I think it would be more fruitful to actually grade the weekly quizzes, motivating students to work hard to learn each week's material, instead of giving every students 10 points back (almost guaranteeing full credit to everyone). Then, if the quizzes counted for a higher percentage of the final grade, I think that this would be a more accurate representation of the students' effort and understanding throughout the entirety of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class has a lot of reading that is overwhelming and doesnt really contribute to learning in an efficient manner. The text was mostly supllemental. A strength of the class was the different teachers who added freshness. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well taught. I would have preferred fewer guest lecturers, and more time spent on the reproductive system rather than 4 (very slow and repetitive) lectures on the endocrine system. It would have been helpful to hand back exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of going through the details of physiological systems and applying what we learn to medical cases. The cardiac lectures were interesting but often it was unclear what we should be taking away from the slides given the high number of graphs associated with this part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I love the quizzes, which highlight and teach major concepts. i loved the exams because they focused on logic and understanding major concepts more than the tiny tiny details of things.  I love wendy and imadh -- they were critical for me to do well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of materials.but highly organized. Guest lectures are great ( except heart lectures, which are more confusing than helpful.) ",
            "\u00a0There is a huge issue with the TA system. One TA is amazing and gave his sections notes regarding details of the entire course (which I found the night before the final) and essentiallly would have given everyone who had it an A+ standard. Other TA's recycled the lecture powerpoints and gave no feedback whatsoever. PLEASE change the TA system because it really screwed over half the students who didnt have the chance to read a cheat sheet ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course rely on the expertise of the various professors, the depth of the weekly take-home quizzes, and the organization of the units. While Professor Saltzman was always a good lecturer, the ceding of the class to other professors, specialized in the current unit, was useful for student learning and was always interesting. The quizzes (though they should be called problem sets and opened sooner after the last one's closure) did a good job at forcing review of the week's notes without asking absurd questions. They focused on the main points of lecture, and required some synthesis of material that wasn't generally difficult, but was extremely helpful in exam prep. ",
            "\u00a0The sheer amount of material made the cumulative final very difficult to feel prepared for ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the guest lecturers. It was very engaging to be met with different professors lecturing on topics that they are most knowledgeable on and passionate about within human physiology. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work and studying but what you learned made it really worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This course challenges students and allows for much to be learned quickly. However, I believe there should be more than two assessments throughout the course of the semester due to the amount of material. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the professors are very clear and thorough.  My teaching fellow was very good, which helped a lot.  Weaknesses are that some of the professors were very confusing and hard to learn from, and it required a lot of hours each week, especially if you wanted to go to the review tutorials, which were often on the weekend at difficult times for me.

Even if you don't read every part of every chapter, you should still be ready to go into the book to clarify the lecture material, as the course moves FAST. This class affirmed my desire to be pre-med -- my favorite class I've taken so far. Despite the immense detail covered, tests are reasonable and tend to focus more on general concepts (not to say that details AREN'T tested), which is a blessing. If you've always been curious as to how the body does it's thing, 100% take this class! ",

It's not going to blow your mind (the teaching can be poor, and the expectations sometimes unclear), but the material itself is awesome (learning about your body is cool!), and you get a lot out of the time you put into studying it.

The class is well structured, and the workload as far during the semester is reasonable. However, there are issues with the class that makes me hesitate in recommending it to another student is that there are quite a few teachers, meaning you can see a revolving door of teaching styles that can be difficult to keep up with. In addition, the tests seemed to emphasize memorization, and it felt like many times I was learning something very easily searched online for an exam. This is the biggest part of my hesitation to recommend the class to another person, as the chances are if you are really interested in the matter it is because you are pre-med, at which point you will learn all this info later, and you don't get a whole lot out of the class from a conceptual standpoint. Overall, the class is not terrible, but it may annoy you when it comes time to study for exams. ",

It's well taught and you learn an incredible amount of information. That said, since you do learn so much it can be quite challenging and I'd make sure you take it seriously/make sure you have enough time to dedicate to it. Take advantage of the peer tutor review sessions. I wouldn't recommend the assigned textbook, it's just too dense in my opinion. You're better off looking at Costanzo. The tests are fair but hard. It's mostly well taught (except for the cardiac lectures). ",

I would suggest anyone anyone interested in the human body at all, especially premeds, to take it or even Cr/D it. It is just so interesting to be learning about all of the physio systems and know it's all happening in your body as you learn it! It truly gives you an appreciation for each organ in your body and all of the necessary components. I loved the class, which I would rarely say about classes with material as difficult and comprehensive as this. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was really cool to learn about the body's systems, and I definitely have a greater appreciation for different parts of my body (kidneys and heart, especially!). However, I would definitely recommend taking the class as Credit/D/Fail if you can though because it is a huge grind, and sometimes the grading felt confusing and unfair for the midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, but super dense and complicated material to memorize. Felt like I couldn't keep up, and don't have good advice. Enjoyable, difficult, fulfilling. Multiple choice questions on exams will wreck you, so study. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are willing to put in a lot of work understanding concepts and memorizing information, because all of the course material is very applicable and good to know, but takes effort to retain. ",
            "\u00a0I would because it is interesting and you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting and engaging but very difficult. I would only take it if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, only to BENG and pre med students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the human body and body function. It shouldn't only be a class for MCDB/BME majors, as I feel that a lot of the information in this class is applicable in daily life. The information in this course helps to explain how the human body functions, and how to identify what goes wrong in certain diseases, making the course very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they were taking in Credit/D/Fail. This is because I found the material very interesting and do feel that I learned a very great deal about the human body, but I think that the course is set up such that it's very difficult to do well, even after working very hard to learn the material throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking the MCAT at any point in the future, PLEASE do yourself a favor and take this course. Don't listen to what other people say about the curve, or how difficult it is-- it is SO worth it, and you learn an insane amount of information that you actually retain. I can't even explain how helpful it has been for me in my MCAT prep. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you like science and think the human body is cool. Be prepared to work hard though. The underlying concepts are easy to understand if you know how potential energy is generated and used, however there is quite a lot to know. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone willing to put in the time to really learn the course material - given the high volume of information it requires a good amount of time each week but it is really interesting material. I enjoyed the class and recommend it to anyone, especially pre-med students. ",
            "\u00a0INCREDIBLE COURSE!! IN LOVE WITH IT! PLEASE TAKE IT! it is so so fun and useful and extremely engaging. you learn such applicable topics that actually can be applied to daily life in understanding manifestations of different symptoms and reasons underlying them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely fascinating knowledge. Make sure you start studying early. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless you have to. Seriously, its interesting but itll kill you trying to keep up. Make sure you get the good TA. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Especially if you are a pre-med, or interested in studying animals, it provided a great overview of internal function of most major systems (barring the immune system). It was well-taught all around, and not a bad amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! ",
            "\u00a0It is incredibly time-intensive but also incredibly rewarding. Would highly recommend if youre at all interested in medicine or physiology. Some parts of it are better taught than other parts, but everything is very learn-able. ",
            "\u00a0Helpful for the MCAT, but it is a lot of work!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it gives you a inside into the body. But if you are taking a hard course load that semester I would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students, especially those looking to go into medical careers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but only if you really need to learn about this material for something.  It's not a course to take just because you're interested in the body and health, since it is very detailed and in depth. "
