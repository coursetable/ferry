Lafferty fails to give anything more than a brief glance at the theory behind the more involved ML methods. Whats more, his notation changes on a slide to slide basis, making it unnecessarily difficult to follow along. The problem sets are terribly organized and untested. Lafferty routinely makes large changes to problem sets after they are posted, often only a day or two before they are due. Yale is supposed to have wonderful professors. Sure, good professors don't always make good teachers, but students expect even bad teachers put time into planning their classes. This CLEARLY is not the case in Laffertys S&DS 365. I learnt what I needed to know for this class by reading the textbook and watching smart 13 year olds explain stuff on YouTube. This is not an exaggeration. I literally watched 13 year olds explain stuff because they do it better than Lafferty does.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Lafferty, while a highly credentialed researcher, doesnt seem to care about the quality of his teaching.

The only weakness that really comes to mind was the midterm exam -- I didn't like that the midterm tested us on material that, in my experience, wasn't really emphasized in lecture and wasn't covered on prior problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was somewhat but not always related to the problem sets. Problem sets were very good. Professor Lafferty was a very interesting lecturer, his passion for the material really came across. ",

Also, the midterm exam was based heavily in theory, which didn't really correlate with your ability to perform the codes on the problem sets. ",

Sometimes, the material on the PSETS required extra instruction that we did not receive and had to figure out on our own, but this wasn't a huge hurdle. ",
            "\u00a0Really cool material, but horribly difficult. I pulled all nighters for the 6 psets I completed, and I found it difficult to study for the exam because there was so much material. However, I appreciated the structure of the class, as it didn't have a final exam or project. ",
            "\u00a0The class was incredibly informative and I learned a lot from a legend in the Stats community -- that being said, it was hard to keep up at times, and the course required a lot of Math and learning outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The material goes by fairly quickly and is quite advanced. However, Psets were structured very well, athough they were very time consuming. You definiteu learn a lot of material. ",

            "\u00a0I think that there should be an ethics section of this course or that ethics should be imbedded into lecture routinely. ML is a very powerful field and machine learning techniques are being used to do some really interesting and meaningful work, but there are a lot of ethical questions relating to machine learning and I think there needs to be an open dialogue about those in all iterations of this class. Other than that, a final project might be an interesting way to tie everything together and let students test drive their new skills on data that they're personally interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I can not think of any weaknesses! The biggest strength of the course was most definitely Professor Lafferty- he is a phenomenal teacher and also just a genuinely nice guy. I found most of the problem sets to be the right level of difficulty, so they were challenging but rewarding to complete. Placing the majority of the grade in the assignments really encouraged me to master the material. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is Professor Lafferty. Hes tremendously knowledgeable, and put a ton of effort into the class. The main weakness was that the psets were often unnecessarily long and tedious. I often felt that I could have mastered the material with half as many problems, or with problem sets thats didnt take 6 hours to run. ",
            "\u00a0The topics themselves are very interesting and the slides are very good. Lafferty is also a very good lecturer who cares about his students. The psets have a fair share of math questions and programming questions which was nice. However some of the problems required a lot of time and computational power to run (like 4 hours for each part) which was a little annoying and made debugging difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course covered more \"modern\" developments in ML - we barely talked about Neural Nets until the very end of the class! ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-taught, and covers a nice range of material. I wished that we were shown more of the math/derivations behind the methods; there was a little bit in the HW, but I found those parts much more valuable than other sections, which often were more mechanical (download and use a package, make a plot, etc.) The structure (2 quizzes and a midterm) makes for a much better-balanced semester, although it did mean that there was less incentive to really study the material of the last few classes, given all the other exams/assignments (for other classes) due right around that time. Finally, I felt like using packages in psets was convenient, but not really valuable. It might not be feasible to have us write our own source code for established algorithms, but a write-up in the pset about what the packages were doing, or something like that, would have been valuable. This is nitpicking, but finally, I personally would have loved to spend more time on the less-trivial algorithms, like Newton's algorithm (rather than the brute-force-ish ones, like for building a tree). ",

            "\u00a0Course had a good balance of depth and breadth, and assessments were fair. ",
            "\u00a0Problem Sets were very long. Some questions, for example, would test our knowledge on the same topic but just make things take a long time to do. Overall, great course and really enjoyed the material. Midterm was hard though. Wish we were given a better idea of how to prepare for the exam. ",
            "\u00a0The psets in this class are very well constructed--they are informative and engaging, and tie in well to lectures.\r\n\r\nThe lectures can be dense: in particular the level of mathematical engagement varied widely from broad/conceptual to high-level proofs. Greater consistency in the level of mathematical derivations would probably help set clearer expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Lafferty's slides lack clear or consistent notation; most of my comprehension came from watching videos online. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of many techniques. Not sure how to get us to grapple more with the implications/interpretations of various techniques, but would have been useful. Perhaps a final project. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more intuitive explanations on the math basis of the methods. Sometimes we just skim through the math explanation. ",
            "\u00a0This class was phenomenal. There is very little I would do to change the course. Never in my four years at Yale have I found myself actively participating in a majority of the lectures until I took this class (and this says a lot because it was a 9:00 AM course) . The assignments were on the long side, but they were really cool and in the last assignment, we implemented a machine learning to solve word analogies (i.e A is to B as C is _____).  Professor Lafferty is a very clear and inspiring lecturer, and he leaves ample time in class for questions. One suggestion I have is to rethink the prerequisites. Unfortunately, I think a lot of students struggled in this class and didn't get to enjoy it as much as I had. I think S&DS 242 was officially a prerequisite, but my sense is that many students who hadn't taken S&DS 242 were still encouraged to take the class. From my observation, these students struggled which is a shame because they would have enjoyed the class had they waited another year and taken the proper prerequisites. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were great and the assignments really made us learn the methods we discussed in class. Professor Lafferty himself is the strength of the course, in my opinion, because he offers really good insights into the subject matter and explains it well. In terms of improvement, I think the assignments were a bit too long and involved too much R coding that wasn't guided. Some of the most challenging parts of the assignments were just getting the non-machine learning code to work, which wasn't very enlightening. This started changing toward the end of the semester, so maybe this feedback is already being addressed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course focused too much on math (especially the lectures) although I liked that the assignments and tests focused more on intuition. \r\n\r\nI'd re-structure this course to be more CS-focused (PYTHON >> R) and practical -- have us do a real final project using Keras / Tensorflow and get a taste of modern ML. ",
            "\u00a0The interesting and topical nature of the material was one large strength of the course. The problem sets were also generally engaging and interesting to think through and solve. However, the organization and grading of the course negatively impacted my learning and overall experience of this class. One major issue was a clear disconnect between the professor and the teaching fellows, and an even larger gap between the professor and the ULAs. There were often typos or mistakes in the assignments that made the problem sets much more difficult, and that required updated instructions or advice from the instructors. In addition, there was very little useful feedback provided on the problem sets, and no solutions were ever posted that would have allowed students to see how their code could have been improved. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was great. The problem sets were well designed, but I wish there had been more guidance on using R. I also think it would have been more interesting and helpful to have students more often write simplified implementations of the statistical methods gone over in class (rather than just implementing already-developed packages). ",
            "\u00a0This class had the best-planned syllabus I've ever encountered. I very much appreciated this, especially since so many syllabi are terrible and make classes unnecessarily difficult and stressful. Problem sets were every 1.5 weeks, but never due on the same day as an exam. Office hours were scheduled well, though the ULAs often were not able to help, since the class covered more material than in previous semesters. Lectures were always engaging.\r\n\r\nThe quizzes were so short and tested such a small portion of what had been taught that they really came down to luck in which slides you looked over most recently. If they continue to be that short, there should be more, maybe every week but covering less material.\r\n\r\nOne p-set was dropped, and there was no final exam or project, which I think was good because p-sets were challenging and we learned the material thoroughly by completing them.\r\n\r\nI WISH THERE HAD BEEN AN OPTION TO PROGRAM USING PYTHON INSTEAD OF R.

The theory he covers in lectures can be a little dense and difficult at times, but he dedicates a good amount of time to talking about some really interesting applications. The problem sets were generally challenging, but not excessively so, and I liked that they focused primarily on implementing things in R rather than proving formulas. The heavy weighting of the problem sets was pretty nice too, because it encouraged me to really understand the material (and it meant that the midterm and quizzes were relatively low-stakes).

The problem sets can be tedious, and the material isn't always as mind-blowing as you might expect (of course, a lot of it is very cool, but it can also occasionally be a little repetitive or simple). But if you have a pre-existing desire to learn about ML, it is certainly worth taking. ",

The material spans from basic linear and logistic regressions, to tree-based methods, to image recognition and topic modeling. Lectures feature substantial mathematical theory behind the concepts, but the problem sets are mostly applied and really help you understand how each method is implemented. Professor Lafferty is good at explaining concepts in addition to theory, and is very willing to answer questions after class. Overall, it is a tough class (get started on the problem sets early) but the problem sets are interesting and doable (and account for most of the grade) and you learn to understand and apply many important topics.

The lectures are fantastic and easy to follow, the material is so cool, and you get to work on fun problems on the assignments. One example of a fun homework problem is that we implemented a machine learning algorithm to find embeddings of different music artists projected into a 2-dimensional space (this is called t-SNE) and then we could play with plotting the artists in the 2-d space to see who was similar to who. Once I submitted the assignment, I could have spent hours just playing around with the output to see whether certain pairs of artists are given similar embeddings. The lectures were also engaging.  Never in my four years at Yale have I found myself actively participating in a majority of the lectures until I took this class (and this says a lot because it was a 9:00 AM course). I was well prepared to take the course, so I really enjoyed it, but I am not sure if students without the prerequisites enjoyed it ",
            "\u00a0This class is not a good class. You leave lecture without much more than you came in with. Lafferty fails to give anything more than a brief glance at the theory behind the more involved ML methods. Whats more, his notation changes on a slide to slide basis, making it unnecessarily difficult to follow along. The problem sets are terribly organized and untested. Lafferty routinely makes large changes to problem sets after they are posted, often only a day or two before they are due. Yale is supposed to have wonderful professors. Sure, good professors don't always make good teachers, but students expect even bad teachers put time into planning their classes. This CLEARLY is not the case in Laffertys S&DS 365. I learnt what I needed to know for this class by reading the textbook and watching smart 13 year olds explain stuff on YouTube. This is not an exaggeration. I literally watched 13 year olds explain stuff because they do it better than Lafferty does.\r\n\r\ntl;dr Lafferty, while a highly credentialed researcher, doesnt seem to care about the quality of his teaching. If you want to learn anything more than the fact that Lafferty wears the same sneakers every day, youve come to the wrong place. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are interested and if you have some programming background. I would recommend an intro stat course with some R as the basic requirement. Otherwise, it is challenging but very interesting, and very much worth it, since machine learning is becoming more and more of an important tool in many research areas. ",
            "\u00a0A good introduction to ML from the statistical side -- this course focuses on the mathematical foundations and classical methods of machine learning. It's a good classic course, and Lafferty is a good professor but you won't be learning the stuff of the ML hype (conv nets, LSTMs and whatnot). R is a real pain. Overall pretty easy A given the emphasis on homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0As this was the first year this course was offered, there were numerous hiccups and issues. However, the material is interesting and Professor Lafferty is a competent lecturer. If you are interested in machine learning, there are not many other classes (as far as I know at least) that cover this material, so this might be your best bet. If the issues that existed this year, such as errors on the problem sets and issues with the grading/feedback system, are resolved, I would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about the forefront of statistical-computational methods. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend if Professor Lafferty is teaching it. He is a father of the field and has so much knowledge to share. The topics were wide-ranging and interesting. Much less theory and more practical applications and coding than other statistics classes have, which was a nice change of pace.\r\n\r\nSome of the problem sets had kinks which should be worked out by the next time the class is taught. Namely, they were designed for Python but had to be implemented in R, so a lot of them took far too long to run (longer than was practical in any sense), but the TAs just didn't know because they hadn't tried to run it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes learned a ton! "
