The biological issues discussed were actually very intriguing and made more interesting by the philosophical implications of their regulation. When I signed up for the class, I did not think there would be as much focus as there was over the actual biological knowledge behind the issues; however, the exams are manageable because the lectures thoroughly teach the material, and I'm actually glad I am able to speak about some of the topics with more familiarity.

Did a good job of relating the actual biology to contemporary issues.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The actual biology is incredibly jargon-laden. I think it's fair to assume most people taking this course are non-stem majors, so it makes it tough to follow concepts when there are so many acronyms. This problem was most evident in the later parts of the semester (RNAi, Genetic engineering, specifically) ",
            "\u00a0I would not improve this course -- it is already fantastic. I loved every lecture and learned very much in the process. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that they TAs and lecturers took the mid-semester feedback into account when considering how to have more effective review sessions. A weakness of this course was that the lecture material often filled with a lot of vocabulary/concepts that just weren't explained. The lecturers and TAs often expected for non-science majors to be able to latch on to information they had never been exposed to. Another weakness was that the sections weren't tailored to the material we needed to know for the exams whatsoever and they felt like a waste of time in my opinion. I never fully understood the material, I simply memorized it, and I can say the same for many students I've spoken with. ",
            "\u00a0It was frustrating at times to have no idea about section grades. Participation scores and reflection scores are hidden on Canvas, so it was hard to assess how well I was doing outside of lectures and exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think section is a real strength. It helps you engage a lot better with the material covered in lecture. I think the consistency of lectures could definitely be improved. Some lecturers expected way more depth and minutiae, while others didn't. It made course-wide expectations more unclear. ",
            "\u00a0This class is designed for students with limited science backgrounds, but it definitely did not feel like a basic biology class. It was a lot more science-heavy than I was expecting based on the course description. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the lectures were focused on individual problems. i liked that the tests were not cumulative (as each of these subjects / lectures were pretty all-encompassing); i would have liked to see a wider variety of topics covered. For example, I felt that some of the Englemann lectures focusing on basic cell bio were redundant when other professors recovered the same material as it related to their topic. I really like the cancer. genetic engineering, and pain  topics (though I do think Professor Paulsen definitely needed another lecture given how much material she covered over the nervous system). I didn't really think the Kuru lectures were relevant. I didn't think Poll Everywhere added anything to the class. I think it would have been interesting to have a lecture on vaccination. A really interesting lecture could have been over home remedies / essential oils --the bio or lack thereof behind these \"Pintrest\" treatments. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting set of issues in current Bio; however, I found the jumping from topic to topic to not really be in such a logical order, so studying for tests was quite scattered. ",
            "\u00a0It was just a science credit that I was taking because I had to. I think that if you want classes to be better, don't make it necessary for bs classes to exist so non-science majors can get a science credit for no real reason. ",
            "\u00a0The \"Experience Science\" section was a great supplement to the content learned in class, making the content accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The different speakers was a cool experience to have had, but sometimes switching from different learning methods through topics that could be difficult to understand was challenging and made learning harder. ",
            "\u00a0Some lecturers moved through material too fast ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good intro, but there was a big disparity between lecturers. Some were really good and easy to understandothers went lightning fast and I could not follow any of it. The workload is relatively light, but make no mistake, this class is /hard/. The exams are difficult and you actually have to do a good amount of studying the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course exposes students to a variety of topics by different professors who focus in on their specific lectures. Some material is review but much of it delves deeper into the applications of modern science. Lectures were fairly interesting and a good length, and I enjoyed the times we were able to interact during lectures. I think that sections weren't very beneficial as they would loosely relate to the lecture material but hardly prepared us for exams. I would recommend that the sections be more oriented to review the lecture material enough so that we are prepared to answer exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the course topics were interesting and relevant. The weaknesses included test questions that sometimes didnt reflect what we learned in class and some lectures that were far more confusing than others ",

            "\u00a0I wonder if there is a way to give this course greater unityor to balance it with the general acquaintance with issues in biology we are supposed to attain. \r\nIn any case, this course proved extremely interesting and it was very successful in its goals to help us become interested in and understand contemporary issues in biology ",

            "\u00a0They assumed that each student had more of a background in biology than I really did, so it was hard for me to understand concepts from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Although this is supposed to be a class for biology beginners, I felt the professors did not explain scientific terms or spoke too quickly so that it was really difficult to understand unless you had a biology background. ",

            "\u00a0This is a great course! I really liked how we went over a ton of issues with just hitting the highlights, since it was perfect for someone like me who wants to know a little bit about science but doesn't want to dive in very deeply. ",

            "\u00a0I liked this course a lot! I thought some of the lecturers were stronger than others. Mainly I think some were able to really synthesize complicated information in a really clear and comprehensive way whereas other lectures were more bogged down with jargon and complicated diagrams etc. But overall I thought this was a really cool course and felt as though I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It actually teaches you a surprising amount. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the professors lack ... social cognizance. We talked about genetic engineering for at least three lectures but the word 'eugenics' was never uttered once. There should be a lot more social consciousness. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the way this course allowed us to explore biology through the lens of ethics, and found the source material to be really interesting. If I had one suggestion for improvement, it sometimes felt as if it was difficult to know what to study for the tests  despite the existence of learning targets, I found that even if I studied all material relevant to the targets there would still be things that surprised me to see on the test. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were much more complex than others (i.e. neurotransmission, mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9) given the diverse range of backgrounds in biology enveloped in the student demographic, so maybe slow it down for those lectures. It was an very engaging discussion section that helped me to better understand course material as well as think about the social implications of the biology. ",
            "\u00a0Great professors who are experts in different subjects of biology, and are great teachers.  Nice section supplement that covers the connection between science and politics.  In terms of improvement, it would be great if section could do a brief recap of the lectures each week before delving into planned discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - wide variety of material means there is something for everyone. Lots of professors with different styles helps keep things fresh. Experimental section is super fun!\r\nWeakness - some professors are less engaging than others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: multiple lecturers from different backgrounds, and an array of interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the paper at the end of the term instead of a final exam and the fact that all 3 exams were not cumulative. It made it easier to focus and engage more deeply with the concepts. I think an improvement could be to make discussion sections more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- interesting lectures and readings. Weaknesses- the general course schedule did not prepare us well for exams as we never had to practice the scientific concepts until right before ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: it covers a wide range of topics, so it doesn't feel too specialized\r\nWeaknesses: it felt very bottom-heavy (second half seem paced much faster than the first) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  interesting subject matter \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  all of the lectures, or at least 80% of them, were not interesting and often very difficult to follow for someone without a biology background.  The test were extremely difficult, again, for someone without a biology background... I also just found it because the lectures were taught by different people, they were often disjointed and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Really loved section, some of the guest lecturers were a bit dry though. A bit too much \"Biology\" compared to \"The World and US\" ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its breadth. A main weakness is the inconsistency between professors, and that exams do not accurately reflect the focus on topics covered in class, instead focusing on things that were no really focused on in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: rotation of instructors keeps it interesting and allows each topic to be taught by the instructor who knows it best. Section is super chill, and the exams aren't cumulative so that's a big plus. The final paper is pretty straightforward too.\r\nWeaknesses: More exam prep would have been great -- which diagrams we need to know (since instructors would often display something for 30 seconds and tell us we didn't need to know how to draw it but it would show up on the exam), how long are answers should be, etc. ",
            "\u00a0-exams were sometimes difficult, required specific answers written one type of way and didn't accept alternative answers that could've also been right but were just worded differently, tested us on material in detail that we skimmed over in lecture \r\n-section felt very distant from lecture, the issues we discussed were interesting but only relevant to the final paper (not included in the exams at all)\r\n-lectures went really fast, not a lot of time for review\r\n-tried to cram too much material into such a short semester\r\n-falsely advertised as a non-STEM course but actually tested on a lot of science that we learned very quickly\r\n-to improve, i would hold more interactive review sessions, create review sheets with topics/sample or practice test questions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting topics and committed TAs who give a high level of personal assistance if asked!\r\nWeaknesses - the course is taught by different professors. While some went at a good pace and actually explained everything they were teaching, enabling us to learn, others went through their lectures with speedy jargon and difficult concepts that were not fully explained, leaving students to do a lot of learning and catching up on their own. Luckily, the TAs were very helpful. "

Some lecturers are more fun than others, but entering class unaware of who or what was being taught made coming to lecture every week a little more fun. Section was very fun, in that we only had to refer to lecture material to strengthen sociopolitical arguments. Talking about the societal impact of scientific breakthroughs made me think critically about my own conception of \"health\" and broader questions as they relate to the survival of the human race. ",
            "\u00a0Yup! This is a great science course for a humanities major. ",
            "\u00a0Sure! As someone whose bio teacher quit halfway through the year, this class helped me overcome a learning curve! Only if you're non-STEM should you take this though, it's absolutely redundant and unnecessary if you're any type of bio major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you've never taken a proper biology course like me. This will give you the background knowledge to be able to understand and think about current biological topics and their ethical, economic, political implications. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Good for non science people ",
            "\u00a0If the student was looking for a simpler science course that taught them about the applications of biology outside of the typical scope of biology textbook ;earning, I would recommend the course. It was challenging at times, but overall easy to follow. But, it also varies depending on your science background. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for any non-STEM student looking to fulfill a science credit.  Not only is it manageable, but it is interesting and very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0YES, especially if you are not a STEM major. I learned a lot of new biological concepts beyond what you would know in AP biology. I highly recommend the experimental section--we get to visit different scientific sites around campus, including the Cushing Brain collection, Botanical Gardens, and ",
            "\u00a0Yes - for non science majors this is a fairly basic but comprehensive class that covers an array of interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great class for humanities majors who need a science credit. Youre learning scientific concepts in lecture, but the sections are a place for discussing the ethical implications of the course material. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was a good science credit to take for students who do not necessarily want to major in a science. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great science credit for non majors ",
            "\u00a0Very good science credit ",
            "\u00a0Yes as an interesting class if they need a science credit ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this as a SC gutit was much more difficult than I anticipated or had heard from other students ",
            "\u00a0No, Regardless if youre taking this class for an easier science credit, or you were really interested in the modern implications of basic biology, I dont think youll get either of those things and less you have a strong background in biology. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! All this scientific information is really really helpful for just being an educated citizen. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this -- you learn a ton, and the workload is incredibly manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Not super gutty, but not hard. The workload comes in bursts, with 3 exams and a final paper. But it is pretty manageable and definitely not something you have to be highly engaged with every week. ",
            "\u00a0maybe (only to meet distributional requirement) ",
            "\u00a0Yes - very good, approachable level for a non-science person, while still allowing you to learn what felt like valuable and relevant content. "
