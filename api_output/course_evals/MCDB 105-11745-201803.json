You would spend all of class learning about the true biology and biological mechanisms of a topic and the test would ask the most irrelevant, unrelated questions.

All three responded to emails quickly and their answers were helpful. Tests were manageable and if you got behind it wasn't difficult to catch up.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Too many profs and no overall theme. Lectures got boring at times, but the material was easy enough to follow. ",

I was also in the Experience Science section which I loved a lot and thought was incredible. I think the review sessions could be improved upon before exams, and perhaps the exams could be changed so that rather than memorizing a lot of information, students needed to actually understand the general ideas that are presented in class. ",

This often gave people who took AP Biology an extreme advantage as these students found the class and the exams super easy. I think the exam questions should have been more open-ended and more focused on the social/ethical implications of Biology which is what the class is designed to teach. ",

Some of the topics were covered only superficially (for example, the mental health impacts of marijuana use). In those cases, none of the information presented went beyond common knowledge. ",

My favorite aspect of the course though was by far the professors. Professor Carlson was incredibly engaging and enthusiastic and really started the semester off with great energy. I didn't think that any professor could live up to him, but I was equally as impressed by Professors Koleske and Gendron. It was evident that all three were extremely passionate about both their areas of study but also about teaching undergrads. I mainly took this class as a science credit, but came out of it really feeling excited about science and a lot of these biological issues. I would say that there were no weaknesses. ",

All 3 of the lecturers were entertaining and funny and made classes interesting and worth going to. Course material was never too complicated and while the tests did require some time to prepare for, it was straight memorization. Concepts were all very interesting and sections led to pretty meaningful discussions. ",

            "\u00a0I think the quality of the TFs varies a lot from year to year. One friend told me last year that her TFs were great and that their review sessions for the exams were super helpful. However, this year the TFs were kind of a mess. The first review session in particular was absolutely useless - the TFs were inaudible, and what I could hear was not at all helpful. They got better as the semester went on. ",

            "\u00a0The course was not really focused on the social and political impacts of biology related issues. The syllabus very much pitched the course differently, but that was not the case. The exams were mostly testing memorization of the slides we went over in class, and not so much for understanding. This was very hard itself since the professors went over a lot of material in a 50 minute lecture. Furthermore, the lectures included very complex biological processes that we often just breezed over, benefitting those who had a strong biology background. My biggest problem with the course, however, was section. Section was completely unrelated to class and the exams, despite being mandatory. I really don't think I gained anything from section, but did end up more confused. \r\n\r\nThis being said, the professors are extremely charismatic and very willing to help you. They really try to make this class as fun as they can. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I think the material is very interesting especially for non-science majors looking for a fun science class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a great easy science credit. If you want to become more scientifically literate at a dinner-table conversation level then this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! lovely class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're non STEM this is perfect science credit in my opinion. Not because it's super easy, but because the material makes sense. At almost no point will you find yourself questioning why you're learning what you're learning because the professors go out of their way to make it applicable. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fun class. I'm not sure if I am more scientifically literate than I was before, but I certainly am more versed popular science. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you know how to memorize you can do well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to non science majors looking for an interesting and engaging science credit that isn't too time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good class for a general overview of scientific topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but the exams do not reflect the level of detail of the lectures and the answers for the exam demand far more understanding than the professors provided. "
