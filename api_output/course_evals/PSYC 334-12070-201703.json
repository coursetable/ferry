            "\u00a0This was a wonderful course that allowed me to learn about various types of psychopathology. All of the instructors are wonderful and very distinguished in their fields. I enjoyed how there were different speakers almost every week with different specialities. The course made me more eager to study developmental psychopathology. ",
            "\u00a0Very practical course ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various psychological disorders and how they are treated in children. I also learned how to develop and extensive research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insights regarding different psychopathological disorders of children from such a wide variety of professionals each specialising in different disorders, which was really rewarding learning from their hands-on experience. The course also provided us with opportunities to be involved in a research lab to learn about how knowledge is applied practically in real life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The professors are very kind and knowledgeable about their work. The practicuum aspect was really cool. There was a vast range of developmental psychopathology covered. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is not structured enough. The lectures, since they are from numerous lecturers, are not cohesive...it is hard to draw main themes/takeaways from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The final paper expectations are high given the lack of instructor support and guidance. The speakers coming in had no idea what level to lecture to. Sometimes they way over our heads and sometimes it was like they were lecturing to middle schoolers ",
            "\u00a0I think more structure to the class would improve it tremendously. More assignments throughout the term and more feedback from professors would make the final paper more effective and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Volkmar is awesome! ",
            "\u00a0I loved how we got to learn about each disorder from a professional in the field. I didnt love the lack of discussion aspect to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured in a way that we could comprehensively learn about different psychological disorders of children. The course is also very flexible and provides us with a lot of room to research on what we are interested in for our assignments. It would be great if the course could include more assessments in between, and more feedback could be given prior to our final paper submission. ",

            "\u00a0If you are a student who is self-motivated, enjoys loosely structured courses, and is interested in developmental psychopathology in general (surface-level), this course is for you. \r\n\r\nIf you have trouble being in charge of your own deadlines/keeping yourself accountable, it might be difficult to bring yourself to class every week and complete the assignments on time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student -- but only if they are genuinely interested in psychology and/or developmental disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, solid class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are incredibly interesting, but communication and feedback from professors is definitely lacking. I definitely learned a lot about the subject, and I would recommend to another student with the warning that there is little structure to the class (which is stressful) and that the final grade is entirely based on the term paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was really interesting and I learned a lot about various disorders. Its incredibly low workload since theres basically no readings and the only assignment is one long essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are interested in knowing more about psychological disorders that are related to children. The course includes so much developmental disorders and each lecture, given by professional of that particular disorder, was intellectually enriching. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were cool and the opportunity to do a practicum was really awesome! I'd recommend! "
