The pace the material was covered at was fair, but the professor was not particularly helpful if you had trouble/ weren't following everything completely. The midterm was of fair difficulty but poorly timed (too long). The final was far beyond what should have been expected after this course. It barely touched on much of what we learned, presented materials in completely new and confusing ways, and had some problems so difficult that the professor felt the need to give a hint mid-exam because it was so difficult.

The teacher was clearly very passionate about the subject, and he taught every lesson clearly and effectively; having never taken linear algebra before, I had a very positive experience with the professor in the classroom. A weakness of the lesson would be that not much time is invested in exploring complex applications, such as Fourier transforms; I would have loved to study them in the classroom from a linear algebra context. ",

The professor was very confusing in class. The textbook was horrific and possibly the most confusing thing I have ever read. The classroom in Watson that this class was located was not suited for MATH 222 and the class should be relocated. The curve on this class is abysmal for no reason other than the math department wants to discourage students in every way possible. Some of the problem sets would take 10+ hours for literally no reason other than the professor blindly picked out a handful of problems without even thinking how long they would take or if they were even helpful (they were not). The exams were complete tricks in every way. These are just some of the many horrible things about this class but I could go on. ",

I found the lectures to be quite useful, and usually they provided all of the conceptual introduction and equation familiarity I needed to complete problem sets. However, I do think that it's important to note that many students simply read sections of the textbook, and thus never needed to (or did) attend lectures. Whether this speaks to the quality of the textbook (Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang) is quite good, or the instruction, I don't know. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is that, in attending study halls, I've met a fair number of students who seemed to have very little idea understanding of the concepts they covered or the operations (on P-sets) that they performed\r\n\r\nI think that it might be worthwhile to look into how undergraduates structure their study for MATH 222. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job teaching how to manipulate matrices but does little to nothing to explain why these matrix manipulations are practical, making the entire course material seem useless. Also, the exams are completely unrepresentative of the material on the problem sets, making practicing for them extremely difficult, not to mention making them an unreasonable test of our knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is fine if you're an engineering major or if your major is not directly math related. The course focuses on processes and less on theory (though we did some elementary proofs). As a potential applied math/stats major, I regret taking this instead of 225 and I don't really feel like I have a solid foundation for higher level courses without doing some further reading. I wish there was more of an emphasis on understanding concepts instead in class. I felt that some of the problem sets were also unnecessarily long and repetitive. We also don't focus that much on applications. "

If you are at all interested in math and are willing to struggle more then take 225, I've heard it's a more rewarding course. ",

Everything about this course was done so poorly, I am not even sure where to begin to fix it. There were no answer keys to anything posted, and the answer keys to the practice exam for the midterm and final only had very not helpful numeric answers and no explanations or walkthroughs. The professor was very confusing in class but there were no class notes posted to clarify anything. The textbook was horrific and possibly the most confusing thing I have ever read. The classroom in Watson that this class was located was not suited for MATH 222 and the class should be relocated.

Some of the problem sets would take 10+ hours for literally no reason other than the professor blindly picked out a handful of problems without even thinking how long they would take or if they were even helpful (they were not).

These are just some of the many horrible things about this class but I could go on. If anyone tells you that this class is great, they are most likely rich, white males who learned linear algebra in high school and thought this class was *cute.* But for people who are learning this for the first time, it is nearly impossible to do well. It's a true wonder why the math department/math majors have very few women/POC? Anyways, don't take this class unless you absolutely have to, Credit/D it if you can, and pray to whoever you believe in that you can pass because many students didn't. Not sure how it's humanely possible to get an A in this course unless you've learned linear algebra before but even still, it seems impossible. Good luck and I have never been so happy to have ever been done with a class so quickly in my life. This class makes MATH 120 look like a 5 star course. ",

I've been told that what we learn in this class should be very applicable but I really don't know to what, and I don't see how I can really apply what I learned in this class because I feel like the explanation behind why we learned decompositions or the importance behind certain properties was not well-explained.

I would say if this is you, think carefully about how much time and effort you're willing to put into the class, because unless you're fully engaged (attending lecture, reading the textbook, completing the psets, etc.) you're not going to get anything out of the class. It is a really cool math class in how everything kinda fits together at the end, but as someone who isn't in love with math it was more something I needed to take for my degree than something I was passionate about, although I did find it fascinating at times.

They're right; for the most part, it is.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would only recommend this class with the caveat that MATH 222 may not take up as little time as students may think. At least as Professor Yang taught it, the length of problem sets would vary dramatically from week to week (think 10 versus 25 multi-part, many-operation math questions). Worse is that he would often perform these variations with little notice.\r\n\r\nSo, students hoping to see some (though from what I've heard, FAR less) of Linear Algebra should take MATH 222.
