            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ethnography as a field and about how scholars have written about Latinx people in ethnography specifically. I also learned about the different kinds of ethnographic projects  that academics pursue and how to understand a scholar's findings in relation to their methods. ",
            "\u00a0Ethnographic analysis tools with an emphasis on Latinx scholars implementation and adaption of them ",
            "\u00a0Prior to the course, I really had no idea what ethnography meant. Through the course, I learned how powerful ethnography could be as a method and learned so much through my final project not just about the topic, but about myself. Ethnography demands a self-awareness of your positionality that I have not experienced in other classes and absolutely loved going through this process. This is also one of the first times that I've been forced to undergo a project through I had to interview people, and meet others. It was a great experience. \r\n\r\nI could also tell that my writing improved tremendously from the weekly writing responses. This was the first semester that I've had weekly one page (single spaced) reading responses (in three classes), and though it was really difficult, my writing improved a lot from the constant practice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what ethnography really is and how useful it can be in various areas of academia and my own life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the ethnographic method in research and how different it can look. I also learned the valued and importance of using ethnography when it come to the Latinx narrative, and communities of color generally. ",
            "\u00a0More understanding of basic ethnographic methodology and theory, specifically as it relates to Latinx studies ",
            "\u00a0This was the first anthropology class I have taken (even though weirdly its not explicitly listed as one) so I learnt a lot about the field, various ethnographers, and the format of ethnography in general. Our weekly reading responses really forced us to engage with the wide variety of readings we did, and our two longer papers were also self motivated--the first being an ethnographic memoir of sorts, and the second a self-chosen research paper. This class focused heavily on the experience of Latinx populations in urban centers within the U.S. as well as along the U.S.-Mexico border, allowing for some familiarity with specific major topics in ethnography, as well as a really thorough understandings of the various branches of anthropology, and functions of ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ethnographic methods in this class, specifically in regards to Latinx communities. I learned that there are valid ways to research and do work in communities like mine. "

            "\u00a0This course is strong because Professor Ramos-Zayas is incredible. She knows a lot about ethnography and much more about Latinx studies specifically. Professor Ramos-Zayas is also excellent at making her knowledge comprehensible and digestable for students and is unafraid to answer questions. A weakness of this course, I would say, is the reading load every week. While I absolutely loved reading the materials that Professor Ramos-Zayas assigned, at times it was overwhelming. Sometimes I found myself skimming everything, in preparation for my reading response, rather than digesting and really absorbing a couple of readings very well. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were great!! ",
            "\u00a0I felt the strongest part of the course to definitely be Professor Ramos Zayas as a discussion facilitator and the amazing readings she assigned on the syllabus. Getting to know her as my DUS and experience a class with her was great. Some weeks, however, I felt that it was painfully obvious that very few people in the class did much of the reading (myself included), and the discussion was rather stagnant at times, but the class was a great experience, particularly towards the end of the semester. Another strength was the vulnerability that the course demanded of everyone involved with the class, and even though I am not particularly close to any of my classmates, I always felt comfortable talking to them at the beginning or end of classes. \r\n\r\nOne thing I would change is the visit to the Beinecke. Though the Beinecke is amazing and valuable experience, I did not gain a lot from this particular interaction. I feel that a reading response that requires that we access the archives at one of the libraries on campus might be more useful and allot more class time for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings were amazing and probably one of the strengths of this course. I do wish that we had more time to discuss the longer works we did read, however, I understand that that would cut into the time we dedicated to the other great readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it discusses various aspects of Latinidad through different ethnographic methods, giving students a good idea of the flexibility and strengths of using this research method. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- loved the overall reviews of ethnography/theory\r\nWeaknesses-- the discussions were really lacking. Needs to be more structured ",
            "\u00a0The readings in this course were AMAZING, so interesting, varied, and great. However, I feel like our in class discussion of them sometimes fell kind of flat. I don't think this was really because of material as much as the classroom environment---it's a long seminar and people would frequently get distracted and be on their laptops. I also think that given we were discussing such sensitive topics its really important to cultivate a sense of community/trust in the classroom space that for some reason I felt was kind of lacking. Because of this I think people were more hesitant to share their thoughts. I also wonder if having students drive the discussion a little more would have helped cultivate conversation, or breaking into smaller groups to talk, and/or moving the lecture sections of the class towards the end of the period as opposed to having it at the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0There was always new information in the course and always discussions to be had. I wish we had more time to discuss in groups. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This is an excellent Introduction and Ethnography and Introduction to Latinx studies class. The reading lot is overwhelming at times, but everything we read is engaging, interesting, and intellectually stimulating. Professor Ramos-Zayas is also a gem. She has so much knowledge and is always prepared to share with her students. I would, however, say that, as DUS of ER&M, Professor Ramos-Zayas is very busy, such that it can sometimes feel like this class is another thing on a long list of things she has to get down as a leader in the department. Nonetheless, I recommend this class completely. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely take if you are looking into doing ethnographic work for your senior thesis! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You'll learn so much about yourself through ethnography and Ana Ramos Zayas is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in ethnographic methods and/or Latinx studies! ",
            "\u00a0I would, especially to other Latinx students who are looking for a class where they can see their own subjectivities and identities reflected by a course's materials and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0MY FAVORITE CLASS AT YALE HANDS-DOWN! Aside from the incredible topics discussed in class, Professor Ramos-Zayas is an amazing professor; no one should graduate and not take a class with her! ",
            "\u00a0Not really. I felt like the discusssions weren't very fruitful, and it didn't feel that fulfilling as a seminar ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because the material is so wonderful and important. Prof Ramos-Zayas is also so knowledgeable about the subject, has written amazing books on it, and is actually really approachable if you sign up for her office hours! Do keep in mind that it has a pretty heavy reading load though and weekly response papers that require you to address EVERY text assigned, so you really have to be doing all the reading---but its worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Ramos-Zayas is an amazing instructor and she cares deeply about the work she does. It was such an honor to read her book and discuss it in class. Her class brings validity to the respectful study of Latinx populations and that is desperately needed. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I learned a lot and the class discussion was very insightful -- I would recommend that you do not procrastinate on the final paper and that you seek individual help/guidance from the T.A. since the assignment is very open-ended. Otherwise, it was a nice class! "
