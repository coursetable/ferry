However, the class was still very interesting and I appreciated its focus on specific applications of the concepts. The use of the last few lectures to discuss HIV and its treatments based on the methods we just learned was very effective and made the class worthwhile.

            "\u00a0A major strength is the professor and the strong communication amongst him, Professor Lin, and all the TAs. A weakness would be the sheer amount of material covered - it did not lend itself to learn but rather memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor was a great lecturer and was very engaging throughout. The quizzes were geared towards what we learned in lecture and it really forced students to stay on top of the lecture and not fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is the weekly quizzes which force you to be constantly reviewing the considerable amount of material we cover, so that you aren't cramming everything at the last minute for the final.  The pace was pretty good, and enrichment was helpful, as someone who's never taken AP Bio.  There were a couple instances when material needed for the Wednesday homework was not covered until Monday class which made it difficult to complete in time. ",
            "\u00a0I highly disagree with the structure of how the course is taught in blocks. Biology isnt simply divided into 4 categories that can be taught in isolated blocks that are stacked on top of each other. Instead it should be interwoven for people to learn how biology. Further, I believe there should be more than one biology track like in the chemistry. I didnt l learn anything until lecture 8 or 9 which made it difficult for me to be engaged. I love biology and would have loved to be in a rigorous course that I would have learned a lot in. For someone with no background however this course is great and the learning curve would not be great. ",
            "\u00a0I like how we had weekly quizzes to encourage us to keep up on lecture content, and I like how we were tested more on lecture content than readings because it made showing up to lectures feel necessary. However, I dont think that this was the best course to introduce someone to bio. I already took AP in high school and feel like I didnt learn much new content, except for excessive detail in lab science. The quizzes ere more focused on lab methods and data interpretation than biological concepts, and those quizzes were not graded with much leniency. The course felt more like intro to molecular biology lab than intro to biology, and I feel like it was designed to push students toward doing research rather than just learning biology. The organization of it was good, but the content focus was questionable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very boring but also moves at an extremely fast pace. There was also too much reading straight from the slides, which made it harder to stay engaged in class. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was very clear and a great lecturer.I also highly enjoyed having section as it cleared up many confusions I had with material presented in class.\r\n I felt that timing on quizzes was a little short. Additionally, I would prefer if enrichment sections were available to more students or if there could be more peer tutors/ peer tutor hours. ",

It showed students what it was like to do \"real science\" in a way most intro courses don't. At the same time, however, there were frequently questions on assessments (quizzes in particular) that felt unfair or poorly written. Frankly, it seemed at times on the quizzes that the professors tried hard to create a challenging quiz to the point where the questions no longer even reflected true understanding of content so much as who can reason the fastest in the 15 minutes allotted per quiz. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Although they were a lot of work to prepare for, the weekly quizzes ensured that I kept up with the work in this class and the knowledge learned. Also the professors were very approachable, and Piazza was a great tool for asking questions. Also, I liked that the slides were posted online.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes, the lectures just felt very fast, but it was definitely still manageable. Also enrichment seats were limited and you could not drop in for lectures you felt you might need extra help on. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor\r\nWeakness: some odd questions on assessments ",
            "\u00a0It felt like Professor Koleske simply read off the slides which could have been more in-depth in the first place so I wish he would use more colloquial language when explaining the more confusing topics by trying to use slides more as a template for study as opposed to how to teach what the textbook says. ",
            "\u00a0The class is way too big so it is difficult to stay engaged and awake. The discussion sections helped, but it'd be better if class time could made more effective by being smaller. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely think that this course did a good job in discussing all of the material in a clear and simple but accurate way; I only ever felt confused about certain concepts  occasionally throughout the course, but there are so many resources like peer tutors and Piazza that definitely help whenever a student has any questions. I also liked the fact that there were study guides for every lecture that highlighted the key concepts and terms that we should have taken away from each lecture. I also liked the practice problems that were posted for every lecture, because they helped me with knowing the general types of questions that could be asked regarding the material in a particular lecture. One weakness would be the amount of time that it took for us to receive our grades for quizzes and homework. It would always take at least a week to get the grades back, and I thought that it was difficult to gauge whether or not you needed to change your study habits because we wouldn't get the feedback back until after we had already taken the next quiz or submitted the next homework assignment. I think that the teaching fellows should be required to post our homework and quiz grades on canvas by the end of the week after submitting the assignment or taking the quiz, so we can see how we did and we can decide if our study habits and the ways we approach the assignments need to change before we take another quiz or submit another assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized; study guides that were provided helped a lot, as well as the lecture slides. By the end though, I realized that it actually helped me more not to print out the lecture slides since it allowed me to process more while taking notes on everything rather than just what wasn't in the slides. ",
            "\u00a0strengths was the pace of the course and the context. The weaknesses would be there should be more interaction with the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it provided the resources for people of all different sorts of backgrounds to succeed in the class. For some students who are struggling a bit more or have less of a biology background, Enrichment was helpful for reinforcing information. For those who already took classes like AP Biology in high school, this class served as both a review for the different concepts as well as an extension that goes deeper in a few topics, like HIV. As such, this class doesn't feel too difficult or too boring, regardless of which student takes the class. The use of Piazza also allows the shy students to ask questions at all times, even the night before an assessment, and the TFs and professors always respond at extremely fast rates to help untangle misunderstandings and confusion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was very well structured. However, when learning research techniques it was hard to learn them from a slide. If introductory biology lab could be made in future years I think it would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you plenty of resources to understand the material.  There are multiple ways to interact with the material through resources on canvas, but Dr. Lin and the peer tutors are extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Well designed, but too many people. The discussion sections didn't help very much in terms of solidifying understanding of material. Lecture slide info was very well organized. But, quizzes were graded weirdly and often docked off points in unfair ways. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that there is a lot of help for students that may need extra help understanding the concepts. A weakness is that students come from very different backgrounds in their knowledge of biology so the class may be harder for students who have not taken AP Biology. The the weekly quizzes force you to study the material until you fully grasp the concepts. ",

I like that the discussion sections are not simply places for review, as they are in many other classes; instead, we dive deeper into the material and take part in interactive activities that are pretty fun. However, the sections that were run as journal clubs were a bit frustrating, because they basically just ran through the correct answers of the homework which was already due that week. I do understand that making that homework due before section ensures that everyone has actually read the paper, but I still think that things could be done a bit better with the journal club sections.

An improvement I would suggest is a quicker turnaround time for releasing quiz scores/answer keys. It was difficult to know if you had to change your study habits/what you were struggling with when it took so long for us to get our work back. I thought the questions on the final were a bit nuanced, and I think that was unhelpful in testing how much of the material I knew. ",

Professor Koleske was a very engaging and interesting lecturer, even when some of the content being taught was relatively basic. He made sure to circle the concepts back to practical applications at all available moments, which was very effective. Likewise, Professor Lin was very receptive and helpful in answering questions.\r\n\r\nThe class just had a few weaknesses that can be improved upon with small fixes. First, the seemingly keyword-based grading system occasionally led to grading that did not actually reflect the content of answers. Just for example, I lost a point on a quiz after using the word \"hydrophobic\" in my answer several times, but did not use the specific phrase \"hydrophobic interactions.\" Of course, this is not at all a huge deal, but it can be discouraging to lose points more often on technicalities than for the sake of learning the correct answers. The only other shortcoming I felt in this class was having to attend mandatory discussion sections. Of course, I appreciate having the option of going to a section to learn more, but the sections in Biology 101 were a bit drawn out and simplified so that they were useful to some students but less so for others. Making these optional, in my opinion, would be equally as effective. ",

The course is well-organized and does a great job teaching the concepts and then making sure students can then apply those concepts. The additional files and study guides were also very helpful. I think the Monday quizzes would be more effective if they were done outside of class. I would study hard for those quizzes but always had trouble with the application questions. I think take-home quizzes would still force us to learn the material and to apply it but would be better for grades. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of the course is the enrichment offer that is offered to underprepared students for biology. At the same time the fact that the course assumes preparation in biology is one of its greatest weaknesses. Unfortunately, Yale is not the place it was before. With the inclusion of low income students, there comes the need to better adapt classes for students whose preparation is not remotely close to that of high income students who come from private schools. I think it would be extremely beneficial if enrichment was offered more than once a week. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that there are many opportunities to work towards the grade you want. I really like the style of having multiple graded things due each week: a quiz and a homework. Multiple quizzes instead of two huge tests. This is the best way to decrease stress in a class. Also the ability to drop your lowest grade from each grading category was very helpful in making biology 101 a learning experience rather than a weed out experience. However, I am not saying that this class is not a weed out. It certainly is. The way that they water down everything. For example they would say \"certain chemical group\" instead of functional group as we have all learned it. It almost seems intentional the way they oversimplify concepts to confuse us and mess with how we learned it in the past. The quizzes are way too stressful, and they rely on memorization. There are pointless questions on exams that are clearly meant to create a distribution within the class to \"get\" people and make sure that not everybody is getting that 100. I can't complain because I figured out this course early on. As in, I figured out that it was a weed out class, so I did pretty well. ",

            "\u00a0Yes; it isn't always the most exciting course, but it certainly is helpful (especially for bio majors or other pre-med candidates). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'm biased because I love biology, but I think biochemistry and biophysics are fascinating. Koleske did an amazing job making the class engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student wither if they have an interest in biology or if they are going to have to take the BIO sequence for a major requirement. ",
            "\u00a0This a pretty good intro course for bio but it was unfortunate that many people who already have strong foundations in bio were taking the same course as though who didnt. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. It is very well organized and interesting all the way through. Although the weekly quizzes can seem stressful at first, when the final came I felt really prepared since I had already studied all the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I liked it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I thoroughly enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I've heard varying things about the bio modules depending on when you take them, but I had a wonderful time learning from Professor Koleske and Professor Lin. They were always conscientious of how the students were doing, and continued to make clear efforts to keep the class light and enjoyable despite the hefty amount of material being covered. ",
            "\u00a0It's required, so yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. A lot of students take it because it is a requirement for their major or to take upper level courses, but it is also a very interesting introductory course on its own. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if genuinely interested in biology or need to fulfill prereq. ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement for many majors and premed, and it can be engaging and rewarding if you get past past the annoyance of all of the memorization. The material was interesting, I really enjoyed applying our knowledge to exploring HIV/AIDS at the ending, and this is one of those courses that you can get as much from as you put in. So yes, if you have to take it or are interested in biology ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course as there is a lot of interesting biology material covered in this course, albeit a little quickly. ",
            "\u00a0While I am sure that many take this course to satisfy their major or pre-med requirements, it is actually a very engaging course. Professor Koleske teaches lectures in a way that is interesting and makes the material easy to learn. I would recommend this course not only for people interested going into a field related to biology, but also for anyone genuinely interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very solid intro to biochemistry. Anyone in need of an SC where they actually learn something would benefit from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is a great introduciton to bio concepts ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to any students interested in science and its relation to life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for those going into the science field. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, super interesting and important intro to biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yea ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty standard intro course. It was effective in teaching the basic material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in/wants to learn intro biology skills ",
            "\u00a0yes, helps you to learn how to apply what you have learned in biology in a real-life setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a terrific introductory science course. The abundant resources make the course manageable for individuals with any level of past science experience. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to. I don't think I would recommend this class to someone looking for a science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Koleske was hilarious and passionate which made the class experience thoroughly enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is a requirement for so many of Yale's science majors. However, after the placement test, I could have placed out of Biology 101, but I still took the course. If I could go back and change my choice, I would probably skip the class and take a more advanced course. For what it was worth, nevertheless, the professors were effective and the content was taught clearly in a practical manner. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great introductory class for anyone. Its concepts are fascinating, and you don't need to be a science major or pre-med to appreciate the material. The lectures are engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Assuming that the student has a reasonable preparation in biology I would recommend the course to another student. If not I'd recommend familiarizing oneself with basic concepts at least before considering taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not something that you \"recommend\" to other students because it is a pre-med requirement and it seems as if everybody in that class is a pre-med. I would take it because it is required for many majors and medical school. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in Biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is not your traditional intro bio course. ",
            "\u00a0I found it mainly worthwhile simply because it is a prerequisite for further courses. I generally do not learn well in large lectures so I had very low expectations for this course. Overall I found the course to be fulfilling, but I do not hold it up to the same standards in which I regard the seminars I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The course is understandable for people with any level of background in biology. The course content is immensely practical if you plan on trying your hand at biological research as an undergraduate. The lectures are easy to follow and it easy to access help when you feel stuck. "
