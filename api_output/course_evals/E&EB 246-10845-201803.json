            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the phylogeny of plants, their impact and importance in the world, and how to identify different species. Sometimes we went more in-depth in certain topics like photosynthesis, biogeography, and the history of botany. ",
            "\u00a0I learned alot about plant phylogenies. ",
            "\u00a0A general survey of plant diversity. This is mostly a survey course of the phylogeny of plants, with several lectures sprinkled in about pollination, neat trends, and other interesting topics. Tests are mostly memorization, but that is most of the work in the class. This class will leave you with \"opened eyes\" to the world of plants. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong knowledge base about plants and phylogeny. ",
            "\u00a0You'll work a lot with phylogenetic trees in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned most of the top-level plant phylogenetic tree, as well as a lot about phylogenetics, evolutionary biology, plant biology, biodiversity, and \"tree-thinking.\" ",
            "\u00a0Plants! ",
            "\u00a0A basic understanding of plant phylogeny and evolution. We went over a number of major plant clades, as well as covering topics such as plant structure and function, interactions between different species and the environment, and evolution of form and function in different species. ",
            "\u00a0Going into the course with little knowledge about plant biology, evolution, and diversity, I learned a great amount. The main focus of the class was describing major plant groups and characteristics, with some focus on the evolution of mechanisms, pollinators, and distribution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about plant in general and the way their major traits have evolved over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about plants and phylogeny!! I don't have a ton of biology, or specifically, evolutionary biology, experience, so I really wasn't aware of a lot of the simple phylogenetic stuff we learned in this class. We learned how to phylogenies are determined -- I had no idea how contested they are and how much we still have to figure out. Also, I now basically know an overview of all of plant evolution, which is insane. I was just walking around today and looking at and trying to identify plant groups or structures as I walked by them and realized that I learned so so much from this class. Learning about plants also definitely gave me a greater appreciation for them and only made me want to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent overview of the entirety of plant evolution from the earliest plants to major clades of angiosperms. You learn about basic plant function and distinguishing traits. You also become familiar with fundamental principles of evolution that are applicable across the filed. Overall, this class makes you stop and stare at (and maybe even start dissecting) plants you come across every single day. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify plants based on their characteristics and place them into proper phylogenies. This course was mainly focused on the evolution of plant lineages as well as specific characteristics of each of the subfamilies. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about plants! I genuinely thought I knew a lot before I took this class but I was wrong. From plant evolutionary to morphology, phylogeny, and interspecies relationships, I came out of this class with a vast toolkit of terms and concepts with which to see the world. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of the phylogeny of all major plant groups and plant physiology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about plants!!! In particular we covered special morphological characteristics of different major and minor groups, how they are related, and some notable members! I also learned how to better understand phylogenetic relationships and research about those. We also got an introduction into different themes about plant evolution. It was cool to move all the way through the history /across the living tree of plant diversity, from green algae, to the lycophytes and bryophytes, to seed plants and angiosperms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned generally how all plants are related to eachother, how certain traits evolved and changed over time, how plants express certain syndromes based on their pollenaters, dispersers, lifestyles, life history strategies, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class completely changed the way I look at the world around me by teaching the fundamentals of plant physiology and how much of the plant families evolved and are related. Starting from the earliest plants and completing an overview of all major plant families made me understand how botany works and how much is still to be discovered. ",
            "\u00a0A ton. I learned how to identify plants of all kinds, so that when I walk down the street now I notice leaf arrangement, flower morphology, and can make educated guesses about what clade those plants came from. It's so exciting to know the story of how plants evolved because it is directly related to how all of life co-evolved. ",
            "\u00a0Things I learned about:\r\n-plant families that are important (economically, scientifically, geographically, etc.), notable examples of plants in each family, distinguishing characteristics of each family\r\n-the history of the field of botany with respect to phylogenetics\r\n-Viburnum\r\n-relevant anatomical/other vocabulary\r\n-that Professor Donoghue is the world's expert on Viburnum "

            "\u00a0Could be improved by narrowing content. No idea how, but the volume made the points rather diffuse. Don't get me wrong, it was super well taught, really engaging, wonderful slide shows that proved to be an awesome resource, but at a certain point, the number of species and characters and details went from interesting to kind of a confusing soup. To be fair. There are a lot of plants out there. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very engaging course and I learned a lot. There's a lot of different aspects of the class throughout the year that make it very engaging, like the hands-on lab, a short paper about any plant clade of your choice, and a plant collection that you get to make. It was a pretty light workload and the exams were comparable to those of other courses. It was a lot of memorizing, and I don't think I would have done well if I did not already have a background in biology.\r\nI wish there had been some study guides to help for exams since there was a lot of information and phylogenetic trees to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I don't really see a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0This class is both interesting and relevant to a part of our world that is often overlooked. You will leave with a new appreciation for the plant world around you. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong! Enjoyed the class lots and made not-easy material accessible to students. It is intense, though. Be warned. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really phenomenal. Professor Donoghue is kind and helpful and an engaging lecturer, and he genuinely wants you to become a botanist, either professionally or just in your everyday life as an additional part of some other career. The tests are not easy, but appropriately challenging and fair to the material covered. I also really appreciated that the steady progression through the plant phylogenetic tree was interspersed with broader plant concepts like insectivory, pollination, and biogeography. No weakness, truly an excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0Great teaching and lecture. More class engagement would be nice! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe class offers a fairly comprehensive overview of the subject.\r\nProf Donoghue is a good, clear lecturer.\r\nMany of the topics are interesting.\r\nThe clade paper improves the class by encouraging students to learn about one group of plants in more depth.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWhile I understand the purpose of trying to cover all the major plant groups, it might have been interesting to spend less time on this and more time on topics beyond the basic phylogeny (eg, aspects of plant structure, genetics, or ecology).\r\nThe textbook is not very necessary for the class.\r\nSeveral lectures are spent on covering very basic topics about phylogeny. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly interesting content (I thought) that was presented expertly by a really enthusiastic professor. Hard enough to keep you engaged but not impossible to feel like you've learned a lot. Can't really think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were a lot of information; studying all of plants is a tall order, and thus class could be a bit disorganized. Professor Donoghue was an engaging lecturer and incredibly accomplished in his field, and I greatly enjoyed his anecdotes. Having all of the major assignments (paper, final, and lab final) at the end of the semester was a  bit much, and I would have preferred to have them more spread out (i.e. paper earlier in the semester, and lab final during the last lab of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was interesting but it was difficult to memorize all the names of the major plant families, especially given how similar many of the names are. ",
            "\u00a0I take issue with the whole point of the course  a review of literally all the plants. I feel like a better class would spend much more time on the major evolutionary changes throughout plants' life history and was less on literally just listing clades. I feel I learned the most from lectures like Erika Edwards' on photosynthesis or the later ones on herbivory and plant defenses and the least from going over all the big families in the rosids. ",
            "\u00a0Michael is AMAZING. He is one of my favorite professors I've had at Yale. He is so accomplished, but the most approachable, kind, down-to-earth person ever. The class pairs perfectly with the lab and together you just learn so much it's incredible. Only weakness I would say is that sometimes an hour and fifteen minutes can feel a bit long for lecture, and also, I wish that the weather didn't prevent our second field trip! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fascinating subject matter, easily accessible material to anyone interested in plants, Prof.Donoghue is a great lecturer and has wonderful stories to tell about a lifetime full of plant adventures. However, the highlight by far is the associated lab. Very manageable workload throughout the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: The hour-fifteen minute lecture was a bit difficult for me. I would prefer 3 fifty-minute classes. The tests are entirely memorization based, you must be able to regurgitate the information on the slides. I found it difficult to retain information about the specific plant families. ",
            "\u00a0The class material is very interesting and the teacher is super engaging, and cares a lot about the subject. This elicited a lot of positive response to the class and made it very enjoyable. That being said, the tests required immense preparation and sometimes that was not even enough as there was simply so much material and the concepts asked about on the tests were both broad overarching themes as well as specific details. That made the tests very difficult to prepare for, and as that was a large portion of the grade, made the class slightly stressful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredible in the vast amount of content it's able to fit into a semester, in inspiring and fun ways thanks to Michael's engaging teaching style and passion for the subject. The only downside is that there is so much material to memorize. If there was some better way to help facilitate this vast amount of memorization--whether that be through quizzes or some other checkpoint method--maybe this wouldn't be so daunting when studying for exams. ",
            "\u00a0Requiring that the lab is taken with the lecture is essential. ",
            "\u00a0This course is seriously amazing, and while I was worried about also taking the associated lab, it ended up being the best part of the class. Michael is an incredible lecturer and will definitely change your attitude towards plants. By the end you are able to identify all major plant families based on key characteristics and gain a solid base of plant physiology knowledge. The lectures are kept interesting by lots of examples/cool facts/research findings. This is NOT a gut though - the exams require a fair bit of memorization but are fair if you study a couple of days in advance. Please please please take this course and you will not regret it! ",
            "\u00a0All strengths. Lectures were fun and jam-packed full of content, well-organized, and assignments were totally reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There was no daily homework but I stilled learned an insanely large amount! Lectures were fascinating and field trips were fun. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a rigorous science course, taught by an expert in the field, that is still accessible and engaging for people of all experience levels. Professor Donoghue is extremely patient and teaches the basic science principles needed to understand the material, while also imparting a comprehensive and thorough review of the subject to his students. The lectures can sometimes be a little monotonous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lab, with amazing food and a relaxed atmosphere, and the lecture slides that are posted before each class on Canvas for great note taking. Weakness is the heavy memorization required for exams, you have to absorb a lot of knowledge about plant groups and it's hard to know what will be covered on the test. ",
            "\u00a0The only aspect of the course I felt was lacking was integrating some recent genetic work into the class. The small amount of time we spent talking about the role of Cyc genes in flower symmetry was super interesting, and having more connections between morphology and genetics in the course would have been cool.\r\n\r\nOther than that, great course - tons of information about all major plant families, extremely engaging lectures, lab was fun, exams were difficult but not too difficult. "

        [
            "\u00a0Highly, highly recommend it. Great teaching. For people who think plants is a gut... it's accessible because it's so well taught, but there is a massive volume of info to learn. It's really enjoyable, so it doesn't feel like a slog, but if you want to get a decent grade/learn anything you're going to be putting in a lot of work memorizing a lot of content from 60-70 slide powerpoints before every test. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend it if you have a background in biology and have an interest in botany. It's not a hard STEM class, and there's not a lot of math or chemistry involved, but it is mostly about ecology and evolution and knowing bio will help you. \r\nOther than that it's a great class. It's engaging, it's unique, and it's interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you can take the course, do it. It's absolutely fantastic. Take the lab as well. It is amazing, fun, and delicious. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any student interested in taking it, which probably means you since you're reading this. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend. This is not a gutty science though, don't enter it expecting that. It's an excellent class that has a heavy amount of studying, and lots of work especially in the end of semester period. Taking it concurrently with the lab made for a really enjoyable, but very heavy fall semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take it! Michael Donoghue is an icon ",
            "\u00a0Yes, without a doubt. Even if you're not an ecology major and are looking for a science credit, this is a wonderful course. The Professor has an incredible ability at lecturing and the subject he clearly loves to life. This is also a very fair course. The professor makes sure to give you everything possible to prepare you for exams and and assignments, and the TAs were always incredibly helpful with any doubts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Michael and the TAs were great. Plants are awesome. The lectures were very enlightening, and the lab is a one-of-a-kind experience.  I would recommend taking it Credit-D as there is a lot of material to study before exams and the questions can be kind of specific. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take this course--it's one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. It's definitely helpful to have some basic scientific background, but Professor Donoghue is more than willing to explain concepts like mitosis and meiosis clearly, in as much detail and as many times as you need to hear it. That being said, it's not necessarily an easy class, and there's a lot of memorization involved. But all of it was worth it, and I've come out of it so much more committed to studying plants in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in plant evolution, yes. The class is fairly comprehensive and covers several topics that are interesting. It's taught to ensure that it is accessible to non-science majors, so you will spend some time learning basic concepts about phylogeny. This makes the class easy to follow, but if you're a biology major you may find that the slow pace is a drawback. The assessments are somewhat difficult, but Prof Donoghue's lectures are clear and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I could not recommend this class more highly. This was the perfect science credit for me as someone who is not a science major but wanted an interesting, non-gut science that would expose me to something totally different than what I normally learn about. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if you are really passionate about plants. If you are  a nonscience major thinking of taking it as an interesting elective or gut, this is not for you, as the material is fairly biology-heavy and the exams require lots of memorization ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if he/she really has a strong desire to learn a lot about plants. Overall I enjoyed this class but it was difficult to stay motivated sometimes given the in depth discussion of so many plants. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very much a clade-by-clade review of all plants. If that doesn't sound fascinating to you, pass on this class. Donoghue is an engaging and exciting lecturer, but at the end of the day, there's a lot of memorization and quite a bit of phylogeny thinking. It's not really a gut, but at the same time the material was less complex than most 300+ STEM classes. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Breadth of the material is a little overwhelming but then again it's a survey of the evolution of all plant diversity. NOT a gut (obviously). Fun to get a taste of Donoghue's literally encyclopedic plant knowledge. you can't not learn a ton in this class ",
            "\u00a0YES! A wonderful class. You learn a ton and it's pretty relaxed overall. If you like plants, this is the class for you! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I will never forget this class and all I learned. You will get to spend extended time in a greenhouse each week with other Yalies that love looking at plants so it's an incredibly enjoyable experience. And I get to move forward in life with a wealth of plant-knowledge and neat facts. ",
            "\u00a0Michael Donoghue is a great professor and he made the class very enjoyable. That being said, tests can be unrealistic and there is a ton of material to be covered. Before taking this class make sure the subject matter really interests you, and that you are very ready to put in a lot of work in order to be prepared for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take the class if you're interested in any aspect of plants! There is a good amount of memorization involved for exams, but that's more of an issue with organismal diversity courses in general. You'll come away with a general knowledge of plant groups and a curiosity for so many fascinating things plants are capable of themselves and in impacting the planet. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Great class, you learn more about plants than you probably think you will. Also memorizing phylogenies and species actually takes a fair bit of effort. Seriously, a good class if you want to know more about the living world around you. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This is an INCREDIBLE course. The lab is definitely a highlight. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES!! If you are looking for a manageable yet semi life-changing course (and science credit!) this could be it. Michael is an INCREDIBLE professor and the TAs are great. Lectures are involving and stimulating, and we had a great combination of takeaways, from visual pictures of different plant anatomies, to DNA stuff, to evolutionary theories and history. In conjunction with the lab, I got a ton out of the class, feel more able to understand the plant world around me, and had a wonderful time in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Yess! Understanding how evolution works and how organisms evolve is an invaluable skill. This course also changes the way you see the world! Everything looks different when you start looking at plants are start wondering what they are and how they work. Plus the lab credit that goes with this course is AMAZING ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was a rigorous science class that also allowed me to explore a subject I had never been exposed to before. Whether or not you have a great interest in plants or experience with ecology, Professor Donoghue will care about his students equally and you will gain something from this course because plants affect all of us! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if they are interested in plants and don't want a gut course. Michael (Prof Donoghue) is a great instructor, too. It requires real work, but fun work. Very light on writing, so if that's not your thing this is also the right class for you. Lots of drawing and memorization, and really good food. A great class, overall. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! The course is very accessible even with no background in biology whatsoever and is incredibly fun and enlightening. I knew nothing about plants in September and now know everything about plants. ",
