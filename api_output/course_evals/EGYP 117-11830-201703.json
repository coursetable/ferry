            "\u00a0I gained an awareness of the Coptic language, regarding its grammar, structure, and historical usage. The course covered the basics of Coptic grammar and vocabulary. The focus, as suggested by the name, is biblical translation. "

            "\u00a0The class is very well taught and the size is small enough to where any questions can quickly be discussed and answered. The most helpful tool we used was the practice sentences that we translated. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is definitely interesting and Coptic is a very niche language, so this is an excellent opportunity to learn it. As far as classes go, the workload and difficulty are very reasonable. "
