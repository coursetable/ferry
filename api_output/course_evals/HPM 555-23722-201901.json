Although it was slow sometimes (partially since my senator was new), this experience still taught me a lot and showed me how much thought goes into each bill but also how bureaucratic it is. This experience definitely made me appreciate the CT state legislators even more since they do so much but they are only part-time. Overall, great experience! ",

My work in the practicum has helped me immensely in interviews and cover letters in my job search. YSPH, please support this course in every way you can. ",

She has high standards for our quality of work because she believes we can meet them, and I produce better quality work because of her. I am so humbled that she quite literally puts her reputation on the line (and YSPH in general) reaching out to organizations to request placements for us.
