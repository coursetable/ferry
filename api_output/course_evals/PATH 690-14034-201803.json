            "\u00a0This course gives the students a broad look at various diseases, but lack a cohesive focus. Oftentimes, the lectures do not detail the mechanism of the disease, and so it is difficult to determine what the students are intended to learn. The administration of the course is sloppy and unorganized. Simple announcements about upcoming assignments were not made, and the expectations of students was never explained. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness\r\nBraddock's section although very interesting was slightly confusing as much of it focused on topics unrelated to molecular pathogenesis and focused on the financial considerations of drug development. I think this is very interesting but it could be its own class. \r\nThere wasn't an apparent structure except on the hematology module \r\nQuality of presentation and relationship to molecular pathogenesis is highly dependant on the presenter. \r\nStrength\r\nExposes students to a wide variety of topics ",

            "\u00a0I loved the dynamic structure, where many different types of faculty lectured. I enjoyed how there were various units and that the basis of the course was simply knowledge. The first midterm should be evaluated. I thought the questions and/or grading did not match the presented exceptions and material in class. I enjoyed the final. ",
            "\u00a0The course isn't truly how it's advertised in the description. The second half is very accurate, but the first half seems to be more of an introduction into how to start a successful pharmaceutical startup. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful if every speaker upload their ppt ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses are too much experimental information and particular research from Yale faculty. I would add more basic and objective pathology. ",
            "\u00a0While the initial material (talking about bringing orphan drugs to the market) was very interesting, it seemed like it would be better suited for a different course as it was a little off-topic for a course on the molecular basis of diseases. ",
            "\u00a0The major advantage of this class is the wide range of topics. It covered the most common and most researched disease types in human. The course is seminar styled with each professor talking about his/her research area. The lectures were in depth and detailed. And the workload is appropriate in this class.\r\nThe dilemma of this class is, if the lecturer go very deep in molecule mechanism (for example, a specific gene the lab is investigating), it will not prove much helpful if the student goes into different research areas. On the other hand, if the lecture is only about research big pictures, it might be too general to provide meaningful details. This is a challenge for the lecturer. In the aging topic, one lecture covered the theory of aging while another covered some molecular target of aging. I find this form somehow helpful. This lecture arrangement can be applied to obesity/T2D as well.\r\nInclude a lecture dedicated to introduce the procedures of clinical trials and how to carry out them will be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0A bit more focus on actual disease mechanisms might be nice. I did benefit from learning clinical symptoms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It provides you lots of topics and invite experts in specific field to give lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the whole lecture is less organized. I would expect a more systematic teaching of diseases. Moreover, some lecturers talk more about their research which is hard for us who do not have the background in that field to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The time of each class could be lengthen: too much information in such a short period of time. Each instructor should be given more time or introducing less materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-The course incorporates clinical trials, experimental data, therapeutic designs and rationale with background on different diseases to create a logical and thorough picture of each disease and its therapeutic approaches.\r\n-Covers a wide array of topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-On certain lectures, more general background information on the disease was necessary in order to understand the molecular mechanisms of the disease and the subsequent therapeutic designs.

I thought the course would be more focused on the molecular mechanisms by which pathogens initiate infection and how pathogenesis eventually leads to the development of symptoms. The course focus was more on drug design, therapeutic strategies and the progression of clinical trials. \r\n\r\nThe course was not bad in itself, but I would tell other students about the actual focus of the course before recommending it.
