I really do feel prepared to apply this knowledge in the future. Problem sets were really well written and had a great balance between reinforcing topics learned in class and new topics we had to brainstorm on our own.

            "\u00a0Lecture was very slow. I feel that we could have covered more material. Also, before the midterm, a longer set of practice problems would have been helpful. The strengths were that I learned a lot and the course was very approachable for a newcomer. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths were that the content was interesting, the professor was knowledgeable and fun, and the problem sets were challenging - in a good way.  A weakness was the lack of diversity among ULAs. I actually had a pretty bad experience during office hours once. I was the only female in a room of men, and when I asked the ULA for help with a problem, he kept asking questions like \"You don't even understand the first part? Did you even go to class?\" and it was incredibly humiliating. I felt ashamed for asking for help, which is not how anyone should feel during office hours. ",

However, sometimes the structure of the lectures themselves is unorganized because one topic seems to flow into the rest. I think it would benefit future classes if Professor Chang made a point to differentiate how one topic differs from another (for example, how do confidence intervals for means differ from confidence intervals for proportions and how confidence intervals for means are the same). ",
            "\u00a0kinda disorganized, but overall a fine, fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty good course. Wouldn't change much ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the resources available and the emphasis on R. This class had many office hours available and some of the peer tutors were absolutely amazing. I visited Neil and Dan's office hours on Thursday Night every single week because their help got me through the course. What I wasn't able to learn in class, I was quickly able to learn at their office hours. In particular, Neil was very good at explaining concepts and super approachable. How he managed to help us all out so much throughout the entire semester still amazes me. The other strength mentioned above was the emphasis on R. After taking this class, I feel I am fairly proficient in R and can take future R based classes/conduct research with R. Honestly, I think this class teaches R better than it teaches stats. The stats sometimes felt rushed because there was such a strong emphasis on computing.\r\n\r\nThe main weaknesses of this class were the teaching quality, sheer amount of material and sometimes the difficulty. Professor Chang is one of the nicest and smartest professors I've ever had but he CANNOT teach. Literally everyone fell asleep in class and most people stopped going. He is also very awkward and uncomfortable with people asking questions which makes it harder to learn. I also think he is unintentionally unapproachable. He is very nice, but sometimes gets flustered and will just leave suddenly instead of answering your question after class. Another weakness mentioned above is the amount of material. This class covers many R concepts AND tries to cover basic statistics. This can be very difficult to do, and we did not get to many concepts that even high school stats classes teach (chi-squared). However, I will say we still managed considerable theoretical depth in the concepts we did cover. Lastly, the PSETS can have one or two problems that are just very hard. Every few weeks we got a PSET that had a problem that made me think \"How could we possibly know this?\" However, this is where Neil and Dan's incredibly helpful office hours came in . Whenever, I went to them, I usually got these problems solved. ",
            "\u00a0Good class! Tests, which we all pen and paper, felt very very different from problem sets, which were all done in R. ",
            "\u00a0Great, clear syllabus. Great feedback system, especially through piazza. Professor Chang really made sure we had enough resources and help. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lecture could have been more interactive, although I think that is just a byproduct of the discipline. I really like the content and pace of the course though, and believe that the problem sets were extremely fun to go through. ",
            "\u00a0The organization was messy and the course was very much a \"we'll figure it out as we go\". No syllabus to help plan ahead which made it difficult sometimes considering how time consuming assingments could be ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nLove the computational aspect\r\nGood amount of material covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nCould be organized better\r\nPace too fast in beginning ",
            "\u00a0I thought the teaching within the classroom coding wise was very good, while explaining the concepts was not very good. The teacher used powerpoint to teach math, which I believe is not an effective way of teaching math. I think if the statistical concepts were taught on the chalk board it would have been much easier to follow along with the content. ",
            "\u00a0One major flaw of the course that I would like to point out is the following. Home-works are supposed to help us revise the things we learnt in class. Not teach us new things that we had never come in contact with before. I believe that the PSet process would have flown a lot more smoothly if there was a more one to one correspondence with the things we did in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organised. The problem sets really build off the lecture and allow for in depth exploration of the concepts covered. The problem sets also really allow for you to get comfortable with coding in R. You don't really realise it as you go along, but by the end, a lot of the R coding comes almost naturally because of how much you've done and learned. \r\nOne thing that I sometimes felt a little lost on was the statistics theory. There were no formal discussion sections, and most of the office hours were spent looking at more R-based questions, so if you still had doubts after lecture and the book, or simply wanted to explore something a little further, it was difficult to find a place to do it in. Especially because although office hours were always very helpful when it came to R based questions, they lacked a little more strength in theory questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think towards the beginning of the course, there could be a bit more focus on writing efficient, concise, elegant R code. Other than that, it is hard to imagine how the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great because the lectures were very valuable and important to go to despite the lecture notes being posted (this was very helpful too). The problem sets were a great and very reasonable length, and drove home key concepts from lecture. Professor Chang also helped clarify questions about problem sets in lecture, and the entire course was geared to facilitate student learning. The material and the workload were very manageable. However the 5pm Friday problem set deadline was a bit weird and I would have loved for it to be midnight on Friday instead. Also, feedback on the problems sets was always super clear. ",
            "\u00a0The course could provide more guidance for the more math and theory based concepts. On the problem sets, I feel like I had a solid grasp of the questions that dealt with applying the methods we learned to real problems, but I struggled a little bit with the more pure math or reasoning questions. ",
            "\u00a0It's nice that the course teaches you how to use R. There might be some areas of content that other intro courses cover that this one does not though ",
            "\u00a0It perhaps could move a bit more quickly once we get into the groove of things, but even that is a minor point. The class is supposed to be accessible to anyone, regardless of prior experience, and it succeeded in that regard. That's what is most important. The psets were also interesting and it was very useful to learn some R. Professor Chang was awesome as well. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a good introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a very well done course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong because it is a good beginner's introduction into both R and Statistics. I felt challenged (for sure) but I never felt wronged or like the coursework was wildly unfair. That being said, I think (to no fault of the class itself most likely) Yale students have a tendency to take the \"beginners classes\" even if they are not beginners, and that sometimes sped the class up to a point where it was difficult to keep up. I think in the future, the instructor will know what pace to go at more regularly and this problem will fix itself. All in all, strong beginner course into a fun but difficult subject. ",
            "\u00a0I think the teaching could've been more comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0A very engaging course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: problem sets were thoughtful and well designed by Chang. Tests were fair. \r\n\r\nWeakness: POWERPOINT! Its very hard to follow math and coding in class when none of the math or coding is done live but done beforehand and just clicked through in PowerPoint format ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was good and everything progressed well from one topic to another. Using R for assignments and in class was helpful and I feel like I have a comfortable grasp on using R now. Lectures were well-organized and interesting, and the problem sets weren't too bad. ",
            "\u00a0My only suggestion for course improvement would be that it's really, really hard to learn to code during lecture... Instead, I would make this part of the homework assignments and maybe do flipped classroom stuff during the lectures about R. ",
            "\u00a0It felt a little disorganized as to us not covering some concepts provided in equivalent stats courses in other departments (i.e aqa, econometrics), but we did go deeper in proving statistical concepts using R. ",
            "\u00a0As this is a new course, I hope it will become more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! One big strength is Professor Chang. Hes greatknowledgeable, fun, and well-organized (e.g. his hyper-linked Canvas homepage made me irrationally happy). This course also used Piazza well (shoutout also to David Brinda, who was really helpful in answering questions). The lectures were engaging and enjoyable; I looked forward to coming to this 9a class.\r\n\r\nThat said, the problem sets seemed like the backbone of this coursethey were where I internalized most of the material (which may be due in part to the 9a lectures)and I really liked them. They were all done in R (which led to me being caught off guard by the paper and pencil midterm) and collaboration was encouraged. They were usually composed of 4ish problems. Often, these would include a few more straightforward exercises, sometimes from our textbook, and then one or two that were trickier or that introduced new material. We did a couple of proofs near the end of the course, but problem sets usually focused on application and often simulation and visualization.\r\n\r\nOh, another strength: all the class materials are free! The main textbook (and extra for-fun textbooks) and the R software. As for weaknesses, while the lectures were definitely engaging and enjoyable, they could perhaps be better organized. In general, though, this was a great course, especially for its first time being taught. ",

Does not require any previous computing experience, this was my first exposure and everything was walked through really carefully. Don't hesitate to ask a TA if you need help, they explained to me how to make a \"function\" which revolutionized the way I could do things! ",

            "\u00a0Statistics unfortunately retains its reputation as a dry subject. This course didn't do too much to change this. \r\nYou will learn R entirely in the service of your understanding of statistics theory something which the course makes explicit at the outset anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a student interested in data science or statistics I definitely recommend this course! This course is challenging but is not an excessive amount of work. The problem sets give a great opportunity to work on the new code that was learned in class and allows for an application of the statistics to real world scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The course provides excellent foundations for anyone interested in following a further path in statistics and data science. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I'm speaking as someone who had never coded before, and knew next to nothing about statistics -- this course is really, really worth it. It gives you a really great overview of statistics, and introduces you to coding with R, but most of all, the way the professor structures it makes for a really great environment where even if you have little to no experience with any of the topics, you feel comfortable and not overwhelmed. Not to say that this isn't a challenging course, on the contrary, but it is very fair and approachable, even if you are completely new to its topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone seeking a deep understanding of introductory statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely take this course. I had no experience in statistics before, and this course was a great introduction. The lectures are interesting and helpful, the problem sets are very manageable and relevant, and the exams are quite fair and like the problem sets. While I did have experience coding before, Professor Chang spends a good amount of time teaching students how to use R, especially in the beginning of the class (emphasis on \"use,\" as you'll learn that more than the theory behind it, which makes sense as this is a stats course and not a CS course). Feedback from the TA's on problem sets was great as well. Definitely take this course if you're looking for a manageable but interesting and fairly challenging introduction to stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who's looking to get a solid introduction into the field of stats along with some practical programming skills with R. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good intro course that not only teaches you how to do statistics, but also the guiding theories behind it. Probably also helps people considering the data science major decide whether it's for them ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was good, in-depth but not horrifyingly difficult introduction to statistics. I'm actually considering double-majoring in S&DS now because of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you've never taken a statistics course and want to be exposed to some basic programming. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Good course for beginners into coding and R and statistics. Honestly quite fun, although at times I was incredibly frustrated. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, if you need to take it, take it. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Very interesting course! Very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This class is neither the best way to learn R nor the best way to learn statistics. The material was presented in a very complicated, confusing manner; despite having seen higher-level stats in other non-stats classes, I was very often confused by the material. The slides don't contain very helpful information, and the textbook was never really used except as a source for homework problems (the textbook material is presented badly too). \r\n\r\nIf you want to learn R, take free online courses. If you want to learn stats, take a different course or read the appendix of the Wooldridge econometrics textbook for ECON 132. You'll learn more effectively and much more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in statistics. You might be able to coast through this class without much work especially if youve taken stats before, but dont expect to get anything substantial out of it unless youre willing to put in some extra work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want a pretty good intro to R. I wouldn't take this if you've had no exposure to stats in the past, as even though it's \"intro\" everyone else seems to understand the stats already. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. If you're debating whether or not to take this class or regular statistics, there is a right and wrong decision: the right decision is to take this class. While it's intensive, it's not intense--my friends who took regular statistics this semester spent the same amount of time on their problem sets as the students in intensive did, but it seemed like we had more accessible instructors (TF, undergrads, and of course Professor Chang), and our problem sets were MUCH more interesting. For example, we were given sample data from a company (real or fictional I'm not sure) and were able to analyze a gender gap in wages statistically. \r\n\r\nIf you've never programmed before, this is an ~excellent~ way to learn that doesn't involve the pain and drama of CPSC112. If you have programmed before, then the parts with R will come really easily, and it's a great language to know. If you've learned R before, I doubt you'll learn much that's new, but you might perfect your skills and learn statistics at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you haven't learned stats but want to learn R. But, do consider other options that do the same: econometrics, AQA, Psych-Stats, to see what best suits your needs. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I love Prof Chang. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great introduction to statistics (no statistical or programming experience necessary, though the latter can give you a little leg up in the first few weeks) with engaging lectures and problem sets, taught by a cool prof, and that has a manageable workload. Dont be scared off by intensive in the name, as long as youre willing to spend some time debugging and/or collaborating, youll be fine. Id recommend this even to people who dont need it for their major because a basic level of statistical insight is increasingly crucial to being an informed citizen in everyday life. Also, learning R is a great skill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, i loved this course and would recommend it to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a great course for someone who doesn't have any background in statistics to get up to speed quickly. I now have a good understanding of important statistical tests and concepts and learned how to implement them in R. I feel a lot more confident reading and interpreting papers and using these tools to understand my own results. "
