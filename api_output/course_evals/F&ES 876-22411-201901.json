            "\u00a0I learned decolonization methodologies and a general survey of indigenous traditions and their relations to the environment. ",
            "\u00a0This class really challenged me to consider the history of colonialism and its relationship to modern indigenous studies and research methodologies of anthropology and ethnography. Gained a lot of insight into relational ways of knowing, monism vs. dualism, spiritual and material, human and animal and spirit relationships. Through a survey of regions I learned a bit about specific lifeways of indigenous peoples, e.g. Inuit and Yekuana. ",
            "\u00a0I came to understand the importance of land in a new way through our close consideration of the colonial encounter. What a gap in my knowledge... ",
            "\u00a0I learned about indigenous lifeways around the world, and some common issues in discourses of indigeneity. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the lifeways and cosmovisions of specific indigenous communities around the world. I gained insight on the role the indigenous communities can play in safeguarding ecosystems. "

            "\u00a0Closely ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course, but it did not align with my expectations. I think the course did not explicitly take on environmental issues as strongly as it could have. On social media, Indigenous rights and the environment are constantly being shared. It was hard to read somewhat older readings knowing that the course could have incorporated more recent articles and news. ",
            "\u00a0Went beyond my expectations. Great class that taught me a lot about reading and understanding indigenous lifeways, their relationship to ecology, and the ideas of decolonization that permeate such a topic. ",
            "\u00a0From taking previous courses taught by John & Mary Evelyn, I went into this course with very high expectations, because I knew how transformative their pedagogy was for me. I was very impressed by the decolonization section of the course, but my expectations for in-class discussion were not always aligned with the actual experience. The size of the class was large, and the deconstruction of research methodologies very thorough, and the conversation then steered often toward people's individual experiences as opposed to engaging with course content more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly well. I don't know what I was expecting exactly but the course was very different- this was in no way bad. I thought it flowed very well ",
            "\u00a0I was glad to learn about indigenous lifeways around the world and discourses around indigeneity, but I was hoping for more contextual discussion around contemporary issues. I thought the course would include more discussion of environmental issues and conflicts. I was also expecting more contemporary literature; many of our readings were 30-40 years old. While these readings were good, I would hope for a mix of more contemporary literature as well. "

            "\u00a0Too many students. Would have been far better with 20 or fewer. Some classes were unorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Readings and lectures are the strongest parts of the class, the discussions are not always informative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: variety of topics discussed and geographic spread built into the course\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were confusing and hard to follow, student-led discussions got repetitive and stale ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - a general survey of Indigenous cultures; John Grim lecturing\r\nI think that the course gave a very wholesome depiction of Indigenous traditions around the world. John Grim's lectures were incredible. His opinions and thoughts on our questions and comments were valuable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Classroom Discussion; readings; practicality \r\nThe same themes in classroom discussions surfaced. These discussions were great in some senses, but they kept returning to the environmental habits of the students rather than critically looking at the environmental habits/traditions of the specific Indigenous community we were studying. Some of the readings were a bit dated. Theory is, of course, needed, but the practicality of the course was missing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the module format, the excellent teaching from John and Anna, the encouraging educational atmosphere, the attention to wellness and community, the flexibility of the final project, split time between lecture and student discussion\r\nWeaknesses: class size was large (so tough to be open and also maintain the intimate feeling), and sometimes conversation seemed low energy ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: some of the discussions seemed like a waste of time. \r\nStrengths: Professor Grim's opening remarks were often the highlight of the class. I thought he tied together loose ends while also encouraging reflection and personal integration of the source material. ",
            "\u00a0Too much time spent on question/discussion. Most of us are not providing our own perspectives on the readings (which are mostly non-indigenous). I would have loved to have had more lecture from Dr. Grim or guest lecturers.\r\nI was hoping there would be more material (readings and discussion) on specific practices of indigenous peoples in changing/interacting with/managing their environment.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Good mix of students from a lot of different schools at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a good balance of geographies and has a good structure. It evolves from looking at lifeways, cosmovision, colonization to climate change. We had very interesting visiting lecturers who were the highlight of the course. It would have been enriching to have more visiting lecturers and more time for professor Grim to lecture too. The student led discussions became monotonous and repetitive, and the level of engagement in the discussions decreased as the semester evolved. "

            "\u00a0I suggest this class to everyone as a great way to engage with non-Western lifeways. I would advise to do all the readings and postings on Canvas in a timely matter. ",
            "\u00a0Understand that this course is not structured well and can be confusing ",
            "\u00a0Take this course to receive a theoretical background in Indigenous traditions. If you absolutely know you will work with Indigenous peoples in the future, definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Please take it, do all the readings, and make the most out of it. ",
            "\u00a0The class is interesting and not a lot of work. You'll benefit from a thoughtful attitude and open mind. It will certainly expand how you think about the world and open a door to understanding indigenous communities, their histories, contemporary status, and environmental issues. ",
            "\u00a0Its much more theoretical, philosophical, anthropological than I would have anticipated. Readings were all over the board - trying to cover a lot of different indigenous perspectives on the environment meant we didnt ever dive too deep into anyone indigenous peoples relationship with the environment, perspective or practice. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to delve into a survey of different indigenous lifeways throughout the world. It is a good class to learn about cosmovision and reflect about the relationship indigenous communities have with ecology, and the impacts of colonization and modern western influence. The readings are very interesting and the final project is very adaptable to your interests. "
