            "\u00a0I learned to manage large amounts of reading and developed the ability to analyze texts while thinking about the overarching themes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to read and analyze historical papers and write with a historical lens, insights into a city that will be applicable for history courses in the future ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the class encompass many different types of sources from anthropology and sociology as well as history. Beyond the material itself, Professor Ho makes sure to discuss how different types of sources from different points of view are evaluated in history. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely taught me how to analyze history more closely, and it erased a lot of stereotypes I had about Shanghai. The discussion resources made me think more about sources and types of case studies. Being in a class of ten people allowed me to speak out more and share my opinions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read scholarly articles properly, and how to effectively read many more pages than I was previously used to. The knowledge of Shanghai history learned in this class was a lot of content, and the quote diary helped in remembering the main points of each article for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was the most intellectually stimulating course I took this semester. The course taught me how to use sources more effectively in my writing and how to read texts more closely. Most importantly this course taught me how to think about history/historiography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the writing standards expected by Yale College. ",
            "\u00a0How to read academic texts from scholarly publications; how to analyze historical evidence; how to do historical writing; how to contribute to seminar discussions ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Shanghai, from its founding to present day, and by extension, broader ideas about China during the same time period. I learned how to approach historical texts with a critical eye, and how to debate and discuss ideas with peers. I also improved my short paper writing skills (3 pages) how to provide context, how to tighten arguments, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The discussion is driven by students with occasional input by Professor Ho, and flows very naturally. The readings are for the most part interesting to read, and some of the assignments fun to work with as well. Not really much that could be improved--what you get out of the class depends on the work you put in. ",
            "\u00a0- Well designed writing assignments that are short and spaced out over the semester\r\n- Lots of feedback on writing\r\n- In total, the amount of writing is not as much as other seminar classes ",
            "\u00a0I feel like some people may have been more comfortable than others speaking during the discussions, so sometimes it was hard to talk about my ideas. However, I    did like the four essay format that gave me room to improve from the feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely an intensive course that covered a long period of history and many different side areas such as art, cinema, food, etc. Alongside the thorough readings, it was helpful to have regular feedback on writing. One weakness was maybe the reflective cover letter at the end of the course, which I found less useful. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. The course was very well managed and the selection of readings as well as the organization of the semester was the course's true strength! The assignments were also thought provoking and the quality of discussion facilitated by the instructor was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0You get to cover a lot of interesting information as well as be very interactive with your class. However, essay writing requirements can be vague. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Great feedback for writing assignments, writing assignments were fun and not overwhelming\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the readings were a little uninteresting/long/repetitive, the discussions were dominated by only a few students, the class seemed to be geared towards students who already had extensive prior knowledge of China/Shanghai ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well-structured, variety of texts to read, comprehensive, great professor. HIST032 is also rather unique; studying one city for so long turned out to be A LOT more interesting than I had originally imagined.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is personal preference, but I felt as though we didn't do enough writing other history courses have essays much longer than 3 pages, and have length end-of-semester research papers. We only did four papers over the course of the semester, which only adds up to twelve pages written total. The trade-off was that we got much more personalized feedback on each assignment, which helped greatly, but I'm also scared that I might not be well prepared for future history courses at Yale (because assignments are much, much longer).

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students looking to expand on their knowledge of Chinese history while studying the multi-faceted history of Shanghai. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend this course to those who are interested in the history of a city. Professor Ho is very caring, engaging, and easy to communicate with. The readings sometimes are long, but are definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if you are not considering East Asia studies specifically. You will receive a lot of feedback on your writing and learn a lot of skills that are applicable to the other humanities classes you may take. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well taught, and I felt like I could easily get help. I think it is great for first-year students still transitioning to college-level courses. It also helped me with historical writing, which i had not been used to or really done before. Also, this class is great in that you can actively participate more in discussions and have your voice heard. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in Chinese history and Shanghai. The course covers a broad range of areas through which to look at Shanghai, and different types of material such as articles, movies, short stories, and memoirs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes this was an excellent class that I believe any Yalie especially anyone who is interested in China or history/historiography in general should take. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if the student is interested and (at least slightly) well-versed in East Asian studies or Chinese history. There are a lot of readings, and at least for me as a first-year, transitioning from my high school academic environment to large amounts of readings that didn't always make sense or interest me was a large change. I think the class is great for first-year students who are learning how to read, write, and discuss at a collegiate level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great, rather thorough introduction to the study of history. Professor Ho is great, the material is compelling, and you'll appreciate the seminar-style teaching while you're taking a bunch of other lecture courses. "
