It was great to learn both about the empirical facts that characterize financial crises, and also to have a unifying theory of financial crises and how they emerge in the back of my head when thinking about empirical work. I learned a lot about the types of open questions that exist in the literature on financial crises. ",

I also learned a lot about how to think about financial crises and avenues for further research in the field, and more generally about macroeconomics. The course also helped transform the way that I think about financial intermediation and how the financial sector works, more generally. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the most fundamental classes in the economics and finance programs. Should be taken by all masters and PhD students. ",
