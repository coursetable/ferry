This essentially means being able to digest the research around a certain narrative of an economic phenomenon and then looking for economic phenomena similar to the central phenomenon that was researched and well-understood. In this seminar we first looked at the causes of the \"Lost Decades\" of post-1989 Japan and then spent the rest of the semester looking for parallels between certain national and regional economies that had gone through similar crises since then, are currently going through similar crises, or are vulnerable to similar crises.

The first half of the class is Japan-centric, and then in the second half you apply these lessons to the world at large. I didn't have a particular interest in Japan beforehand, but it is an interesting way to look at the world.\r\n\r\nProfessor Roach is a solid professor. He is very accessible for office hours and even took the class out to dinner on the last day. Obviously, he's a superstar and has a lot of interesting stories about his encounters with world leaders.\r\n\r\nThe grading seems to be reasonable. Prof. Roach gives VERY detailed feedback, but rarely gives a 100% on anything. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred fewer readings, but hey, thats a Yale seminar. ",
