            "\u00a0I was surprised at what I learned from this course. In this class, I learned how to direct a scene \"from scratch\" and how to connect sensorily to a play. Professor Dorfman focuses on the action/objective of the scene, over that of the actor, which I found helpful in distilling the arc of the play. I learned to create devised work and to engage indirectly with the text for a sensory experience. I learned to revise scenes based on critiques. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the ins and outs of taking a script and developing my own interpretation and vision for a show. Also worked with actors "

            "\u00a0Students don't actually direct scenes class until October, which was a little frustrating. I also found the first few weeks frustrating because much of our class time was Professor Dorfman talking and theory-based (Aristotle, etc) without practice. The necessity of this theory became clear later in the course, but it would be helpful for it to be integrated into the directing praxis more. \r\nHowever, this class is an unexpected delight. Professor Dorfman gives students instructions to devise original work without examples or clear steps to move from concept to performance. However,  this was an unexpected strength of the course.  Students had to think for themselves, have trust in their artistic work, and genuinely devise pieces they connected with. The focus is clearly on directing, where some THST courses cross lines, this class is more focused. Presenting scenes in class was helpful to give our work a platform and see it with an audience's eye. Prof Dorfman gave us a rich trio of plays to work with.\r\nIt would be helpful to focus a bit more on what to do in the rehearsal room. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was Professor Dorman's attention to detail and giving clear and helpful feedback. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, make time for it. The course does require a lot of rehearsal outside of class to get the most out of it, but that work pays off if you can get it done. The class is frustrating at times in that Professor Dorfman gives assignments that seem impossibly vague, but which in the end are super helpful and force students to think creatively as directors. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to any Theater Studies major. So many classes focus on breadth, but this class refreshingly focuses on depth. You spend the semester developing a few key skills for analyzing plays, but you are expected to come to excel at these skills by the end of the course. I certainly felt that I learned a lot. You will, too, if you put in the time. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I'd recommend whether you're interested in pursuing theater or not--the class changes how you look at the world, and encourages you to notice all the little things. It's a great introduction to both theory and practice, and a fun and eye-opening course to take! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to learn how to take a text and develop an intimate relationship with it to be prepared to direct this is a wonderful course "
