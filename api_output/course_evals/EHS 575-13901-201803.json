            "\u00a0The course is set up so that each week is a new guest speaker, while this is interesting there was not enough time spent on lecturing and focusing in on topics and concepts we should take away from the course. \r\n\r\nThe most frustrating aspect of the course was that there were \"pop quizzes\" and that counted as your entire participation grade. I find pop quizzes to be juvenile and in no way assess knowledge or understanding of the course. It is also not conducive to the life of a graduate student some classes were missed due to job interviews or personal matters etc and you would miss the quiz on those days regardless with no way to make up for the lost points. Also, at first the quizzes would be given at the beginning of class so students would come to take quizzes and then leave so the following quizzes were given at random times such as at the end of the class or in the middle which I thought was too much effort to elude students. Other courses have had extra quizzes but they are scheduled so that students can plan in advance to attend a certain class. Other courses have created an activity for a week that would count as participation grade or given students the chance to make up missed class if participation is solely based on class attendance. I had not had pop quizzes since before high school and that aspect alone made the course less enjoyable and not an encouraging learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0I only took it to fulfill an environmental requirement. I think this course needs a complete overhaul. I didn't get much out of it at all. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed getting an introduction to occupational and environmental medicine. It could be improved perhaps through a better time block-- I think some students were pretty tired by the end of the day. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed much of the material in this course, however, there were some unnecessary components. \r\n1) Discussion groups. It was VERY frustrating to be in a group where the other individuals rarely did the reading. Furthermore, assigning us a discussion group made it unnecessarily difficult -- we could have easily just split up in groups with the people we were sitting near each week. \r\n2) The quizzes were unnecessary. It seems like they were more of a way to force people to attend. I think it would be better to structure the midterm and final differently so students who do not attend class are at a disadvantage is better than just giving random pop quizzes. \r\n3) Site visit. I love this idea! However, I think the professors/TFs need to take it upon themselves to organize the visits. There should have been a set of sites that were already scheduled (different days/times) that students could sign up for depending on their schedule. Trying to coordinate with a large group was a nightmare, especially when sometimes the schedules were just not compatible. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: easy EHS requirement, interesting speakers were invited to present\r\nWeakness: Could be a bit dry at times, but that may be because I'm not in EHS ",
            "\u00a0- the professor never taught the class herself, there were always speakers and I think this took away from making the class cohesive one to the next. It is also too long and a little dry. I wish there were more strategies of what we can actually do instead of just learning about random cases that I will not really be able to apply in my life time. ",
            "\u00a0Too many students take this course. Winslow Auditorium would be better than the room in College 47. ",
            "\u00a0I have compiled a list of feedback for this course, and am submitting them here in hope that the school will attempt to improve or eliminate the course. \r\n- Poor content: Every class was a guest lecture so there was absolutely no continuity between lectures. There were a lot of redundant topics across lectures and it was clear that the professors had not communicated what we had already learned. As a result, I could probably summarize everything I learned in the course in one sentence or two. \r\n- Lack of respect towards students: I felt that the professors did not respect the students. \r\n-- First of all, we were all required to do group presentations which constitute a portion of our grade. It was outrageous to me that one of the professors would often be late, or even when she was there, she would be on her phone not paying attention to student presentations. How is she going to grade us when she was not even listening? \r\n-- Second of all, the class was poorly managed administratively . Class announcements were often made too late and posed a burden on students' schedules. The group project details were released far too close to the due date. The timing of the final was also not communicated well, and was only clarified at the end of the very last class.\r\n- Poor evaluation mechanism: The class is so unpopular (and frankly, some students called the class insulting, which I agree with) that students often missed class. Thus, the class conducted \"pop quizzes\" that happened at the beginning, middle, or end of class in order to penalize students who had to leave early or come late. This is a testament to how terrible the class was - they literally had to administer pop quizzes in a random fashion in order to threaten students to even show up. \r\n\r\nIn sum, if YSPH has any respect for its students' tuition, time, and self-respect, I believe this class needs to either be completely revamped or removed entirely. We deserve better classes if you are going to promote that you offer quality education. ",

            "\u00a0Oh goodness. Where do I begin? I needed to take this course to complete my core requirement, and, like other core classes I've taken here (minus Jason Schwartz's), this proved to be another disappointment, waste of time, and waste of tuition dollars. The course consists only of guest lectures - and while few were interesting (shout-out to the emergencies and disasters one!), I left every course scratching my head and trying to figure out what exactly I learned (pretty much that there are 4 types of hazards - that's my big takeaway from the entire semester). The professors did not really engage with us (aside from the two lectures they taught, which I did enjoy), aside from telling us at the beginning of the semester that they wished less people would take their class (welcoming? not particularly). Students were on their computers the entire class doing other work because we found the material and lectures so un-engaging. Even the attempts at small group work felt pointless. The one upside was the midterm project - that was fun and enjoyable; I don't feel like I learned that much, but I had a good time completing it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course introduced way too many guest speakers who fluctuated in public speaking abilities.  Some lecturers were very engaging while others were dry and dull.  It would have been great to hear from the course professors more often.  I also felt that the course shouldn't be mandatory for the student curriculum and should instead be offered as an elective for students interested in pursuing occupational health long-term. ",
            "\u00a0fun to have different guests each week. Occupational health is relatively boring so the different topics and guests made it bearable, but not all weeks. Also, the quizzes were a bit annoying since I couldn't always come to class because of the evening times. Lastly, the grading was a bit confusing since my group members would get good grades while I got decent grades even though I did everything that was asked for. Perhaps have the group members anonymously grade each other too since I did most of the work, including planning the whole site-visit, while some group members barely did anything but got better marks than me. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed learning about a range of topics and having all of the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good but pretty disorganized. There was wide variation in how good the guest lecturers. It may be helpful to have instructors send in slides beforehand to ensure that classes flow from week to week. There was often repetition between lecturers, which could be avoided if the slides were checked beforehand. While quizzes were important, it would be helpful to know about them in advance. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely waste of time, energy, and money. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course, more than I have expected. It was nice to listen different lecturers from various areas and to hear their experiences. The field visit was helpful to involve the course better and I enjoyed it a lot. Only thing that I was disappointed was the warning about citations at the very first class of the semester. We were told to be extra careful about our citations (which is totally understandable), but then it was emphasized that this notification was for especially foreign students. It might be true that it is more common to see problems among international students but I think telling this explicitly is not very kind. As a foreigner one, I would feel myself better if this was emphasized stronger but to all students. ",
            "\u00a0This class was essentially a throw away class. The lectures were almost never related to each other and didn't have a common thread - one week we'd have one on the history of OSHA and one week someone came in and talked about the molecule benzene for the full two hours. Two hours at that time of the evening is hard to get through, particularly if the lectures seems haphazard and not to follow any kind of cohesive curriculum. \r\n\r\nThe site visit was an interesting idea, and a good way to summarize the basics of occupational health, but it would have been much easier if the instructors had done some more arranging, rather than just saying \"go find a business.\" \r\n\r\nThe instructors were very enthusiastic about the subject and I get the sense that they do want people to get something out of the class, but it's poorly organized, not cohesive, and demanded virtually nothing of us. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the guest lecturers. The course was very large, which made it somewhat difficult to interact with the subject matter to the extent it deserved. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great overview of occupational & environmental medicine - but I might suggest more interactive activities ",
            "\u00a0This course was very laidback and covered interesting material. I felt that the group discussions added very little to the class. Class time would have been better spent on lectures alone. The course also could have been better organized. The classes felt a bit random and did not build off each other. I felt the class could have benefited from more discussion of US OSH policy and occupational health justice issues. The pop quizzes were not a very effective way to encourage me to study and retain the material. I think one in-class midterm would have been better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Occasionally interesting content; wide range of content means you will probably find something compelling at some point; Ease of work\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of coherence between weeks/topics ",

            "\u00a0Many of the lectures were bland and the assignments just felt like busy work (you gain very little if anything from doing them). This course would perhaps be better suited for a knowledgeable high schooler/freshman in college or someone who has no experience in the field of public health. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Very much appreciated the different \"experts\" you were able to bring to class. \r\nAlso loved the group work as it was nice to be paired up to individuals we did know prior. ",
            "\u00a0Occupational health is something I've encountered while discussing workplace safety, but I have never explored concepts related to occupational health or environmental health through an epidemiology lens. The course provided a good survey of different bodies of work within this field. ",
            "\u00a0Despite this course being an EHS requirement/elective for all students, I wish that even a moderate degree of effort were placed into this course. It was evident that the class did not care, the professors did not care, and even the guest lecturers seemed not to care at points. This class was honestly intellectually insulting and did not challenge me in any way. There was absolutely no work for this course besides a \"write-up\" on a site visit that we had to do as our midterm. This course was also at a tough time (5-7 pm on Tuesdays) and it was clear everyone was tired, people left early, and no one wanted to be there. I do think this course has a great deal of potential, but serious adjustments need to be made, starting with the effort placed into designing the class. ",

How is she going to grade us when she was not even listening? \r\n-- Second of all, the class was poorly managed administratively . Class announcements were often made too late and posed a burden on students' schedules. The group project details were released far too close to the due date. The timing of the final was also not communicated well, and was only clarified at the end of the very last class.\r\n- Poor evaluation mechanism: The class is so unpopular (and frankly, some students called the class insulting, which I agree with) that students often missed class. Thus, the class conducted \"pop quizzes\" that happened at the beginning, middle, or end of class in order to penalize students who had to leave early or come late. This is a testament to how terrible the class was - they literally had to administer pop quizzes in a random fashion in order to threaten students to even show up. \r\n\r\nIn sum, if YSPH has any respect for its students' tuition, time, and self-respect, I believe this class needs to either be completely revamped or removed entirely.

I find pop quizzes to be juvenile and in no way assess knowledge or understanding of the course. It is also not conducive to the life of a graduate student some classes were missed due to job interviews or personal matters etc and you would miss the quiz on those days regardless with no way to make up for the lost points. Also, at first the quizzes would be given at the beginning of class so students would come to take quizzes and then leave so the following quizzes were given at random times such as at the end of the class or in the middle which I thought was too much effort to elude students. Other courses have had extra quizzes but they are scheduled so that students can plan in advance to attend a certain class. Other courses have created an activity for a week that would count as participation grade or given students the chance to make up missed class if participation is solely based on class attendance. I had not had pop quizzes since before high school and that aspect alone made the course less enjoyable and not an encouraging learning environment. ",
