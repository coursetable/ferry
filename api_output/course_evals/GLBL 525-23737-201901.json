            "\u00a0I learned about Philip Bobbitt and his theories on the great cycles of epochal wars and epochal peace, and how it has affected the systems of state constitutions and The constitutions of the society states throughout history and into the future ",
            "\u00a0I came to Jackson to learn about international relations obviously, but this is the course where I found it. Wilson taught us how to think about the compounding security threats in the world, and gave our modern moment the historical context I was seeking. I understand that Wilson is not returning next year to teach which is a huge loss. I think Wilson brings exactly the kind of insight into global affairs that Jackson graduates should be exposed to. \r\n\r\nI learned how to think about war, and peace, and how the US has historically misunderstood these two terms and how that has had important and enduring consequences in the international arena. \r\n\r\nI learned how to conceptualize different theories of international relations, from Woodrow Wilson to Obama. \r\n\r\nI learned how to take historical examples of war and revolution and apply them to the near and far future, and how policymakers should prepare for and mitigate incoming challenges. \r\n\r\nI also learned how to write about these topics.

            "\u00a0The professor was very engaging, however, the readings were sometimes a bit too much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings / discussion / class participants were all excellent. The assignments were very do-able and engaging, and much more practical than other class assignments I've had. (e.g. the Common Place Book was a unique opportunity to practice critical engagement with a work, and to hone my own voice). \r\nWeaknesses: The class met on every other Friday, which was too infrequent (only because the in-class lectures were so great). But we liked it so much we often stayed late each time by over an hour. Given the amount of reading we had (a lot!), it actually worked pretty well, especially for us busy grad students. "
