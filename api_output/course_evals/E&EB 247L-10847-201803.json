            "\u00a0I learned most of the plant phylogeny, how to identify major plant groups, a lot of highly specific morphological characteristics like orchid columns and pollinia, as well as more broadly applicable scientific skills like observation, scientific drawing, and dissection. I also became fluent in a large technical botanical vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Plants structure, function, phylogeny, nomenclature ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about identifying plants and their key features. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the lab better facilitated learning through hands-on identification of plant structures, plant diversity, and drawing for scientific purposes. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to look at plants and determine what they looked like based on their phylogeny and their characteristics in a real-life environment. It was very well tied into the course that was being taken simultaneously and that cause the material to make a lot of sense. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of plant family groups and their distinguishing morphological characteristics. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about physical characteristics of major groups of plants, as well as unique traits of various families that can be used to classify them. I also learned about the basics of plant identification - determining leaf patterns/appearance, flower traits, etc., and inferring what family a plant belongs to. ",
            "\u00a0You'll learn a surprising amount in lab for how stress-free it is! I definitely found it much more memorable to see and feel the plants when learning. "

            "\u00a0This is such a wonderful course. It helped solidify some of the concepts presented in class to be able to work with these plants in person, and was one of the best and least stress-inducing courses I've taken at Yale. I felt (and still feel) a bit unsure about how grading will shake out, but ultimately have a lot of faith in our teaching instructors and Michael to be fair, even though exact criteria weren't always clear. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a lot of fun and consisted mostly of drawing plants and eating snacks. The lab final was a bit difficult but overall still fun to complete. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very enjoyable, particularly with the delicious food that was provided each week. I thought it was a great way to put the knowledge we learned in the classroom to work. It would have been nice to have a little more guidance, especially when it came to what the expectations were for the lab; we were given good preparation for the lab practical, but the drawings we made for the class would have been more effective if we had known the format earlier. Also, it would have been better to have the lab during the last meeting of the semester, rather than during finals period. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the class was very enjoyable. I looked forward to coming to each of the lab days and every time there was something to look forward to. It was a very low stress environment and there was plenty of time to learn everything necessary without feeling rushed or feeling like it was taking forever. All I wish is that there had been maybe just a tiny bit more preparation right before the practical. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a lovely way to spend an afternoon a week. The lab takes place in Marsh Botanical Gardens, a gem on campus that is filled with plants from around the world. Basically each lab consists of sketching plants for three hours while sipping tea and eating food that was related to the plants we were studying for the week. The food and tea is amazing and totally relevant. Dave, one of the MBG people, works hard to set up lab each week and makes it such a delight for students each week. Truly one of the highlights of my classes at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0This lab is amazing, I would not change a thing! It is such a privilege to have access to all these plants in a beautiful environment, and you get to eat so many of them! The only thing that would have been nice is a practice session for the final as it was harder than I expected/included some plants that were not on the list of terms/families to know. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you get to learn about and draw cool plants in a relaxed atmosphere!\r\nWeaknesses - there were times where I was super confused about some aspect of identification but both the professor and the TA were helping someone else for an extended period of time. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Particularly for science majors who have been scarred by Chemistry Lab, this course was the complete opposite of what I think of when imagining a lab. How could you say no to three hours a week in a warm greenhouse, drawing pictures of plants, drinking tea, and eating food from whatever part of the phylogenetic tree you're currently studying? There's also a tendency sometimes in labs for TAs to do all the work, while the professor is barely (if at all) present, but that was certainly not the case here. Our TAs were excellent and helpful and always available to answer questions or go more in-depth on a particular topic, but Michael was also always there to check-in on how we were doing, point out fun and weird characteristics, and tell stories about his years of botanizing. This lab was one of the best and most relaxing parts of my week. ",
            "\u00a0Yestake it especially if you love plants and love food ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who really enjoys learning about plants. ",
            "\u00a0Lab was the highlight of the class, and I really enjoyed this as a nontraditional lab and way to learn about the material in a hands-on setting. However, it isn't easy, and if you aren't committed to taking the class, then it's not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Only enjoyable lab I've ever taken for an Sc course. Not super structured which I know stressed some people out...I would recommend bringing your textbook to help with IDing structures, that definitely helped me get more out of lab time! The TF to student ratio is pretty low but I think both sections were slightly oversubscribed this year ",
            "\u00a0YES. I would totally recommend the plant lab. It went along great with the associated course and the teachers and teaching fellows were always available to answer any questions. There were frequently snacks in the lab and everyone basically just took there time hanging out, drawing plants, and learning their characteristics. One of the most enjoyable courses I've taken thus far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes take this lab! You'll look forward to it each week. Honestly such a legendary lab. ",
            "\u00a0Take it, it is such a fun, stress-free lab. I looked forward to it each week. ",
            "\u00a0You'll only ever take this if you're taking Plant Diversity and Evolution, but the full package is completely worth it - the lab was a great way to actually see all the cool characteristics Professor Donoghue talks about in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This lab is even more stress-free than orgo lab. Seriously, it hardly feels like work. You'll spend your time dissecting flowers, making botanical sketches, and sipping teas from the clades you're looking at. It's held in the greenhouse, which is absolutely the loveliest place on campus. "
