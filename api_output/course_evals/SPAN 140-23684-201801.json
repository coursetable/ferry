            "\u00a0The course was great and should not be changed. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that one of the weaknesses of the course was the speed of the course and the difficulty of the material. We covered many advanced and new grammar concepts in a very short time frame, and I sometimes felt lost or confused. \r\n\r\nI believe that the biggest strength of the course was the range of literature and poems we read because they helped illuminate the different ways that Spanish can be used as an art as well as practically. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good about making the student more fluent with the language, which is a big focus of the course but I felt like the exams only tested absolute perfection of the grammar rules, which did not really agree with the course goals. "

            "\u00a0Yes great course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to a student looking to improve their Spanish, but I would also warn them about the very high workload and intensity of the course. It is very difficult to achieve a high grade due to the workload, difficulty of tests without a curve, and the harsh grading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed this course and learned new things about the history of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good course but be prepared to perfect your spanish grammar. "
