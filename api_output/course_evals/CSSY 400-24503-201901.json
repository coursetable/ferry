            "\u00a0I learned about the frameworks of leadership and innovation. Through case studies of a wide range of Americans, I was able to understand the manners in which social, technological, and political leaders came to their positions of influence and how they retained those roles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different American leaders throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned different frameworks of leadership and methods of entrepreneurship through case studies of different American leaders and innovators ",
            "\u00a0This class is about teaching leadership. For many Yale students who claim to be \"leaders\" and for an institution that claims to produce \"leaders\" few have tried to think or see the world through lenses of leadership. This class introduces students to literature on leadership as well as greater leaders in history. The knowledge that is gained in this class can provide a strong leadership framework for students to build off later in life. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyed learning about different leaders and the leadership models. Felt it was super applicable to my life and knowledge gained was very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking skills ",
            "\u00a0Engaging with leadership styles, analyzing great leaders and their impacts, assessing my own leadership practices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basic ideas on leadership but most of the class was surveying the biographies we read and then answering factual questions. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the subjects and cases it studied. Also, Professor Baldwin was extremely engaging and insightful. The weaknesses of this course were that the leaders chosen to study could have been cast from a more diverse background of fields. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class because the students were always really well prepared and the conversations we had as a class were incredibly stimulating. I quickly began to look forward to Thursday nights because I was excited for another class. The biggest weakness of this class is that it lacked diversity. Each week, we discussed one great American leader, and each week the leader was a male caucasian (bar one week where we studied Martin Luther King Jr). As a result, the class was very repetitive and reflected the views of our past but hopefully not those of our future. They could have incorporated at least a few women or POC. ",
            "\u00a0The reading selections were all excellent and covered a wide breadth of business, technology, and military areas. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class is well run as it is right now. It was my most enjoyable class this spring. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness was the lack of diversity in leaders studied. I think while US history is limited in its offering of female and minority leaders, the class would be improved by seeking out those individuals who do represent these groups. This would reduce the repetition of similar people studied. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are how nice the professor was, how experienced he was, how he started sharing his experiences after midterm feedback. Another strength is how well he took feedback! Improvement would be to do with the readings...some were not too intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is Professor Baldwin's own experiences, but he does not share very often. The weakness is that it hardly made me think in discussion. We mostly just regurgitated events from the books without synthesizing ideas. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would. The course was engaging and very practical. Definitely learned lessons for later in life ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because I personally loved it, but I would hope in the years to come Prof. Baldwin will chose to incorporate more diversity. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It explored a different area of education that is not normally covered by traditional academic areas. If Yale wants to continue to produce young leaders, leadership is important to study ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Baldwin is a great instructor. He is my first professor to come from outside academia and his areas of expertise and teaching style are more suited toward my long term goals. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was so interesting and doing the readings didnt seem like work. For the right person, this class has the potential to be a Yale favourite. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, awesome professor and class ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they're looking for something that's not too hard but will still give you lots of food for thought if you engage. It's a self-driven course I would say. ",
            "\u00a0It's chill and that is worth something, but overall I would have been much more engaged taking something else. "
