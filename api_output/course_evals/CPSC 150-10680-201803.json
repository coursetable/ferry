            "\u00a0We discussed the question of whether software can properly simulate the human mind. ",

            "\u00a0The semester revolved around the question: \"Can machines think?\" It's a complex question with many nuances. We approached the question from many angles. Professor Gelernter pushes you to write clear and concise paragraphs. It is a fantastic writing style for the modern era. We need important information in as little time as possible. I care about your ideas and clarity of your sentences. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Turing machines and their relevance in the modern day pursuit of AI and machine consciousness. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about various arguments on whether we will ever create a functioning human-like mind out of a computer ",
            "\u00a0Thinking philosophically. Looking at different arguments related to the philosophy of mind and thinking critically about them to create my own argument. Writing very CONCISELY was a main skill I developed. "

            "\u00a0Cannot say enough bad things about this class. Professor Gelernter is a very funny and knowledgeable guy, but he is a horrible, horrible professor. He fails kids on papers, and then when they try to meet with him he just doesnt even show up. He makes you send him a draft of your papers before you submit them because if you dont he will give you somewhere in the range of a C-F. BUT, he doesnt even answer his emails. So youll send him a draft to be edited and he will literally not answer. And then youll turn in the paper and get a C. Its the most arbitrary grading system ever. He claims it isnt and theres specific things hes looking for but I have submitted a draft to him for corrections and then on the final paper I got a horrible grade and he corrected his own corrections. Professor Gelernter couldnt even remember the sentences he created in my paper and then ripped them to pieces. If thats not an arbitrary grading system I dont know what is. This class is probably the least amount of work for a writing class just because of how short the assignments are, but it will be the most effort youll ever put into a 200 word assignment. Do not take this class. Do a little bit of work in another WR credit and get a better grade. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting but sometimes got sidetracked. However side tracking kept the lecture interesting and made sure I didnt skip any class. ",
            "\u00a0The initial paper was difficult to write as the professor provided little guidance prior to its submission. The feedback on papers was clear and concise and I feel I improved in my writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, but extremely unorganized class with no syllabus, no sense of what the weekly readings were, no readings uploaded or linked on canvas, and extremely erratic and seemingly random grading. ",

            "\u00a0Hell no. Cannot say enough bad things about this class. Professor Gelernter is a very funny and knowledgeable guy, but he is a horrible, horrible professor. He fails kids on papers, and then when they try to meet with him he just doesnt even show up.

            "\u00a0Yes.  Excellent professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it felt like a class in which I truly learned about the human intellect. You dont have busy work but the level of discussion is much higher than any other class. One of the classes I will remember after I graduate. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for an easy writing credit that isn't a lot of writing and have interest in what it means to have a \"mind\", then YES. \r\nKeep in mind though that it is 80% lecture, and that the professor is late about 50% of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Gelernter is great. He will help you improve your writing. The topic is also very interesting. I enjoyed going to class. ",
            "\u00a0I would thoroughly recommend this course as long as you're not too hung up on grades. Professor Gelernter's grading style is difficult to unpack and I received a fairly poor grade on my first paper but went on to improve significantly on the rest. Unfortunately, the significance of the final paper in grading is a bit unclear so I currently have no idea what my final grade will be and could feasibly have ended the semester on an A or a C. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a very low workload writing credit, take this course, but just know that the grading is extremely erratic and sometimes seemingly random, so you might not have much control over your grade. The prof grades only on writing style and flow, so if he doesnt like yours you may be in trouble. ",
            "\u00a0No. While I think Professor Gelernter is an extremely intelligent and extremely knowledgeable person, the class was incredibly disorganized which made it difficult to learn. "
