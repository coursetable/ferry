I also feel more comfortable engaging in conversations with those to practice Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism because I have a better understanding of their worldviews and beliefs. "

",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this course exposed students to a wide variety of literature, tradition, and belief in a short semester. The assignments were also extremely reasonable and I feel gauged my grasp of the course material. \r\n\r\nSuggestions: I really enjoyed the short lectures given in the beginning of the class periods early in the semester. After a while, however, the focus shifted to us and our paper development. While this is extremely helpful in receiving feedback and stay ing on task for writing a large research paper, I think it would have benefited us to also receive some historical or cultural lectures to open the class.
