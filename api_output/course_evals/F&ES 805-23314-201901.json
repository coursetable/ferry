I know the culture in econ is to constantly interrupt and ask questions, but I felt that too often we would get hung up early in the presentation - often fairly aggressive questions are asked about methods and what the speaker is planning to do when they are still on the intro slide which seems inappropriate and counterproductive. I think the faculty should think critically about the seminar atmosphere they want to encourage. ",
