            "\u00a0Understanding ways of working with metal. Processes of working with metal including bending, cutting, shearing, different types of welding. Presentations of work by other artists and videos of raw processes involved in terms of working with metal helped to understand the conceptual underpinning behind working with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to weld, and to a certain extent, how to build things! ",
            "\u00a0Working with metal, operating the various machines, welding techniques, how to safely cut & weld sheet metal, exploring what art means to me and how it can be represented in 3D space, considering 'space' in art much more than I previously have, allowing myself to make mistakes and learn from them, increased awareness of the audience and their engagement with the piece and the space -- and figuring out how that conveys what I am trying to say. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about sculpture and welding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about metal sculpture and sculpture in general. I learned about shop equipment (welder, plasma cutter, etc.) as well as metal sculpture artists and ideas. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Great flexibility and freedom in the course to experiment on ways of working with metal, gradually understand the different tools in the shop. The structure of having two main assignments is great so that one can use the semester in a flexible manner and gradually make progress towards making the piece. I feel it would be great to have some conversations and discussions about readings regularly to complement the act of making with intellectual rigor and strong conceptual underpinning. Since it is an undergrad level class, there could be more flexibility in terms of visits to sculpture grad crit sessions or even sculpture grad students involved during our crits. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very practical and hands-on, we were given pretty much free rein in the shop space which I appreciated, there were always more skilled people available to help us. Improvements: being completely new to metal sculpture, I had no idea what was even possible to make at the beginning, which made me feel a little lost on my first project. Perhaps seeing examples of work in the first couple of lessons would help. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be nice if it were made more clear how the budget is used. Like, if you don't use any of the budget to order sheet metal for the first sculpture, you are still able to use it for the second sculpture. I felt like I didn't use any of the budget but I was still charged 150 but had less options to order stuff for the second project. Although, it all seemed to work out that everyone was able to make what they wanted to make so maybe this isn't really an issue.\r\n\r\nIt would also be nice if pdfs of the readings were posted on canvas, or reserved in the library. I didn't read some of the readings because I couldn't find a free source anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course because it was all about making. Once you learned the techniques and equipment (which takes about a week or so), you were free to make and explore on your own. The class was very loosely structured and most classes were work days. The iron pour, which was offered outside of class, was also a major high point. The class could do with some more organization. It would have been helpful if the links for the readings we were supposed to do were posted on Canvas or mentioned/discussed in class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Great exposure to understanding ways of working with metal and familiarity with working in the metal shop at the sculpture school. Also great to work with and get introduced to students at the sculpture school. Events like the Iron Pour were especially great, in terms of working together as a team with sculpture school students. ",
            "\u00a0I would, it was a very challenging but very rewarding course that made me explore art in a dimension I was previously unfamiliar with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in metal sculpture or just sculpture in general. "
