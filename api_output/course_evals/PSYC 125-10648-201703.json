            "\u00a0This class reveals so many of the important elements of early childhood education. You can learn so much about so many different ares of childhood education from the teacher's role, to the current policy and its implications, to parenting to development. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a ton about how infants work and how children develop throughout their life. The most educational aspect is definitely the observation, although the class is taught lecture style and has many qualified guest lecturers from a variety of fields who brought their own unique insights or shared research from their area of expertise. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating survey course in child development. The practicum was incredible and added so much to the learning experience. It was great to be able to see what we were learning in the classroom come to life in the daycare observations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what it means to take on the role of a participant-observer, something that had I not taken a class with a practicum component I would not have learned. I learned to write objectively about the children I was observing without injecting personal bias, a skill that is great to have in any profession. ",
            "\u00a0Students learn child-development patterns for children ages birth to five. Students have the opportunity to observe in one of three child-care facilities for the duration of the semester. Students are exposed to professionals working within the field. ",
            "\u00a0this course was a comprehensive understanding of how a child develops and the many influencing factors. I learned a lot about teaching, medical care, mental health, behavior, language, play, parenting etc. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class! A must take ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough understanding of different aspects of child development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much from the participant-observation sessions at the child care centers. I feel that being there defeats all readings in terms of the amount and the effectiveness of the learning. We learned mainly the various developments of the children, as well as the \"development of the parents\" and school-systems in the U.S. through lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I view kids and interact with them as well as helped me remember my own childhood and how I got to be who I am today. I learned how to observe as a participant and how to be a listener to the mind of others, especially children full of curiosity and energy. I especially learned the developmental process of children throughout the life stages and in their early education and just what shapes the important policies that regulate it. My insight from this course has been overarching in many parts of my life. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me synthesize a lot of information that I knew somewhat vaguely coming into the course into a much more concrete understanding. I really appreciated the classroom observation portion. I learned so much about the individual children in the Calvin Hill kindergarten, and about how the teachers watch and respond to them in turn. "

            "\u00a0I think one way that this class would be improved would be to create other opportunities at other schools for observations so that you would be able to experience a few different methods of teaching. But otherwise, if you are passionate about teaching and/or education, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- placement site was fantastic, and the teachers are very, very supportive of you throughout your journey. Professor Close is an absolute sweetheart, and the guest lecturers are very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses -- maybe a small one, but I feel like I didn't get to know anyone in the class because it wasn't taught seminar style. I also think the readings aren't super necessary, especially if you're doing readings on infants but observing preschoolers or vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest lectures and lectures, and the set up of the course with the daycare observations. One weakness were that some of the readings seemed to be a little outdated and were harder to get through. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Practicum component allowed you to apply concepts in class to a real-world early childhood education classroom. The guest lectures were amazing !\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the regular lectures were a bit boring and they could have benefited from greater audience participation ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths are the break-out sessions with professors and the organized presentations and discussions with experts in the field. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the observations and the different types of lectures we had and the time to discuss the children.\r\n\r\nNo present weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Nancy and Carla are amazing ",
            "\u00a0This class was great because of the observation hours at the day care centers. They really make the course! Unfortunately, I think that the readings NEED to be updated. There is a lot of older theory based stuff and almost no new research. The 2 journals that you submit look long and time consuming, but they really arent. You are writing about your observations and your thoughts so it goes by very quickly. This is a great WR class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lecture style and the breakout sessions! I would say that some of the weaknesses is that the readings did not seem applicable. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely the participant-observation at one of the child care centers. I got to see the complexity of development and teaching which is hard to understand just through readings. The lectures were also interesting but sometimes felt convoluted and unorganized. I wish there was more time allotted to sections, since that's when we really discussed each concept at the level of each child. ",
            "\u00a0I personally thought that the strengths of this course relied on the direct participation with children to directly apply the theory learned to actual life and interactions with kids and seeing them experience the developmental growth for yourself. As well, the many instructors and guest lecturers really opened the scope to so many other parts of childhood development, whether clinical, psychological, and even childhood policy. One point of improvement could be to allow for the students to visit a different age group for one week to experience a new group of kids and their diversity of interaction. This could even allow for a span of time away from the regular group to see just how much growth happens within two weeks for the kids. ",
            "\u00a0The classroom observation feature of this course is incredible. I think that overall the class did a really good job of weaving together observation, lecture, reading and discussion. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are passionate about teaching and education, this course is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If for nothing else than the placement site, take this class, if you can get in. Make sure you are willing to give 2.5 hours per week to your placement site, though. You can get away with doing none of the readings, but you can't skip placement, and if you want to, you shouldn't take the class. You will learn so much about infants and have a fantastic, fun, enriching time doing it. You will meet fantastic professors and experts in their fields and genuinely wonderful people who have chosen to devote their lives to early childhood education. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone with an interest in children or developmental psychology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in early childhood education. You learn so much about being a participant-observer and it's a nice change of pace to go to a daycare once a week for 2 hours. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a must for anyone who enjoys children. I would highly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in education, biological development, pediatrics, or early childhood care. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class. important for life and if you want to be a parent it is critical to understand these things. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course! Excellent experience that gave me a whole new perspective of all the work and thought that goes behind every aspect of early childhood education. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great because of the observation hours at the day care centers. They really make the course! Unfortunately, I think that the readings NEED to be updated. There is a lot of older theory based stuff and almost no new research. The 2 journals that you submit look long and time consuming, but they really arent. You are writing about your observations and your thoughts so it goes by very quickly. This is a great WR class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all Yale students. Even if you are not interested in education, it's a great opportunity to learn about children, which all of us may have one day! The teaching is not as organized as I had hoped (some of the materials are old, the lectures are a bit convoluted), but overall, I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0take it ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to any student at Yale, to discover just how amazing this group of little people is in our everyday lives, and to remember and appreciate their own childhood. You will learn a lot more than you'd ever think from the kids as much as the class. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing class if you have the chance to take it. Carla and Nancy are both so wise, and so kind and generous with their knowledge. The classroom observation portion is a fantastic opportunity especially, I think, if you've worked with young children before and are used to engaging directly with them. Making yourself just observe is tricky; it is also so, so rewarding. "
