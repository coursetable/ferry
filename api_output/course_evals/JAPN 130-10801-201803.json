            "\u00a0Learned Japanese ",
            "\u00a0It's a great intermediate language course that taught me enough to travel around Japan without issue! ",
            "\u00a0Extended grammar, vicabyrly, kanji etc. ",
            "\u00a0I developed more conversational and grammatical skills in Japanese while taking this course. I also expanded my reading comprehension and writing abilities, particularly in kanji. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write hundreds of Kanji and practice memorizing and recalling Kanji, which has helped me to become exponentially more literate in reading and writing in Japanese.  Moreover, I now know hundreds of new vocabulary words and many new grammar structures that I can use in conversation.  I feel much more comfortable writing in Japanese than I used to, and I am much better at translating written and spoken Japanese into English. ",
            "\u00a0Advanced grammar and reading small passages ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the spoken and written aspects of the Japanese language. I feel comfortable being able to hold more advanced conversations in Japanese as well as interpret different readings. I also feel comfortable writing short essays in Japanese. "

            "\u00a0High workload but well structured and very enjoyable! ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of work but is much better structured than L2. There are frequent quizzes but overall they are good preparation for exams. Difficult but a good class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was very rigorous and taught a lot of new material. Sura Sura is a great textbook and I liked using it and learning from it a lot. Teachers are good and care about students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The pre-Sura Sura kanji worksheets were very poorly done; it would have been very helpful to have all of the kanji that were associated with the kanji we learned available on the sheet or on the website, as the link to the MIT website did not work for some computers, and also isn't accurately teach all of the new combinations of Kanji. \r\nFor the oral presentation, having people write their own questions as they wrote the entire thing would have been easier than having someone else insert questions.\r\nOffice hours are not posted. B/B- grade average is not posted. ",
            "\u00a0Specifically, the first half of the course emphasizes work with the textbook JSL.  While I think the grammar structures used in this textbook were very helpful, the format of the textbook was very hard to follow at times and the wording used was very complicated.  Moreover, the way that Kanji were learned in this first half of the course was very disjointed such that single Kanji would be learned instead of learning them as how they fit into.  This was the biggest flaw of the course, but it also leads into the biggest strength of the course - the textbook that was used for the second half.  Surasura is an amazingly well organized textbook that made the learning of Kanji much easier and the understanding of grammar concepts easier as well.  I am excited that we will continue to use this textbook next semester, as I actually enjoyed reading and understanding the stories it uses to teach these concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the level of improvement that one can achieve through thriving in this course. Maruyama Sensei provided students with the enthusiasm for class that allowed for a positive work environment. Each day of class was enjoyable and everyone in the class felt comfortable asking various questions that would enhance our learning of Japanese. The single weakness of this course was that the time commitment per day was much higher than that of other classes since there was a vast amount of daily work, but because of this daily work, I felt that I was able to improve quickly.

            "\u00a0I absolutely would, the Japanese department at Yale holds some of the best and nicest professors I've met! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are serious about learning Japanese. No, if youre the type of person to complain about high workload/frequent homework. ",
            "\u00a0No, not unless they have the time and the capability to focus on this course and make it their number one priority. There is so much work everyday that sometimes learning Japanese is not very fun unless you can make it the thing you spend the most time on everyday. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of work but worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other Yale students, especially if they are interested in improving their Japanese language ability.  Students who are taking the course simply to fulfill the language requirement may not enjoy it, but I learned so much and was engaged in new, useful material every day in class.  That being said, it is certainly the hardest class I have ever taken, with a lot of homework each night and frequent assessments, but it was also my favorite class, and I sincerely believe that it has exponentially improved my language abilities in a relatively short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It'll be hatd but if you actually want to learn Japanese, it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to students who have taken the basics of Japanese since I believe that it will assist greatly with the process of learning the Japanese language. The class was enjoyable and was great for students interested in the course. "
