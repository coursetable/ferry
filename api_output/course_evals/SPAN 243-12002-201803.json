            "\u00a0I am now able to understand and write Spanish at a much more advanced level. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my Spanish grammar, reviewing and strengthening topics that were covered during high school. ",
            "\u00a0The class taught me about specific grammar rules in Spanish. With this knowledge, I was able to develop my skills in writing in Spanish, with a focus on grammatical structure. We also learned vocabulary and read stories in Spanish that helped to increase my fluency. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my command of Spanish grammar from learning more complex and nuanced grammar rules. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper knowledge of spanish grammar and speaking ability. ",
            "\u00a0Learned some more nuanced uses of Spanish grammar and refreshed a lot of the grammar I've learnt in previous years. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger understanding and familiarity with Spanish grammar, from imperfect/preterite tenses to indicative/subjunctive moods. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think this class is well designed, but sometimes the work can be repetitive and a little bit of overkill. ",
            "\u00a0It's a pretty standard Spanish course--you get out of it what you put into it. I found the readings and movies engaging, and the grammar exercises were about as painless as that sort of thing can be. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed reading stories and writing assignments; I feel like these helped me the most with my Spanish and allowed me to consider the culture of the Spanish-speaking world. However, I think a lot of the homework was pretty tedious and some of the textbook assignments felt a little bit robotic. I don't know if the fill-in-the-blank exercises were very helpful to my fluency, as it could be confusing at times about which rules to apply. ",
            "\u00a0The class is almost exclusively strengths, as the professor is very knowledgeable and encouraging, participating is not too intimidating, the instruction is very well organized and the expectations are clear. ",
            "\u00a0Theres a lot of homework, however it is very consistent each night and it is not hard. About 1-2 hours for hw due each class. I like the engagement in the course, but I wish there was a little more clarity on the material tested. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were the amount of material covered and the enthusiasm brought by the professor. Weaknesses in the course include the low-level engagement with students. The classwork felt monotonous and aired on the side of boring, and the homework largely felt like busy work. Course also could have included more conversational speaking. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized, the beginning of the semester starts with more basic grammar and advances towards more complex and difficult aspects of Spanish grammar. The course has a lot of assignments due every other day (M-W-F schedule), and the amount of work could be reduced since half of the assignments feel like busy work. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as it is both engaging and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a great course to take following AP Spanish in high school and it's nice to keep your brain engaged with another language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they feel like they need improvement in Spanish grammar, as this is the main focus of the class. However, I think that if someone wants to focus more on culture to fulfill an L5 requirement, this class might not be the right one. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course will increase your comfort with each facet of Spanish by building your knowledge of grammar conventions in a comfortable, collaborative learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they want to improve their spanish. This is not a gut. ",
            "\u00a0Only recommend to students who are keen on improving their Spanish grammar and are willing to dedicate the time needed to the course. The professor grades strictly in a way I was not used to based on my Spanish classes from high school. Homework can feel like a time-consuming chore, and in order to get the most out of this course, you'll have to dedicate a large chunk of time to reviewing and studying the work. As someone only taking this class my first semester to fulfill the foreign language requirement, I decided to put more work and effort into my other courses instead of this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with Profesora Seymour as she is a very engaging and supportive instructor. She is always available to discuss your work and easily reached via email. The material in the course helps make students stronger Spanish-speakers. "
