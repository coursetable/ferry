            "\u00a0This course is great - but to the point at which it might be a little too chill. All lectures are recorded/streamed, so you feel even less of a need to go to class, and often times you just end up never watching the lecture. You get what you put into the course - so if you really want to learn it, you can definitely go to lecture and do the homeworks - otherwise, a lot of times many groups would just read the notes and do the homework the night before. JDRS is a great professor though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a blessing and a curse; JRS is a FABULOUS lecturer, and he records all the classes and has incredibly comprehensive notes with very straightforward problem sets. Because of this, there isn't a HUGE incentive to go to class, especially if you have a lot of statistics experience. I was able to complete all the problem sets simply looking at the slide deck, which is really convenient, but I would have gotten more out of the class if I actually went (this is totally on me, but it's easy to fall into this mindset). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material in the course is great - a lot of statistical techniques that I have not learned of before and that may actually be useful for the future. Also, JDRS is great and presents the material in a way that is very easy to understand. Not much work at all - just 6 psets and a final project that can all be done in groups. ",

I would suggest focusing less on the nitty gritty math details in lecture (which you overall don't need to know for the problem sets) and doing more actual coding. Toward the end of the semester, I found myself not even watching the lectures and then teaching myself how to do the homeworks with the code Jonathan provided (which was super helpful). There is also a VERY long turnaround to get grades back on homeworks (sometimes a homework would be due before you even got the grade for the one before it). ",

A point of improvement would be to offer more detailed feedback about mistakes that were made in the various homework assignments and how such mistakes can be avoided in the future. ",

Because of that, psets were largely finding the code chunks we needed from his notes and plugging in our data. For that reason, I don't think I have nearly as strong of a grasp on the details material. Rather, I have more of an overall views and could do it in R if I had to. \r\n\r\n*To be fair a lot of it is fairly advanced math, linear algebra, etc., hopefully I can take a later stats+math courses that go into the background of these methods ",

            "\u00a0Strengths are that it teaches you a variety of data analysis techniques but a weakness is that they are very hard to understand. I don't feel like I completely understand any of the material or how to analyze the results of the data analysis technique, even though I know how to do it in R ",

            "\u00a0There are so many problems with this course: the format makes it easy to never go to lecture, never watch the (recorded) lecures, and copy from his notes to the homework. The examples are very pertinent to graduate students (many of whom are working on projects that are similar to the ones he discusses), but the material isn't as relevant to undergraduate students who are not actively conducting research. Unfortunately, Yale S&DS has a dearth of other courses at this level (past the beginner level, more applied and not super theoretical courses), so many students don't really have another choice, and the alternatives either aren't running or are just as bad. Seriously, though, I had so many friends taking this course at the same time and none of us learned anything besides how to copy his code to do the psets. That said, he's a good lecture and the lecture slides do make for some good reference material for later on. ",
            "\u00a0It's very structured which is nice. ",
            "\u00a0This class was good. I think that not having exams makes it a lot lower stakes. ",
            "\u00a0This course had interesting homework assignments. I liked that we got to work with our own datasets, which meant that we got to do an actual project based on a real dataset. ",
            "\u00a0Great content, easy to keep up, fun lectures. ",
            "\u00a0It was both a strength and a weakness that this course was so self-directed and customizable. It was very convenient to have video lectures and no exams, but that meant I wasn't very motivated to actually learn the material, so long as I could follow the provided example code to complete the assignments. I also did feel like the class focused on the application of the statistical methods we covered more than the theory, so I feel very reliant on built-in software packages-- I sort of wish we'd had to write our own functions at some point to really learn how all this stuff works. But really, it's mostly my fault for not putting the hours in-- it's just that this course was a lot easier to blow off than my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0The TA office hours could be located closer to central campus. Otherwise, the accessibility of the lectures online was very helpful for my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures recorded, group psets/projects \r\n\r\nWeakness: group psets - east to rely on group members and not worry so much about learning the material oneself ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn how to really use the skills learnt using real life data\r\nWeaknesses: You can get away without learning much; Google can reveal just as much. The problem set grading is opaque as you can use your own data set. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: recorded lecture. Never have to go to class. Easy to understand. Easy problem sets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: for a lot of the hw you can base it off the example code so at the end its easy to realize you didnt learn as much as you thought. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, but JDRS does a PHENOMENAL job teaching. He is smart, engaging, funny, and knows how to explain topics well. He singlehandedly makes this class great. The problem sets were usually insightful and enjoyable, but occasionally they were not worded well or asked questions that were impossible to do in one of the recommended coding languages. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the slides and lectures. Weakness was the assignments - too broad. ",
            "\u00a0This was much more my fault than the class's, but the entire class is recorded and Professor Reuning-Scherer puts no pressure on you to attend class in person, so its very easy to become disengaged with the class. I think it might have been better to encourage students to come to class in-person, and use the videos as a backup. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very accommodating and flexible, with video lectures and biweekly group problem sets. JDRS is also very enthusiastic about the course. The course could be improved by having better organized content and slides -- I oftentimes felt that the course only haphazardly tried to go into the mathematics/mechanics of each form of statistical analysis. I would have much preferred that the course either took the mathematics/mechanics head-on and went into more detail or chose not to explain the mechanics and only give a brief overview, as I felt that I didn't fully understand the math behind the multivariate analysis techniques given the brief amount of time we spent on it. I also wish that we got more detailed feedback on the problem sets (more than just a grade on the rubric) and got it much earlier so that we could incorporate this feedback into the subsequent problem set. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good explanations of theory behind methods/approaches, accessible video lecture format \r\nWeaknesses: the lack of full explanation behind the code (many things the professor just provided source code rather than walking us through how to actually perform that technique), psets that could not be completed in one language (if you are going to say you can use any language to complete the homework, then make sure you provide enough instruction on how to do so or write a pset that you do not need to switch between programs to finish) ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths:* JDRS is an excellent teacher. Hes readily available, friendly, and patient. Hes very knowledgeable and knows how to make difficult, abstract concepts engaging, interesting, and accessible. The class is extremely well structured. Everything was very organized and laid out far in advance which made for relatively low stress. JDRS posts comprehensive PDF coursenotes (with lots of graphics and jokes!) on Canvas which are a great resource for reviewing the class material; there is no textbook for this course, and JDRS coursenotes are a worthy replacement! JDRS also posts sample code for the homework psets to help students who have less experience coding getting started, and I feel like regardless of your coding background, your coding will improve by working through this course. Another great plus is that the psets encourage you to apply the multivariate techniques taught in class to a dataset of your (and your partners -- up to 3 others!) choosing, so the work youre doing feels personally meaningful and interesting. If one weeks technique isnt applicable JDRS also posts loaner datasets. Psets are due every two weeks. Grading is based on your explanation/rationalization of results, and psets often have opportunity for extra credit for completing optional, nonparametric techniques at the end. The final project is pretty much an amalgamation of your previous psets. Classes are livestreamed and archived online, so if you miss a class you can go back and watch it whenever you want from your laptop. TA office hours are also held nearly everyday, and JDRS has office hours twice a week. I thoroughly enjoyed this course.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* In some places, the lack of lots of math left a few questions that couldnt really be answered unambiguously, but such is the nature of teaching with an emphasis on conceptual understanding, which overall I believe was very effective. The course notes had a few equations that made conceptual sense, but they seemed to be obscure enough that I couldnt corroborate them anywhere online, and wiki gave different math definitions for the same operations. Also grading conceptually on analysis meant that sometimes it could be unclear what constituted a complete, full-credit answer (answers were always to be written in plain English). Before turning in your pset, it really is necessary to check in with a TA to have them skim your work and get their opinion on whether or not theyre looking for a line or two that you omitted. I feel like in general though, weaknesses here are pretty minor and this is clearly a course JDRS has spent a lot of time over the years refining to where it is today. "

Besides that, I think it's a good class. ",

The rubric seemed very vague as if to try and help students out. Also, the group psets were very nice. I did little work on my own, and thus may have suffered in learning to apply the theories I'd learned. ",

The professor provides tons of code examples, so an experienced coder will find that the setting up the analysis takes very little time compared to many classes (where much of the time is spent learning the packages, troubleshooting, etc). Highly recommend. ",

            "\u00a0Your experience of this course is highly dependent on how much work you put into it. Since it's a semester-long group project, it is entirely possible to not go to lecture, not watch the video lectures, and still do well just by looking at the example code for the problem sets and applying it to your own dataset. That doesn't feel very fulfilling, though, so I can't say I'd actually recommend doing that, even though it does help out if you're taking a lot of heavy-workload classes at the same time. I wish that I'd gone to more lectures so that I could have had a better understanding of the statistical methods-- though the class was more application-focused than theory-focused to begin with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is very interesting for any student in the social sciences who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of more sophisticated analytical techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would suggest. The professor is very accessible and he makes sure that the topics are easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0If your interested in an intro to multiple different multivariate statistical methods of analysis than yes. JDRS is a good professor, he records the lectures so you dont have to go to class, and you can work in a group on all psets and projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Easy but you learn a decent amount. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You learn a lot, and JDRS is great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about a wider variety of statistical techniques than you get in 230 or 238 this is a good course to gain some understanding of how and when to use multivariate techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn so much in this class and have the opportunity to apply it to a subject area you like. Its a must take! ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they are willing to go to the actual lecture and not just watch the video lectures -- Given the infrequent nature of problem sets, it's really difficult to learn from just the problem sets and reading the slides, and students won't get much from the course if they don't actively try to go to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, despite the occasional lack of explanation and generally low buy in into the class, the material is still interesting enough to warrant taking it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. I learned so much about multivariate statistical techniques (emphasis in 363 is on learning techniques to apply to data, vs. 361 where emphasis is on analyzing data and choosing techniques) with both a moderately in-depth mathematical understanding as well as a very strong visual/conceptual understanding. It really changes how you think about statistics in general. JDRS is great, the course structure is great, the online component is great, choosing your own data and your own group is great, and working extensively with R is great. Grading was fair and there were no surprises in this course -- everything was laid out far in advance which made for relatively low stress. JDRS even extended certain pset deadlines when he saw people were in crunch-mode around midterms. He really cares about all his students and wants to make sure everyone understands. This was easily one of the best classes Ive taken all year. "
