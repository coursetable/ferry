            "\u00a0My writing improved so much! And I was able to think about my life through the essays because they are designed to be very personal. This ended up being my favorite class of the semester, and I am so grateful to have been able to cultivate the skill of writing. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to be unafraid of simply putting what I think and feel on paper and then playing around with it. The kinds of essays we wrote were so different from ones I'd previously written, but they allowed me to work through things that have been on my mind for a while. They also broadened my horizons in terms of how I think about writing as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I picked up an understanding of the form of the essay, how to write with a digressive and personal voice, and how to draft well.  My confidence in my natural style grew immensely.  I love writing now far more than I did when I began the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to constructively read and write, what my writing strengths and weaknesses are, and how I can improve my writing in the future. ",
            "\u00a0How to structure and develop a personal essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write! More specifically, I learned to apply a narrative style characteristic of creative writing to a nonfiction setting, while also learning to emulate other writers in voice and style. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 taught me how much work writing is, but also how useful a medium it is for exploring things that really matter to you. I kind of came in with the mindset that I'd just be writing for class, but throughout the semester, essay writing became less of an assignment and more something I did for myself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what essay-writing is. A virtuosic medium which trades in uncertainty in order to create meaningful and meditative pieces of writing, there are so many possibilities. I think my own writing improved very significantly and I zoomed in on some strengths and learned to be more clear and put together writing that is both complex and highly effective. Also was confronted with my limitations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a personal essay and also read a text and learn techniques from reading. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me figure out what an essay really is and taught me many different, useful styles of essays. It also helped me learn how to give and receive constructive criticism comfortably and how to be more open and confident in my writing. "

            "\u00a0We read some incredible essays this semester, pieces of writing I will no doubt return to in years to come. They provided the foundation for us to work on our own writing. At times we didn't have time to get to all the essays we read, but even reading them on our own proved very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a really balanced structure that feels well designed to teach the skills it focuses on. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: reading selection, open discourse in class that encourages all to participate, and Shifra!! \r\nweaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: the grading was too subject to the individual professor's style and preferences. There wasn't much standardization across the various 120 sections, and it seemed like what would be frowned upon in one professor's class was celebrated in another's. \r\nStrengths: the personal feedback and the amount of individual attention that students received was unparalleled. ",
            "\u00a0Often in class, we would focus on only one or two of the five or so essays we were asked to read. Therefore, I found it hard to prioritize my readings. On the one hand, we got through a lot of repertoire -- on the other hand, I didn't feel that I was prepared in every class to delve in-depth into the correct readings. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:\r\n-workshops: getting feedback from my peers, and then having Shifra use that as a basis for her feedback for me was really helpful \r\n-one-on-one meetings: a lot of the times they helped me get a better idea of how I wanted to revise my essays, but sometimes, even just talking through ideas I had for a piece I'd felt particularly unmotivated to write helped inspire me\r\n\r\nweaknesses:\r\n-I know this is generally not known to be a reading-intensive course, but I still spent a lot of time doing close-readings of the essays we were assigned. we discussed this in class but I would've preferred to have been given an idea of what readings we were going to focus on in class in advance so that I could really try to focus on those ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lovely and complicated syllabus of essays to read, a very special and warm class environment, workshop dynamic can be productive, personal attention from the professor very valuable; Shifra is an unforgettable person, to me\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/improvements: sometimes the criticisms of our own work were so meta as to be too vague; workshop format can feel unproductive when students have a million different critiques; I often wished criticisms of my essays were even more directed and productive ",
            "\u00a0I think maybe honing the reading list a little bit, but overall the course was excellent and that is my only minor feedback. Maybe it would be helpful if we spent part of a class learning how to edit and critique other students work effectively for workshops. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the open structure of the class, where everyone was communicating with everyone about their essays and the examples of essays we read for the class. It was a really eye-opening experience to learn about what other people care and think about a lot and therefore choose to write about while also learning numerous essay-writing skills. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! English 120 was my favorite class this year. Aside from the fact that I had a wonderful professor and group of peers, one of the reasons I loved this course was that it truly is for everyone; it seems that one of the things it allows you to do is just write your truth and grow as an individual writer and thinker. I happen to love writing, but there were people in my class who had never taken a writing course before and still enjoyed it immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely.  Learn to write authentically and have more fun when writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend it all the time! It's incredible for really just learning about writing styles and self-improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to students who wish to develop their personal writing skills--that is, how to articulate one's own thoughts and experiences, which is a very different style of writing than most Yale students have had experience with. However, because the personal essay is so particular and characteristic, I don't know how applicable the skills picked up in this course would be able to translate to writing for other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I learned to write in a way that I'm not convinced I would have otherwise. My writing improved greatly, and I pretty much got to write about whatever I wanted. ",
            "\u00a0take it!!!! please!!! but only if you have the time and energy to invest in the class, because it's a lot of work. shifra is great and really helps you grow as a writer ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was an especially good way to approach creative writing without the intimidation of producing fiction or poetry: an accessible form. Reading for craft is fun if a lil confusing. Reading some of the essays felt very enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is super fun and engaging because the reading material is interesting, the essays are really open ended and short so theyre not too hard to write, and youll get to know the other students in your class really well. Take it with Shifra if you can get into her section! She is amazing and gives great feedback. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn how to write many different types of essays and be in a discussion-type class with a lot of peer review and open conversation, this is the perfect class to develop your writing skills. "
