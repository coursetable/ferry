            "\u00a0This class helped me to grow as a writer with the concise and helpful feedback and office hours that Professor Guy provides. We learned how to write critical analysis and comparison of texts, but people of all levels of experience seemed to be learning and engaging with the materials and format equivalently. ",
            "\u00a0I dramatically improved my ability to compose high-level, well reasoned arguments that really built to a worthwhile conclusion--Professor Guy provides so much support on essays that really helped the entire class tighten up their writing skills. I also learned to think critically of fantasy as a genre and about the conventions and implications of fantasy. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar taught me how to analyze fantasy texts and write quality papers. Professor Guy is incredibly helpful in his comments on our papers. I learned how to write quality analytical essays that reveal a deeper meaning in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to discuss works of film and fiction critically, and also about the process of analytical writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course was mostly about interpreting the whole genre of Fantasy. It was interesting to see how different texts worked together, and how other texts defied common expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about literary analysis and humanity and fantasy and other students and everything in between. We all bounced off each other wonderfully, and brought new insights to the table - I would say I learned as much from other students in the seminar as I learned from the (incredible) professor. Our writing was both creative and analytical, and both types of writing were thoroughly improved for me through effective feedback from the professor and other students. I learned so much more about the value of fantasy and its reverberations through culture, politics, history, and society. I left nearly every class feeling inspired by the passion displayed and with a deep sense of excitement for the next lesson, with new ideas reverberating in my brain. "

            "\u00a0This course is how I had hoped all Yale courses would be. The workload is manageable, and the discussions are fascinating. The students in the class got along well together, making the experience even better. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Guy is an incredible professor, and the material is amazing. I definitely wouldn't expect a fantasy class syllabus to have so much diversity in authors and topics and styles, but that is what made this course so special. The only weakness might be that there is a lot of material and it sometimes doesn't get the time and depth that would allow students to dig deeper, but the broad range allows for many interesting connections between all of the texts explored throughout. ",
            "\u00a0This class has 0 weaknesses. I loved this course so much and I have no interest in film or literature, nor do I have any experience with the fantasy genre. If you are in the amazing position of considering the course, consider this your sign--take it. Beg the professor to let you in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Guy is SO wonderful and engaged. He's genuinely excited and wants to make space for various opinions/thoughts/perspectives when discussing things, and is hands-on enough to keep things moving well. Honestly, our biggest problem was a lack of time--this course has a lot of texts, and there were many times when we probably could have continued discussing something for longer but had to move on for sake of time. Still, I liked the consistent screenings a lot and enjoyed the texts that we had, so it's hard to say there should have been fewer. Prof. Guy is also very open to feedback and each class's feedback gives him room to improve next class or next semester. A heads up, though: the grading in this class is pretty intense. I would HIGHLY recommend taking this credit/D, as Prof. Guy has high expectations and (as head of the writing center) does not give out high grades easily. It'll be less stressful for your GPA. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the seminar setting- provided for interesting and very involved conversation about course material with the rest of the class. Prof guy is a wonderful professor, and does a great job facilitating conversation without dominating it. The books and movies are all really interesting. Essays not too difficult but its still a writing credit. Definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the fantasy texts and the instructor. The texts are amazing! Kindred and Brown Girl in the Ring are two of my favorite novels ever. They are laced with powerful social commentaries, and were fantastic to analyze in class. Dr. Alfred Guy is one of the best instructors I have ever seen. He's incredibly engaging and facilitates discussions in a way few other professors can. Moreover, his feedback has helped me become a better writer. I gained much more from this course than I thought I would. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weaknesses of this course are the grading system, the fact that it meets once a week and that it wasn't super organized. This course is near impossible to get an A in. Professor Guy gives out more C's on papers than A's. Furthermore, I felt like we were barely in class. I feel like a course that meets twice a week would have allowed for deeper, more though out conversations. Professor Guy is fantastic and engaging, but not totally organized. For example, he provides really good feedback on papers, but  takes a long time to send that feedback. Also, minor note, but a few of the fantasy texts were not the best. For example, \"Field of Dreams\" was not an entirely great text which made the discussion less interesting than something like Kindred. ",
            "\u00a0This is a WONDERFUL course. It is thoughtfully put together, and discussions are extremely well run. There is also so much guidance in terms of the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fun class; you could tell everyone was pretty passionate about the material. For such a participation-heavy class, I found it a bit odd that grading was based solely on essays (not in class engagement,) though perhaps it was because no one needed much of an incentive to talk. Every session of this class felt too short to me, like there was always more to be discussed that we couldn't quite reach--this was occasionally frustrating, but certainly better than being bored. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are as above - engaging, informative, brilliantly creative, analytical and rigorous but with lots of room for energy, fun, and genuine passion & love for learning. The only weakness was the use of literary criticism in the course, which I felt we could have been introduced to more consistently, in a way that built up throughout the course, rather than all at once in an information dump. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this class is definitely worth taking, especially with Professor Guy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! This was my favorite class at Yale so far. I look forward to keeping in touch with other students and continuing to grow a library of fantasy books and movies. I would not say that I was very knowledgeable about the genre before, and yet, I learned a lot and didn't feel out of place in discussions. Everyone seemed to have their own interests and lenses to bring to the table. The creative writing element frightened me at first, but we were well-guided and it was so much fun to hear the short stories other students came up with. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Hands down. Take this course ASAP. Especially if you have 0 interest in film, or fantasy, or literature. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Guy is a wonderful human being and if you have a chance to take ANY class with him, you definitely should. But I especially recommend taking this particular seminar with him because it is such a joy. It is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale and the highlight of my week. There are a lot of texts: a movie every week and about 7 complete books to read, but they were all pretty great and discussions were incredible. Plus the texts were fun so it didn't even feel like work. ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you can get in, absolutely take it. It's the most lively, animated seminar you'll ever take--people felt comfortable around each other and there was a lot of productive discussion. I cannot recommend this class highly enough!!! Please do take it Credit/D though if you can--it'll allow you to get the most enjoyment out of the class without worrying about your grade. (For context: on the first essay, the highest grade was A- and only two people received that. The average grade moved slightly upward with each essay but it's HARD to get an A or A- overall) ",
            "\u00a0100% take this course. You watch some great movies and read classic fantasy books, and regardless of how familiar you are with fantasy it will stimulate your brain and make you view fantasy texts and movies through a different, more critical lens. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another students. The professor is great and the material and texts are fascinating. The texts are so much fun to read/watch, and I never imagined I would be watching Lord of the Rings for a class. Also, the papers are fun to write with great feedback throughout the writing process. This course is NOT an easy grade, and an A is almost impossible (no one got an A on any of our first three papers). You have to work extremely hard to do well on the papers but it is totally worth it. A gem of a writing credit that I am really glad I took. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. Professor Guy is such a wonderful teacher. He is the most thoughtful and considerate discussion moderator I've ever encountered-- he's incredibly brilliant and knowledgeable, but values each person's input and puts a lot of effort into helping you make your points in the best and strongest way you can. The reading list is lots of fun, and make sure you go to the weekly film screenings--they're a blast and help the class form a real community! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I'm sure anyone who's read within the genre of fantasy would enjoy this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It was incredible for my academic and personal development "
