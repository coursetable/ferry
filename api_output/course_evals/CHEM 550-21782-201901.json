            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class. Most of the topics we covered were things that I have come across before and expect to come across again, so it was great to learn more of the theory behind the different techniques and have a better understanding of what situations are best matched with which spectroscopic techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very useful for understanding spectroscopic methods of analysis with very practical applications in inorganic chemistry. I will definitely draw on what I learned in this class in my research! ",
            "\u00a0Different way to use spectroscopy to determine structures and dynamics for various situations. ",

            "\u00a0I do not have any complaints about this course. I think that a clear rubric to explain the grading of problem sets and exams would be helpful so that it is easier to learn what is being looked for. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course did a good job of giving a somewhat in depth taste of many techniques, including just enough theoretical background to understand what was happening. I liked the different guest lectures from postdocs and other faculty (Kaz and Anna did an especially good job). I would have appreciated working through even more examples to practice thinking through some problems. Not sure if that would mean more problem sets, or maybe a bonus problem at the end of a lecture to think about without giving the \"answer\" right away. Just a suggestion! ",
            "\u00a0There are too many methods. At the end of the semester, I felt like I'd only learn deeply one or two of them. Then again, now I know what all of them are used for. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. For anyone studying chemistry, no matter which subdiscipline, it provides helpful knowledge and skills that will definitely be used in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. This course is very helpful for anyone doing experimental inorganic chemistry. "
