            "\u00a0I built solid Chinese business writing and read skills from this class. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking improved by in class conversations with Chen Laoshi and classmates. My reading improved from the excellent readings she found for us from real newspapers. My writing improved from the in-class assignments. It is safe to say every aspect of my Chinese improved by taking this course. Although the focus was business, my Chinese improved in every field. ",
            "\u00a0Learned lots of really useful terms for discussing business on the global scale and lots of useful grammatical structures\r\n\r\nI was surprised by how much I could read and understand Chinese newspaper articles after taking this class ",
            "\u00a0learnt a lot of vocab and learnt a lot about international affairs, politics, trade, business as well "

            "\u00a0If you really want to improve your business Chinese, make sure you follow the optional assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Chen Laoshi is amazing. I will comment more about that below. Other than that, the other strength of the course is that it teaches us to learn how to read and discuss professional-level Chinese. That's very important. Actual news articles are a far cry from the simple language that is in a textbook, so having a class like this serve as a bridge from \"educational text\" to \"real Chinese texts\" is crucial. \r\n\r\nIn that vein, the course could be strengthened by having more original Chinese texts, and less focus on the textbook, which I felt to be too simple. \r\n\r\nOne other point: some of the other students are American Born Chinese, or even Chinese who came to the US after High School in China. Although I do not know if this class is educational for them, I will say that their presence in the class is very helpful to those of us who did not grow up speaking Chinese. I really liked being surrounded by people whose pronunciation was much better than mind. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of work but you learn a lot! \r\n\r\nThe workload could be toned down some because I felt like I was barely keeping up and the material was challenging. ",
            "\u00a0the textbook homework is a little tedious, but the rest of the material is engaging and you learn a lot. I like how we have a lot of opportunity for discussion "

            "\u00a0For those who want to utilize Chinese in real life settings, this class is a must take. ",
            "\u00a0If you finished the L5 classes and want a low-work class to continue to improve your Chinese, then absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great class! You learn a lot but you also have to put in a lot of work. Essays and presentations almost every other week means you'll never really catch a break. But you will definitely learn a lot if you have the time to dedicate to it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, fun and you learn chinese as well as learning new things about the world "
