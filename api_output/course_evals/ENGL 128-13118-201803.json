            "\u00a0I don't feel that I've learned many new skills from the course. A lot of what we learned in the class, I'd learned in previous classes, which makes sense since this is a 100-level course. We learned to close read, use archives, and connect texts to the world. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a variety of books written by authors from a multitude of different cultural backgrounds. I gained understanding of the complex relationship that many authors from previously colonized countries have towards choosing to write in English or their native language, and how that relationship towards the English language and the history and impact of the British Empire can be tangibly seen within their works. ",
            "\u00a0Emphasis on close reading / forms was useful developing arguments about a text based on those aspects of the text ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to literature from parts of the world I had never explored earlier, and I learnt how to write better papers. ",
            "\u00a0-I learned a lot about different cultures and historical eras\r\n-I got more comfortable reading different types of texts, such as poetic forms I hadn't seen before (ghazals), novels without conventional plot structures, et cetera\r\n-I learned a good deal about my classmates, as well, due to the nature of our engaging class discussions\r\n-HOW TO USE PROQUEST and other similar tools (super helpful) (I now use ProQuest for everything) ",
            "\u00a0I rally enjoyed taking a foundational English class in world literatures rather than the western canon. It was a very informational course in the ways in which literature and history interact, and colonialism has influenced the writing styles of many African, South Asian, and other diasporic literature. I was able to more understand postcolonial thought and literature, through the works we read and the discussions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading. Literary analysis. Discussion skills. How to handle a pretty significant reading load of fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of various postcolonial texts that I wouldnt have otherwise explored in the usual literature courses. I also developed the skills to conduct deep archival research into the periods and locations contextualising our texts. ",
            "\u00a0I hadn't really read any non-American or British English literature before taking this class, so the biggest thing I got out of this class was the chance to read from new perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use Yale's digital archives and, indirectly, the virtual private network since I had to do a lot of the work off campus. ",
            "\u00a0A broad survey of world anglophone literatures. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think that it attempts to include too much in a single syllabus. Most books were read in a single week, which meant we could never go that in depth into them, and the class suffers from the weirdness of \"World English Literatures\" as a construct. Since Yale insists on centering the literatures of England and white Anglophone countries, classes like this that are meant as fixes have to shoulder the burden of including early English, Caribbean, African, South Asian, Canadian, and Irish literature in one class that then strains to cohere. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all of the books that we read for class this semester, and found that seminars were structured well towards helping us understand the texts that we were reading, while also teaching us skills for how to write about these texts in papers. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussion was fantastic and Professor Richards really helped to facilitate it. The class grew a lot, in large part, because of her work as a teacher. One weakness I felt like a lot of the texts were overly-popular and didn't really belong in a classroom setting. The English department needs to really figure out what they want this class to be. Because, right now, it's not as meaningful as it should be. It's hard to do, because \"world literature\" doesn't really exist, but there's serious work that needs to be done in order to make this class worthwhile. There needs to be an overarching message or theme to all the work. I think, right now, it's something like \"global anglophone literature is, in large part, a result and response to colonialism.\" That needs to be drawn out more, and reading texts like the Munro and Synge don't really fit into the narrative. The point is this: what understanding does the class want me to walk away with? Right now, that's lost. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the teaching style was clear and engaging \r\nWeaknesses - discussion could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the syllabus is amazing and diverse, Professor Richards is wonderful, paper topics are flexible, workload is never excessive, welcoming and friendly classroom environment\r\nWeaknesses: honestly, none are coming to mind... you do have to do a fair amount of reading, so if you're a non-Humanities major looking for a gut, this isn't it... but if you're an enthusiastic English major, you will probably adore it (as I did) ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful class and I would say that anyone who needs a foundational English course should strongly consider taking 128. One difficulty that our particular class presented was that there were many students in class, so we often did small group activities or shared our thoughts about a novel going around the table, and sometimes these parts of class did not generate the most productive discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class didn't necessarily generate productive discussions. A lot of affirmation but not necessarily any pushes for students to build on each other's ideas or really theorize. At times could feel like a book club with everyone giving a reaction, which is helpful but only to a degree. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the texts and student discussion. Good intro lectures on time periods/ topics, too. Weakness were mostly unnecessary (in my opinion) group exercises (like idea maps, writing a \"good, better, and best thesis\" with a partner, etc.). Discussion would've been more fruitful in pretty much every case. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was definitely the variety of the texts in terms of form and location. Further, one strength was that we had to write different types of essays - regular/archival/long archival - that challenged us in different ways. A weakness could have been that some regions were not represented at all in the class, but I suppose you can never fully represent world literature within one seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone was encouraged to speak--I enjoyed doing round-table reactions. I liked the diversity of readings (in terms of geographic location, time period, style, etc.). I also liked getting historical context from lectures, although I never know whether I should be taking notes/absorbing the information in a more concrete way than listening. I didn't get as much out of the writing exercises. They might have been more helpful for first-years/non-English majors, so I understand why we did them, but to me they seemed like a review of pretty basic skills. ",
            "\u00a0It's good for learning about other cultures and how to use library resources. ",
            "\u00a0This course, though it had a pretty impressive syllabus, fell a little flat. We managed to somehow spend most of our discussion time talking about things that weren't relevant to the course. For example; we spent a really long time talking about realism and credibility in Robinson Crusoe and never actually talked about imperialism or the imperial mindset. The book is imperial propaganda. We spent a lot of time on form, which is fine for a foundational class, but we rarely used form to actually further a deep discussion of the actual themes at play in the texts. Also, Professor Richards, while warm, personable, and obviously knowledgable, was not proactive in shaping class discussion, and presented us with several activities that had little relevance to the topic at hand, which often seemed poorly thought out. The google maps activity, for one. Also, I was made deeply uncomfortable by the class where we were asked to close read a documentary photograph of the young boy killed during the soweto protests; in my opinion (which I would defend, heartily) you can't close read an image taken in a split second, of people dead and running for their lives. Talking about the composition of the photograph (allowing it to be compared to the pieta??) when in reality, it was taken in a moment of violence and unrest, is a useless, small violence in of itself. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in taking an English class that does not focus on the \"traditional\" English canon of white, male writers and who are looking for more exposure to a wonderful body of literature that does not normally get discussed in foundational English courses. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting texts (except Robinson Crusoe) and well-taught ",
            "\u00a0Yes! We cover very interesting texts and we learn a lot about the history and culture of places. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I read so many books that I now count among my favorites (\"Lives of Girls and Women\" and \"The God of Small Things,\" in particular), and each class discussion was lovely. Every student was always given the chance to speak his or her mind, and Professor Richards contributed so much with personal insights, videos, primary sources, et cetera. In addition, the workload is very reasonable, and paper topics are flexible, so you can write about what truly interests you. This is how every seminar should be! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Please do take it. It will allow you to better understand the way in which colonial legacy continues to shape our interactions with one another, our conception of the world at large, and the ways in which we dissect literatures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great introduction to post-colonial lit. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students, even those who are not English majors. It will encourage you to approach many texts that you would otherwise never heard of in high school or the other canonical literature classes. It will also force you to grapple with the issues of representation and postcolonial identity, which is very interesting because you learn a lot about the real world and not just literature in the process of doing so. ",
            "\u00a0If you're an English major or prospective English major, I definitely recommend this course. It's so different from the other foundational courses and really broadens your perspective, especially if you haven't read much world English literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great alternative to reading Beowulf if you want to be an English major and gives a broader context to English literature. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not, unless they were an English major. "
