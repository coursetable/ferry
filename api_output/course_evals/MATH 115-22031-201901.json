            "\u00a0Obviously I learned about single-variable calculus, but one thing I really felt I got out of it was the ability to visualize the mathematical concepts. Rather than memorize different rules and such, my teacher made it so I could visualize the problem and figure out formulas from there. ",

I felt like sometimes I would come in with more questions than I originally had, but at the same time it would leave me feeling frustrated because I didn't know what was going on. I did like that my professor was very ",

Brett Smith explained the concepts clearly and made sure that everyone was understanding the material. I liked the think, pair, share exercises which engaged everyone in class. ",
            "\u00a0I am not even gonna talk about the strengths. FLIP CLASSROOM IS STUPID! Periodttttttttt. I don't understand why Yale just can't teach math. You can't expect students to learn a subject on their own and come in with their own questions. There were so many students that didn't even know what they don't know. This class only benefits people that have taken Calculus 2 before ",
            "\u00a0The course is good overall. Every professor has a very different teaching style, so the course could benefit from standardization. Also, it is not ideal that there are students in the class who have taken Calculus BC or equivalent alongside students who never took AP Calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I don't like that it is a quasi flipped classroom in which we do homework assignments before the class where we learn the topic. I preferred the structure of Math 112. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great. Explorations made you think about the class beforehand, which I recognize as valuable. Sometimes the homeworks felt a little long, but I suppose this is necessary. ",

            "\u00a0I think that there was a big difference between what was asked of us in class and in the Psets, and in the exams (midterms and finals). The class could be improved by either making more clear what is expected out of students for the finals and midterms, or if the teachers taught us the actual material necessary to succeed! ",
            "\u00a0The course talks a lot about series and sequences, which is why I understood them more than trig functions. I think more time should be spend on understanding trig. ",

            "\u00a0I really thought my section was really helpful and I learned really easily from them. The teaching style was very interactive and kept me engaged. Professor Smith made sure we understood all topics and the way he wrote on the boarded highlighted was easy to follow and all the important ideas were easy to pick out and tell apart from examples. I think review sessions before exams could be better and the exams were also something I wish we could get more information time in advance. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths and weaknesses of the course depend entirely on whose class you are placed into at the beginning of the year. Because I had Dr. Smith, I thought the class was well-structured and well-taught, but I know others who said this class was absolutely awful because their professor offered no help. This is not a new problem for intro math courses at Yale, but it should still be fixed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class was that the professor was willing to help with problems that occurred. Some weaknesses of this course was that the midterms and exams were weighted very high, and it seemed to stress me out more with taking them. I also felt that the course went very fast and if you didn't understand something it became very hard to keep up with the class ",

            "\u00a0I thought the course was run very well - explorations were great introductions to the lecture material, the psets were difficult but not terribly long or in any way impossible, and there was support for learning in the form of office hours, review sessions, and peer tutors! ",

On the spreadsheet thing it says Math 115 or higher but Stats can cover this (and if you're pre-med this benefits you even more because stats is a requirement). I think the class is cool and all if you need it or are even interested in it, however, I mistakingly took it thinking I needed it and am now crying because my final is tomorrow and my GPA will be hurting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who likes Calculus, wants a challenging math course, or needs it as a requirement. The course is definitely harder if you haven't taken AP Calculus. I did not, but it seemed like most of my classmates had. ",

            "\u00a0Maybe; I think if you have a genuine interest in math you'll find the course engaging, but most people take it as a requirement so it's just eh. It's not too hard though if you put in some effort. ",

You learn so much over the course of the semester that I have to say this class was one of the most fulfilling ones I've taken in terms of the sheer knowledge you gain. ",
