            "\u00a0This class is focused on improving each student's poetry writing ability through writing assignments every week and reading contemporary poetry for class discussion. My writing improved drastically through what I learned from reading contemporary poets and the many workshops that we did in class of each student's work. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a crash course in the craft of contemporary poetry. You read a ton and write a ton and learn a ton. I've really learned that I love writing, and feel more equipped to pursue poetry in a more deliberate and polished way after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I want to write: I learned how to \"shoot the cheese\" but I doubt future students will get the reference. What I mean by that, is that I learned how to think outside the box when it comes to writing poetry. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed my life. It served as a brilliant introduction to reading and writing modern poetry, a broad but also deep survey. Perhaps more importantly, though, through this course I found a valuable way to grapple with the deepest questions that have faced me throughout my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Ability and confidence in writing poetry; ability to read, analyze and better enjoy poetry; more insight into my own work and tendencies in writing and how I can improve ",
            "\u00a0I honed my skills at writing, editing, and critiquing poetry. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The shift from reading contemporary poetry to writing our own poetry was great because we saw the advice the professor was giving us utilized in practice my accomplished poets. The workshop component of the class was by far my favorite and the most beneficial. We would, as a class, go over poems by students in the class and spend 20 minutes analyzing and giving advice - it was very constructive. ",
            "\u00a0This was maybe the best course I've taken at Yale. I don't know how it could be improved. David is so organized and so dedicated, if you take it and do the assignments, you will grow as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gorin makes this course incredible. He created a learning environment that I had never encountered before at Yale: intimate, tight-knit, honest and stress-free. I love how our group got closer as we learned more about poetry - I was always looking forward to class. My favorite part of the course had to be the workshops when we would read other students' poetry. It was incredible to dive into their worlds and discuss their poems as a group. The one-on-one meetings with Gorin were also a perk: never before had I met a faculty member who took so much time to write about my writing, and made the effort to meet on a regular basis to discuss it in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course overall! Super engaging and a lot of feedback and collaboration. Got no grades along the way though so I had no idea what my final grade would be like. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! The structure is wonderful. Splitting time between reading poetry and workshopping our own writing is a great structural model, and there really feels like an arc to the course that climaxes in a project that marks one's growth in the course. Nothing feels random; all feels intentional. ",
            "\u00a0- Really knowledgeable, committed and helpful professor\r\n- Great reading material + assignments\r\n- Healthy and engaging classroom dynamic\r\n\r\nNot sure how it could be improved. "

            "\u00a0Phenomenal course for anyone interested in poetry. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in poetry at all, take this course. If you don't know if you're interested in poetry, but you're looking for a creative outlet or wanting to try something new in a fun environment, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!!! Life-changing and wonderful. The sort of classroom experience you daydream about before coming to Yale, but in real life. ",
            "\u00a0YES !!!! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale !! It will make your heart blossom I promise !! It is good for the soul, so much fun and extremely freeing !! ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class! I learned so much about my writing, myself, and my classmates. It was an incredible semester - reading poetry from the other students in the class and career poets, while writing our own. The class had weekly writing assignments, which weren't too much work, but a ton of readings. Gorin wanted to meet with each one of us once every week or two to give individualized feedback and check in. ",
            "\u00a0A million times yes. David Gorin is an amazing professor, very knowledgable, generous, and invested in his students. I did the assignments and participated in discussion because I wanted to and because I personally benefitted from them -- an educational experience that more rare than it should be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you dont like poetry, this is an amazing intro poetry course to take. It introduces you to a variety of aspects of the way poetry works and encourages you to engage personally with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Certainly. Great for any level of poetry reader/writer. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fanstastic course and I would recommend it enthusiastically to any student who is interested in the subject.\r\n\r\nIt is intense: there is a lot of reading and writing, but you feel the stakes of each assignment in this class. I gained a greater appreciation for different kinds of poetry and the ideas/stories driving such diversity, got a better understanding of myself as a thinker and a poet, and developed my relationship with the practice of writing. Toward the end of the class I found myself rationing the time I devoted to other classes so I could spend more time reading and writing for this class, and at this point I have difficulty seeing a life for myself in which poetry does not play some part.\r\n\r\nAside from the well-designed syllabus, this course also benefits from a spectacular instructor. David Gorin is a wise and lively presence in the classroom, and will provide you with great feedback/advice during your frequent meetings at Jojo's. \r\n\r\nI feel blessed to have had the chance to build a relationship with this art form; do not pass up the opportunity if you suspect you might have some interest in reading and writing poetry.
