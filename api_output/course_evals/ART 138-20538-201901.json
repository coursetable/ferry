            "\u00a0I learned how to handle digital camera, work Camera RAW, photoshop, and print photos for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the basic skills of digital photography. For example, how a digital camera works and how to take pictures manually using a light meter. Additionally, I learned a lot of photoshop editing skills and inkjet printing skills that I have never previously known. ",
            "\u00a0Some history of photography, how to use a DSLR camera, basics of photoshop and print-making process ",
            "\u00a0I gained much better insight into the various styles of digital photography and got to hone my own perspective on the craft. ",
            "\u00a0Logistically, you learn how to use a DSLR camera, how to edit photos on photoshop, and how to professionally print photos. You also learn how to find your own individuality within photography, you learn independence and self-discipline, and you learn how to understand one another's photography. "

            "\u00a0I wish that there are more one-on-one critiques on the quality and content of the photos throughout the whole semester, as often as possible in order to significantly improve camera work every week. ",
            "\u00a0Its relatively unstructured compared to other intense classes at Yale, but that was one of the fun parts about the class. It could be improved by more frequent feedback from the teachers. ",
            "\u00a0Very open-ended, allowing for a lot of freedom and creativity. Expectations could have been made clearer/higher degree of organization would have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course gives you an unparalleled opportunity to experiment with photographic voice and get feedback on incredible photographers on your work. The biggest weakness, however, is that there are so few critiques (only 2 my semester), meaning you have to really seek out feedback if you want it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not accessible to a lot of students. The class is capped at 16 people (with over 50 shoppers last semester) and you really have to prove why you should be in the class. This is upsetting because more people should have access to introductory photography courses at Yale. We shouldn't have larger classes because the small class sizes are necessary for individualized feedback on our photos, but there should be more classes available. In addition to the capped class size, this class is inaccessible in terms of cost. You need to buy your own camera, lens, paper (which cost $60 this semester), hard-drive AND pay for printing ($3 every time you print, around $60 per semester) AND a $150 lab fee. So this class is NOT for fresh beginners unless you can prove that you have a strong passion to learn, stand out within 50 people, and can afford the class. I spent $370 on this class, not including the camera and lens which I already owned. This is not the professor's fault, it is the class that needs to be fixed. There should NOT be a lab fee. The equipment should be subsidized. It's upsetting that this amazing class has so many obstacles.\r\n\r\nThe small class size is a strength. You get one-on-one feedback about your photos each class. The class time is devoted to working on your photos in photoshop, learning new editing techniques, and getting feedback on your progress. I liked the long classes because you're just editing photos and working on perfecting your craft! It's a very very fun course for alllll majors. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great course, but you do have to be willing to put in the time to go out a shoot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was a refreshing course that offered a chance at expression and exploration- of the self and one's surroundings. Fun and meaningful. That said, it is expensive, and students should be warned that costs add up very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Its a great way to dive head first into the art of photography without too technical a focus. It also gives a great introduction to the history of the photographic form. ",
            "\u00a0YESS THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS EVER ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you have an interest in photography, take this course. If there are a lot of shoppers, make yourself stand out. Express why you should be in the class, talk to the professor after class, email the professor about the class, talk to the TA.  Don't miss out on this opportunity. If you don't get in, try again the following year. It's worth it. But, if you think this class will be a fun, easy 5th class, do not take someone else's spot in the class. It's enjoyable, but within the small class size, it's very obvious who's taking the class seriously and who is not. It is a time commitment and the work cannot be done overnight. But, it's so rewarding to see your work come to life at the conclusion of the semester. "
