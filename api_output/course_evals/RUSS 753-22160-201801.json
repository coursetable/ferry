            "\u00a0I was exposed to a large variety of short stories within the Russian literary canon, many of which are not typically read in Russian literature survey courses. Moreover, the texts were structured thematically in a way that transcended typical chronological ordering. I was able to make connections between authors and traditions that may typically associated with one another (i.e. looking at Sologub with Pogorelsky) and explore thematics and generic forms within a Russian context that are traditionally associated with other traditions (such as the Gothic).

            "\u00a0Weakness: Class seemed to be more or less an opportunity for graduate students in that discipline to run discussions. Very little opportunity for engagement from others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Strong thematic organization and logical progression through traditions and writers\r\n- Weekly discussion posts provoked some very interesting discussion and served as a useful platform with which we could discuss our knee jerk responses to the texts\r\n-Wonderful and thoughtful selection of texts, with attention given to some lesser known authors such as Leskov and Andreevich. \r\n- Generally an excellent and productive flow of discussion \r\nWeaknesses - This was likely due to time constraints, but I felt that the texts could have been coupled with theoretical texts about the texts themselves, the literary tradition with which they are associated, and the history of the contemporary moment of the text "
