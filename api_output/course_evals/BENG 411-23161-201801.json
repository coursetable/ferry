            "\u00a0I took this class as a mechanical BS12 and learned a lot about a whole new world of technologies which I previously knew nothing about. I was matched with a biomedical engineering grad student for the final project and we used his biomedical expertise with my mechanical background to develop a novel biomedical micro device. Rong is a great professor and I very much enjoyed taking this class as an engineering elective. ",
            "\u00a0This class was more of a survey of the field of bioMEMS and microdevices than a development of new skills necessarily. I gained a lot of familiarity about the field, but I would need to do much more in depth learning to fully understand each of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the process of microdevice fabrication, as well as the different functions of many different components to microchips and current microtechnology in the field. There was also a small business component added to this class ",
