            "\u00a0I learnt about key events in middle east history as well as key players. I was especially grateful for Amb. Crockers lessons and pet peeves along the way. By the way he has interacted with these characters throughout his career, you can really get to see what it is like to do diplomacy in a challenging part of the world. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths -- I enjoyed the focus on historical issues and how Amb. Crocker weaves in current events. He's an expert and deeply knowledgable. \r\n\r\nWeakness -- the course is very unstructured -- which I don't mind -- but I do think you can achieve more in a course if you have a roadmap of where you're heading.
