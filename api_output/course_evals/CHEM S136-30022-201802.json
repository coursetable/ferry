Actually doing the labs, though, is a bit mindless and mostly consists of blindly following the manual's instructions. It would be more engaging if the students were called on to make decisions or apply theory personally during the experiments. ",
            "\u00a0Give more partial credit. When I got something wrong, it was usually due to a small stupid error rather than a flaw in my understanding. I feel as if I left the course knowing much more than my grades would represent. I feel as if I can explain the topics very well and have a good grasp of general chemistry however the exams didnt reflect that. ",

            "\u00a0Lab is often a requirement for students, and for anybody planning to take the lab course, I would strongly recommend the summer session course. Taking the lab course doesn't significantly enhance understanding of the material, and I didn't actually learn anything in lab, since all the concepts are taught in the lecture course. ",
