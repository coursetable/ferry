            "\u00a0I developed a broad understanding of the debate surrounding abstract concepts of totalitarianism and authoritarianism, as well as their subtypes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an in depth look at the theoretical underpinnings of scholarship on autocratic regimes. It provided an extremely useful foundation from which to understand how these regimes operate and why they make the decisions they do. "

        [
            "\u00a0A great strength was the breadth of the material we looked at, and the fact that it dealt with more abstract theoretical issues as well as more concrete practical examples to illustrate these issues. I can't really think of any serious weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Candas taught a really serious amount of theory, and the pieces she chose were from across the spectrum of scholarship. One of the biggest strengths, at least one of the less obvious ones, is that she bridged the scholarly work between different geographical areas, which over time have apparently developed their own ways of looking at things and even vocabularies. Using these to discuss other issues in other regions helped to create a big picture that was not just dependent on one particular type or area of scholarship. I also think it is extremely useful in general to convey the importance of theory in looking at the world, and this course strongly reinforced that idea. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this course. The material is incredibly interesting, and you certainly don't need to be a political science major to take part. In fact, one of the great things was the academic range of students taking the course, which made for very rich, engaging discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. It is appropriate for anyone who is very interested in non-democratic governance.  Students should be prepared to really delve into the reading and then engage with what it explains and doesn't and how it relates to other cases and other materials. "
