            "\u00a0The class is great but would probably be more helpful if it was more intense (e.g. workload, evaluations) and counted for a full credit. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that it really helps you approach and analyze new music in a critical and educated way. You leave a lot more confident with sight reading, rhythms, common chord progressions used in all types of music. Another strength is that examples are drawn from all genres of music - so please consider the class even if you are not a \"classical\" musician. We spent equal amount of time of pop music, jazz, piano/instrumental/electronic, classical music. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness is that in order to succeed at these skills, you really have to practice. You go to class (2x per week) to learn practice skills, but if you are really putting in the practice time outside of class, it ends up being way more than a 0.5 credits worth of work and time. "
