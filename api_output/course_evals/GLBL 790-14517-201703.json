            "\u00a0I learned about twenty-first-century organizations and leadership, gained knowledge of the civil-military relationship, and also became acquainted with interesting historical case studies. I also developed the skill of self-reflection through the emphasis on evaluating one's leadership flaws. ",
            "\u00a0An appreciation for the study of leadership, particularly philosophically, from different sectors of the world and throughout history. I came away, for instance, with a newfound appreciation for Abraham Lincoln as a role model brought to life through our study of his leadership, not merely as a two-dimensional historical figure. \r\n\r\nAlso, an appreciation for team-building and relationships with others in the context of leadership. On a related note, I'm thinking there's a good chance I'll grow closer with these classmates than with any others I'll have in any other elective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about leadership critically, and enjoyed learning from different case studies across regions, times, and leadership styles. The course was exceptionally self-reflective, so I learned a lot about myself as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some keys for success from historical leaders, from MLK to Lincoln to JFK. I also gained insight into my own leadership style, strengths, and weaknesses. This mix between case studies and personal reflection enabled grounded, concrete, and profound learning and growth. ",
            "\u00a0-I learned how to be a better, more thoughtful leader\r\n-I learned how to structure and manage more effective teamsmost notably through the Team of Teams framework\r\n-I gained a greater awareness of how modern information technology is creating challenges for organizations of all kinds and how effective leaders can and should respond to this new environment\r\n-I developed new insights about how leaders can/should interact with journalists, particularly in the modern media age \r\n-I learned more about the US militaryincluding its culture, values, and operational tactics; in particular, I gained a deeper understanding of JSOC, the Iraq + Afghanistan wars, and the political dynamics between the US military and civilian leaders \r\n-I studied examples of effective and ineffective leadership throughout history, particularly during Lincolns Presidency, the Civil War, the Financial Crisis, the Civil Rights Movement, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, the Apollo program, and more\r\n-I came away with a deeper appreciation for the importance of trust and relationships in leadership\r\n-I made meaningful and lasting friendships with talented peers across the Yale community "

            "\u00a0I love the degree to which this course emphasizes accountability and engagement. Everyone comes prepares (and if they don't, it is clear very quickly). Each session is structured in an engaging format and the semester included great exercises like the trip to Gettysburg or the crisis simulation (though the travel can be a little exhausting). My only other criticism is that the course layout can cause certain weeks to be very heavy if the student does not do the reading/writing/preparation in the week prior. Another strength is the degree to which students get to know one another outside of class. Finally, feedback on all assignments and is very thorough and prompt. ",
            "\u00a0I have previously submitted and discussed this feedback directly with the teaching team in a separate survey. But suffice to say the course, the material, the teaching team and the classmates are all among the best I have ever experienced at any institution. This was a philosophically and practically formative experience. I'm truly lucky to have partaken in it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The course and instructors are dynamic and incredibly engaging. There is a high level of accountability in this course that comes from the devotion and energy that the instructors put in. It makes you want to give your all and very best in return! The personalized feedback I received in this course was also exceptional.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the readings were too U.S./military centric. However, this was softened by the amount of diversity in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors are incredible. They bring real-world, elite leadership experience to the classroom. This is rare at Yale. The time allowed for self-reflection and team bonding, and the constructive way in which it is facilitated, are also excellent. \r\n\r\nOne area for improvement could be the case studies. The most valuable one was the Lincoln case study and the Cuban missile crises. Some of the others felt rushed, and we weren't able to go deep enough (for example, the civil rights session). It might be better to do fewer leaders in more depth (as we did with Lincoln). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-reading list\r\n-diverse backgrounds of my classmates\r\n-alumni reunion at the McChrystal Group\r\n-trip to Gettysburg\r\n-crisis simulation\r\n-post-class drinks\r\n-Ellen + Will were excellent TAs; they made the course experience more rich and meaningful\r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement:\r\n-Consider making the course year-long\r\n-I wish we had more time to discuss the readings during the Financial Crisis session\r\n-If time allows, it would be neat to add a session on the daily routines of effective leaders; i.e. how do leaders structure their days to maximize their productivity, creativity, and physical + mental health?\r\n-I loved each of the individual sessions throughout the semester, but wonder if the course could be designed to tell more of a story. If possible, it would be interesting to structure the syllabus such that each session builds narratively on the one that came before. Im not quite sure what that would look like, but it might be interesting to consider "

            "\u00a0Yes - definitely. I took this course as an undergraduate and really enjoyed it/gained a lot, but some of the assignments could be more difficult/less valuable if a student has less leadership or professional experience. That being said, I think this issue is resolved through the selection process. ",

            "\u00a0This is a little awkward to recommend the course given one must apply to get in, but I encourage everyone else to apply to this unforgettable experience. If you don't get in once, try again (I got in on my second attempt). Write honest, introspective essays and you'll have your best chance. ",

            "\u00a0GLBL 790 was a phenomenal course, easily one of the best I have taken at Yale. Leadership as a concept is often tossed around, but far less frequently studied or thoughtfully practiced. Despite this, leadership is vital to accomplishing our goals and dreamsof which Yalies have many. Accordingly, it was a privilege to delve into the art and science of leadership, alongside talented peers, and with Stan and Chris at the helm; as teachers, their depth of life experience, inquiring minds, and commitment to the class were invaluable to the semesters success. From our trips to Virginia and Gettysburg to the crisis simulation, Stan and Chris poured their hearts into every aspect of the course and were always generous with their time and wisdom. They gave prompt and thorough feedback on every assignment and took the time to get to know every student in the seminar. Most of all, they were excellent seminar leaders; they knew how to effectively guide class discussions, ask probing questions, and tease out important insights; this is not an easy task, but they executed it masterfully.\r\n\r\nGLBL 790 was a highlight of my Yale career. The course was not only fun, but it also made me a better leader, thinker, and person. I feel honored to have been a part of this golden opportunity. "
