            "\u00a0This course hugely developed my ability to read a text critically while taking into account its context, authorship and influence. It developed my ability to formulate and discuss views on a text, and how to ask interesting questions about how literature and society relate and inform one another. It also taught me how to write book reviews, do close readings and write on contemporary topics through a literary lens. ",
            "\u00a0I read and learned about different African writers and themes and topics that relate. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly strong at provoking and facilitating engaging conversation and thought around African writing. The instructor is an amazing discussion leader and structures the course expertly. The course is very enjoyable if you're interested in the subject matter, and if one engages thoroughly it can be a hugely illuminating introduction to African writing and its place in the broader literary context. ",
            "\u00a0We were able to read some really interesting texts that I really enjoyed. Perhaps, it would be better with more background information going in about what are major topics related to the things we were reading and what the stakes were of reading each text in relation to the larger discussions. This came out later on during discussions but going into each memoir thinking about how it fit more broadly into what we were reading and the genre/discourse on African studies in general might have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Quite interesting texts and well organized conversation around them! ",
            "\u00a0This course had a strong syllabus, and discussion was well structured to both look carefully at a particular work and talk about multiple memoirs in comparison or within a larger thematic framework. I also thought that the personal writing assignment was a great way to encourage self-reflection, and I really enjoyed both reading my classmate's writing and working on my own. Meredith was a wonderful professor, clearly very knowledgable but also always encouraging and kind, and she made the course great. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Memoir in Africa is a really interesting course. Some of my favorite readings were later in the semester, but they are totally worth it. You Can't Get Lost in Cape Town and Freshwater are absolutely amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're at all interested in African studies or life writing, this is the course for you. Its quite a lot of reading, but the discussion that Shepard cultivates around topics is really exceptional, the subject matter is really interesting and combines literary, philosophical and political themes, and assignments were creative and enjoyable. Loved it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student - the readings were interesting, the discussion was good, the structure/workload wasn't too stressful but also wasn't easy, and Meredith did a great job of introducing new concepts and ideas to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! There is a lot I learned about myself and about African texts through this class. Moreover, Meredith was such a wonderful teacher to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. Already I have recommended about half the syllabus to my friends and familythe memoirs are so interesting, and they're well-selected to represent a variety of experiences and styles while staying thematically linked enough to be discussed together. The workload was very reasonable, and although there is a fair amount of reading, it was always very manageable. This class was by far my favorite of my semester, and one of my favorites I've taken at Yale. "
