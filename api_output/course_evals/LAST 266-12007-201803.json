            "\u00a0Learned a lot about this part of history that I never considered before. ",
            "\u00a0Since I had not taken an intensive Spanish class since the 11th grade, I really enjoyed being immersed in Spanish language and culture once again in SPAN 266. I emerged from the class with a better grasp of the mechanics of Spanish grammar, as well as an eye for the rhetorical analysis required to interpret colonial Latin American literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned alot about the history of Spanish and learned how to write critical analysis of Spanish text.  I also learned how to read and understand old Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a good entrance point to the world of colonial Latin American literature. As a student who has never read literature in a foreign language, I learned effective techniques with which to parse a text that I may not have understood from the initial read. I gained a deeper understanding of the world of Latin America and was challenged to differentiate between history and interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of different indigenous groups, colonial scholars, and so many other perspectives over the course of the semester. Although Adorno will insist that this is a literature class, not a history one, the narratives we read do paint a picture of how the colonial question manifested in various places globally around the 15th century. Good refresher on Spanish for someone who hasn't taken it in a while. ",
            "\u00a0I got much better at learning to read texts in Spanish that use outdated language or are difficult to comprehend. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't know much about early Latin American literature or about the period of history that the course covers, so it was a great introduction to both of those things. ",
            "\u00a0Familiarity with some basic history and culture of colonial Latin America ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about different Spanish writers and how to critically analyze texts in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about literature, mainly by colonizers of Latin America, with some literature of Latin American writers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about early Spanish literature! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and evaluate colonial Spanish texts. I also was able to work on my speaking skills when going to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do close reading and how to decode quite complex Spanish. I believed my writing also improved throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A greater fluidity in Spanish reading comprehension, as well as knowledge of Spanish colonial literature. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to various primary sources and perspectives around colonial action in Latin America, interactions with indigenous groups, connections between literature and visual arts, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- excellent development in reading literature critically and gaining more understanding about the historical contexts of the authors. ",
            "\u00a0Read lots of Latin American colonial literature ",
            "\u00a0I developed my understanding of the colonial history and literature of the americas, specifically south and central america. I got a deeper look at perspectives on both sides of the conquest of latin america. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to comprehend histories, documents, stories, and poems from pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial Latin America. We were familiarized with a variety of diverse authors and settings. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: material is interesting\r\nWeaknesses: wish it had more chance for discussion between students so we could practice speaking Spanish rather than just reading off slides. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Adorno chose some very interesting works to study and discuss in class, so the perspectives we learned about were all very exciting. However, I do think the course would be much more engaging if taught in a seminar style as opposed to a PowerPoint lecture style. It was sometimes hard to hear Professor Adorno speak, especially when she was not wearing her microphone. I would also like to learn more about female writers (we only touched on Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz's work on the last 2 days of class). ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I feel that the course was just too superficial and did not function well to show the diversity of Latin American literature. ",
            "\u00a0The processor is a riviting lecturer though the class could be improved through more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was its diversity of information. Texts were sourced from different regions of the world, by authors of different racial, ethnic, geographical, and age backgrounds. However, there could have been more diversity of gender, as all but one author were male. The course is well structured, with a syllabus that is strictly adhered to and lessons that are of the perfect duration to keep the class on track. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- Very accessible L5 class for anyone who places into it, regardless of your comfort with the language. I took it as someone who got a 5 on AP Spanish in junior year and is very uncomfortable speaking, but loves history/literature and wanted to get the language requirement done, and SPAN 266 was a great course! The two exams were cumbersome to study for, but nothing at all surprising shows up on them because of the study guide. Adorno ended up canceling the final paper (since the other paper ended up being more like 6-8 pages than the 3 the syllabus indicates), so the workload really decreases about 2/3 into the course. Weaknesses -- This might be somewhat unavoidable due to the time period, but I wish the texts had a bit more gender diversity, or that our conversations spoke more to the experiences of women within the different groups we discussed. We talked extensively about the nature of indigeneity, mestizaje, and colonial masculinity, but little about the women who existed in the world these writers populated. The only female writer we read was Sor Juana, which makes sense, but we only spent the very last two classes on her and were given no assignments where we could write about her work. (I was intending to write my final paper on her but, as I said above, that paper was canceled. The one paper we had to write was comparative between two writers, which was straightforward but didn't leave a lot of room to explore topics that caught your eye over the semester.) If you're looking for a class to practice your speaking skills or perfect your grammar/writing, there are probably better L5 classes to take. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are really fascinating and I love that we learn about indigenous cultures and literature. It could be improved by changing structure so that students practice speaking more and so we do more in class than just go over the readings we ought to have already completed. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class, the content was interesting and it was presented very well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Adorno is amazing  she is so knowledgeable, and cares so much. The material is interesting, and you get to read great material. It's a really solid L5 credit (and I didn't even need another language class!)\r\nWeaknesses: I hesitate to say it (because Professor Adorno is so great) but I think the lecture is a little long  I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more had it been 50 minutes. I was also a little intimidated by speaking in such a large class setting  I think from now on, I'll be searching for seminars in Spanish, because I personally know I feel more comfortable in those smaller settings. I think other people likely felt similarly, because while there was a contingent of people who spoke quite a lot, many of us only spoke (or mostly spoke) when called upon (which is great! Professor Adorno is great about calling on everyone). This is not at all the format of the class, but I would have greatly enjoyed speaking in small groups about the readings (as a wild thought at the end of this). ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing Spanish lit course. The material is extremely interesting, and Professor Adorno does an excellent job of helping you understand everything. She is always willing to help, in class and in office hours. That said, it's important to come prepared and pay attention in class; she will call you out if you are not ready and paying attention. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught slowly, so it is easy for students who have less experience with Spanish and are looking to get their language credit completed. However, if you are are heritage speaker you are likely to find this class less engaging unless you really enjoy the writers studied. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- Readings are short enough so that we can take the time to read through them and work to understand them. We received clear feedback on how to improve our writing.\r\nWeaknesses -- The lectures could sometimes be dry, as we read through the assigned passages. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is really interesting and the subject matter is very compelling. It could be improved by fewer PowerPoint presentations and more student led discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the course was editing our midterm paper. I learned what kinds of mistakes I tend to make in Spanish and how to best correct them. I learned a lot about myself and how good my Spanish skills are, and how to improve them. The readings were all interesting, and the assignments were enjoyable. I don't think there were any weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the lectures. However, sometimes I felt it quite difficult to focus in the dark room that we were put in. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Adorno is very knowledgeable, and makes herself available always for students. However, the class largely consists of reading primary source paragraphs from Powerpoint slides, which gets dull ",
            "\u00a0Professor Adorno is the main strength of this class, as she is passionate, enthusiastic, caring, and understanding. I would say that the readings are also interesting and worthwhile. I do think that the class could be more challenging/demanding, and that this would encourage students to be more engaged and committed to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = power points added greatly as they were accurate, well-cited, and current.\r\n\r\nSuperb use of a course reader for efficiency.\r\n\r\nTeaching assistant was very attentive and gave two good lectures.\r\n\r\nGenerous office hours and clear interest in us.\r\n\r\nWeakness = microphone use was inconsistent and needs to be reviewed for best clarity. ",
            "\u00a0More discussion in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course material is relatively interesting, specifically the later works that we studied. \r\nWeaknesses: A very low amount of reading was assigned, and most of it was reviewed in class, which made doing the work feel pointless. The class layout (a lot of reading the material off of powerpoint slides) was uninspiring and the discussion felt superficial. Almost every question in class purely tested comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the subjects we went over in class were fascinating for the most part, and Prof. Adorno was very good at engaging the class. She was inviting and excited about the material every day, which kept the class interested. Weaknesses were sometimes repetitive actions during class (reviewing the homework's readings) as well as the large loads of reading that were not particularly diverse in terms of their colonial Spanish authors for the most part. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you want an easy Spanish class that is also relatively interesting. I would not recommend if you are trying to improve your Spanish skills mainly because you don't end up discussing anything in class (just read off slides basically). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is great for those who are rusty in Spanish (like I was) and want to get a foot in the door without the stress of intensive Spanish learning. I gradually regained fluidity in my speaking as the class jogged my memory, and I also learned a lot by writing/studying the works of Latin American authors. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0No. This class was not at all what I expected it to be. I understand that it was a literature class, but we hardly ever acknowledged the brutality and lasting affects that Spanish colonization had on the people/cultures of Latin America. It just felt like everything about the class was superficial and not substantive at all. I also did not feel very comfortable in the environment and I never wanted to say anything in class because of it. The only good thing was the TF, Esteban, who taught 2 classes which were the best lectures of the entire semester. He was thoughtful and provided not only literary critiques, but also historical perspective. His class was the only time we discussed how indigenous communities in Latin America are still being oppressed today and why it is important that we study Latin American literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a fascinating course and it was my favorite class of the semester. I loved the professor and the course material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. For students who have placed into L5, this class provides the perfect continuation of engagement with the \"hispanohablante\" world.  If a student were interested in gaining insight into what has shaped the region of Latin America, I would certainly recommend this course. This class also helps students develop useful skills for further studies of Spanish-language literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're looking for a straightforward and manageable way to fulfill your language credit, I recommend this class. It definitely wasn't as intensive as other L5 classes here, but it was perfect for getting your language done and learning some interesting history in a relatively painless way. Adorno is also the cutest (and a little wacky, which makes class fun!), and she made a great pair with Esteban this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you really need another Spanish language credit. I went into this class hoping to be engaged with the material and because class lectures didn't offer anything new, I stopped doing the readings and wasn't always able to pay attention during class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this as a 5th class. Interesting stuff and not too much work. Professor Adorno is great. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved this course ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, maybe with a smaller class size it could allow more of the class to participate but otherwise it is a great class and covers really interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! (with some caveats). If you need an L5 credit, this is a great one take it! If you don't  probably still take it! That being said, if you find the lectures to be slow for the first few classes, know that they're not going to pick up, particularly Professor Adorno is great, but she does speak slowly and melodically. I was sometimes frustrated by this (depending on my own personal state of mind) but most days found class to be quite a nice respite from a busy day. If you have trouble hearing Professor Adorno (not so much of an issue with the microphone) sit near the front! She's worth it. I almost wish I had taken the second installment of the class on later literature because I feel I would've probably been more naturally interested in the material. I might still take it, though  Professor Adorno is that good! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in Spanish literature. Professor Adorno selects very interesting material and does an excellent job of explaining everything. She is always willing to explain material, in class or in office hours. The workload is not too tough, and she goes over homework well enough in class that you do not need to spend too much time on it. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I would only recommend this course to someone who needed to get an L5 credit and didn't care about improving their Spanish skills or going into depth with any of the content. I placed into L5 with the AP test, and didn't take any Spanish my freshman year. My Spanish was really weak going into this class, and it still is. Despite that, the class was almost frustratingly easy. Readings are super short and are reviewed in lecture, there are comprehensive study guides for the two exams, and the papers didn't require much nuance or argument at all. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not include almost any homework, so it would be good for a student looking for a fifth course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not the most interesting I have taken, but did allow me to improve my writing in Spanish and was not too much work. I would recommend this as a way to fulfill the language requirement, but would probably not choose to take this otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it but only to students who feel very comfortable reading advanced and complicated texts in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This class is beautiful. It's a lot of fun, manageable work, and has a wonderful professor. You get to read beautiful texts and learn a lot about Latin American history. It's good for anyone regardless of major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I absolutely love Professor Adorno and would recommend any class with her. ",
            "\u00a0If you are genuinely interested in the topic, take it. However, don't take it just to have a Spanish class on your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if youre looking for an easier language credit in a relaxed atmosphere. Lectures do involve student participation (Professor Adorno calls on people randomly), but as long as you pay attention and do what youre supposed to youll be totally fine. Readings are interesting and lectures arent the most engaging but Professor Adorno is an absolute gem. She knows every student's name (how many professors take the time to do that?) and shes genuinely rooting for her students to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I would recommend this course.  The professor is engaged and active in our learning.  The syllabus is organized well and it was a very useful course. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the topics, yes. My Spanish communication knowledge didn't really improve much, but I liked learning about the history and literature of the time period ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. It felt almost like a waste of time to spend class reading the material off of the board and answering superficial questions that were addressed by the passage that we had just read. Neither class discussion nor assigments were intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in Spanish literature. "
