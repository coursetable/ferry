            "\u00a0I gained an incredible amount of knowledge throughout this semester, on topics ranging from charter schools to school organizational structure to what makes an effective leader. And in addition to this content knowledge, I also gained skills in collaboration, critical thinking, and analytical reasoning. The course forced me out of my comfort zone by pushing me to discuss constantly with peers, work together on a group project, and question my long-held convictions about education. Truly a wonderful course, and one of my favorites at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught really valuable skills, such as critical thinking, leadership, and questioning assumptions, in addition to concrete information such as change models and educational theories. We also went through cases on multiple levels (classroom, school, district, etc.) that were helpful for understanding the issues, dynamics, and stakeholders at each one. ",
            "\u00a0I completely learned how to frame a problem to effectively work with others to come to a solution. This class taught me about far more than just education in the United States. It taught me about my own leadership skills, and helped me find my voice as a future systems-level leader. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about cases around the country of education reform, successful and otherwise. I gained insight into the skills and practices of an effective educational leader, and had the opportunity to learn from real leaders around the state. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much about controversies in the American education system (accountability, charter schools, technology, unions, etc.) all with real world examples. I also learned from the structure of the class what great pedagogy looks like at the college level from the way professor Lemons set up the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the education system works, how people change it, and how \"improvement\" is subjective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to listen to understand instead of listen to reply. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely the best course in leadership, institutional change, innovation, thinking about complex problems, and education that I've had the privilege to be a part of at Yale. The diversity and intensity of the case study method - in what it demands of you as a thinker - is incredibly powerful when applied in a classroom context in which active participation is somehow vibrant, constructive, and real. What is more powerful than any one semester is the realization and hope that there are many more semesters - months, years, decades - left to explore these problems with talented thinkers and actors in the education/policy space today. ",
            "\u00a0I gained further insight into leadership and change in education from a variety of angles through a case study approach. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it offered endless opportunities for peer-to-peer discussion and collaboration, it forced you to do the readings and engage meaningfully with them, and it allowed opportunity for the expression of diverse viewpoints. I can point out no weakness in the course, except that one or two of the group project assignments were mildly redundantit may have been more helpful to have had an extra week to work on our final presentation instead. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible! Weekly readings are very fascinating and applicable, the case structure is very good for learning because it involves applying knowledge and drawing connections, but then is supplemented with additional engaging and educational activities during each class. The class is a great balance of discussion and small group work. The final project is well-designed because it allows us to really apply what we learned and delve into a topic of our own interest. The meta aspect of looking at leadership within the class itself is also very interesting - this is something that could have been more emphasized or integrated. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great size, and I didn't want the course to end. Only recommendation I have is to make it longer. ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of this course is definitely the format - the small size and case-study focus make for riveting, challenging discussions which are encouraged by Prof. Lemons. His enthusiasm and consistent pushing made for a stimulating and rewarding intellectual environment. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. The strengths are the case-based format, the final group project that encompasses the whole semester, and the diversity of activities in class that focus on active learning and break the mold of traditional seminar style discussion by inviting students to talk in small groups and do activities out of their seats. It might have been helpful to have a clearer understanding about what professor Lemons was looking for in the weekly memos. ",
            "\u00a0One major strength of the course is that the instructor engages every student by employing many group activities from pairs to groups of 6. The readings are relevant and class discussion is always enjoyable and thought provoking. There are no major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0It was near perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lemons is a huge asset to this course. He is incredibly knowledgeable through his vast theoretical and practical experience working in the education field. He makes this course extremely engaging through incorporating a wide variety of class activities that help to encourage student learning. also really liked the opportunity to dig deeply into a current problem in education via the group project. \r\n\r\nMy main suggestion would be giving further clarity on the project in the future especially in terms of the change and improvement diagrams. While I grew to appreciate these diagrams, I think Professor Lemon's expectations were not always initially completely clear. Introducing the diagrams in class, showing real-world examples, etc. could have helped to mitigate some of the confusion when we were attempting to implement them on our own. A few other elements of the course could also potentially have been clearer (i.e. giving more initial guidance on the reading responses as it took quite a few weeks to figure out what makes for a strong reading response). "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Dr. Lemons is an incredible instructor, and you will leave the class with a better, more nuanced understanding of educational leadership, educational change, and a laundry list of hot-button issues in education. The course is structured differently from most at Yale, and it will challenge you to get out of your comfort zone; there is a lot of peer-to-peer collaboration, a final project that you present in front of district superintendents and other educational leaders from across the state, and engaging class discussion where Dr. Lemons isn't afraid to challenge your views outright. It's a wonderful learning experience, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in education. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who is interested in the American education system. Professor Lemons gets you to think differently (more analytically and less politically) about the education system and also about pedagogy in general. The cumulative project at the end of the semester seems to tie together absolutely everything that he's talked about all semester. I have never taken a class that was so well-designed. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE! This course is incredible. I've never learned so much in a class - it's incredibly well-taught, you are engaged in every single moment, the two hours fly by because each time is different. There's a good mix of individual thinking, class discussion, and small group collaboration. It's organized/conducted in a way that really emphasizes student learning and a positive learning environment, but with just enough guidance and teaching when necessary. The project and assignments are also very challenging (only take this if you're ready to put in effort), but you learn so much through them so they're very high reward. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0An absolute must-take! Professor Lemons is a true expert in his field, and a phenomenally engaging professor to boot. Every class (despite being Thursdays at 7pm!) became a riveting and spirited discussion. It was refreshing to talk about real-world cases every week. The final project is intense at times, but was ultimately a profound learning experience in the challenges of education reform. What other class allows you to research a problem of your choosing and then present to a room full of experts? ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course if you can get into it. It covers many issues brought up in other education studies classes at Yale but does so in a more practical, hands-on way. Instead of focusing on theory and abstract examples, it gets into the nitty-gritty of policies at the national level as well as decisions at the school level. Professor Lemons is fantastic at his job and has experience from working in the field of training educators. He brings his pedagogical knowledge to dynamically teach this class, making it absolutely worth the Thursday evening time slot. TAKE THIS CLASS! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course for anyone interested in education. Everything about this class is enjoyable, especially when people crack jokes during discussion. The readings and case studies are pretty wild. The best part is that it doesn't even feel like a class. Cold calling is not stressful at all. Everyone feels good. And yet you learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. If you are interested in education at all this class will teach you so much, not just in broad strokes about the current state of education but about how to think creatively about what the problems in education are and how we can solve them. Honestly, if you're interested just in thinking deeply and being excited and engaged with what you're learning this class is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take it. Its very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale - it was such an honor to have Prof. Lemons teach it! It honestly wouldn't be the same without him - he was unwavering in supporting and encouraging every member of the class to bring their unique perspectives to the table, and to think in more critical, less clear-cut ways about the cases that we studied. You learn not only from the material, but from his immense experience at every level of the education spectrum - here's a class where the professor could walk in, a plate of cookies in his hand from a superintendent training session that he was running. At the end of the class, you present a brief on an issue in education today; after a semester of going through root-cause analyses, logic models, etc, you can feel prepared in front of all these people who have been working on these issues their whole lives. Amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to any student who is at all interested in education. Professor Lemons is incredibly engaging and helpful, ensuring that the course is always interesting and provokes further thought into education today. "
