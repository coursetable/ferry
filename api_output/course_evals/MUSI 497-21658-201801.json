            "\u00a0Taking on the recital as my senior project for the music major required me to design a cohesive program, coordinate collaborators, and, of course, prepare a significant amount of repertoire. It was in some ways a very stressful experience, as I have chronically overloaded my schedule during my time at Yale and found myself very pressed for time to prepare the repertoire and be in shape for the recital. While I strongly regret how I shortchanged myself, the music, and those who supported me in this venture by not allowing myself enough room to prepare, I was rather proud of what I was able to accomplish in a short amount of time. Preparing this recital made even clearer to me that what I value about performance is almost as much the communal experience of sharing music as it is the integrity of the art itself - this, unfortunately, being to the detriment of the latter. I was incredibly moved and inspired by the enthusiasm of those who helped me prepare, played with me, and joined me in the audience. In thinking about my performance opportunities in the future, I know that I need to allow myself more time and space for preparation in order to feel proud and satisfied with my effort. "
