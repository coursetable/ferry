            "\u00a0We went a great deal in depth into the specifics of processes concerning the central dogma that had been covered in introductory courses, yet this course helped to cement these concepts and introduce some of the biochemical aspects. One of the most valuable things taught was the survey of different biotechnologies, which will certainly be useful in the future. ",

            "\u00a0Could have put more emphasis on papers. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very comprehensive but could be greatly improved by issuing problem sets that are more relevant to exam material and exam question-type, making lectures more interactive, and making practice exams or old exams available to students in order to prepare for midterm exams. ",
            "\u00a0My largest concern with this class was the fact that there was always so much material to memorize for the exams and there was never really much guidance as to what types of questions would be given on the exam, what to spend most time on studying and so forth. I think giving out practice questions before the exam would have helped me a lot and eased a lot of the stress I felt going into the tests.\r\nA second weakness  would definitely be the location and time of the class. I noticed that attendance dropped drastically even after only a couple weeks into the semester, simply because KGL is is truly the farthest place from the majority of the residential colleges to have class apart from just the Divinity School. A change in location would be beneficial in increasing attendance long term. ",
            "\u00a0Too early, tests were too detail-oriented ",
            "\u00a0The class was slow and it wasnt clear what we actually needed to learn off the lecture powerpoints ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that you learn so much about biological processes, but the class is very memorization based. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the TA sessions reviewing articles. I had never really read scientific articles before, and this class was super helpful in gaining some kind of scientific literacy. I also liked having 3 non-cumulative tests. I think it could be improved by having set TA office hours (because the Professors' office hours were all down at the Med school at really inconvenient times) or HAVING A PIAZZA. PIAZZA FOR THIS CLASS WOULD BE IMMENSELY HELPFUL. ",
            "\u00a0The depth of the lectures are a big strength of this class. I really enjoyed how much we learned about each topic. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course is its inadequate explanation of complex concepts such as Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE). Making a rushed job of this is not conducive to student learning. If something has not been taught well in class and is not understood well even by the Teaching Fellows, it should not be tested on a final exam. This is poor pedagogy. Apart from this, the class was taught relatively well. One strength of this course is its incorporation of scientific papers in the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides could be more informative and less time could be spent on specific examples if the general concept is more important to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: grading was very fair as it assessed exams and coursework equally. Having non-cumulative exams throughout the semester was better for learning and grasping the material far better than a single final exam. Section was always fun and engaging. The material was explained thoroughly. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lectures are very difficult to sit through when the professors aren't engaging students in the material, especially at 9AM. Professors didn't make themselves as accessible to students as I had hoped. Professors could have done more to engage students. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers a lot of information that is interesting and related to future science. However, the tests require very detailed information and therefore requires a lot of study time. Even after studying for hours on end, it was still likely that there was stuff students wouldn't know. Good class, but very specific. ",
            "\u00a0This course is set up for students to fail. The instructors made no effort to be engaging, the tests were impossible to finish (nobody in our class was ever able to finish an exam within the allotted time frame), and any attempt to ask for help was met with scorn. "

            "\u00a0It is a good standard course for anybody doing biology. The material is very accessible, and may fill in the gaps of knowledge in the bio intro sequence. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not very engaging -- I would only take it if I needed it for a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was very informative, but it's not by any means an easy class. If the person doesn't find the material interesting it would be a waste of time for them ",
            "\u00a0Not the best MCSB course ",
            "\u00a0If you are an MCDB major this is a great course to meet the requirements. ",
            "\u00a0No, take cell biology. I took cell biology, biochemisty, and repro bio before this and this was probably the hardest class out of all of them, not because the material is difficult, because it isn't, but because it so badly facilitated student learning. Like I could only get help by emailing the TAs. Lectures are hard to wake up for (9am), there are no set TA office hours, and no study guides (I'm writing this in comparison to cell bio). The material was interesting and I learned a lot, but I think if you are sophomore, definitely take cell biology because molecular biology kind of leaves you to your own devices to figure out how to study (which is good if you're an upperclassmen and already know how to study for bio exams, but can be very difficult if you are a sophomore or first-year). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. The weekly homework is incredibly light (~2 hours between reading a paper and answering several questions about it) and studying for tests isn't much more than reviewing the lecture slides. Also, having three midterms as the main portion of the grade is a big plus. I truly felt that there wasn't much pressure to focus on my grade and that I could give lots of time to learning and caring about the material. Honestly a great core course in the MCDB major and one I'd recommend to anyone interested in science and or medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, if you would like to learn about DNA, RNA, and protein biology. This class is not out-of-this world good, but it is an adequate and often good introduction to transcription, translation, non-coding RNA, and protein, and structural biology. One of the best aspects of this course is the fact that you actually have to read papers for it. You will learn recent, relevant advances in areas such as gene therapy, which I found to be pretty darn cool. ",
            "\u00a0As a requirement, or someone who has a strong interest in biology ( thats the only way I can see one keeping up with the material) b ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, tentatively. It benefitted me to go to lecture, but be aware that this is a 9am class all the way in KGL. Also, be prepared to memorize practically everything that is in the lectures; the tests are very detail-oriented. The weekly sections and questions are kind of a nuisance once other courses ramp up their work. A background in organic chemistry or biochemistry would also help; you need to know how some mechanisms work, and it is much easier to know it off the bat than add it to the list you have to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very well paced course for students looking into Biology altogether. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are a bio major. It's interesting but requires a lot of time to study for exams which can be a lot if it isn't an important course for a student that semester. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course. Any other core MCDB course would be less soul-sucking than this. "
