            "\u00a0I really liked all of the guest expert speakers as well as the broad variety of topics covered in the course. \r\nI would have liked more instruction from Professor Cunningham herself, since I think she has a wealth of knowledge to share. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good class for anyone who was familiar with sexual and reproductive health, and wanted to hear real-life experiences and information from speakers. I really liked the various speakers that we heard from, but some of them felt like they were just trying to pass the time, and there may have been better speakers for specific topics. I also wish we discussed the articles more, I often felt like there wasn't really a point to the readings and reflection if the content wasn't always brought up the next class. ",
            "\u00a0This course surveyed a lot of themes relevant to the fields of Sexual & Reproductive Health. It was a great way to not only explore areas that I already found interesting, but also gain exposure to a variety of new topics. I think it could benefit from more continuity between weeks, as well as more chance for discussion of the readings, but I thoroughly enjoyed the chance to hear from experts each week, some of whom I've been able to keep in contact with. ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy that the professor listed as the teacher of the course never lectured; I felt that having only guest lecturers significantly minimized the structure and ability to learn in the class. I strongly think this needs to be corrected and replaced with a true lecture-based structure combined with some high quality guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good - I felt that there were too many reading responses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0the professor didn't really teach the class herself, there were always speakers and I think this took away from making the class cohesive from one to the next. It is also too long and the speakers were always passionate to share about their topics (which is great), but it just made it hard to get through the entire class without a break in a timely way. \r\n\r\n-overall, the professor should stay and she should get to teach the class again (as she has brought many great topics to our attention), I just believe the classes structure needs a little reframing ",
            "\u00a0Good class overall, but I really wish we took more time to go over content/material as a class before diving into guest lecturers or other activities, I think it would have been really helpful to learn some more information early on in the course! ",
            "\u00a0Going into this course I was not aware of the structure. There were guest lecturers every class, sometimes more than one, that took up most, if not all, of the class time. The professor rarely \"lectured\" and there weren't many class discussions outside of questions asked to the guest lecturers. The papers we read throughout the semester were interesting, the weekly papers were too short to allow for critical thinking considering you had to mention each paper and therefore were mostly just a nuisance to prove you read each week. The final group project was also short, requiring just a few pages to be written by each group member, and I don't think we conducive to each of us learning deeply about our assigned topic. I did like the set up the last day of class where we each went around talking for a few minutes to each group- it was a great alternative to sitting through each group present. ",
            "\u00a0This class was just a little disorganized- next year I think it will improve a lot! Very interesting and important topics, so it will likely remain popular. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall ok.  The guest speakers were very interesting and a cool way to run the class, but I struggled with how the participation component of class was set up.  Many of the topics discussed are controversial, and I do not have much background on them. I feared sounding ignorant making a comment to a guest speaker who was an expert in the topic or in a classroom where many students have a deep understanding of these topics.  Since many students in the room had strong opinions on these topics, it was difficult to speak up when I knew my background was not strong enough to form a solid opinion. We never had lectures to provide background, we would jump right into speakers.  Each week, we were required to do readings and write a write up on them.  After spending all that time reading and writing we rarely actually discussed the readings.  I would have felt much more comfortable discussing the readings rather than raising questions to a guest speaker, as I would have the readings as background to base opinions and questions on.  Having little background on the topic, it was frustrating and intimidating for the only way to gain participation points in the class to be confronting an expert in a topic.  Although I do greatly enjoy guest speakers, if readings are required, they should also be discussed.  The lack of regular class discussion lead the assignments to feel like busy work and not the best use of my time.  Part of our assignment was to ask questions for the speakers, and those were very rarely addressed, especially at the beginning of the semester, again making these assignments feel more like busy work than anything else as nothing ever came of these write ups. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n\r\n- diversity of speakers \r\n- engaging content\r\n\r\nWeakness \r\n- limited opportunity to discuss ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. It presented a broad introduction to the field of sexual and reproductive health and reproductive justice. The professor was immensely knowledgeable as was the TF, Jaclyn. Furthermore, every week, Dr. C invited speakers (professionals and experts from the New Haven community and Yale) to present on their work in front of the class. The set up of this class was unusual in that way, but I liked that the rhythm of the class was varied by having different topics/different speakers each week. ",
            "\u00a0Enjoyed topics but room for improvement in structure and organization. Since its the first year its offered I expect this to improve in time. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course was fantastic! I  loved the guest speakers, the readings were very thought-provoking, the projects were so much fun!\r\nWeakness: I almost wish the class was twice-a-week. I wish we could have had more in-class discussions. I'm also unused to the group paper, so I don't know if I liked it, but I did like hearing what other people said about their projects, so I feel it was the only way to get the breadth that was necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course and I strongly believe it is necessary to have a course like this one in the YSPH curriculum. I think this course format should be revised to include more primary instruction on concepts and balanced with guest speakers and class discussion. There is so much that can be covered in the course which is why it's so necessary, but I think it would be more beneficial to cover fewer topics and go more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I was expecting for this class to be more clinical with public health implications. Instead it was about reproductive justice vs reproductive health. The class was run like a seminar and it was too big to have quality discussion. There were too many guest lectures. The class tried to cover too many topics. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good break from quantitative course. I enjoyed the topics discussed and speakers brought into class. Still, the class had a lot of potential to be more discussion based. Although the speakers were interesting, it would've been good to discuss the topic in small groups and have more time to discuss than what was allotted. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely brilliant!  I don't know why this course wasn't an option in the past but I'm SO HAPPY its a course option now.  It's incredibly insightful, informative, and relatable considering the current day political climate.  It's easily one of the major highlights of my time at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class. I enjoyed the wide array of topics explored although sometimes wished the classes could flow together a little bit better. I enjoyed the guest speakers and discussion format. The format for the class would probably be having one guest speaker for the first half and then having the second half of the class be a discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic introduction/ survey course in sexual and reproductive health that did a great job catering to all levels of knowledge. This class generated great discussion, and allowed students to learn from many experts in the field. Readings were great as well. Many were very timely. I feel that everything about this class helped prepare me for my future as a public health professional. ",
            "\u00a0Course was an interesting overview of some topics in Sexual and Repro Health but was not comprehensive. Professor relied heavily on guest speakers to provide lectures, which was hit or miss. Readings were interesting and light -- weekly assignments to write reading reflections was easy enough. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent class that featured a variety of topics on a broad field. I really appreciated the seminar style which invited students to participate in class discussions in a supportive environment. The teacher and teaching fellow were incredibly receptive to feedback and really made the class a great learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0I am SO glad this course was finally offered this year! Such an important topic which has generated a lot of interest at YSPH. The course was well-organized, and the prof and TF were excellent. Sensitive topics were handled well. It was great to have such interesting guest speakers - my only feedback is that it would have been great to have more group work time and lectures from Professor Cunningham. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- This class is FANTASTIC. Definitely one of my favorite classes here at YSPH. It is formatted like a seminar, so that every class you're learning about a new topic. The readings are great and give you the opportunity to engage with a variety of topics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I wish we had more time for discussion and time to ask questions to the speakers. Maybe we can set up a lunch before the class/after to speak with them. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. I suggest that students write 4-5 reflections over the course of the semester, instead of one per week. I would have been able to write more meaningful reflections this way. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: interesting readings raising challenges and complex issues; great speakers; very engagement format of assignments.\r\nWeakness: jumping between topics, not much time to go in depth in each one. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers gave the class a lot of diversity and different things to look forward to.  However, the breadth of what was covered made it sometimes feel like we were not going deep enough into certain topics. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class, it provided a holistic view into many facets of sexual and reproductive health in the United States. I appreciated the course's format of bringing experts in every field to speak about their professions and careers and providing unique perspectives that we usually do not get from our classroom. Our end-of-semester presentation was a little scattered and difficult to display, but the semester as a whole was enormously informative and enjoyable. As someone hoping to delve deeper into the clinical perspective, this class fulfilled that curiosity while also jogging my interest in topics not previously in my realm of understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. It was my favorite this semester! I think Shayna and Jaclyn are wonderful and our class as a whole had an awesome dynamic! I loved the different quests we have, the readings and the work was good too. My only critique would be that I would have loved for their to be more internal class discussion about our readings. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of this course. Our readings were all very interesting and I enjoyed being able to reflect on them in a weekly reading response. I enjoyed learning from topic-specific experts and learning about sexual and reproductive health issues in local, national, and international contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great overall. The course provides a great opportunity to gain a greater breath of knowledge with respect to past and current issues in sexual and reproductive health. The assigned readings were interesting and manageable. I appreciate that the instructor took the approach of inviting guest speakers to share their expertise and insight with us, with respect to certain topics. One weakness is that we often ran out of time to fully discuss topics or go more in depth on issues. Maybe there could be a greater emphasis on small group discussion among classmates in the future, rather than primarily listening to guest speakers. "

I was dismayed that not only did she not teach a single full lecture herself, she also spoke in a way that minimized her knowledge and accomplishments. She should try to work on speaking publicly in a confident manner, because she is clearly very capable and her diction patterns (saying \"kind of\" each sentence, repeating she is not an expert) minimize this.
