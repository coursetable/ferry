            "\u00a0This course allowed me to better understand the relation of the film industry and American history.  I learned how to analyze films in a historical context and how to view films on a much deeper level than before taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze film and was able to better understand the relationship between history and cinema. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough overview of American film history relative to American sociopolitical/economic history that was really engaging. We learned how film both was both shaped by, and had an impact on, American culture in each decade. I learned how to watch films critically, and look for certain techniques that help portray a message the film is trying to convey. ",
            "\u00a0The course deepened my understanding of American history and encouraged me to rethink about historical events. It also trained my ability to think and make judgements critically, considering the whole picture of historical events. Moreover, I learnt about the development, history, and effects of films over time as well, which influenced me on a different perspective towards films. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot about American history by watching some classical movies and analyzing them from multiple directions, which helped me dig deeper into the American social environment at that time. ",
            "\u00a0I have a further understanding of the connection between American movies and history. I used to take watching movies as a way for pure entertainment, but now I understand that some movies can be recreational and thought-provoking at the same time. The course provides me with a new way for studying and enjoying movies. I have never known that there can be so many details which are carefully designed by the director and scriptwriter in a movie. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to appreciate films far beyond their plots, character arks, and soundtracks. This class is a great class to take if you have any general interest in film-watching at all--the films chosen were wonderfully picked and easy to engage with. Even if you have no prior experience with Film Studies, the syllabus and coursework guides you through the process of analyzing the scenes and context surrounding the productions themselves. I found myself with a newfound knowledge of the historical periods that the films took place in. \r\n\r\nFilms are a great educational tool and this course helped me to better understand the culture and history of the country I grew up in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to further analyze films through the use of sound, camera angles, actor's behavior, and historical context. I have become more interested in films and decisions made to film the way they are. "

            "\u00a0The course's content was very strong.  We covered many interesting parts of American history and learned how the film industry responded to and affected them.  The 4.5 hour-long classes can seem a bit long, but the screenings help break it up nicely. ",
            "\u00a0The class was overall very good. The discussion was able to dive deeper into the content and help everyone gain a better understanding of what we were watching. The one weakness it had was that it was a very long course and could have been broken up more. ",
            "\u00a0I only wish we had more time (not in terms of class length but the semester length, it would be great to watch and analyze more films). Other than that, the structure was really conducive to learning and being engaged! ",
            "\u00a0The course arrangement was great. Professor would first organize the students to discuss the movie we saw last time and introduced some historical facts to help us understand better about the coming-up screenings at the end of the class. Perhaps if Professor curtails or just selects some key chapters of the long readings would help more for students to absorb the knowledge, especially when the final assignment approaches, otherwise students might have to skip the reading to finish the final essay. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is that the films shown in class are all very good. Sometimes if literary output were to be thought-provoking, it would be a little boring for its content may be too abstruse. But all the movies we watched in class are attractive. The weakness may be the way to bring out a discussion. Sometimes I feel a little confused about the questions and don't know what to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thoroughly enjoyed the setup of each class. I liked how it was divided up by the movie seen in the previous class, clips, important historical information from the time period, and then the movie at the end.\r\nWeakenesses: The length of the class and the classroom. It could get hard to sit and engage for such a long period of time. I would havel liked to receive a grade or comments on my final essay. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any student interested in film or American history.  It offers a unique lens to view history through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I feel like it was very interesting overall and the professor put a lot of work into the course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, films and TV are a part of our everyday lives, and this course really encourages you to look at them in a critical way! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to others. This course helped me get a broad understanding of the development of American history and American film history, which is a great introduction class for film lovers and those who want to learn more about American history. Besides, this course stimulated me to demonstrate film scenes from multiple angles, combining with historical facts and people's various attitudes towards it, which can help one develop a comprehensive understanding of American society.  And through analyzing specific films, students' skill of critical thinking would be largely improved. So this class deserved to be recommended. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course has been an eye opener for me. Films are present in almost everyone's life, and this class allowed me to think about and evaluate films in a different way that I believe was very benefitial. "
