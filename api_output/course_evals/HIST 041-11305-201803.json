            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of the different revolutions (US, Haiti, Latin America) that occurred in the Americas, their motives/aftermath, how to use Beinecke primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to research and using the resources at the Beinecke in particular. \r\nI learned about the American, Haitian, and South American revolutions.\r\nI learned how to evaluate sources \r\nI learned how to talk about history in a constructive way, as in with politically correct and accurate word choice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think more critically about Primary Sources and analyze these sources in papers. Also, I learned a vast amount about many Latin American Revolutions, which are largely understudied and under-researched. ",
            "\u00a0How to read critically and engage a large amount of material in a discussion-based setting--drew connections between readings that seemed unrelated over common course themes ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge concerning latin american revolutions and insights on how they played out. Additionally, how to write an adequate analytical essay. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows students to gain an understanding of the processes that motivate revolution. By writing weekly response papers reflecting on (very long and sometimes dry) readings and 3 papers (1 primary source analysis on American Revolution, 1 film review on Haitian Revolution, and 1 research paper on Latin American Revolutions), you will gain an overview of revolutions in the Western Hemisphere. This class is a fairly easy Writing credit if you stay on top of the readings and are interested in the material. If you are not, and you fall behind, you will find yourself having a hard time attempting to write for the class. The seminar style is perfect for this course and the way Professor Echeverri conducts class is absolutely excellent - she is so educated on these topics and learning from her is a great feat of this course. You will learn how to get through long readings by taking this class. While you will not receive direct instruction on how to better your writing, the writing you complete as part of class weekly will help you better your craft. ",
            "\u00a0Historical analysis ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new way of looking at history that I think will be a valuable skill going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I learned both about the history of the revolutions of the Americas and the importance of historical perspective in historiography ",
            "\u00a0I learned about several specific American revolutions, and in particular how they affected and were shaped by people of Indigenous, African, and multi-racial descent. It gave me insight into many social processes and movements in the Americas during this period, as well as a better concept of the Atlantic world as an entity. "

            "\u00a0The seminar discussions were interesting and provided a nice synthesis of our readings for the week. The structure of the course could be improved with clearer transitions between different sections and maybe even a broad overview about each new revolution before we started the readings. Also more feedback on writing would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a great transition from learning how to discuss and analyze history to diving into arguably more complex revolutions. Though the majority of readings were crucial to this process, a few of the readings were difficult to parse and contributed little to class discussions. Adding a few sources that provide a synthesizing overview of each revolution would also provide students with a stronger backbone for discussion; some of the more analytical sources were difficult to understand due to a lack of prior knowledge about specific revolutions. An added general focus on Latin American wars of independence would also be interesting! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nNon-eurocentrism: viewing America as a continent and viewing how different parts of the Americas affected each other \r\nPrimary source readings\r\nResponse papers\r\nGreat classroom environment \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nTOO MUCH AMERICAN REVOLUTION. We all took US history so it was a bit much to spend a month on when we wanted to take this class to learn about the rest of the continent. \r\nMore constructive criticism on the response papers would be nice \r\n\"Burn\" was a terrible firm \r\nA few inconsistent due dates for assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading material (a great array of material and a lot of it) and discussion format (very open and accessible to all students). Weaknesses: teacher did not give a ton of feedback on papers and basic facts about Revolution not given/taught except in books (in other words, not discussed in depth in class). ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting, and Prof. Echeverri led our discussions really well. While I don't feel like I have an amazing factual understanding of actual events that happened in the Age of Revolutions, given related documents, I feel that I've learned how to engage them critically because we wrote weekly response papers and were encouraged (in a really welcoming/no-pressure situation) to participate in class. I really enjoyed the class, but I wish there were a little bit more structure sometimes to our discussions and the progression of the course material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that you clearly learn about the revolutions, but I chose the course for latin american revolutions but in the first part of the semester we discussed the American Revolutionary War (which did not intrigue me very much). It could be improved if the professor gave more guided questions for the discussion, as we first ramble about until we arrive to what she wants to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by more direct instruction on how to write primary source analyses, especially as it concerns the final paper. There were no clear guidelines for the final paper and that lack of instruction weakened my liking of the course. Otherwise, the breadth of material and sources analyzed in class and through readings is by far one of the best things about this course. You will come out having learned so much new information regarding the revolutions, and the discussions in the seminar lend themselves to that learning. ",
            "\u00a0Too much reading. Good teacher and interesting material though ",
            "\u00a0I think that a weakness would be the amount of reading as at times it seemed a bit much for how it was used in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion based exposed me to new ideas about our texts. Covered a large body of texts and history ",
            "\u00a0I found the content of this course extremely interesting, and I loved that there was a dual focus on the content of the sources as well as on how they were written, how they intersected/agreed with/contradicted other sources, and how we approach history and the work of different scholars. I also thought that the visits to the Beinecke and to Bass were a great introduction to Yale's resources, and helped me learn how to navigate the library system and find help when necessary. I found the grading a bit confusing--we never really got clarity on how the weekly responses were graded, and some more specific comments on them would have been useful, because I think we were confused as a class when we got to major papers and found that we weren't exactly sure what we were supposed to be doing. Some more specific instruction and clear guidelines would have been useful, as well as more clear feedback along the way. In terms of content and historical/research skills I thought the course was very strong, but it could be improved when it came to bettering our writing ability. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. The discussions were insightful and will challenge your thinking. There is a lot of reading but it's pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course convinced me of the fascinating field that history is! I did not (and still do not) expect to major in history or any humanities, but found the class incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's such a great introduction to research at Yale and that's a good enough reason alone to take it. \r\nA great intro to History at Yale and the seminar environment, as well as being an interesting writing credit. \r\nProfessor Echeverri is super nice, too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If one is interested in Latin American Revolutions, how they were formed, how they unfolded, and how they resolved, all of those questions will be answered. Also, it was a great class if one likes to speak in class and voice their opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Being able to research in the Beinecke for two of our papers was especially amazing! Also a great way to get into the heavy reading load/discussion/writing courses as a first-year ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is very interesting and fascinating, but be prepared for various readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes good fys ",
            "\u00a0Yes, i would recommend. The only thing is that if you are not genuinely interested the class can become repetitive at points. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that for students simply looking for a writing credit this might not be a good choice, because as a class we had trouble finding clarity in the feedback and in terms of the expectations for our writing, but for people interested in the content itself and scholarly approaches to history, it is incredibly stimulating and informative, and I really enjoyed it.
