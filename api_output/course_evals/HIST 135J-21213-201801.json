            "\u00a0Lots of primary source reading, analysis. Learned to be a better reader and writer. Great course! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a huge amount about the Founding period, the Founding fathers and how they interacted with each other. I learned how to work with primary source material and how to interpret it in greater detail than I knew how to before. I also developed as a writer from working on our research papers - an assignment that pushed me. ",
            "\u00a0A seminar with a WORLD CLASS historian! ",
            "\u00a0This class significantly improved by ability to work with primary sources from this time period. I learned how to \"read other people's mail\" as Professor Freeman would say throughout the course and felt my ability to interpret these sources improved with every week, culminating in my final paper. Professor Freeman does a great job of guiding students through the process of writing a 20-page paper. I don't think there is a better class at Yale for preparing a history major for a senior essay. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me a better reader, writer, and researcher. Focusing on primary sources for (almost) the whole semester was a great historical exercise and I imagine it'll help a lot in the senior essay process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read through (historical) people's mail, and, more importantly, how snooping through letters sheds an incredible light on the Founding Fathers: their ideals, their politics, their contradictions, their personalities. I also learned how to research and write a 20-page research paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a lens into the founding era and two of its key playersHamilton and Jefferson. Through a close reading of their personal correspondence, I was able to get a sense of their personal and political personalities and patterns of thought. By the end, I felt that the correspondence really helped my classmates and me access this miraculous moment in American history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so, so much from this class. We got to read primary sources (letters) each week, which I found fascinating and which I think helped my reading/analysis skills. I learned a lot about the time period and feel like I got a great sense of the characters in this era. ",
            "\u00a0In the Age of Hamilton and Jefferson, Professor Freeman helps students explore the early American republic by analyzing correspondences, conducting research with primary historical documents, and engaging in original, nuanced historical argument. While the course material specifically treats Jefferson and Hamilton as its foci, the course helps to build an understanding of document-based historical research (read: a preview of senior research projects in the History department) and helps students explore the post-revolutionary period generally.

            "\u00a0None. ",
            "\u00a0The only way this course could be improved would be to meet more frequently throughout the week because it was SUCH A JOY to come to class every Wednesday. ",
            "\u00a0The class was difficult. Just make sure that you are ON your toes. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its focus on primary sources. The depth in which we explored Hamilton and Jefferson was awesome and a great way to study this period in history. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a carefully curated syllabus of primary sources with the best professor (probably anywhere) to study with. One thing to note is that it won't get you more familiar with the secondary literature around this period, and that the quality of the discussion depends on how much of the reading other students have done in the week (because, really, there are no shortcuts for much of the reading). Overall, it's a really strong course with a really strong professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty perfect the way it is. I can't see a way to improve it. I especially loved that the first draft of the paper was due so far in advance, giving students ample time to write, rewrite, edit, and incorporate Professor Freeman's extensive (and excellent!) line notes. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Freeman is one of the best professors at Yale. She is definitely the highlight of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course drew strength from the seminar dynamic created by Professor Freeman and from the required reading materials. Professor Freeman is an excellent interlocutor. Her questions spurred productive and engaging discussion. And, the stories that she has collected over the years and shared with the classeither about the founders, through her extensive experience dealing with their private and public papers, or from her first-hand experiences over the course of her career as a historianfurther enhanced the seminar experience. Though the paper deadlines were daunting, we all thanked Professor Freeman later! ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is definitely Professor Freeman. She knows so, so much and shares her limitless knowledge with the class each week. She has an abundance of stories and tells them in such an engaging way. She made the class a delight to go to each week and made sure that everyone was active and was learning from the class. The strength is also I think the letter-reading. Reading from primary sources like that is such a great way to structure the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but I caution you that there is a rigorous reading load of about ~200 pages per week! ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY take this class if you can get in. It is the best history class I have taken at Yale, and Professor Freeman is just incredible. Normally long seminars can feel LONG but this one flew because of how exciting the material was and Professor Freeman's hilarious anecdotes. You won't find a better seminar than this, I promise you. ",
            "\u00a0You produce a 20 page paper. It will be difficult and rewarding, so I suggest taking this class in an easier semester?\r\n\r\nWould I recommend that you take THE CLASS OF YOUR LIFE???? I dunno, that's up to you, man. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I can't think of a better class at Yale at preparing you for a senior essay, which is what junior seminars are supposed to do. Professor Freeman teaches you how to write a research paper step-by-step and the class really helps you work with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get into this seminar, I absolutely recommend that you take it! You will appreciate history in a totally different way than you have (or might not have) in the past. Professor Freeman is a dream, and will make every seminar different, fascinating, and fun. Her stories are legendary. Hear as many of them as you can. ",
            "\u00a0Every Yale student with the slightest interest in early American history should not forego the opportunity to take this course. Professor Freeman is fabulousshes brilliant, engaging, and incredibly devoted to her students learning and writing process. She makes learning an absolute joy and makes the founding era incredibly accessible. Furthermore, students are exposed to Hamilton and Jeffersons correspondence throughout the semester. This proved to be incredibly enlightening and entertaining at once. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a must-take class  seriously. You will learn so much from one of the foremost experts in this field. If you get into this seminar, you 100% must take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but do not take it lightly. Professor Freeman is among the lauded professors that make Yale outstanding; her research has transformed the way both laymen and fellow historians approach the early American republic, and her ability to share that expertise through teaching is equally exceptional. It's a privilege to study in such an intimate classroom setting with such a wonderfully knowledgeable (and personable) professor. That said, you have to work hard to get something out of this course; Freeman is there to guide students' own research--so if you don't invest yourself in that research, your experience will fall flat. So, put shortly: Take this class--but only take it if you know for certain that you will be willing and able to make it your priority. If you are not, then you would be better off taking the course at a time when you are. "
