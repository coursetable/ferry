            "\u00a0This course will make you a better writer, critical thinker, and historian. Take this course if you are interested in learning about the English monarchy, London's gin craze, and how London's neighborhoods developed. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who knew almost nothing about London going in, I learned a lot about the social, cultural, economic, political, and religious life of the city. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the best history classes I've taken. It was well balanced between interesting primary sources and secondary literature. I feel like I have really improved in analyzing and writing about early modern primary sources, which are sometimes very tricky. ",
            "\u00a0Different themes in early modern London: the household, crime, the \"gentile\" etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the pre-industrial period in London. It goes very in depth into the nuanced social history of early modern London which was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to blend primary and secondary sources into a coherent, compelling narrative/research paper. Professor Wrightson's gradual incorporation of primary sources in our weekly classes and presentations throughout the semester made the research paper writing experience all the more enjoyable. Also loved the variety of cultural/social historical perspectives we assumed in the course to engage with the history of Early Modern London. ",
            "\u00a0I really improved my writing skills through taking this course and learned so much about the history of London! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about engaging with primary and secondary material, and doing some primary research of my own. This was my first upper-level history seminar, and was a good introduction to this kind of class. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the primary source documents, historiography, and social history of Early Modern London. I learned about many of the the major historical events which took place in England between 1560 and 1730, with an emphasis on their impact on the city and its people.  I also learned how to analyze a variety of primary sources, such as the Bills of Mortality, the Diary of Samuel Pepys, and the Proceedings of the Old Bailey. "

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include good feedback on assignments, high level of class engagement, and the fact that Professor Wrightson is extremely knowledgable. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of strengths because of Prof. Wrightson, a friendly and approachable guy who brings a lot of knowledge to the table and who cares about helping students ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well curated--all of the readings are incredibly interesting. With that being said, the secondary literature for each week sometimes was quite long. However, I do feel like all of the readings were purposefully picked and were each important. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very very well organized. Prof Wrightson is meticulous with how he wants each seminar to go, and you will definitely learn a lot because he will get through everything he wants to. On the flip side, there is not much discussion because of this. Often, it felt like a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a bit too much of a lecture each class. I would have liked for there to be more open ended discussions, but nonetheless, Professor Wrightson knows his facts and does a really good job of covering all the details. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths included: the consistent build-up of primary source engagement throughout the semester to prepare us for our final papers; the disparate readings which allowed the period and city to vividly come to life; and the flexibility to pursue our own varied research interests for our presentations and final papers. Professor Wrightson is extremely supportive and will spend hours individually with you throughout the course to discuss your interests, etc., should you ask him--a marvelous advising resource. No apparent weaknesses to me. ",
            "\u00a0Not only was this class extremely interesting, but it was also really well organized and had great discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely knowledgeable professor, light week-to-week workload\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: rather unforgiving grading, wish there had been a bit more room for student participation in seminar ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing and had no real weaknesses. Professor Wrightson is an amazing historian and educator, and he organizes the class in a very clear, thematic way that helps students digest and understand each week's discussions and readings. All of the assigned reading was interesting, and the papers were fun and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I wish prof Wrightson would have sat more in the middle of the table because, as it was long and rectangular, the people on the ends had a really hard time engaging in the conversation. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to history majors and non-history majors. Be prepared to work hard, it will be very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in the topic, it's a fascinating course with a great prof ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to another student, especially if you have any interest in London or early modern Britain. I think that if you don't already have a strong interest in London, the class might not be your favorite. However, Professor Wrightson is wonderful and so knowledgeable. It was incredibly fulfilling to understand early modern experiences of such an amazing city. I think Professor Wrightson is incredibly thoughtful and kind, and handles the history delicately but robustly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an interesting class, not that much work. However, at least for me, it wasn't super intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for anyone interested in the social history of London. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend: accessible, passionate, and interested instructor; variety of social/cultural lenses into the material that allows everyone to find his or her own points of interest; and relaxed seminar setting without wasted time (knowledge imparted more akin to a lecture style course, but in a calmer and more participatory setting). I could go on. Please take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. In fact, it was one of the best and most interesting classes I've taken at Yale so far! You learn so much about London and address topics like migration, marriage patterns, fashion, prisons, alcohol consumption, education, and entertainment. I thought it was really fascinating to see how certain London neighborhoods that we know today, like Mayfair, came about. Professor Wrightson is such a great professor - he is not only very knowledgeable on the subject, but gives very clear feedback and rewards hard work. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in the topic, yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any history students interested in learning from one of the brightest minds in Early Modern British History. Professor Wrightson's course is thoroughly interesting and engaging. This is by far one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, if not the. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely I loved the class and prof Wrightson. Such an amazing professor with an abundance of knowledge to share. He is completely willing to meet with you anytime. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Though the background readings are dry at first, the course offers rich insights into the varieties of daily life in London. "
