            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot about formatting for charts and also gives some useful building blocks for writing good arrangements of songs and arranging for multiple instruments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned extremely practical skills related to music copying, formatting, and arranging for different environments (broadway, class, middle school, and pop band). I got to speak to professionals in the industry about the business and about the key components about what makes arranging such a unique creative field. The class was a candid, honest look at what it means to have a creative stake in the music business today. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a strong practical understanding of how to format a score to professional standards.  Through this class, I really learned to appreciate formatting, and how it can influence the way your piece is perceived by players, and can expedite the rehearsal process. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It's important to understand that this is more of a master class that focuses on one specific individual and his way of producing music, and it is not a course designed to allow individuals to explore all types of arranging and composition. It is focused on honing one specific style of arranging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jeff is a great teacher, you get to work on meaningful and practical projects, and you get advice from established workers in the arranging and music copying business. Working with a middle school choir was one of the best and most practical parts of the class, so hopefully that aspect of the class can continue.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Jeff makes things up as he goes along, so the next experience might be different from mine. He doesn't give concrete advice on arranging, rather he bases it off of each assignment. We worked on 1 assignment for 3 weeks before moving onto the next one, which seemed tedious and unnecessary. You get to arrange in this class, but not a lot. \r\n\r\nAlso, the name of the class should be changed. It's not an a cappella arranging class, but a class that teaches you how to support voices through instruments and different textures. ",
            "\u00a0This strength of this course is that it will make you learn how to format your music properly.  Probably half the time in class is spent discussing formatting techniques.  I really feel like I've learned a lot when it comes to preparing a score to be read by other musicians.\r\n\r\nJeff also gave some pretty good advice when it came to arranging.  I definitely feel like I've learned how to pare back first draft ideas into a more cohesive piece.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is the assignments.  Some of them weren't as exciting as others, and a lot of the difficulty of the class is preparing your arrangements for in class performance/recruiting the musicians to play your pieces (but then you also see the practical advantages to well-formatted music.)

            "\u00a0Yes probably! I would just make sure they understand the master class element of it before signing on. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to musicians looking for something different in their schedule! The class is much more practical/skill-based, so it is a good compliment to other composition, history, or theory courses. It is the most awake I've ever been for three hours on a Monday afternoon! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to ANYONE who wants to make it in the business as a composer, music director, or songwriter. Jeff is a great, charismatic, and intelligent teacher who develops a great relationship with his students. Most of all, you get to learn from your friends in the class who are also driven musicians. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student.  Just be prepared to spend time recruiting musicians and rehearsing your arrangements each week.  Prof. Klitz is a lot of fun, and class is always entertaining, but if you haven't rehearsed your arrangement, he will get annoyed, and there is also less he can do.  He usually sets up really cool events during the semester, including going into the city to watch him music direct a project, meeting famous music formatters and arrangers, and working with an award-winning middle school choir.
