            "\u00a0Developed my writing and reading skills in Spanish while expanding my vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0great course ",
            "\u00a0As someone who knew almost nothing about medicine, MedSpan was the perfect opportunity. There were great readings, comprehensive and interactive work in class only helped accentuate it. I also learned a lot with my comprehension - my writing got much better as we turned in a few pages of work every class period - feedback was great too. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of medical topics, practiced a lot of writing and reading of articles, and practiced my speaking with the presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn about the etymology and treatments of a wide variety of medical illnesses and diseases. I was also able to learn the specific spanish medical terms for these. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to further my Spanish skills in general as well as my medical knowledge in a broad range of topics and how to address these topics in Spanish and how these topics are different from the US in Spanish speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved and I learned a ton of new medical vocabulary. I also learned a lot about different illnesses and treatments and about the medical professions generally. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish vocabulary, writing, and reading skills. I also developed a better understanding of various medical disorders. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different diseases (mental, physical, chronic, acute) in Spanish, including the etiology, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. ",

            "\u00a0Sometimes boring lecture, but appreciated that it was a stress-free class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professor and topics. Seora Carreras is an incredible Professor. The only weakness are sometimes the writing assignments are repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0teacher is superb ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = Sra. Carreras. She is welcoming and really helpful with feedback, but also definitely never made me feel scare for anything. I loved coming at 9 AM! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses = sometimes, it was a little unorganized and it took a while to figure out what was the plan - nobody knew what the assignments of the week would be until the Saturday before, which meant some weeks were a crunch because I couldn't plan. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and engaging, but the daily writing assignments felt very repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0The big strength of this class is that it covers almost any medical topic you can think of; the course material is also very easy to understand. \r\nThis class could improve by having more oral discussion with students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought one of the strengths of this course was that the work load was very reasonable and therefore students were able to engage with the course material without feeling stressed out or resentment towards the course. ",
            "\u00a0The grading of this course is extremely fair. The material is interesting, and relevant to anyone interested in human health. However, the course material is presented very lecture-style even though it is a small class, and this can sometimes be unengaging. There is not as much opportunity to practice speaking in Spanish. That said, Profesor Carreras is a lovely, kind person who is very eager to help her students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The topics were very interesting and engaging, and Professor Carreras is such a lovely, kind, and encouraging professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There weren't any formal assessments, which gave students less motivation to retain the information taught (though it shouldn't be this way, it is unfortunately seems to be the case for classes without tests/quizzes). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: manageable workload, wonderful professor, dynamic class activities\r\nWeaknesses: same homework type every night (article summaries) "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this class to other Yale students. This class involves a lot of writing each week which greatly helped improve my comfort when writing in Spanish by the end. Professor Carreras is also incredibly approachable and overall knowledgeable on the subject. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as a way of fulfilling L5 Spanish requirement and getting a bit of Spanish practice every week. It is interesting, but not the best way to improve Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would! It was an engaging and fun way to continue practicing my Spanish, which I hope to continue using into the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course is a manageable way to brush up on your Spanish vocabulary, but not a way to become a medical-Spanish genius. It is an enjoyable class environment, with a wonderful professor. "
