If so, definitely take this, because I don't think 10 hours/week is enough to have a fulfilling research experience. Personally I loved it, and the freedom from classes (since this is two credits, I only had to take 2 others) gave me a lot of time to focus on my labwork. However, if research isn't for you, then maybe this isn't the best idea. "
