            "\u00a0Good understanding of  main applied and theoretical issues around food and social justice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about frameworks related to food justice that I had not encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge on various theories and frameworks relevant to studying social justice in the global food system: racialization, structural oppression, intersectionality, and food sovereignty. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to apply a more critical eye to food systems analysis, and most importantly to draw connections between different actors and levels in the food system to consider questions of equity and social justice. I had never studied food systems before - whereas most of the other students in the class had - but this never dissuaded me from participating in class discussions. By learning and applying frameworks such as food security and food sovereignty to readings and discussions of contemporary food system challenges, I improved by ability to delve deep into the complexities of food systems. This course deals a lot with questions of power imbalances (governments and their constituents, business/corporations and customers/shareholders) in the food system and what changes could be made towards a food system that is more environmentally sustainable, whose economic benefits are more equitably distributed, and that can provide all people with appropriate quantities of nutritious food. The reading load is constant but very manageable if you space it out over the week - that being said, most of my coursework up to this point had been psets, so if you're used to reading and analyzing 60+ pages of academic writing regularly you'll be more than fine. You definitely want to do the reading because discussions are routinely structured around them. The last few weeks of this class are perhaps the best; everyone has to present their final paper topic in a 'lightning' 10-minute presentation, so you get exposed to the wide range of really interesting topics people are researching. Paper topics in our class included a study of the effects of targeted food product marketing on children, a comparative analysis of different cuisines in the U.S. by tracing the history of different cultural groups, and a land rights project based on personal research in Burma.

            "\u00a0Fairly well - but I expected a somewhat deeper engagement with critical theory. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this class with little knowledge of food systems beyond my generalized knowledge and a personal interest in the culinary industry. This class blew me out of the water. Not only did I amass a huge amount of knowledge and insight across the full spectrum of the food system, I gained a fundamental perspective shift regarding the role of social justice and equity in the 'sustainability' discourse writ large. ",

            "\u00a0Better lectures\r\nbetter TA\r\nMore  of Kristin;s mind and analysis less worry about word choice and precision. ",
            "\u00a0i enjoyed the class for the most part. Kristin is very organized and thoughtful in her approach to teaching it. I enjoyed the discussions and the opportunity to lead the class in discussion. \r\n\r\nI think the course was much more academic and theoretical than I was hoping for. Many of the readings that we had were very dense and erudite, and I didn't find them that instructive. Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies was my favorite reading because it was a blend of theory and storytelling. It felt personal and engaging. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to spend more time talking about what justice looks like in real terms i.e., what are actual solutions? I think we could have spent less time reading about some of the problems - for instance, I don't think we needed a whole week on seed sovereignty or land grabbing. Instead, we could have had a couple of weeks learning an overview of the injustices of the food system and spent more time thinking about ways folks are approaching food justice, especially in New Haven. I would have liked to explore the concept of justice more and learn about how organizations on the ground are actually working towards it. It would have been nice to visit with more activists and discuss different approaches to justice (analyzing/understanding the actual actions - not just declarations - of nonprofits, individuals, governments, corporations, religious institutions).  I enjoyed having the activists come to class and would have loved to see more engagement along those lines. \r\n\r\nAlso, for the amount of reading that we did and the amount of effort required to write a response on a weekly basis, it would have been a better incentive to have the reading responses count for more of the grade. On a related note, given that most of us are not academics or entering academic work, a final project that was less theoretical and about \"frameworks\" and perhaps more practical could have been interesting and more worthwhile for many of us in the class. ",
            "\u00a0My classmates were absolutely the strongest aspect of this class. We were able to have really interesting class discussions because everyone would participate and offer their perspectives. \r\nMany of the readings are too superficial and could do more to really delve into the frameworks we establish during the first few weeks of the class. \r\nDr. Reynolds' lectures are hard to follow. Fortunately, she did not lecture much and most of the class was discussion. \r\nThe tour to Yale Farm was really great. Could the class more directly partner with Yale Farm? ",
            "\u00a0The course's greatest strength is the space given for student discussion based on our own experiences, positionality, and interests - I learned a lot from these open but guided discussions.\r\n\r\nThe course's most significant weakness is that Dr. Reynold's lectures did not always line up well with our readings and discussion, and sometimes felt like they were trying to cover too much ground in a very short time. This could be improved by more focused lectures that explore specific case studies through theory. ",
            "\u00a090% of the time, this course felt like a well-oiled machine. The body of readings and discussion topics is varied yet their sequence is pretty well streamlined, so each week felt like it made sense in the context of the previous week. I would chalk up the 10% of discussions that had some extended awkward silence to the fact that not everyone does the reading in ANY class all the time. Otherwise, this class is one of the best I've ever taken in terms of its content and the organization thereof. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the lectures, the student-led discussions, and how each person shared their paper. I didnt love the reading response aspect  I wish the deadline were later in the day (even midnight) and that the prompts were more probing. I wonder if the global aspect of the course could be reigned in to allow for a little more focus. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses- ramp up from outline to final paper was steep. Would have been good to have at least one more preliminary milestone in between. Also focused too much on theory. Weekly reflections took quite some time to write and aren't reflected in the portion of the grade, they should worth more. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the in-class discussions and professor lectures. A weakness of the course is the reading reaction assignment. I found the exercise to be time-consuming and repetitive (similar questions were asked from week to week, leading to fatigue). I would eliminate this assignment in future courses. Or, I would ask students to pick 5 classes in which to complete the reading reaction assignment. "
