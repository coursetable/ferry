            "\u00a0I got in touch with Hindi, which I hadn't studied in a long time. I also learnt a lot about pre-partition, partition and post-partition times in India. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt about Indian independence in detail. Had 3 units - pre, during, and post independence. Learnt how to take good interviews, got some first hand information about the struggle from partition survivors. Also, watched several films and read texts, which gave an insight about different perspectives and ways of thinking about Indian Independence. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Hindi skills and gained a better understanding of India in the 19th and 20th centuries. The course primarily involves reading 20th century Hindi writers, looking at various patriotic songs, and watching various movies related to Indian colonialism, partition and post-independence struggles. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered modern Hindi literature and to a smaller extent, some film. The course was split into 3 time periods- before, during and after Partition respectively. I improved my Hindi writing, understanding and speaking skills, and also gained a lot of knowledge about 20th century Hindi society, politics and culture. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a refreshing and challenging exposure to Hindi literature  made all the more difficult because I was the only non-native/non-heritage person in it. In reading authors as diverse as Bharatendu Harischandra, Amrita Pritam, and Harishankar Parsai, I was able not only to expand my vocabulary as a Hindi speaker, but to challenge my understanding of the subcontinent's literary history and develop critical-writing skills in a language that I only started studying last year. Seema Ji and Savita Ji were both so supportive and helpful throughout the entire process; I'm grateful that I stuck with it even when it got tough. "

            "\u00a0Classes are small and a lot of fun and the instructor is extremely warm and supportive. ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught course. The small class size means we can have meaningful discussions about the topics. Professor Seema Khurana and Professor Savita Bala are very knowledgeable. The material was well taught, and the course was well organized. Also, the material and the movies were very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job at introducing you to various Hindi writers and directors whom you would probably never encounter otherwise. Seema ji and Savita Ji are very accommodating to various proficiency levels and will work with you to improve your grammar or vocabulary. Perhaps it could be improved is to more evenly spread out the readings over the different weeks of the course, and make the assignments more varied instead of simply being open-ended responses to each month's material. ",
            "\u00a0Seema Ji and Savita Ji are affable, kind professors who do a great job tailoring the class to each student. The texts they chose were really interesting and covered a wide variety of sources. They set out a lot of time for us and were always available.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by making it more demanding, and ensuring that there all the students are motivated to work hard and challenge each other. I also felt some of the standards set earlier on in the course, for example in terms of reading or homework requirements, fell slightly.  At times, I (and the professors) felt let down by a lack of hardworking peers who would push each other to high standards.\r\n\r\nFinally, the 3 long papers we write are often a struggle for some of us, and the process could be much improved, by, for example, breaking it up into drafts so we get continuous feedback. Each unit could add onto the previous unit's paper rather than being a separate paper, so that we can build off our previous work and draw links between units. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the diversity of ways this course expected us to use our Hindi knowledge not just for reading and writing, but also for conducting partition interviews, giving in-class oral presentations, and having substantive discussions about Hindi literature around the seminar table. I think I would have appreciated a little more clarity at times as to when things were due, but other than that I have no complaints. It was an excellent, challenging and rewarding course. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Hindi L5 is a lot of fun, especially for Native speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an amazing class. You will learn a lot about Indian independence, and gain new insights from the movies, texts, and from the interview that you will conduct with a partition survivor. The teaching in the course is very well organized, and the material is presented well. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0How much you get out of this course largely depends on how much effort you are willing to put in, whether it's in learning new words or seeking feedback on your grammar. Take it if you're looking for a language credit and are relatively interested in Indian culture/Hindi literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although if you want to get a lot out of it you will have to go beyond class and speak to the professors one-on-one, and be strong enough to not be bogged down if your class simply sees it as a requirement to be fulfilled. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I would caution that you get as much out of this class as you're willing to put into it  take advantage of the opportunity to meet with Seema Ji and Savita Ji, work hard on the assignments, and give yourself sufficient time to do the readings, and you'll find that your Hindi ability has increased dramatically by the end.
