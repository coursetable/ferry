            "\u00a0I learned so much about Russian Art and Russian History. It was great to take a look at a range of art historical periods from the lens of one culture. ",
            "\u00a0Nuanced understanding of the art of Russia and the Soviet Union  how visual and performing artists interacted with historical events and trends in other parts of Europe and the world. ",
            "\u00a0Oh my - an incredible amount of knowledge, skill, and insights. I learned about how to effectively formally analyze art based purely on aesthetic. Thanks to fascinating and comprehensive lectures, I think I honed in on the ability to then extrapolate meaning from that analysis based on history and context, too. I learned so much about Russian and Soviet artists and Russian/Soviet culture more generally - especially given that my only engagement with this history came from  a fiction novel \"A Gentleman in Moscow.\" I think I also gained insight on the power of art - particularly when in the face of oppression. ",
            "\u00a0WOW, I learned SO MUCH from this class. I became a better appreciator of art and learned so many FACTS about Russian Art History! A whole new WORLD feels open. ",
            "\u00a0- The concept of \"alternative origins\" for Russia's art history. Rather than thinking of Russia as delayed or derivative, looking for the ways in which Russia's artistic trajectory was buffeted and altered by its own inherent forces (i.e. looking for the heritage of the Icon in abstract art that is often attributed to the West, breaking apart the West/original and East/copycat binary)\r\n- The skill of close reading images and looking for differences in color, line, mark-making, shapes/compositions that resonate with images we've seen before\r\n- Professor Brunson's provocative questions such as, \"How does one paint a nation?\" \"Might there be more for an artist to contribute besides just 'getting there first'\"? \"How does one depict what's real?\"\r\n- Realizing that there are a multitude of \"realisms.\" Verisimilitude isn't the only way to bring attention to what's \"real\" -- painters like Rodchenko and Malevich and Tatlin who let the pliability, the stickiness, the color of their materials determine their art were also highlighting something very real about painting.  \r\n- Just how difficult it is to try and remake the world. And how indebted I am to people like El Lissitzky for making Prouns that made me wish that I were handier so I could try and make what I saw on the canvas. The genius of paintings that were able to make me wish I were prole rather than bougie. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots about Russian and Soviet art, certainly, but also a lot about thinking and writing critically. This was my first art history class, and I really enjoyed developing my close-looking skills through section and papers. I also learned a lot of history through Professor Brunson's lectures. Every semester I hope to take a class that changes the way I see the world; this semester, this was the one. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a strong appreciation for the history of Russian art, especially since Professor Brunson challenged the dominant narratives which hold that Russia is backward, dull, unoriginal, and insignificant within the larger discourse of art history. This class was also a great opportunity to practice formal analysis of art objects. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to develop real analytical skills in the realm of art.  I also learned how to write an essay about art, and research in Yale's extensive literary and art collections. ",
            "\u00a0Although this course pertained specifically to Russian art, I learned a lot about how to look at and write on art in general. I learned how to explain my thoughts about a painting using specific, visual coordinates, and learned to translate these visual cues into an artists larger message. I learned about the important role art plays in capturing and defining a culture. Overall, I developed a heightened appreciation for and new approach to looking at art that I know will serve me well in life. "

            "\u00a0Such a great class. Lectures are incredible, I never missed one! Professor Brunson delivers succinct, well planned lectures, and at times turns to the students for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course, and Prof. Brunson is an equally marvelous instructor. Her lectures are straightforward and interesting  clearly she puts a lot of effort into each one. I would absolutely take it again.\r\n\r\nMy only problem, if you can call it that, is that there is only one exam  the final  so if you're not an art history major, it's hard to know what an exam like that will be like before it's upon you. It might've been helpful to have a short in-class midterm to prepare everyone for what to expect on the final. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think there were many weaknesses. My discussion sections were absolutely inspiring and joyful - never stressful, never competitive, never quiet or lacking engagement. We were able to get up close and personal with propagandist posters, constructivist sculptures, oil paintings of Kandinsky and Malevich... I mean how lucky and blessed are we? Unreal experience and it's great that the TAs and Prof. Brunson didn't skimp out on utilizing Yale's incredible resources. Additionally, lectures were incredibly thoughtful and fascinating. Prof. Brunson attacks the material with no fear - never leaving a question unpacked or a nuance ignored. The canon we explored was comprehensive and bold. The work was manageable. I really adored this course. ",
            "\u00a0LOVE the lecture format. I will listen to anything Molly Brunson says every day. They are insightful and utilize thought-provoking narrative structure. \r\n\r\nI can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- LOVED the fact that all of our sections consisted of examining and reacting to images together -- and that it gave us so many excuses to go to the YUAG. In so many lecture courses, sections consist of people posturing and pretending they've done more of the reading than they actually have, so I loved the fact that close looking at images let us bypass that altogether. Sometimes in section I can feel muzzled and hobbled by doubt about whether I should speak at all because I worry that my comment will be too \"obvious\" or that the answer to my question will be right on the page I didn't get to. But in this class, I felt brilliant because I could combine my first impressions of works with what I learned in lecture \r\n- The fact that the readings were very enticing, but essentially supplementary. I loved feeling COMPELLED to read rather than OBLIGATED to read. I'd go to lecture and Professor Brunson would include such tantalizing quotes in her PowerPoint that I'd say to myself, \"Wow, I wish I could read more than an excerpt\" -- and then I realized that I could! It was right there on Canvas, just waiting for me!\r\n- Really appreciated the fact that there was no midterm and papers that combined together to prepare us for the final. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Wish we had gotten a primer on how close looking at an image differed from close reading a text before our first assignment. I'd love to supplement the Susan Bartlet \"Writing About Art\" ",
            "\u00a0I really loved it all. ",
            "\u00a0RUSS 220 was absolutely fantastic! Professor Brunson's lectures are never anything short of life-changing; the material we covered was both interesting and enlightening; and when writing the papers I felt like I was supported throughout the process and I received helpful feedback afterwards. The only thing I didn't love was that sometimes section discussions were so intense that they felt combative, which made it hard to really be thoughtful about artinstead I felt like I had to just shout something ASAP in order to participate. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are FANTASTIC. This class offers well-balanced, insightful, and new perspectives on Russian art. It brings up a lot of interesting issues, like the tension between Russias identification with Europe vs. Asia and the connection between Byzantine icons and modernist abstraction. The one weakness of this class is that, during lectures, its not 100% clear how much of the material youre responsible for and most of your grade depends on work at the very end of the semester. AMAZING and worthwhile lecture though! ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest parts of this course for me were the sections, held at times in the Beinecke and in the YUAG.  In these smaller group settings, I felt comfortable to engage more fully with the art and flex my analytic muscles. ",
            "\u00a0The course content was very engaging, and I love how Prof. Brunson was able to tell such an engaging story of Russias history through its often-overlooked visual art. The one thing that I was sometimes bothered by is that all the lectures were read word-for-word from a script. While I know that this helped stay on track, it adds to the excitement and engagement for me when a professor is unscripted. It feels more organic and less like we are just bulldozing through material. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Such a great course. I was so engaged and interested in the subject material. Great, even for non-majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes  Prof. Brunson is a really excellent instructor, and the topic is fascinating and well-presented. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class its fantastic. Prof Brunsons lectures are so engaging. You get incredible access to the YUAG, where sections are held. ",
            "\u00a0I think my first few answers pretty much encompass this. I will be telling anyone who listens to take this class - regardless of major. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Learn more stuff, become more knowledgeable about the world, improve your appreciation of art. So many formative art movements come out of Russia (constructivism, cubism) and you NEED to know about this! ",
            "\u00a0A truly perfect class. In every lecture, Professor Brunson asked provocative questions and chased them down with gusto. Svelt Power Points, fascinating readings (lots of primary sources), brief but intriguing papers that let us try our hand at answering the questions Professor Brunson had to leave unanswered in class...what more could you want? ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I learn so much and loved he breadth and depth. ",
            "\u00a0this was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale!! professor Brunson's lectures are very engaging and she is very well spoken. definitely take! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, absolutely take this class (or any class taught by Molly Brunson)! This class changed the way I think about the world. Professor Brunson delivers beautiful and engaging lectures; the art we looked at was fascinating; and the readings are both accessible and not excessive. PLEASE take it!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Would DEFINITELY recommend this class. Professor Brunson is one of the best lecturers Ive ever encountered; her lectures are well-organized, highly engaging, methodical, and even poetic. While this may seem like a niche topic at first glance, the course covers a wide, diverse, and colorful range of art objects, and it traces a trajectory often ignored by dominant art historical narratives. Dont you want to learn about everything from portraiture of peasants to totalitarian art of the failed Soviet experiment to Pussy Riot and protest art? Trust me, you do! Take the class (or at least audit)! Workload is definitely manageable. Sections are actually fun (we often met at the art gallery!). You are graded on a few short papers and both a final essay and exam. Grading is fair and you are really encouraged to hone your art analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  It is a great introduction to art history, and the subject material is very interesting.  The coursework involves quite a lot of reading, but it is not necessarily essential to the course, and skimming works jut fine.  The workload otherwise is very manageable.  Smaller group section in the YUAG is fun and engaging, and really helps to practice analyzing art. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Even as a person with no art history experience, I learned so much about art and was able to learn how to write about it and appreciate it more. During section, we visited the YUAG collection extensively which was a huge plus for me. The content itself is absolutely fascinating especially considering the role Russia plays today on the world stage. This is a great class because it is adaptable for both seasoned art historians and relative beginners. "
