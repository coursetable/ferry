            "\u00a0This class was a great in-depth look into health inequities for the poor and the origins such inequities ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount in this class. The topics of conversation and readings were highly important for what I want to study. It is an extremely important class to understanding the current healthcare climate in the U.S. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the development of hospitals, medical testing, healthcare policy, and the effects on urban communities. I liked the variety in reading material, we read both historical accounts and contemporary secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0learned about the history of health care provision, both governmental and non-governmental, for poor populations in America, including policy histories. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a helpful background to the history of many different aspects of the American health care system / landscape. Because it is a seminar, insights were also gained through dialouge with other students and the instructor. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, good readings, and lots of discussion. \r\nWeakness: Readings were not in a cereal place, and had to look for them every week. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: The readings were amazing and Prof Abedin was really knowledgeable and understanding! I learned a lot about the structure of our healthcare system.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The class discussions could sometimes be fairly unstructured and unproductive. It really annoyed me when people would be on their computers doing other things and then just tune in to say one comment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Discussion topics and readings are very useful. It is an extremely important class to understanding the current healthcare climate in the U.S.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Prof. Abedin doesn't always facilitate discussion easily. ",
            "\u00a0There is not as much structured discussion as there are students who hate silence that feel obligated to speak up. This left the students with a not very well rounded discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus and class structure was great. I learned so much important information about our healthcare system and its foundations. I liked how we looked at different social movements alongside national policies/corporate structures. I think that class discussion could have been better. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the readings and class discussions- both were eye opening and engaging. I especially appreciated writing questions before class- I felt they really made me think about the concepts before class. I wish we had had the opportunity to read more primary sources week to week- I think they would have really added to the class discussion and helped prepare us for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think all of the readings were great and there was an appropriate amount assigned. Some of the discussions felt flatter and less rich than I think the material warranted, and I think that deeper questions and debates could have been discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - really excellent choice of readings; seminar course with small group discussion; knowledge of the instructor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the weekly timeline due each class by a different student was sometimes redundant. Might be more helpful to restructure the assignment or make it more clear what the instructor really wanted "

            "\u00a0It's a great class especially if you're HSHM or entering the medical field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I will use this information going forward for the rest of my academics and it is extremely valuable for understanding the current healthcare climate in the U.S. I would suggest that every student takes a class that focuses on this information for a dose of reality and understanding of how important healthcare for the urban poor is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in healthcare or public health at all, you should definitely take this course. I learned so much important and necessary information, and Professor Abedin is really kind and has a deep understanding and passion for the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have the opportunity to take this course, please do! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely, especially for students who want to grapple with complex topics related to American health care In the past and today. "
