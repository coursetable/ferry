            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history of inequality in the US, facets of its definition, and its mechanisms, especially with regard to racial stratification in US society. ",
            "\u00a0This was probably one of my most important classes that I have taken in relation to my future academic/career plans.  This is the most policy-based course I have taken at Yale as well as one of the most relevant to my field of interest in Political Science (labor and social policy).  Opportunities to express the development of these skills, namely in writing an op-ed, mid-semester paper, and final research essay, featured well in developing these skills.  I also highly appreciate the opportunity to learn at least some of the histories behind social policy development in the US, especially emphasizing the role of structural racism in preempting efforts to create a more extensive welfare state or labor rights regime. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we learned about the underlying policy issues that perpetuate inequality in the United States. We covered a wide breadth of topics, from the failures of the welfare state, to universal healthcare, to the finance sector. This class is perfect for those interested in social issues and policymaking. Adam Thal is a great professor who has an amazing depth of knowledge from his research and is willing to be challenged on various issues, as well as an engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the historical, political, and social causes and consequences of inequality in the United States. Through an exploration of different policy initiatives - from healthcare to housing - I gained a rich understanding of systematic oppression and opportunities for change. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the inequality in America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Inequality in America, and I also learned more about the social science methods that go into research on it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about actual policy and policy studies in this course. Read a lot of studies throughout the semester pertaining to equality and ended the course with designing my own policy study. ",

            "\u00a0The information I got about social policy from this course was helpful and very relevant to current issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about theories of equality, the Great Divergence and why it's happened, the effect of inequality on the US in terms of political participation and power, the welfare state, opportunity, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Class does not teach much.  Everything gone over is either common sense or already covered by most basic US History classes. ",
            "\u00a0Good background on critical studies. Gave me a good foray into multiple things I want to continue with in the future! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to the scope of the problem of inequality, and the potential policy solutions to those problems. Additionally, the final research project is a great introduction into the process of writing a political science research paper, and teaches students how to think about setting up potential social science studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a really in-depth and nuanced way to analyze inequality in the US. Additionally, the readings, most of which are studies, provde a very rigorous model of understanding inequality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history and of political and economic inequality in the United States. ",

            "\u00a0An introduction to political science methods and a strong overview of social policy in the U.S. related to inequality. Sort of gives a solid overview of a lot of things you might vaguely know about from reading the news but could benefit from an academic engagement with. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a basic overview of the major topics in inequality. The topics themselves are interesting, but you mostly look at the important research studies and don't spend a lot of time thinking about the issues themselves. I feel like I have a better understanding of the field, but other than that, I don't feel like I learned a whole lot. ",

            "\u00a0The course addresses very relevant and important information, though the delivery and discussion of the information is limited. ",
            "\u00a0The course's charting of the history of inequality and the importance of studying it featured well in addition to Professor Thal's thorough work of identifying the causes and effects of inequality in the US while still providing alternating theories as to these causes and effects.  However, I think that one of the course's most powerful areas--doing the policy work of imagining solutions to inequality--might have been expanded more, as many of the students who take Professor Thal's course have a preexisting devotion to solving inequality.  The resulting diversity of solutions proposed would have provided fertile ground for dialogue among students in a way that enabled the class to close its circle of thought more completely and powerfully.  I also believe that the course could have analyzed inequality employing more of an interdisciplinary approach that marries cultural and ethnic studies and feminist theory with more empirical studies of inequality.  This combination of fields could be immensely powerful in extending the class's implications that gives the study of inequality more justice than what can be given by agreeable platitudes said by center-left economists. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers and explains a lot of basic issues that young people may never have learned about, such as how the welfare system is set up and what types of healthcare systems exist (ex. single-payer). It is also well structured, with engaging topics and lectures accompanied by more in-depth readings and books that help students delve deeper than the lecture material.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this course is that it is definitely biased towards liberal policies. As someone who identifies as a Democrat, I wish that there had been more issues that were explored from both sides, even if the end conclusion was the same. I also wish we had spent more time on Latino, Asian-American, and Native American inequality. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by fewer readings, or perhaps more of a variety of readings, on the same topic. While the books we read for this class were incredible, it is challenging to assign a book to a lecture class in one week or less. If readings were more accessible, I think class engagement would have been higher. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading! ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot in this course, but the amount of reading they ask you to do is absurd, especially when you can get by without doing any of it. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it felt like we glossed over pertinent subject matters -- education in America, health care -- that I wish we spent more time actually studying them in depth. ",
            "\u00a0more engaging lectures ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting and well taught. I absolutely loved the lectures and the paper topics were interesting as well as broad so that we could choose to discuss about what we are most passionate. The reading could be a little much on some weeks but overall it was a well-designed class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized, and the lectures are fairly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content and relevance to national conversations, mix of assignments that all helped practice a different skill, diversity of readings. Weaknesses: lectures a bit dry at times (and often just repeated the readings), could have received more guidance on the final paper since most undergrads are not as well-versed in research design ",
            "\u00a0Low level material, but high level expectations for papers.  Disconnect between what we are taught and what we are expected to produce. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good introduction for people without much experience in these discourses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt like we could have dived deeper into many things. ",
            "\u00a0It was fine. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is the scope of problems of inequality introduced. However, I think that overall there was a disconnect between the amount of reading and the material actually discussed in lecture and section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - lectures and readings were really interesting to me\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes, it felt that some of the lectures were stating the obvious (i.e. the Jim Crow lecture). I think it's a missed opportunity to delve into other facets of inequality that are less well-understood. ",
            "\u00a0It was very comprehensive in dealing with the various forms of inequality and thinking about how they came about. However, I feel like my pretty Left-leaning views on things were not challenged from the left OR the right in the class. ",
            "\u00a0More engagement with contrasting literature needed. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job of outlining inequality in the US, but I wish more time would have been spent getting at the root of these issues. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material, but not necessarily new material. Also, not particularly engaging ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course! As an international students, Professor Thal's class gave me a great insight into the socio-economic inequalities in the US, the political, historical and structural causes, and possible ways of combating these inequalities. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very profound readings, great subject material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments were not discussed with the same seriousness that they were graded with. The \"quiz\" was longer and more detailed than most exams I've taken here; the papers are brought up once in class as a \"write about your interests,\" and then TFs are instructed to give out as few As as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: highly relevant subject matter, pretty nicely organized, lots of room for asking questions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there aren't too many \"wow\" moments in the class, it's kind of straightforward, maybe in part because it's an overview and doesn't focus as much on details. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this class is that it's based on a very interesting topic, so it has a lot of potential. But right now it's just kind of meh. Some of the things we read were actually really interesting, but lectures presented the material in a dry way. I felt like I understand the major topics and studies in inequality, but I'm not sure I learned anything particularly fascinating or insightful. Perhaps, this was just about my TA, but I also had issues with the grading. It seemed arbitrarily difficult and picky compared to the overall level and expectations of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Too boring of a lecture ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting but the lectures tended to be a bit bland - switching it up a bit from just going through wordy slides would be helpful to cement the material we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Section could have more robust discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the angle of this course-- combining political and economic inequality, and using multiple disciplines to do so, was really valuable. I also enjoyed the variety of assignments and got a lot out of them. I did think lecture sometimes felt like it was just recapping what was in the readings, and not going further or taking a broader perspective. "

        [
            "\u00a0No. There are better courses out there. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to any student interested in policy surrounding inequality, because the information is quite thorough. ",
            "\u00a0I at least partially believe that this course should be made mandatory for Political Science students, since a wide absence of the kinds of analyses provided in this course has proven dangerous when many of the Political Science majors at Yale use their degrees for ends that are contrary to actually solving the problems that wide swaths of Yale students seem to agree exist.  It's because of this reason that I see potential for the class to expand its scope by integrating more historical and cultural analyses while placing policy solutions closer to its forefront. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was my favorite course I took this semester, largely due to how in-depth the lectures went and how many topics we were able to cover. This class is a great primer for those wanting to delve into specific policymaking areas, so that they can first understand how healthcare/education/welfare in the US works. This class has also shaped how I view the world, and inequality in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it is a relatively new course. Hopefully with some tweaks it will be a little more student-friendly. I did learn a lot and its survey style helped me articulate what my interests really are. ",
            "\u00a0Good class if you want to learn about inequality ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course, it's a great way to learn about inequality in America, and it's pretty easy to get a decent grade, even if you don't do all the reading. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about how policies and practices have further inequality in America, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0perhaps ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was interesting, well taught and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course had a lot of reading, but that is one of its strengths because it teaches you how to manage a high reading load. In terms of the information we learn, the course is extremely valuable and pertinent to policy questions of today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially as a fifth class. Definitely not a gut, but workload was totally manageable and I felt like it was structured so that there were *just enough* assignments for me to actually get something out of the class, both in terms of content and in terms of skill. Five-page response paper as the midterm paper was a good length; an op-ed, which is something you don't usually write for a class; a quiz with true/false, short-answer, and short-essay, to make sure that we were actually learning the content; and a research design final paper, which is something that's arguably more useful than your standard argument-based research paper. Professor Thal was great considering this was his first time teaching (definitely still has room for improvement), and his selection of topics was amazing: good mix of theory and practice, and often very relevant to the conversations we're having as a campus and as a nation. ",
            "\u00a0Probably. But, I wish it would be better past introductory material. ",
            "\u00a0It was fine. Definitely take credit D for a lecture. More work than is warranted for a lecture, TBH. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone looking for an introductory political science class that gives you a good sense of what studies in the field are like, and how to write papers in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this is a must take course for all Yale students. This class provides a strong foundation for understanding racial and economic inequality in the United States, an understanding that I think is integral for all people--especially privileged Yale students--to have. In addition, the readings (i.e. Evicted by Matthew Desmond, Gilens' groundbreaking study on racial coding of welfare, etc.) are really excellent; I didn't feel like I had to force myself to read the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, this is the history we all need to hear. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, as it is a great overview of the social policy development and the resulting inequalities in the US and includes some really interesting readings, while at the same time not being overly much work. ",
            "\u00a0No, there are better alternatives, and the disengagement from professors/TFs and general disorganization prevent this from being an enjoyable course ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely feel it was worth it. I learned a lot of things that will help me understand the government and how people think about it. The lectures where clear and straightforward. I learned a lot about the history of inequality and its dramatic rise over the last 50 years, which is so important in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in the topic, you might want to consider taking it, but know that it's just alright. Not a lot of work, but not a particularly good class either. In all fairness though, this was Professor Thal's first time teaching it, so it might improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. the material is important for anyone who lives in the United States ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend U.S. Social Policy and Political Inequality to any student interested in gaining a general, practical knowledge of and engaging in conversation about current events and practices that affect the state of inequality in America today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the material but the readings were too numerous. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - a bit bland but the material is so important for everyone to learn! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you can easily get through the class not learning too much if you don't participate. That being said, the material is eye opening and important. "
