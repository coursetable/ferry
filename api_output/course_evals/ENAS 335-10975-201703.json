            "\u00a0Strengths: the class has no exams, just weekly case studues which are basically reading comprehension, three take home case studues which are really similar, and a final paper. Sometimes attendance was taken but usually is based on if you pick up and drop off your case studies at each class. Mercedes is a great human being.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the case studies were a little long. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the course and I feel that if you actually attend class and listen to lectures, you really do learn a lot. The presentations are very thorough and flow very logically, making it easy to understand some difficult concepts. I can't believe I'm writing this, but I think the class could actually be more punitive and harsher. I'm writing that preemptively not based on my experience, but because I'm sure a lot of people will write that they didn't learn that much, but they're also the ones who LITERALLY never showed up to class, or played on their computers the whole time if they did. Honestly if you showed up and paid attention, you learned a lot. Professor Carreras genuinely doesn't want her students to suffer (she puts a ton of effort into her classes) and it really bothers me that a lot of students seem to think that suffering is directly correlated with engagement. ",

            "\u00a0Her lectures were a little bit disjointed. I really appreciated how hard she tried to engage the students and let us participate but the setting of the classroom kind of made that difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is that it teaches a lot of ethical theories that are very applicable to the real world and the cases we looked at for homework were all very interesting and relevant. No real weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0Good content, but maybe turning in and picking up of homework could be better organized. ",
            "\u00a0Mercedes is very caring and understands that the life of a college student can be very stressful. Unfortunately, many of the students in the class did not use this opportunity wisely to come to class and have a conversation, which is what I think could improve the class even more. Mercedes encourages us to make our own decisions, and this gives us a chance to look at our own lives and decide what is ethical. I would not have read as much as I did if it weren't for this class and learned what I needed to through the case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super easy\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: boring, poorly taught... and did I mention boring? ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a very reasonable amount of work while also stressing the main points of each topic learned. The one weakness is the organizational structure of the class in terms of receiving and returning work. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by moving fully digital. It is environmentally insensitive that 150 students are using 3-5 pages for each case which is 2-3 sheets double sided for each of the 34 cases which would be 3*34*150 = 15, 300 SHEETS OF PAPER WASTED. this class is completely ridiculous waste of paper. Sorry I forgot the 12-15 page final essay that was also required in print so 15,300 +12*150 = 17,100 sheets of paper. 8,333.3 sheets of paper are in 1 tree which would mean this class has killed 2 trees more or less. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Carreras is fantastic. Extremely nice and accommodating, and really cares about her students. I learned more than I thought I would, and the class didn't have too high of a time commitment. \r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the readings/homeworks were closer to the material that was covered in lecture though. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Carreras is a kindhearted, insightful and intellectual woman. She truly cares about her students. I only wish that more people felt the urge to engage in the discussions she tries to facilitate. My strongest critique is that the questions for the reading responses are incredibly tedious and in some instances pointless/without depth. In most cases are forced to regurgitate information rather than engage with it. ",

            "\u00a0A strength was that the readings are very interesting and relevant to everyone's lives. I felt like I got a lot out of the readings. A weakness is that the lectures were hard to follow and sometimes felt like a waste of time. ",

            "\u00a0I think this class is well intentioned and covers an important topic, but I think the mechanism through which it tries to instruct students about ethics in the workplace is poor. The homework assignments were too easy and it seemed like they were arbitrarily graded. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are actually quite interesting. I enjoyed doing them, and I think that having the reading questions is a good way to force people to do it. However, answering these questions often took a long time and felt very tedious/useless, because the questions essentially just tested reading comprehension. I think there could be fewer questions per reading, but the questions could force you to think more/integrate what we talk about in lecture with what is in the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very chill and relaxed, not much work, interesting videos in class\r\nWeakness: Not at all intellectually challenging or stimulating ",

            "\u00a0I thought the content (case studies) were very interesting and explored a variety of different subjects. I would say that having more in class discussions related to the case-studies could perhaps help with the understanding of the fundamental principles embedded within the studies. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to learn about a variety of topics take this class ",
            "\u00a0This is probably one of the worst classes I've taken at Yale. It has the reputation of being a gut, which is the reason a lot of people take it, but it has an annoying amount of weekly assignments which are nothing more than busy work. They're literally worksheets about articles, but the worksheets are often times incomprehensible and the entire activity boils down to you pulling lines straight out of the article to answer the question. Even though the questions are a joke, the grading isn't forgiving so you have to spend a lot of time on them and fluff up your answers if you want to do well on them. Really infuriating to have to spend a couple of hours doing something so mindless. Take a different class, put your work towards something more worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a relaxed but still interesting way to learn the basics of philosophy and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn about important philosophers and moral theories and how these then relate to the workplace. The class explores business ethics, bioethics, and sexual harrassment along with a whole host of other topics. Professor Carreras is also very kind. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, take this course if you can get in! Mercedes is a great professor and she really cares about her students. It's not a lot of work and you learn about a lot of different ethical cases that are very relevant to the world today. ",

            "\u00a0Mercedes is awesome. Fairly easy class because no real tests, but there is homework EVERY Thursday. A little redundant, but nonetheless fairly easy. The homework takes about 1-2 hours every Wednesday night, so if you're not willing to do it then this class isn't for you ",
            "\u00a0Negative. Its easy in the sense that most stuff isn't graded very hard, but the weekly homework and 10-15 page final paper aren't worth it. You are way better of finding an easy lecture with a midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0I would  definitely recommend this course to any Yale student. Professor Carreras is an incredible orator that makes old philosophy mean something to our everyday lives. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely take as an easy 5th course! Very little work needed, but professor Carreras is great and leads a fun class! The final 15 page paper does sneak up on you thought! ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student. We had weekly assignments which took about one or two hours to complete, in addition to some other work we did in class. The final essay was a great opportunity to explore an area we were interested in specifically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You've probably heard that this class is pretty easy. The homework can get a little repetitive/lengthy, but for the most part this is true. Still, you can actually learn a fair amount from this class if you go to class and pay attention, especially if you have never taken a philosophy/ethics class before. Dr. Carreras is very nice and accommodating. ",
