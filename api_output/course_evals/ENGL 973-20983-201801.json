            "\u00a0I appreciated having a weekly student presentation because it was nice to have objects to hold on to while we discussed the texts. On most weeks, I also liked having a lecture to situate the readings. Nevertheless, I was disappointed that not enough time was left for discussion with our peers. Although the lectures, videos, and images were helpful overall, I found that the class dynamic shifted to comments being mediated through the instructor rather than with each other. "
