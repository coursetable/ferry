            "\u00a0This course took me through a survey of perspectives about the emergence and evolution of human beings. It touched on how various features of the modern human emerged, including our symbolic capacities, language, culture, music. It was also very inter-disciplinary: our readings came from evolutionary biology, but also from archaeology, linguistics and other fields. This class nurtured my ability to draw from multiple disciplines in learning about a topic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about evolution, especially human evolution through a different lens of culture including music, art, and speech. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of evolutionary models on all levels, how to parse conceptual papers and link seemingly disparate ideas into cohesive scientific narratives ",
            "\u00a0I learned the complexities of and contemporary debates within evolutionary biology. I developed a greater capacity to think about complex systems. I was introduced to semiotics, linguistics, and evolutionary history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many of the major events in the evolution of modern humans and their culture. The main topics covered were the history of evolution, same basic science principles of evolution, the theory of semiosis and origin of culture, and a brief overview of archeological research related to early humans. Overall the course was about a 50/50 mix of scientific and traditional humanities readings and topics (which felt very nice!) ",
            "\u00a0I spent a lot of time reading scientific articles with a humanistic lens.  Also, I workshopped my writing to be better for this type of class.  And, I learn to engage with and produce work for a professor with a different teaching style that I had previously faced. ",
            "\u00a0Readings on evolutionary theory and human history, with a focus on culture and non-genetic inheritance. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus was outstanding. Every week gave me a whole new perspective on this topic. Each reading really engaged with each other. \r\nWeaknesses: I think Prof. Tomlinson could provide slightly more guidance to those of us unfamiliar with writing papers related to science. At times, I found writing the essays difficult because I was unsure what methodology I should be using. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the materials and the way it was taught. I think the paper topics and lengths were fair and I enjoyed the topics. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of lecturing, little real discussion, readings were very dense. Conversations in class were good at teasing things apart in a cohesive way, Tomlinson is very clear ",
            "\u00a0Very specific focus\r\nTomlinsons own book is not well written, it has many odd turns of phrase that are very unclear ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topics were interesting, lectures during seminar were informative, papers were concise.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material sometimes felt scattered, seminar lacked discussion among the students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Course scope/breadth, course professor, workload. Overall the course was excellent. The readings were usually highly relevant and almost always actually discussed during the class. Some weeks were a little more reading intensive than others but overall I felt the load was not unreasonable. Readings/course outline covered a wide array of topics, including Darwin, primary scientific articles about evolution topics, semiosis, archeology, human migration, human culture, etc. Dr. Tomlinson was another strength of the course: he was very insightful and did a great job of leading the class discussion. He is very knowledgeable about both the science and humanities side of the course so I found him to be very engaging to listen to. Finally, the course was not a super high workload (weekly readings that definitely were discussed so you had to do them + 1x3 page paper, 1x4 page paper, and 1x 5 page paper).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Structure. This is a lecture class masquerading as a seminar. The class is pretty large (like 20-25 ish) and you'd be lucky to get a sentence in per week in. Tomlinson talks for like ~90% of the class at least. I personally prefer this style over ones that are more undergraduate led but I imagine that most people like to talk a little bit more. ",
            "\u00a0We are privileged to be working with one of the greatest innovators in today's biocultural evolutionary field. The course has an internal logic, which I would certainly preserve. I found the class discussions informative, though I did sometimes catch myself thinking that our conversations were simply regurgitating the readings. It may be nice to have students bring in articles of their own -- or to have small presentations at the beginning of some meetings. ",
            "\u00a0The course felt well-structured, and I think it as the right size.\r\n\r\nHowever, the course was also incredibly dry, taking a topic that at first glance is exciting and surrendering over solely to the technical.  This led me to believe that the course is not really sure what it wants to be.  Is it a cultural approach to evolution?  An evolutionary approach to culture?  Who knows.  I would see for yourself if it's a course you want to embark on.\r\n\r\nAt times, also, I felt that the way discussion went was uneven.  It was not about venturing guesses and having a dialogue; it was about speaking to the so-called correct way of thinking and then listening to a lengthy explanation if we had no idea.  No class really strayed into the exciting space between what students are drawn to and the syllabus; it stuck solely to the syllabus.  And, while some readings were interesting, others missed the mark completely.  It often felt like we could never have a productive discussion because the majority of the class did not know how to approach the material, and there was no attempt to coach us how. ",
            "\u00a0This course has interesting content but fixates on weird things that are hard to focus on ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is excellent, but it would benefit from more clarity on format. The class this year was too large to function effectively as a seminar, but not really committed to being a lecture. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course especially to students in the humanities and social sciences looking for an interesting, rigorous and challenging way to delve into human evolution from a humanistic lens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Interesting for anyone in different fields and approachable for those not STEM inclined. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material and relatively relaxed workload make for a really nice fifth class ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Prof. Tomlinson is fantastic and knowledgeable about a wide range of fields and the way he creates a class full of people from various majors with unique insights bolsters this interdisciplinary quality even further. The content was very interesting and he did a good job of explaining the more difficult concepts. Definitely one of best seminar Ive taken in a long time! ",
            "\u00a0No, a more general science credit is more informative ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in an introduction to evolutionary biology and other topics such as semiotics, culture, archaeology, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for sure! I took this as a science student looking to complete my humanities requirement and loved it. I think the course is the perfect mix of science and humanities and does not lean more one way than other. The reading load is not unbearable and the papers are fairly short. The content is extremely interesting and combines info from many different fields, including genetics, developmental biology, archeology, psychology, history, semiosis, etc so there's something for everyone. Plus, it only meets once per week so it's not time intensive. The only thing I would warn is that Dr. Tomlinson talks for at least 90% of the seminar. If you like a more lecture-style class you will like this but if you were hoping to hear yourself talk more then maybe you might find this a little frustrating. I personally liked listening to Dr. Tomlinson and prefer lectures so I liked this style. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This science credit will make you think without overwhelming you with work. Plus, there are no exams! ",
            "\u00a0If you are highly interested in the subject, have a background in evolutionary biology at least at the bare minimum, and are willing to go along for the ride with some lectures that will be absolute snoozers (unless, of course, you can make them not snoozers for yourself because you love the subject), then have at it.  But, you do need to be motivated and you have to make of this class what want out of it.  Prof. Tomlinson likes to see people be engaged and likes students to be fully-formed intellectuals in life and/or on the subject, or at least nearing that level.  He dislikes wrong answers, and he will often shoot them down in an effort to forge on to the one he was looking for.  If you're the kind of student who thinks \"all my peers who venture guesses to professors and have no idea if they're right are idiots; they should just be quiet and listen,\" then you'll love this class.  Alternatively, if you know a lot already about the subject, he will really like that.  Those with curiosity but perhaps not all the knowledge might feel burned.  And this burn might turn into disengagement, which will make the lectures (note: I say lectures because it's mostly the professor talking for a seminar length of time to wax poetic) interminable.  I could go on, but I'd risk sounding like one of the lectures I heard this semester in the class, so I'll stop here! ",
            "\u00a0I was under the impression this was an \"easy science credit\" - that's not the case if you are actually a STEM person. It's super philosophical and he grades very harshly, especially if writing isn't your strong suit which is not something you want in a science credit. "
