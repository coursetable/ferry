            "\u00a0I learned about diasporic theory and its evolution and differential application since the 1800s to the present time across different places and ethnicities. I learned how to read both historical and secondary sources for perspective, detail, and patterns in migrations and community-building and critique them during discussion and in writing. I also learned about the value of alternative forms of knowledge production, such as documentaries, literature, and art. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of diasporic communities and migrations is definitely much more nuanced now. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, very little knowledge or skills, but a lot of insights! I really liked Professor Tran, and a lot of my insights came from me being one of the only white people in a primarily Asian class --what was my place there? What could I add or when do I back off? What is the value of other people's mesearch? I found that I relied on readings more because I couldn't take from my own experience, and that sometimes it was best not to talk, and let someone with actual experience in the situations we discussed speak instead. But it is still important people of other races take Asian diasporas!! Learn about your legacies of oppression, or solidarity! Put in historical context current issues! ",
            "\u00a0As a STEM major this class really helped me learn how to read and discuss and think critically. ",
            "\u00a0So much about the history behind asian diasporas, current theoretical frameworks of diasporas, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Diasporic Studies lens and lots of new perspectives "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course's strengths included the framework of the course, which involved facilitated discussion with occasional guest speakers and recommended events. The reading list highly facilitated student learning and was very interesting. Professor Quan helped situate our discussions within the readings, while encouraging the exploration of how personal histories and observations outside of class. \r\n\r\nIt would be cool if the class could go on a field trip to a museum or show concerning Asian history. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class, no improvements necessary. ",
            "\u00a0In this course you explore Asian diaspora through a variety of lenses and narrative types. In general, Professor Tran goes above and beyond to make sure each class is engaging and unique. At times, class discussion became a bit repetitive and simplistic, but that was not Professor Tran's fault and did not happen often. ",
            "\u00a0Ok honestly I found the course itself pretty standard. Professor Tran has a good heart, but if you want a great class with her, just take Intro to Critical refugee Stidies. Prof. Tran truly blossoms in that setting and that class was one of my favorites. This one was just good. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a lot of different topics and there were definitely areas I wish could've been explored more, but with only a semester I don't know if there's a way to fix that- it's more in the nature of the course, in that its subject is extremely complex. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a good class -- the readings were appropriate for incoming level wgss studies students as well as seniors more familiar with the theories. I've learned so much from this class and I'm ready to use it in my future life as well as to pass on the information I've learned as a means of raising awarness! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this course. If you're thinking of taking this course, I hope you take it--Professor Tran is very supportive of all her students. We had a mix of humanities seniors and science major sophomores and everyone enjoyed the class and got a lot out of it. Some of the most interesting discussions/ideas this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course! Professor Quan is a warm, highly knowledgable, professor who wants to help you learn. If you want to take your first ER&M or Asian/Asian American studies class, I highly encourage this one for its highly varied reading list, great discussions, and interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it's a fascinating, well-developed class with a multifaceted perspective on diasporas. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about Asian diasporas and don't mind a mix of history and more creative, personal narrative then definitely! The class begins with a history-heavy focus, and there is a lot of reading. However, this is really instrumental to being able to discuss and understand the texts and materials covered in the latter half of the course-- which tend to be much more creative and easily engaging. Professor Tran really does a great job of making sure that each class encourages learning in a new, exciting, intriguing way, so the two hour blocks do not feel nearly as long as they could. The final project is quite fun and freeing, and you can explore almost any aspect of Asian diaspora that you want. ",
            "\u00a0Mm not the best class in ER and M, but if you can't get into any others of Tran's classes, take it just to be near her. She's like a delicate and beautiful butterfly, with wings of steel. Definitely the best Professor in ER and M. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredible- at times there's a lot of reading and it demands that you be engaged, but even if you don't come from a strong humanities background (I'm a STEM major) you won't feel in over your head. Professor Tran is great at leading discussions and structuring classes so that even though it's almost 2 hours, it doesn't feel long at all. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tran is really wonderful  she's super dedicated and so helpful to all of her students. That said, I was not super interested in some of the material in the course and took it more for the professor. It's a lot of reading if you're not interested in it, so make sure you like the topics before enrolling! ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Take it take it take it. Such a good class. There was a lot of reading but it was all so interesting anyway! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is obviously of interest to anyone looking to understand Asian diasporas and migration, but it is also very useful for anyone who wants to study migration in general. The diasporic lens is a game changer for migration studies, and this class offers a look into diasporic studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Tran leads discussion super well, and designs an amazing syllabus. We went to talks, had guests, and ate great food. This class totally changed how I view diaspora both in the US and abroad. I would 100% recommend, especially with a full engagement. "
