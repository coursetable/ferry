            "\u00a0This course was not practical enough. It felt like each week we learned about a different horrible thing happening in the world, but did not learn how to address it. This was frustrating to me, because I fully know that there is a high rate of sexual assault in conflict settings -- I took this class not to learn about the prevalence of horrible things, but instead to learn how to SOLVE those problems. The title of the course, \"epidemiological methods...\" does not actually represent what the class is truly about. I would have appreciated learning some true epi methods to address the challenges of conflict and other ways to effectively address challenges. \r\n\r\nThe guest speakers were all awesome people, but impaired the flow of the course and the ability for us to learn material that built on itself. Each guest speaker provided a high-level overview of their topic, much of which was information I already knew. I would have liked to go much more into depth about fewer topics. \r\n\r\nIn particular, though, 2 guest speakers were awesome --- Jennifer Mootz and the speaker from the military/war college. Talking with guest speakers over Skype is a cool idea, but I don't think I learned much from that experience due to 1) language barriers -- hard to understand their English sometimes and 2) the distance over video chat is very challenging to overcome and build report. \r\n\r\nAlso, the event with the families from IRIS was not very new for me. I've learned a lot about refugees and the process to get to the US. So, I don't really feel like speaking with them was that beneficial. Instead, I would have liked to go more into depth about how to actually help those populations, practically. \r\n\r\nOverall, fine course, but too high-level....wanted more practical applicable skills, instead of a grand tour in world problems.\r\n\r\nThe research proposal assignment was not very good either, because we learned nothing in the class about how to design research in conflict settings. Also, some students in the class do not want to do research after YSPH, so designing a proposal is not that helpful for them. Would prefer more flexibility...i.e., you can do a research proposal if you want, or could come up with a policy / action plan to respond to a key issue in conflict health. Or, perhaps also give students the option to just write a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0A great course ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course! I really enjoyed the readings and the guest speakers as well as the opportunity to learn from my classmates during the individual presentations. Having the refugee families come into class was an extremely valuable experience and something I will never forget. I felt like the workload was very heavy near the end of the semester, so the only thing I would change would be to distribute it more evenly throughout the course. For example, moving the cholera in Yemen simulation (which I thought was a great assignment!) to an earlier week. ",
            "\u00a0It was great! I learned a lot and thought it was a very thought provoking class. I would have enjoyed it more with more discussions and/or activities like the simulation assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the material discussed in this class, since so many global health efforts take place in areas that are recovering from or actively in conflict. I think the ideas and discussions were valuable and interesting. This has been my favorite course at YSPH. I think the proposal is valuable practice, and I think it would be helpful to incorporate how the different authors may have approached the different sections of the proposal to help students begin to think about how others have approached the research and how they might apply it to the proposal. (e.g. directly discuss what the ethical considerations of research of the chronic disease or mental health research in Syria, etc) ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Kaveh did an amazing job. This is one the best courses I took at YSPH.\r\nGreat lectures and guest speakers. This course is a must take for anyone at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoy the way the course incorporates one paper throughout the semester, and the readings were very interesting. The game was also interesting to complete. "

            "\u00a0Professor Khoshnood is a phenomenal professor! He is extremely passionate about addressing health ramifications of violent conflicts and his dedication is admirable. He truly cares about his students' wellbeing and seeks ways to supplement our learning by connecting us with refugees as well as leading health care professionals and researchers working on some of the topics we covered in class. His kindness, empathy, and ability to facilitate respectful and thoughtful conversations about heavy topics is remarkable. I am so fortunate to have taken this course with such an exemplary role model. Thank you Professor Khoshnood for this life-changing learning experience. ",

            "\u00a0Only recommended if you know close to nothing about conflict + health. Not a very practical class, as each class session was mostly just, \"here's another bad thing happening in the world....\" but did not include a discussion really of how to address that bad thing. Some cool guest speakers, but most were just okay and took away from class time / made the class not feel very coherent. Honestly, I cannot tell you a single thing I learned in the class, though I did enjoy getting to work more closely with Kaveh. Not at all an epidemiological methods class, so don't take it expecting that! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. Kaveh has put so much thought into designing it and I learned more from this class than any other class at Yale. Issues surrounding violent conflict and refugees are not taught in any other class, and I think they are extremely important to understand. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you are interested in how violence is a public health issue! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend this course. The course provides an overview of different research and approaches when addressing a variety of health issues surrounding armed conflict. This includes diseases, access to chronic disease care, sexual violence, nutrition, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to another student! This was my first (and unfortunately last)  global health course at YSPH and I am blown away by the quality of Professor Khoshnood's teaching. He is extremely passionate about addressing health ramifications of violent conflicts and his dedication is admirable. He truly cares about his students' wellbeing and seeks ways to supplement our learning by connecting us with refugees as well as leading health care professionals and researchers working on some of the topics we covered in class. His kindness, empathy, and ability to facilitate respectful and thoughtful conversations about heavy topics is remarkable. I am so fortunate to have taken this course with such an exemplary role model. ",
            "\u00a0must take this course ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course where students will be exposed to difficult conversations about violence and conflict. It will get students to think about their work in a different manner. Highly recommend this course! "
