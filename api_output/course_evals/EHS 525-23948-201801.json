PEOPLE INTERESTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH ARE ALSO INTERESTED IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE RESEARCH.  SCHEDULE THE SEMINAR SERIES AT DIFFERENT TIMES. ",

            "\u00a0I did not gain too much from this course. There were a few subjects that I was interested in but it was very toxicology and genetics heavy which was hard to follow without a strong background in those topics. ",
            "\u00a0I think that rather than presentations focusing on simply conveying the material in the assigned papers, the presentations should focus on the connections and the relevance of the material to public health and environmental health. ",
            "\u00a0This class should not be mandatory for EHS students, or we should get one credit for taking it. None of the students do the readings, because we are stretched way too thin with coursework. We should only have about 4 lectures each semester, and we should not be required to present in journal club. ",

Additionally, students in this class could have opportunity to discuss different scientific issues with professors and experts in their fields. ",
            "\u00a0Since this course is not for credit, it is difficult to put additional time into it outside of class. I like the idea of reading journal articles and hearing presentations from experts in the field. I think the course would be improved if instead of student presentations on the papers we had a group discussion (i.e. something more involved and participatory) "

And everyone's so overbooked from their five other classes that no one does the readings and then the discussions are pretty useless.  I vote that it meet only every other week and just include the actual speakers. ",
