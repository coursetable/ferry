            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of the field of American Political Development (APD). Being taught by the individual who practically invented the discipline forces you to engage with the subject matter and walk away with a conception of what the field hope to uncover and how the school of thought has changed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about American development through a wide variety of lenses, including political culture, state capacity, movements/party organization, and constitutional change. I learned how to think about political changes over time, and grappled with difficulties facing the modern American state. "

            "\u00a0Although Professor Skowronek is transparent about the reading load, you do not realize how intensive the assigned books and articles are until you dive into the class. Lackluster class discussions revealed that most people had not done all of the readings. However, Professor Skowronek's summaries of the texts at the beginning of every seminar really helped me understand the material. I might have learned more in this seminar than I have in any other despite the fact that actual class time was often not very dynamic. I think the course could be improved by condensing readings and more clearly articulating expectations for the writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course included Professor Skowronek, who is a founding member of the APD subfield. Having him frame the week's readings, placing them into dialogue with each other, was invaluable. Concluding the semester with The Policy State was a nice touch, as it allowed us to complete our study by discussing the cumulative effects of development over political time. I also was a fan of the diverse readings, which covered subjects ranging from racism to state-building to movement politics. While they didn't always fit together nicely, observing how APD has shifted its focus was instructive. Discussion among students with such different interests---American institutionalists, comparativists, theorists, etc.---was always fruitful. "

            "\u00a0I hesitate to recommend this course to another student. I simultaneously loved the class and hated it. The political theories we engaged with thoroughly helped me in other seminars on American politics or history. However, the reading load was overwhelming, and I often felt that students had no incentive to do the reading given that Professor Skowronek monopolized most of the class time. Moreover, when students did contribute, Skowronek seemed dismissive or disinterested in what undergraduates had to say. Ultimately, I would suggest selecting a different political science or American studies seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a lot of reading per week, often very dense and technical, but APD provides a great lens for cataloguing shifts in the state's operations and priorities over time. An incredible opportunity to learn about a subfield of political science from one of its most influential scholars. "
