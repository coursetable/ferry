I learned from my peers as well, from watching them present their own research and field questions about their methods, inquiries, and so on. "

We had an undergraduate in this seminar and it was great to have that intersection between graduate and undergrad. \r\nThis is such a good environment to pursue research and get feedback from peers I would like to pinpoint some formal aspects that I can later use in other environments to bring them up to a good speed.
