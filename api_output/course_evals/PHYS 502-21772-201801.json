            "\u00a0I already learned the entire Griffiths electrodynamics in undergrad and then forgot most of it, so this class was mostly a refresher. I passed the qual before I took this class, though, so it was mostly an inconvenient hoop to jump through that will have left me feeling like I've gained virtually nothing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use expansions with Legendre polynomials to solve boundary condition problems (mostly due to the number of times that this came up on homework in the first half of the course, not because it was taught well). ",
            "\u00a0Very few. I learned many of the same things in my undergrad EM or while preparing for the qual. The class ended just beginning to cover new EM topics like waves and radiation.\r\n\r\nSome new things: Green's function method (magic rule), Lorenz gauge, some things to do with EM in matter. ",

            "\u00a0A course in evaluating electro- and magneto-static problems by hand even though nowadays computers exist? WTF. ",
            "\u00a0I think that EM here is an utter disaster. It needs to be split into two semesters, or combined with math methods, or something. Doug said that Green functions were an important part of the course, and yet we learned it over one lecture and then never had explicitly assigned homework problems on them. They were the last thing covered before the midterm and then constituted 1/3 of the material on the midterm. This was one of many reasons that resulted in an abysmal average of 23/60 on the midterm.\r\n\r\nI stopped going to class very early on because Doug is simply not a good lecturer for this material. His slides are just full of equations and he rambles through them, occasionally stopping to do an error-laden derivation on the board. He seems like a nice, genuine guy and obviously a very successful researcher, but he absolutely should not teach EM ever again.\r\n\r\nIt's truly *unprecedented* just how awful this course was.\r\n\r\nI've never had a class this terribly executed kindergarten through grad school. ",
            "\u00a0This course has absolutely no idea what it wants to be, and really needs a set curriculum and goal in order to be worthwhile at all. After taking it, I am still not sure whether the point was just to learn some math, or to learn some physics. The textbook (Zangwill) also had several errors and was unclear on certain things, particularly when it came to notation. Additionally, this class should really be a two-semester sequence--we spent the necessary time on electrostatics and magnetostatics, but ran out of time to cover electromagnetic waves and other topics that would actually be interesting (and potentially useful). ",
            "\u00a0It must be split into two semesters. There is no other way to fix this disaster of a course. Stone tried to cover about 18 chapters in a one semester course. A friend of mine at Georgia Tech, where the book was written and is used, covered 22 chapters in TWO semesters. Covering this much material in one semester is impossible. I absorbed barely any new material because the pace required to cover this much material sacrifices every derivation and shred of thoroughness. It is just slide after slide filled with equations that are explained quickly, never derived, and often not practiced on the homework.\r\n\r\nThis class was a complete waste of time. I could've spent this time in lab doing research or teaching myself EM instead of stumbling through problem sets about material that was hardly covered in class. Knowing EM well is a useful skill, but one that I still do not possess.\r\n\r\nStrengths: none. ",
            "\u00a0It was the stuff that we did in undergrad again! Time to bring in some covariant formulation of E&M please. ",
            "\u00a0The very obvious weakness of any EM course I have heard so far is its high mathematical complexity, which almost all lecturers focus on. It would be fundamentally better to, first of all use another book that can actually be finished in one semester (and not Zangwill, which in fact is a nice book, but an overkill for such a short period of time). One should either split the course in a more fundamental part and then a specialized part or focus the first 2 or 3 weeks on the basics of EM and then dive into more interesting phenomena. \r\n\r\nThis course was very badly taught. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe it would be beneficial to put all of statics together at the beginning of the course so there is less disconnect between electricity and magnetism, and more class time can be put into dynamics ",
            "\u00a0This course covered too much material in too little time. Perhaps the course should be divided into a 2 semester sequence, with the first semester covering static EM and Electro/magnetodynamics and the second semester covering maxwell's equations and electromagnetic fields. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the structure of the course can be changed. We did electrostatics first and repeated the whole thing in magnetostatics and was left with not much time to do dynamics. I hope we can combine E&M statics stuff together in the first part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches electromagnetism at a much higher level than my undergraduate course did. This was important to me because I feel as though I should learn E+M at a high level. The main weakness of the course was that we spent a very long time on Electro- and Magnetostatics and had little time to cover electrodynamics. I would have liked to cover more about EM waves and radiation but there wasn't time. ",
            "\u00a0Seemed like we just read out of the book for much of it.  I would suggest leaving some of the math out of the lecture, we should be able to follow the calculations in the book ourselves.  Spend more time just talking about the concepts and motivate the results.  For example, while I may be able to calculate the H field, I couldn't really explain what it is. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was good but the lectures were not helpful because the professor covered the material in a cursory manner. I am aware that it is impossible to do a good job covering all the material in lecture because there is just too much in this course. I think it would make more sense and be more useful to the students for the professor to skip over much of the material in the lectures and take the time to clearly teach whatever topics are deemed most important. It is unavoidable that the course covers a ton of stuff, and the professor just has to realize that he cannot teach it all and he has to explain to the students that they will have to teach a good portion of it to themselves. That's OK if that's the way this course is. But lectures that are rushed and superficial are not useful to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0It focused on Statics for too long, I wish we got to dynamics sooner. ",
            "\u00a0Too much focus on  electrostatics/magneto statics in spherical coordinates. Not enough time spent on electromagnetic waves. All EM waves covered had been seen before in undergrad courses. No waveguides/resonators/antennas/practical applications. Physics and intuitive reasoning not terribly well motivated. Course did not feel cohesive, hard to develop a sense of problem solving/generality. ",

            "\u00a0Why? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. I thought it was laughable that there were actually two undergraduates in this course. Do they really not have opportunities and encouragement to focus the extra time that they may have on research rather than wasting it re-learning EM, only to be forced to do it AGAIN if they go to grad school? It's not like graduate admissions committees care much about grad courses. This seems like it must have been a catastrophic waste of their time.\r\n\r\nI would never recommend this class to anyone. The graduate program needs to seriously restructure and this is one of the most crucial classes that needs to be modified. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. The class is very poorly structured and very poorly taught. It does not have a clear purpose, aside from the physics department's insistence that all physicists must go through this horrible class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. You will learn nothing and spend time doing problem sets that are more at home in a math course than a physics course. ",
            "\u00a0Compulsory for grad students ",
            "\u00a0Up until now this is a required course. If it wasn't I wouldn't recommend the class to anyone given its current form. I would recommend taking one out of a two-level course (EM I and EM II, similar to QM) based on the level of knowledge of the student. Where either one is counted towards the required courses. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless it is taught by someone sufficiently prepared to teach the class in an organized way. ",
            "\u00a0I believe E&M is an essential course for grad physics, so yes you should take it (and it's required), but this class can be improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It is a required course so this is not really relevant.  But the material is great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you really need to get better at electrodynamics. If not, just learn it on your own. ",
            "\u00a0No, most of the material does not seem relevant to research and does not give much general insight into how to approach an EM problem from scratch. If this level of detail was required, better to just read the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0In concept, E&M is fascinating.  In practice, E&M courses seem to involve evaluating lengthy integrals and using convoluted math tricks to arrive at uninspiring results.  So, no, I wouldn't recommend taking this course. "
