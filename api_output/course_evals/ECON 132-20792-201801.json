            "\u00a0Econometrics and Data Analysis II is a great course from the standpoint of the practical, real-world econometric methods you learn.  During the first half of the course, I learned the theory, assumptions, and mathematical foundations behind multivariate regression.  During the second half, I learned all about panel data methods, time series methods, instrumental variables, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about econometric techniques, study design, and how to read and understand economics research. Gave me a real perspective on interpreting data into causality. ",
            "\u00a0A continuation of metrics 131, bi/multivariate regression, 2SLS, regression discontinuity, methods for panel data, time series. Learned both the theory and how to do things in Stata. ",
            "\u00a0This was an extensive continuation of ECON 131. I learned a lot more about different methods to analyze data sets of different kinds. These kinds of skills for analysis and then learning the sense to interpret the results are things that are becoming more and more valuable in today's workforce. ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT about different regression techniques and how you would use them in certain situations to get a causal understanding of the relationship between dependent and independent variables. However, as I said, we learned very many things in a short amount of time so I feel that it was difficult to have anything more than a surface-level understanding of all the topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class, including mastering stata ",
            "\u00a0Ability to read economics papers and understand them almost completely, and an ability to write papers using regression techniques ",
            "\u00a0This class was a good introduction to basic econometric methods and to economic research tools. "

        [
            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course lie in the sheer volume of material it covers, which is extremely extensive.  After taking this course, you truly feel like you understand the inner workings of regression and the methods used by actual econometricians today.  The papers it covers are consistently interesting as well.  The only weakness might be that its problem sets are tad bit long. ",
            "\u00a0Course is well organized and pretty well taught. Professor Altonji was very good at answering questions and the slides he makes are great. He's clearly very passionate about the material, which frankly can be very dry, so it really helps.\r\n\r\nOne small suggestion is to clean up the Canvas page -- it has a lot of different documents and slide PDFs laid out in pretty random folders that are nested within each other, so it's kind of hard to find the file you're looking for. For instance, half of the slide decks are in Multivariate Regression, but almost everything uses Multivariate regression so it's kinda random which one goes in that folder versus a folder that gets its own name.\r\n\r\nThat said, the slides themselves are really good! Also really appreciate how Altonji prints them out for us, much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn a LOT, both theory and Stata, good professor, great TA\r\nWeakness: sometimes Stata parts on psets and final project were not something we'd covered well (or at all) in class, so there is some googling/self-teaching involved ",
            "\u00a0strengths: good holistic approach to econometrics, strong mathematical/statistical basis, good exposure to programming in STATA with real life applications and relevant data, fantastic final project that is guided well enough to facilitate student learning through experimentation ",
            "\u00a0This course packs a lot of different methods and techniques into one semester. The TF was fantastic in the effort put forth to help understand what's happening in class, but some concepts still escaped me despite my best efforts. The psets certainly taught us how to apply the concepts using STATA, data analysis software, but the midterm and final exams used virtually no STATA, so the psets are not a good indication or practice for preparing for the exams. Lectures were good, though I feel like they could be a bit more thorough with the nitty-gritty of the techniques. Professor office hours were always extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material is rigorous and you learn a large amount of genuinely useful information. Overall, if you want to do academic research, I'd say that this class is a requirement (and the Econ department seems to think so as well now).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class was not organized well for learning at all. We often fell behind in class (although we asked a lot of questions which contributed to this), we jumped around in the textbook a bit which didn't help our understanding, the printed lecture slides we received for each class were often stapled incorrectly and inverted on each page. The academic papers, which should have added a lot to the class, were introduced when we were barely learning the relevant regression technique and I often found myself confused. Prof. Altonji definitely overestimated our ability to understand the papers' methods, let alone the regressions used. ",
            "\u00a09 am is brutal and sometimes altonji / class gets boggles down in details and not big picture ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Writing the final paper is an instructive experience\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized material, often glossed over a lot of technical details ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would.  I think it is an extremely good survey of the current methods being used and research being conducted in econometric circles today.  It also provides a solid theoretical basis to the broader study of regression techniques.  That being said, the course is by no means easy.  Expect to be challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Very useful -- you learn how to understand econometrics and papers in a way that I didn't get in ECON 135. Really useful course in understanding econ research and Professor Altonji is pretty engaging. The final project and final exam combo is a tough one, so be sure to start the project early and pay attention in the second half of the semester (even though 9am class can be tough). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, though apparently it will be required for econ majors wanting to write a senior thesis 2021 and up. It's a very valuable class, not a walk in the part, but I think very useful. ",
            "\u00a0YES. These skills are some of the most useful and employable among any field. Plus, it's really cool to be able to analyze huge data sets to discover \"the truth\" for yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Very important material - take it if you want to understand how to read academic papers. ",
            "\u00a0This class is simultaneously on both extremes of good and frustrating,. It the material it teaches you is ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY if you want to do economic research or a senior thesis. But you cover way more concepts than you can learn thoroughly and I feel Prof. Altonji overestimates your understanding almost constantly. The psets weren't very difficult and were basically guaranteed 100s (which is nice for your grade), but you also don't really understand if you did anything wrong. Also, for most of the homeworks, Prof. Altonji simply gave us data sets and pre-constructed models to estimate in STATA; I never really felt like I was asked to think critically about the choice of control variables, and it was unclear why some were included/omitted. This is especially dangerous for the final when Prof. Altonji asks you to construct your own regression models.\r\n\r\nProf. Altonji is an extremely kind and dedicated professor who knows his stuff and will help you if you go to office hours. However, he is definitely disorganized (moreso during this semester because he was swamped with work) and often goes on tangents related to the research papers that are difficult to follow. The math can be a bit difficult, but if you stay on top of the readings you'll find it's not as hard as all the notation makes it seem and there's actually a good amount of repetition in the concepts. Beware of the research papers Altonji assigns though; he DEFINITELY expects you to know them well, even if they were touched upon briefly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to get PhD in Econ or want to learn more about stata and have the hours to dedicate to it ",
            "\u00a0This course is decent in terms of material covered, as it really helps you understand economics papers (and write them as well). Prof. Altonji is also a really nice person and is helpful in individual settings and Yoko, the TA, was extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nThat said, the material was very disorganized, notes were riddled with errors, problem sets contained topics not yet addressed in class, Prof. Altonji can be excessively verbose in his explanations, and at times you can feel cheated out of the math behind the scenes.\r\n\r\nIf you are really invested in the content of the course, you can make it work and will feel good about having taken it, but there is a lot that can leave you frustrated along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  It is required for the econ major, and I thought it was nice to see applications in papers, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take. Professor Altonji is an incredible teacher. "
