            "\u00a0The content of this course was relatively interesting and I find the problems presented to be very good mental exercises when solving. However, I do find the course to move very quickly. So it was difficult to absorb the information. I feel that giving homework involving what was learned during the week at the beginning of the week, on Monday for example, instead of towards the end (on Friday) would be more helpful. During the week, as students are learning the material, they would be able to practice through the homework and assess what they know and don't know. That would make it harder for students to fall behind. "
