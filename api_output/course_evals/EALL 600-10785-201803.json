            "\u00a0I not only have learned many useful sources for Chinese Studies and also learned how to find them. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned several valuable skills. First, we covered a wide variety of Chinese reference material, as well as the history behind it. This has allowed me to utilize a wider variety of historical sources in classical Chinese. Through our units on topics such as Buddhism, maps, and measurements, I learned not only the interesting answers to the assignments, but more importantly I learned the methods by which I could investigate these topics further myself. This has been the most important aspect of the course for me - the knowledge, direction, and confidence to conduct more extensive historiographic, bibliographic, and qualitative research in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I gained familiarity with a wide variety of Chinese reference sources. I also became more confident in reading particular styles of Classical Chinese. "

            "\u00a0The incredible breadth of materials and methods we covered is the seminar's greatest asset. I feel much more situated in the field than I had before. Improvement might come with more discussion of or examples showing how scholars have used and now use these sources. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teacher who loves to teach the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The course was more than great! Everyone who works on China need to get a chance to learn those staff. ",
            "\u00a0At first the course seemed to be hit-or-miss in terms of relevance to individuals' interests and areas of study. However, a strength of the course was when the assignments began to reflect these diverse interests. Having the course be flexible and, to a degree, tailored to the individual needs of the students as opposed to a rigid syllabus was a major improvement to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that the assignments were compiled weekly meant that sometimes the instructions were hastily written and a little unclear. I think the goal of having them compiled every week was to include examples from students' own research, but I think the benefit of this is outweighed by the downside of less clear instructions. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. I have learned more about sources and materials in this one term than in my entire academic career prior. Even if some of these materials would normally be considered outside my subfield, simply knowing about them will make me a better prepared scholar. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. The breadth of the materials covered in this course is tremendous. And the teacher loves to teach this subject. Overall, great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to students who work on China, no matter modern or premodern, no matter you are a literature, history, religious studies, or political studies person. This course will give you the most foundational skill! The sources and genres of Sinology is weigh more than you can imagine. Please come and enroll this course and learn them ! You will see a new world. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that I have gained invaluable research skills that will facilitate future research in my academic field. I would recommend anyone who wants to conduct in-depth graduate-level research in Chinese to take this course. ",
