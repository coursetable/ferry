This course provided me with such a strong understanding of tree biology and forest ecology, as well as a much better understanding of forestry (the industry, not just the environmental practices) and how it is connected to every day life, the global market, communities, cities, etc. For this reason, it was such a valuable course for me as an Environmental Studies major because even though it was a very science heavy course, it provided social commentary and improved my way of thinking about conservation in a more practical sense.

            "\u00a0The course is very well balanced with being accessible to all students (including non environmental / non STEM students) while also still being intellectually engaging for students of all skill levels in the subject of ecology/ forestry.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course was the discussion sections. It is clear that the content of the discussion sections was included to make non-STEM majors more comfortable with engaging in discussions on ecology and plant biology (which is support!), but sometimes the was a lack of connecting the discussion  sections back to the content of the course / lectures that left them feeling irrelevant. Also, because the material in discussion sections was often more artistic than conventional scientific reading, I worry some students were left with misconceptions about the environmental science at hand (for example, after speaking with one of my peers who is a humanities major, I found out he was lead to have a very factually incorrect understanding of natural selection due to the book \"What a Plant Knows,\" which personifies plants for the sake of trying to explain their sensory capabilities. This was very worrying to me.)   \r\n\r\nThe most serious improvement I recommend is the complete removal of \"American Canopy\" from the course material. The negative aspects of this book FAR outweighed the few helpful facts and statistics that it provided for discussions. Its erasure of Native Americans was very disturbing to me and detrimental to the understanding that other students have on environmental issues. I worry that many students, especially those not in my discussion section where we addressed the problem, do not even realize how harmful, and racist, it is to exclude indigenous people and people of color from environmental discussions. The book supported the traditionally white-centric approach environmentalism has historically had, and still has today, and I do not think that should be promoted in a Yale, or any college, course. Other material could be found to replace this book that provides the history of forestry in the united states without ignoring and degrading Native Americans. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture's material was really cool and engaging, and the course itself was well-designed. However, it had many weaknesses that limited engagement with the course. It was at the least ideal time (9am), lasted way too long (over an hour twice a week + mandatory section), and was in the least desirable location (all the way up science hill). While the course itself was fine, getting there was a hassle. I definitely think everyone's attendance would've been much higher if it were in a more central location at a later (and maybe shorter) time. ",
            "\u00a0S: good readings for section, interesting homework, reasonable exams\r\n\r\nW: lecture slides have too much information, material is weirdly mysterious and not as straightforward as it can be ",
            "\u00a0As an environmental studies class, I was really hoping to learn more about ecology and identification.  I was disappointed to find out it was heavily biology based but still interested nonetheless.  I think a lesser emphasis on tree physiology and more of a focus on forest ecology as a whole would be a better fit. \r\n I also do not see the need for a section for this class.  Reading two pieces of literature for a discussion section should not be required in a science credit, for the books provided no insight into the actual course material.  Sections also varied far too much for my liking.  Each TA set their own deadlines, so discussing the classwork with another student was often confusing.  TAs also graded quite differently, which could work for or against you depending on who you had. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is a lot more interesting than you expect but a little harder than you expect too. I really loved learning the material but some aspects of the course felt unnecessary and did not contribute to overall learning. I felt like reading some of the books for section didn't hugely apply but mainly the music/ furniture homework was a cool idea but I didn't really feel like I learned much from them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing professor - Prof Brodersen  is a fantastic teacher who goes above and beyond to engage students with this class!! Class content is also so interesting and taught very well. TF team is AWESOME. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the section readings were a little bit too much - i.e. I didn't have the time to read all of American Canopy, although I would have liked to!! ",
            "\u00a0The course material itself is largely fantastic (tedious memorization of hormones aside). My only advice is that future classes don't take place at 9am far up on Science Hill. That would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brodersen is great. He is the strength to this course, I do not think it would work without him. \r\nThere were several weaknesses of this course, as I saw it, was that the TFs were not knowledgeable about the subject (evidenced by saying different answers to the same question during office hours, etc), and the class featured much more about tree biology than \"global significance.\" ",
            "\u00a0Craig really tries to make this course engaging by teaching us about trees from a variety of levels and pulling in all kinds of resources. However, its hard to overcome a subject matter that is inherently boring. Sorry Craig. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of assignments and I think there were only a couple of them that could be cut out. The variety of exams and assignments helped to cover the breadth of material the class covered. However, the quizzes were probably unnecessary and were somewhat of an annoyance to have to do within the allotted time. I also hated how this exam was the last day of the exam period, but I guess some class has to take this spot (nothing the professor can do about it). Professor Brodersen's investment and enthusiasm in this class were definitely a plus, he definitely made it easier to wake up and walk to science hill for this 9 am two days a week. ",
            "\u00a09 a.m. lecture up science hill was a barrier to entry. The discussion sections were pointless, though the visits to the YUAG and musical instrument study were mildly interesting. Homework assignments were useless, whereas the quizzes were really helpful in regimenting study habits. Lecture was not engaging and often muddled. ",

A lot of the discussions on saw mills, instruments, and furniture were far less interesting and important to me than the lectures on actual tree biology and ecology, and I think it would be more meaningful to focus the course more in that direction.

By the end of the course, you will have a very comprehensive understanding of plants and certainly a whole new appreciation for them! Also, there were tons of fun trips that we went on for section... YUAG, Furniture museum, Musical instrument museum. The section assignments were fun too (like trying to find the oldest and tallest trees on campus)! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally, certain topics will feel notes-heavy and a little less interesting than others (for example, learning about different specific plant hormones felt pretty mechanical and less engaging than learning about making instruments from trees).

            "\u00a0The topic is inherently really interesting however the books we read had very little to do with what we were learning in class.

He emphasizes the importance of the science we talk about with contemporary research and technological innovations and loves to share things that he finds interesting. The lectures used a good combination of clarifying lecture slides and in-person explanation by Professor Brodersen. The final was also very well designed: the questions were clear and relied not on pure memorization but a synthesis of understanding from lectures. The relatively early 9am time and long walk to SPL was a bit tiring at times, but he mentioned trying to find a closer location and later start time for future dates. ",

Dr. Brodersen is an amazing and engaging professor who really knows how to make material interesting and teach it in a way that you care about it. Readings and field trips provide opportunities to engage with material in unique ways, and the lectures feature some especially interesting topics that bring what's being studied into something that feels incredibly relevant and intriguing.

This class is also of general interest to students whose interests may be outside of environmental studies; it covers a broad range of topics that touch on sociology, history, music, and many more. ",
            "\u00a0Nice and easy science credit. My one complaint is the multiple choice on the exams - they are worth a good amount and there are usually only two of them and they tend to be tricky, so getting one wrong could drop the exam grade from an A to an A-. ",
            "\u00a0No. Only take it if you absolutely need the science credit. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they are looking for a fun, accessible science credit. ",
            "\u00a0yes already have. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Whether you are an environmental studies major of just need a science credit, this course was very informative, and genuinely enjoyable for me. Lectures were interesting and assignments were fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but I would really only recommend it to students in an environmental major. I took it to fulfill my biology requirement, and I definitely wouldn't have taken it if I weren't interested in environmental science. Don't take it if you're looking for a gut; there are much easier science credits at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Took it as a science credit. Deff not a gut so beware, but an interesting course ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if I would be able to recommend this course to another student.  If changes are made, like eliminating section and providing an ecology focus, I would likely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Great class for non-Stem majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really liked this class, and actually found it super interesting when I didn't know I would. Get a good TA though! makes a huge difference. ",
            "\u00a0Y E S !!!!! Such a great class - Professor Brodersen is a fantastic teacher and does so much to engage students (great lectures, fun field trips, etc.). You learn so much interesting stuff about trees and wood - I looooved this class. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this is a course that I will appreciate more in retrospect than I did while I was taking it. The material is fascinating, but it was sometimes easy to lose sight of that from week to week. Not every lecture landed, and there were stretches in the middle of the semester where the subject matter felt somewhat tedious (lots of memorization of lots of hormones and secondary metabolites), but the first and last thirds had some really fun stuff, especially the last third: I loved learning about how wood is used in violins and really just everyday life--I don't think I'll ever look at a wooden door or table the same way again. \r\n\r\nThe workload is perfectly reasonable, though it might be more than you're expecting. Five short online quizzes, five (pretty interactive) homework assignments, weekly reading and section, and two midterms and a final. If you keep a sharp eye on the dates (stuff sneaks up on you) and pace yourself accordingly you should be fine. \r\n\r\nIt's not the greatest class, but it does cover a lot of fascinating, even occasionally mind-blowing stuff that you're unlikely to learn anywhere else, and best of all it really sticks with you. Since trees are such a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of life on Earth, you see them everywhere and are reminded of the course material when you do. I really do have a much deeper appreciation for these natural miracles, and I'm glad this course gave me that. ",
            "\u00a0Trees is a fine science credit, though I am sure that there are easier ones out there somewhere. The class is curved so 20% get A's, 20% get A-'s, 20% B+'s, 20% B's, and 20% C's and D's. I know this because he showed it on the first day. That means that a significian portion--more than half--do NOT get A's or A-'s. For people taking this for a Sc, it is worth keeping in mind. \r\n\r\nThis is basically a tree biology course. The textbook, Taiz and Zeiger, is dense, and opens a paragraph \"As you likely remember from Organic Chemistry,\" which gives you an idea of how much it is used in the course. I am not sure anyone in the class ever did the readings. Ever. \r\n\r\nThere are tests, quizzes, problem sets (which take FOREVER), and participation. It is also at 9am. \r\n\r\nBottom Line: See if you can find another easy science. If not, this will likely do. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course for a science. It's not exciting or engaging, but its pretty fair. There are some frustrating projects (ie measuring trees) and some fun ones. Don't expect anything life changing. ",
            "\u00a0If you really don't want to take a difficult physics or chemistry class like me and don't have much of a background in science at all, this is a good science credit that's not too hard to understand. If you pay attention to the material you'll be able to get it fine. The only thing is there are a decent number of assignments and exams and there is section so if you want to do well you do have to invest some time to this class (I said some, not a ton). But you do learn a lot about trees and plants in general and much of it will probably stay with you after the class ends just because knowing the details are kind of important. The textbook also has a lot more information than we learned and the TAs are available to meet additionally if you want to learn even more about trees. ",
            "\u00a0The biology portion of the class was interesting and changed my perception of trees. For this alone, I would recommend the class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in trees and forestry ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great, substantial science course -- very accessible to non-science majors, and very well-presented. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting and a good SC credit. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great science credit for non-science majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for non-STEM majors. Good science credit, not too gutty, learn something. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! if you like the environment trees are a great lens to view it through ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Trees is a fun science course that will give you lots of fun facts about trees and will, in general, help you to have a better understanding of the plant world around you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as it is about much more than just trees. It does encapsulate a good deal about environmental science and challenges many preconceived notions about trees and plant life in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course for those looking for for an introduction to a fundamental topic in biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because I think its important for anyone to be educated on important factors that affect our environment ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a friend who understands biology pretty well and is interested in gaining a deeper understanding of trees. The class material refreshes on high school biology at times so be aware of that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great, interesting intro to the biology of trees and forestry! ",
            "\u00a0If you can make it all the way up science hill at 9 am, take this class--its great and you'll do well! If you're not an early riser you won't... ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class for anyone interested in environmental studies, especially those coming from a non-STEM background. I took it for a science credit because I didn't see myself spending much time with STEM classes, but it has made me much more strongly consider an environmental studies degree. The material is often interesting and not difficult to understand; consistent attendance at lectures and a decent amount of studying for the exams are guarantees of a good grade. It also opens your eyes to some great stuff, like tree height and Maple Fest. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely.  The lectures were interesting, the slideshow presentations were comprehensive, section meetings were helpful, and examinations were fair. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it tentatively. If you are particularly interested in trees, the content provides a wonderful overview. The trouble is that the lecture format doesn't really whisk you along, it tends to leave you wishing the subject matter was brought to life more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I was worried about getting my science credit because I'm a humanities-type, but the class is set up in a way that makes it accessible to everyone and probably more enjoyable than a different science class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good science credit that isn't too difficult but also teaches you something useful about the world around you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they need a science credit or an introductory course into environmental sciences. "
