            "\u00a0Prime Ideals, Dedekind Domains, Number fields, class groups, and units. Good extension of Algebra and really cool to see applications into current and past problems like FLT. I gained more insight into how Algebra as a field, hehe, is used to solve problems, by creating special structures that are just nice. ",
            "\u00a0Dedekind domains, the class group, Diophantine equations ",
            "\u00a0I learned mainly about the commutative algebra of Dedekind rings and rings of integers, ramification of primes, the class number, the unit theorem, and applications to diophantine problems in number theory. ",

We did a lot of review between each lecture making it manageable as it is a grad class.\r\n\r\nNot many problem sets, which I like, because it's fun to think about problems than to consider concepts like prime ideals. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very fun! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Auel was wonderful, but I would have liked for the course to have more homework; as it was, we did not get a chance to develop out skills and intuition outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The material was super interesting and Professor Auel is a wonderful teacher! We got psets back very late and without any grades, so it was hard to see how we were doing in the class overall. "

ANT just adds a layer of algebra to NT things and goes beyond it in so many ways to tackle really simple, but challenging questions like FLT. You don't have to take Modern to take it, but I think it would have helped. ",
