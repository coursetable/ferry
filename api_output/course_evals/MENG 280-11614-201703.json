            "\u00a0I learned all about the considerations that go into designing of beams, columns, and other structures to ensure that they will support the desired loads. It covered a great deal of topics which gave us a great knowledge of what to check for in a design and how different beams and structures will fail. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course content, but the course itself was not up to par.\r\nI feel prepared to tackle static problems ",
            "\u00a0Very good introduction to statics and finite element analysis, understanding of static mechanical systems, and basic construction techniques/ material choice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the complexity of building constructions and tools necessary to safely design them. ",
            "\u00a0This class confirmed my desire to study engineering.  I didn't know what to expect but was very pleased with the wide range of topics covered in this intro to engineering course.  It's best described as the creation of a toolbox with which we learn how to approach different types of systems throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0In many ways this course felt like an advanced physics problem solving class. We looked at the many ways engineers determine how to build and maintain structures. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you learn basic structural analysis techniques and are able to essentially determine whether a structure will be able to withstand a certain load, and if so, how it will deform as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Learned engineering and problem solving skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what makes a structure stable and how to determine stresses and strains in loaded beams. I also learned techniques in choosing proper beam sizes. ",
            "\u00a0Failure modes of beams, columns, different types of forces, design in different situations, accounting for factor of safety and using different materials. Although still idealized situations, much more real-world than anything I have taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers different kinds of stresses a material can experience and how these can cause deformations or breakage. Apart from theoretical knowledge, we also were given the opportunity to be machine-shop trained or do a project in the shop for credit and we were given a bridge project to apply much of what we had learned. ",

            "\u00a0I understood the importance of diligent material selection in many mechanical and building systems. It was a realistic course in which we took into accounr the stresses and deformations in each mechanical element to design and create systems that are safe for use. The course combined technical skills with real life insight on how and why structures are built the way they are. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze basic structures for failure under a variety of different types of loading. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be very interesting since by the end of the course I felt I had a strong foundation in analyzing a structure and having the ability to define different support reactions and possible areas of failure and deformation and how and why they would occur. ",

        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course covers a good amount of material which is useful for design. It would work even better if there could be more interaction from the students during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the bridge project and the candlstick\r\n\r\nThe psets were much harder than the lecture. I am fine with that (I enjoy self learning), but the lecture was extremely boring and it seemed as if we would go in circles explaining the same thing. It was slow paced and I feel as if we could have accomplished more in the course with the time we had (maybe additional section or two about other loadings?). ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets can be hard to work on and there aren't any homework sessions other than office hours. There are also no practice midterms/finals although the homework is very accurate. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides many opportunities to help students work through concepts.  I found the peer tutoring hours to be very helpful in providing a space to work through the problem sets with other students.  I found the difficulty differential between example problems and those on the problem sets to be too large for my liking, but with the help of other students, it was pretty manageable. ",
            "\u00a0My main issue with this course was Professor Brown's rule (which he outlines in the syllabus) that he will not review grades on anything, meaning you have to track down TA's for any type of grading ambiguity. This can get especially frustrating if expectations on certain problems are not the same between TA and Professor. The fix would just to make communication easier between TA, Professor and student, so maybe a slight alteration to that policy. ",
            "\u00a0The content covered in this course is very useful. The main problem is that it is not covered in a very helpful way. The problem sessions definitely helped, but in class Professor Brown just talks about the equations. Everything makes sense with the extremely simple problems, but when working on a pset, the problem solving approaches are much different. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well organized, expect a discrepancy between pset problems and exam problems. Typically we were not very well equipped to do the pset after class, so you have to teach yourself a lot of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were perhaps too theoretical, although I understand going through the proofs where equations come from. However, you could not even come close to doing the problems on the problem sets or tests based on the information learned in lecture alone.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of office hours was extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength are the psets, which are good practice for the midterms. Weaknesses are the TAs, as they are not always helpful and grading was inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The two projects (candlestick and bridge) were super fun. Prof Brown was very nice and approachable and it was clear that he cared about students' learning. For the most part, his explanations were very clear, although sometimes they were confusing. Tests were fair. Also, the Hibbeler textbook was amazing!!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TFs. The TFs were quite unhelpful, and they often made things worse. They often did not now how to solve problems, and when they did, they did not know how to explain them. Moreover, they only looked at the final answer when grading a pset, so if you used a different value for a value you had to look up (eg a modulus of elasticity) you lost a disproportionate number of points. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the different resources available to us to help us understand the information. If we don't get something in lecture (apart from asking in lecture or going to office hours for clarification) we have problem sessions where the TAs go over some problems related to that week's lectures, there are undergraduate TAs that hold office hours and were great at explaining things, and different textbooks or videos that we could consult on our own. Prof Brown really put a lot of effort into making sure that we had resources to turn to. I think the weakness of this course it wasn't taught in a way in which I understood why things happened the way they do. I feel like many of the derivations were lost on me, I felt like I could apply something to some scenarios but then when I went to apply a concept to something else I would make a mistake somewhere but couldn't understand why it would work in the first case and not in the next. I think there was a gap between knowing the formulas and understanding how they worked.\r\n\r\nI think this course could be improved if it was made into a flipped classroom. I think the material is straightforward enough to learn outside of class, and I think that the real-life problems are complicated enough that having someone there to walk you through them would really help with understanding how to go about solving these problems. I believe I would have been much more successful if learning had been that way. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this was a really good course. We covered a lot of material but covered each topic thoroughly. The peer tutors were extremely helpful for understanding the material and doing the problem sets. The one thing I think the course could be improved is that while I really appreciated having a design project and it was a lot of fun, it felt like it could have been more rigorous and we would have gotten more out of it had we been given more direction in the analysis of our designs. ",
            "\u00a0I think it did a good job of clearly helping me learn basic structural analysis, something I think will be very useful for me in the future.\r\n\r\nThe only improvement I can think of off the top of my head is the course could have used some more real-life examples of the topics we were doing in class.  I enjoyed the few small demos, but some real-life engineering would have helped the class be even more engaging, and make the material more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I like that he final is real-world but there should be more practice problems distributed, and a formal review session would be very helpful ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: straightforward and can clearly see how to prepare for exams, lots of supplemental resources provided\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The final emphasized figuring out which failure modes to test (aka not knowing what chapter you were working out of and identifying what type of problem it was). We didn't have much practice with this though. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the problem types we learned to solve. The class couldve been even stronger with even more real life examples, and our professor already tried to make the class material relatable by providing many examples. The class could be stronger if we went over the specific problem types in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the textbook in this course is extremely well written. I mostly learned from doing the readings. I feel like lecture is not nearly as clear as the textbook itself. The problem sessions were not really all that helpful because the TA's were pretty terrible. Luckily the pier tutors for the course were incredible and they started to show up to the problem sessions about half way through which made them much more useful. ",
            "\u00a0I felt the course to be well structured in terms of developing base skills and then building off of them to higher concepts and how they all interconnected. I feel it could be improved by giving more real world examples of the topics covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor not able to deliver a clear explanation to most of the lessons.\r\nSome parts needed a little more time in class to give students a deeper understanding\r\nLack of available material for studying\r\nNo posted lecture notes which adds more pressure on students to fellow the teacher and take notes without much reflection.\r\nLack of information regarding the class performance on midterms and other assignments ",
            "\u00a0The class does a good job going over the concepts but more in depth problems in class, applying these concepts, would have helped ",
            "\u00a0Professor Brown clearly cares a lot about this course and wants to make it as great as it can be. He asked for suggestions or concerns periodically throughout the semester and did his best to address them. The course is well structured, and the textbook is very helpful. I also really liked having peer tutors available, especially because the TA's were really not great. That was one downside-- the TA's were really not a good resource and the optional problem sessions were really unhelpful, so no one attended them. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to students who are more into the mechanical aspects of design - loadings, material properties, stresses, types of failure. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in mechanical engineering, definitely take it (you also probably have to for the major). It was really nice to see how physics takes on real applications, particularly structural ones. Plus, Professor Brown is very dedicated to students and their understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is very interesting. The course itself is far from interesting. Boring lecture even though the professor is a nice guy. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an incredible way to get an idea of what it is like to be an actual engineer. Although offered early in the engineering sequence, the class offers you incredible insight into what real engineering is like. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really solid MENG course. It is the most practical course I have taken up to this point, which was greatly appreciated in a very theoretical curriculum. Prof. Brown is a great, super clear lecturer, which occasionally means class can be dry but it's worth it. He makes a point of continually tying the math back to real life, and even offers a few hands-on extra credit projects to encourage students to apply what is learned. Overall a worthwhile and important class for engineers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to physics majors as well. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one I would recommend to any student considering engineering.  It provides a wonderful introduction to the concepts of design and structural analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is an interesting course in which students can learn a lot about materials, but it is also very specific to the mechanical engineering majors so I would likely only recommend this to other STEM majors as its likely more down their alley. ",
            "\u00a0Chances are you have to take this course as a major requirement. The content is very useful, but unfortunately is not taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is obviously required for everyone taking it. Try to take it if there's a semester when Eric Brown doesn't teach it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You learn how to design structures for engineering projects -- very cool. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for mechanical engineers this is an interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0The Hibbeler textbook is very good. I didn't realize til halfway through the semester that the best way to learn this stuff is out of the book, working through the worked examples. This is not to say that Prof Brown was a poor lecturer-- he was pretty good-- but I still had to go back and learn/review stuff from the book to do the psets, which was fine. The most annoying thing about this class was the amount of time you will waste debugging algebra mistakes. You miscalculate your moment of inertia and then waste 45 minutes finding your mistake. Would recommend using Desmos. I thought this was a pretty cool class, it was cool to really see how the buildings and structures that we inhabit and depend on actually stand up. It's pretty real-world, although the problems still feel a little idealized, but it's much more real than, say, physics problems. Professor Brown is good, exams are fair. Also we did two hands on projects that were super fun. We made candlestick holders in the machine shop and we build truss bridges to crush. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of whether or not this is required for you, I would say that this is an important course to take if you're interested in mechanical engineering and/or designing structures. I personally don't think I feel comfortable with all the material we covered but I do think that I will have to revisit it on my own because of how important the material we cover is. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who's interested in mechanical engineering. I thought it was really cool to learn how to analyze parts and figure out how exactly they would fail. ",
            "\u00a0If you are any sort of engineering student this is a useful (if not required) course, as it gives physical interpretations to a lot of important physical properties, and helps immensely when trying to interpret/create physical designs. ",
            "\u00a0The topic of this class is really interesting and applicable to real life. The lectures can be dry but are informative. The psets kinda suck but arent too long and the midterms are fair. ",
            "\u00a0The class is required for mechanical engineers, but I actually enjoyed it. The material isn't the most exciting, but it's more interesting than you might imagine. You get to understand how things fail (in a lot of ways) and it feels like you're learning actually relevant information. It's a straightforward class and you can do well if you go to office hours and make a good study group. Prof. Brown is really wholesome and cares about his students. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very useful class and a good introduction to mechanical engineering. The class material is very relavant to the real-life design of buildings and mechanical systems, and it is exciting to learn why some structures are designed and built the way they are. It is also interesting to learn about the stresses and deformations in beams and mechanical elements, and take into account these non-ideal conditions (unlike physics, which at the introductory level assumes deformation doesnt occur) to design systems that are safe and sturdy for humans. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to a way of thinking about structures and materials that will continue to be relevant throughout the rest of my education. Although it was required for my major, I still would recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning more about basic material science and structural analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I found the course to be very interesting and applicable to life in general and multiple other fields. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a Mechanical Engineering major then you need to take it because it is a requirement so the best thing you can do is to pick the right timing and a more knowledgeable, experienced and a better-at-problem-solving teacher. ",
