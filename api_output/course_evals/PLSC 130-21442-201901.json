            "\u00a0The course is rather long and can sometimes be dull. I think this can be improved by reducing the time of the course to 50 minutes, or an hour at most. Perhaps it could be offered as a once-a-week kind of class as well. However, I feel that the class is very clearly and organically structured. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were good. The response memos were annoying. The instructions for the assignments  were vague and the readings, although interesting, at times could be fairly dense and long. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a well put together course. The assigned readings were a reasonable length and there were optional readings each week for students who wanted to know more about the subject. Each student was assigned two weeks to do reading responses, so there wasn't an overwhelming amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-structured in the historical sense, but with not too much application to the current affairs. "
