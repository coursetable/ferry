            "\u00a0I now have a comprehensive understanding of all the methods available to me for my senior thesis research. ",
            "\u00a0Different research methods (content analysis, ethnography, surveys, interviews, etc.) for social science research. It was cool to get to debate the details and controversies related to different research methods. I feel well-prepared to begin research for my senior thesis next fall now that I understand how to prepare, propose, and conduct a research project. "

            "\u00a0Thank goodness Professor Almeling stepped in! The course was engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Rene turned this class around for the better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great class, very informative and useful! Enjoyed class a lot ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very important for sociology majors to start thinking earlier about their thesis projects. This class is absolutely necessary, especially for sociology majors who are less familiar with different methods.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Depending on the level of future classes, I would have appreciated less epistemology and more \"practical\" skills. To me, social science is largely learning by doing, and I think it would have been interesting to do assignments that asked us to do some preliminary analysis or data collection. Also the class was really not useful to seniors, so I feel like it should ideally just be taught every year for juniors. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-structured: one method a week, with corresponding readings and guest speakers, who are professors within the sociology department. I really enjoyed the portion with the guest speakers because it is always so eyeopening to hear from people who are so much farther along the journey than you are and have them talk about how they overcame the same obstacles that you currently face. That said, sometimes it did feel like the speakers just rambled for half the class time, and I ended up getting nothing much of their talks. Also, I really appreciated how Professor Almeling took the time to read our response memos and discussed the questions that we raised through them in class. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: intimate discussion setting; discussions based off of student questions submitted on Canvas prior to class; the guest speakers each week were super cool- we have such amazing and accomplished sociology faculty, so it was cool to get to pick their brains about their research specializations; the research papers we read were really cool and covered a wide range of topics, and the papers were easy to skim as long as you read the methods section in depth; Prof Almeling is super upbeat, engaging, and organized- she made it a very straightforward class; grading is fair and it is not hard to get a good grade as long as you participate, complete your assignments, and ask the TFs for help when needed; the TFs were SO GREAT! They were extremely engaging, brought up such interesting examples of research studies and from their own field work. They were also extremely helpful and supportive in crafting your own research proposal; Finally, we had some in-class exercises that made the material stick better.\r\nWEAKNESSES: sometimes sacrificed quality for quantity. But it is a survey course, so that kind of makes sense. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any sociology major that is required to take this class. Fear not, it is manageable and everyone wants to see you do well. ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement of the major, but is very useful ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very useful class and great teacher/teaching fellows ",
            "\u00a0You are a sociology major - so it's required - so take it. (Junior year!) ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great for building a foundation for future sociological work. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a sociology major, this is the core methods course that you have to take. That said, it probably will be one of your more pleasant requirements. Sometimes it can be a little dry going over the methods, but the papers assigned for each method always end up being very interesting and touch upon many different fascinating subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you plan on conducting your own social science research in your senior thesis or elsewhere. Super useful skills for doing that.  I feel well-prepared for my thesis next year. "
