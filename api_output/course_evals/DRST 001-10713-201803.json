            "\u00a0I learned to become a better reader and writer. While literature is not a strong suit, I found it challenging yet accessible. I certainly learned a ton about plot and themes and ideas in ancient western literature. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading was the most valuable skill I learned in the class; critical essay writing and discussing in seminars followed. Learning was primarily uprooted in the interpreting of texts, and rather than tangible knowledge, the class provided a general improvement in critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped me become a better writer. I learned how to write a focused, in-depth analysis that develops and explores a central claim. This class also gave me important tools that allow me to analyze literature. ",
            "\u00a0How to balance getting something meaningful out of the text without heavy discussion of plot in class, becoming more comfortable inserting my own voice into my papers and being honest about the extent to which the text supports my analysis ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to critically evaluate and analyze themes, symbols, and meanings of classical literature. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Roffman gives great feedback on papers which definitely helped my writing. I feel I am a better reader of literature now and take in more of the books I read. ",
            "\u00a0I think that I have become more comfortable with classic texts and better equipped to recognize the influence of these text as I read other works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read more critically, how to write in a way that expresses what Im thinking without excess fluff, And how to pick up on the most Important passages in a larger work. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading and analytical skills ",
            "\u00a0I develop a greater understanding of literary texts. I refined my ability to conduct a literary analysis for both the text as a whole and through close reading. My reading skills greatly improved and my ability to retain large quantities of information greatly increased. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills of understanding a piece of literature within the context of the Western Canon ",
            "\u00a0I think one of my main takeaways was how to really focus and analyze a specific fragment/segment of a work of literature and connect it to the broader message of the entire work. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned how to hone in my close reading skills, discuss texts thoughtfully with my peers, and complete readings quickly and with intention. ",
            "\u00a0The analysis of symbols, meanings, and imagery was the main focus of Directed Studies: Literature with an overarching approach that focused on similarities, differences, and the meanings behind those comparisons throughout a tradition. From this, I further developed my skills in literary analysis and close reading, being able to take minor sections of the text and extrapolate important themes that change or affirm readings of the texts. Especially when it comes to inter-textual analysis, this course helped me develop an understanding of how several works of myth and fantasy come together to craft sometimes coherent, other times conflicting narratives of life and humanity.

            "\u00a0I think the strength is the books we read and the writing assignments. While there was little to improve, I wish some of the students in the class had talked less, and the professor had tried to call on quieter kids more. ",
            "\u00a0With DS as a whole, the pacing was quite quick; I would much rather read less works but spend more time with each. It was sometimes frustrating to read an entire work, but only have a chance to discuss a fragment of the whole in a single day. However, the very bulk of reading, especially with literature, opened up many interesting conversations and general themes while supplementing them with specific passages brought forward by both the students and professor. The strength is that it introduces the very methods required for close reading, yet does not quite bring the satisfaction of in-depth analysis. ",
            "\u00a0While this is a problem with DS in general, I felt, at times, that this course was too rushed. There was no way we could give 200-400 pages of Ovid justice in 2 classes, or do two entire books of the Bible in one class. Other than the fast pace, I really enjoyed this class! ",
            "\u00a0Its greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses - the speed of the course and the preference somewhat for breadth over depth. Fusing creative elements and formal analysis in papers was incredible. Thought readings from the Bible were sort of boring. Greek tragedies and Sappho were incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The readings assigned were often very extensive and difficult to complete on time. ",
            "\u00a0The course is an excellent introduction to the western literary canon. However, it is hard to grasp the importance of the works we read without some previous background. Spreading the reading load more thinly and over a wider array of books might remedy this. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Roffman is a kind professor, the course covers some really fun works, its a really student driven class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class was often unfocused, with respect to the student conversation. One student would say a really great idea, and  another would respond with another completely unrelated good idea. Lots of good ideas, but very few lines of unbroken discussion, which sometimes made out analysis seem really superficial in class. ALso, we had to go over master works in one or two hours, thats it, but thats the nature of DS ",
            "\u00a0It was overall very strong and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Due to the high volume of reading required, I can read higher quantities of text quicker while retaining more.\r\n-Due to mandatory seminars twice a week, I am more comfortable voicing my ideas among my classmates and professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Because it is required (through DS), there is less freedom in choosing classes.\r\n-More time to digest the dense texts would be great. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the breadth of texts we were able to read and discuss. A weakness would be the depth at times sacrificed in order to get through the volume of texts scheduled for the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was challenging but a good challenge and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student to the extent that they would choose similar classes outside of DS. If a student enjoys the western canon and likes being in a close community, DS hits home. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially with Professor Roffman. What you learn in this course is absolutely incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt. The pace can be frustrating, but you learn what you love and are interested enough to spend a whole semester on later. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the knowledge gained enhances so much of how I now view the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, she helped me more with my writing than any other prof this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The insights gained into the western culture are invaluable and an intensive approach at the beginning of undergrad allows for the benefits of these insights to be maximized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn in depth about the Western Canon of literature, and read some very interesting and engaging texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The texts that we covered were very interesting and because we had to meet twice a week for seminars, they will gain a greater assurance in their own ideas and an ease when voicing those ideas to others. ",
            "\u00a0Without hesitation. I think the Directed Studies' literature course pools together an incredibly passionate group of students and professors who are eager to work through the texts at hand and eager to help each other grow and learn. It is a uniquely immersive experience that I would recommend to any first-year. "
