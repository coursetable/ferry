            "\u00a0Extensive knowledge of both the historical and current environment of the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0This course served as a great introduction to security in the Middle East. I enjoyed learning about the different countries in the region. I am now more able to understand current events. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided insight on the history and formation of Middle Eastern states, the roots of conflicts, the great leaders of each Middle Eastern state, and the current actors, incentives, and prospects of contemporary conflict in the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the Middle East through case studies and applying international security theories to them. I am now able to understand discussions about the region and implications of various foreign policies within the region as well as relationships with countries outside of the region. An understanding of the history of the region is also important to understand security challenges today, and Im glad I learned that. ",
            "\u00a0I gained general knowledge of Middle Eastern history and how different factors have impacted the security of the Middle East today. ",
            "\u00a0Before this course, I had absolutely no knowledge of anything going on in the Middle East. Now, I feel like I have a solid grasp on the most important aspects of recent history and political relations. Not only do I understand a lot of what's happening, I also have an idea of the underlying issues of the conflicts in the Middle East, and ideas for possible solutions. In this course, I learned about the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Iran, Saudi Arabia, North Africa, the Gulf States, and more. I developed insights on political solutions to Middle Eastern conflicts. I also understood in greater detail the west's role in the Middle East throughout history, now, and possibilities in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the recent history and current status of different countries in the Middle East. The focus on case studies in the second half of the course was great as we not only learned some new details about the countries, but were also to apply the themes from the first half of the course to recent events. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write and think critically. I also developed an amazing breadth of knowledge in regards to middle eastern politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned tons of information regarding the foundations of the modern middle east and their current security struggles. ",
            "\u00a0This course renders a structured and informed overview of the geopolitics in the Middle East since the beginning of the 20th century. Professor Lotito does a wonderful job explaining general concepts of international security and applying them to case studies across the region. "

            "\u00a0This class was very interesting in terms of the topics covered and the overall insight it gave into the current status of security in the Middle East, especially with the way up-to-date current events are addressed throughout the class. At times, however, it did get a bit bogged down in the theory of international security, which I found to be less interesting that the specific case studies of various countries across the regions. Personally, I found the second half of the course, focusing on specific country cases, to be more interesting. Overall, the course does of a good job of staying engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-taught course, well organized and information was clearly and effectively relayed to the class by the professor. Information was supplemented by interesting and relevant readings. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the class schedule is very helpful, as were given a base of knowledge and theory understanding to later apply to the second half of the course with individual countries. The use of videos alongside lecture notes is also helpful, and discussion is facilitated through the use of that and various articles read in class. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course. It is a good overview of the MENA region regardless of whether or not you have a PLSC background. ",
            "\u00a0This was an awesome course. Lotito was super engaging and made sure that we participated by asking questions and having us discuss answers with small groups of classmates or write down our thoughts. Lotito made really complex issues really understandable by breaking them down and teaching us about history and political terminology and theories. I also liked the informational videos, which really contextualized what we were learning to modern events. So I would say more videos/visuals (maps, pictures of people) would be great. I absolutely loved this class! ",
            "\u00a0As I said, case studies were a definite strength. I didn't have any problems with the course. I thought it was structured well. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing organization which facilitated an awesome learning environment. Both phenomenal lecture content and engaging discussion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course were none ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Structured and concise overview of international security concepts \r\n- Deep knowledge about the recent history of the region\r\n- Objective explanations and discussions of current political events\r\n- Clear feedback and suggestions for improvement from Professor Lotito\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Technical problems impacting the student experience "

            "\u00a0Yes, very helpful in understanding a topic that is frequently discussed in the news and is often misunderstood. Interesting and very-well taught by Professor Lotito. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about the Middle East and I am interested in taking more courses on the region. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in foreign policies and internal conflict within states. Regardless if you are interested in the Middle East, much of what we learned in this course may be applied to conflicts in other regions. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Its important to understand what is happening in the region currently, and this class offers and excellent overview of history and security challenges and how those are still around today as well as why. Its an important class to take considering the recent political climate and ignorance surrounding issues in the Middle East. ",

            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to any student interested in learning about current political issues and international security in the Middle East, especially to someone who has little to no background knowledge. You learn so much valuable and critical information, and Lotito breaks the content down to the basics, so it's really easy to comprehend. You also learn a lot about the events in the past century (or more) that precipitated current issues. Take this class! It's really not too hard, super interesting, important, and valuable. And Lotito is a great professor. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in learning about the Middle East and some of the most pressing security dilemmas today then you should take this course. Its not easy and he's a tough grader, but the material made it worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course that is interesting for more than just students with a curiosity for the Middle East in specific. Not only are you learning a lot about international security in general but you get a much clearer understanding of many current conflicts that influence our headlines. It is more work than other courses that I took at Yale but for me, it was definitely worth it! "
