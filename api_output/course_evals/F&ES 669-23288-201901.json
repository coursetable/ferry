            "\u00a0I gained an improved understanding of how state regulations apply to and influence professional forestry operations. I also increased my knowledge and vocabulary of forestry equipment and the types of issues that face field foresters. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - the field components of this class rival any field trips that I've had at FES in terms of usefulness and interest. I learned a ton with Mike during the Spooner Hill exercise. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the course's organization is kind of flimsy, such that the syllabus and the reading list consistently change, frequently up to the last minute. This makes it difficult to keep up with reading. ",
            "\u00a0Great professionally oriented course that bridges academic forestry with the applied. Very useful for understanding the opportunities and boundaries of managing a forest (and also applicable to other natural resources/working lands). Substantial field time at the end of the semester is difficult with other commitments--would have been better earlier in the semester rather than right at the end. Syllabus could be clarified--there are many great readings, but fairly unclear what is required vs. suggested. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there were a lot of strengths, but the only weakness was the syllabus. It was difficult to follow and need restructuring. It's like looking at someones person calendar with everything they have going on and trying to figure out were we fit in. It needs to be simplified or more structured. The color coding wasn't working, I would consider separating the southern trip from the class syllabus. It was difficult to understand what readings were for what week and it was difficult navigating to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0No weakness. Strengths were the teaching style, low key. "

            "\u00a0For a 2-credit class, if you're interested in forestry, you can't go wrong. This class had an optimal ratio of learning : out-of-class-work. For very little out of class investment required, you walk away with a bunch of highly useful knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Useful if ever interested in pursuing applied land management in any field--presents issues of physical impact of forestry as well as cost and limitations of silviculture. ",
            "\u00a0Take it post silviculture, as class trips conflict with silviculture trips. Having taken silviculture, and forest crew before forest ops, I felt I could comprehend the material more and had a better understanding of the assignments. ",
