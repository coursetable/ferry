            "\u00a0The course is thorough in the knowledge it imparts, but it seems rushed in parts. The reading load is fairly heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings, TAs, and how all-encompassing the material was. Failures: Perhaps better suited for a seminar or leminar, rather than a lecture for the level of student engagement expected by the professor. The pace was really slow at times too. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Slides are very clear and so are expectations for midterms and papers.\r\nWeakness: Lectures aren't very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is unnecessarily liberally biased. Professor Henderson was pressing his own agenda the entire time, and his anti-republican examples did not contribute to the better illustration of course concepts. Benjamin Miller (TA) was also infamous for pressing his own agenda and docking grades with more conservative angles. Political science does not have to be approached/taught with a \"blue glasses\" on to be understood. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly responses in section need to be communicated in the syllabus and were not consistent across the TA's.  The class did not follow the syllabus and the professor fell behind in the course material. It was a fairly informative class about the legislative process and party ideologies, which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were boring but in studying for the midterm i learned a little. Everything was pretty disorganized and no one was engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is not difficult or too much work. However, lectures and sections were not very engaging and much of the material was very surface-level. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was wonderful. Keep it the way it is. ",
            "\u00a0It couldve gone quicker, we fell behind the syllabus ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Thought-provoking material if you're at all interested in American national politics or its history. Straightforward exams if you complete the study guide and memorize your answers. Case study was a really great assignment and allowed you to have a lot of fun with the material. My TA (Marco Biagi) was also really helpful, but I haven't spoken to students in the other sections so I don't know whether this was universal. Weaknesses: I would have loved to do the paper, but the way things are set up now makes doing so really difficult. Not only is it due in the last week of classes, which is a really busy time, but we also don't cover the readings/content necessary for the extended case study until the very end of class because we were behind the syllabus since early on in the semester. Also, it's pretty clear that a lot of kids in this class were disengaged -- too much reading of which you really need very little to succeed, and in-class lectures that do not expand much beyond the slides that Henderson uploads on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of the course was pretty solid ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredibly biased and boring course. The professor doesn't even try to hide it anymore. The political bent is just frustrating, even if you agree with him.\r\n\r\nHe also did not have the decency to email the class when lecture was canceled one Thursday. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Interesting material, relatively easy to complete assignments, valuable feedback for papers.\r\nWeaknesses - Not a lot of reason to go to lecture ",

            "\u00a0thought it was pretty good as in it met my expectations as to what I thought I was going to learn when I signed up for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I'm afraid the course content is rather dry, and the survey model of several different topics prevented us from going more in-depth on some of the more interesting topics, like redistricting and party bias. Within a few weeks of the beginning of the semester, lecture attendance had dropped to perhaps 1/3, and slid down to maybe 1/4 by the end of the course. Any lecture with that kind of attendance issue needs to receive a hard look, as it suggests that students were getting all they needed to or at least enough out of the lecture slides posted on canvas. Professor Henderson assigned several books for us to read throughout the course. It soon became apparent that the books were not covered in lecture or section and thus the reading was hard to justify with all the other work I had to do. Professor Henderson also bizarrely assigned \"recommended\" additional reading, as if the 100+ pages of required reading could be taken for granted even though we essentially never covered it. A mark of a disengaging lecture is one with a mandatory section, and while attendance was excellent, participation was limited to maybe half of the section. It sometimes felt as though we just had to fill the time because the content wasn't that interesting and there was no plan for section. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were enjoyable as well as the discussion sections. The paper was also a very instructive assignment due to allowing us to apply concepts from class. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself and the material in it is very interesting but not very challenged. I would have appreciated more application of the concepts in and out of class. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course is its connection to our present political landscape and helping one understand how the past connects to the present. "

The grading is not forgiving, even though he tells you the test questions in advance. I thought that would make the course easier, but answering those questions can be tricky and subjective. ",
