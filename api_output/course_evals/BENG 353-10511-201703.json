            "\u00a0Didn't really learn anything. The class was poorly taught. The professor never explained simple terms like strain, stress, viscoelasticity, poroelasticity, etc... in such a way that the students could understand the concepts. The entire class was spent copying equations that the professor would write on the chalk board with no real explanation as to what the equations meant. ",

However, given that I did not have the level of knowledge apparently necessary for Matlab, I did pick up some skills in the programming language as a result. I did get a cursory level understanding from Murrell's lectures, but the level of engagement was not necessarily highest and problem sets did not always reflect the lecture material. ",

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Murrell is really passionate about the material, and it's evident in his teaching. I think the fact that this course is lab-based instead of exam-based is a MAJOR strength. The real BME world does not include exams, it includes critical reasoning and working with data, which this course emphasized more. Murell's notes were really clear as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been a lot easier to study for the exams if the pset solutions were posted. It's hard to learn from our mistakes, especially since the TAs were pretty unhelpful and frequently antagonized students. This course is VERY matlab heavy and is incredibly difficult with no matlab or coding background. I found the matlab portions beneficial, but there needs to be some disclaimer at the beginning of the course for students who don't have that background. The fact that the professor said that you don't need any prior background in matlab and everything will be taught is completely false.\r\n\r\nAnother major weakness was that it's incredibly frustrating to be working on the take-home labs (which are supposed to be like midterms where collaboration is not allowed) alone when it was obvious that there were many people collaborating together. I'm not sure how to remedy this because I really like the take-home lab format. However, even when the TAs were made aware of cheating, nothing was done about it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not very transparent in grading, which meant there were students who would have very similar answers, and some got points taken off while others didn't. We also didn't have answers to the problem sets, so if you wanted to know what the correct answer was, you had to go to office hours and ask a TA. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely expected that the class would be about stresses within the bones, fluid mechanics inside the blood vessels, things like that. I think dealing with these concepts on a larger scale would have been a lot more accessible, but it was still manageable. There were a couple Matlab assignments which didn't really deal with the concepts so much as they were just how to Matlab. I get that the point is so we understand that modern engineering can't be done with pen and paper and requires numerical tools like Matlab, but Matlab assignments have this downfall more often than not in my opinion, that it just takes forever for everyone to figure out how to get their code to work, a bunch of people can just take code from other people and not actually do the homework, and at the end of the day we didn't really learn about stress and strain all that much. But as a mechanical engineering student taking an elective from the BME track, I enjoyed seeing the stuff I had learned elsewhere applied toward something other than steel. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course focused on cellular mechanics, fluid flow, stress and strain, etc. was stronger than the second half which was focused on modeling polymers. This may be due to the fact that there was a textbook associated with the first half. Some of the psets were very long and arduous. However, they did reinforce some of the concepts learned in class. I would have preferred it if we knew the solution to the questions that were very difficult. Learned a lot about Matlab which was also very good. Professor Murrell spoke very clearly and was easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the biggest weaknesses is clarity in what was wanted of students. Particularly on the laboratories that serve as take-home midterms, it was unclear what exactly what was desired of us in qualitative explanations. In addition, on the second midterm, it seemed pretty clear after I had completed the assignment that the assignment was much too long for the allocated 3 hours--which puts those who adhered to the time limit at a disadvantage than those that violated the honor system and finished the assignment, using more than three hours. The strengths of the course are the lectures, which were well-organized and mostly clear. It may have been useful to have more textbook excerpts or posted notes to review when working on psets or exams. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best parts of this course was how Prof. Murell went from first principles in mechanics and built up to complex models of biomechanical systems. It was really great to see how basic physics can be developed into useful models of living cells. But the focus was exclusively on cells. As if cells were the only entities worth modeling through biomechanics. Prof. Murell never once mentioned other interesting and vital topics in biomechanics, like vascular mechanics and bone structure. We couldn't even write about these topics for a final paper. The final paper topics had to be about cells. The course as taught, though excellent, was NOT an introduction to biomechanics. It was an introduction to cell biomechanics. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered too much material and often skipped basic building blocks that were necessary to understand. I felt like there was a large gap in our knowledge that caused me to often feel lost and confused in lecture. The professor oftentimes assumed we knew more than we did and in the future should take more time to help students understand the most basic concepts so everyone is on the same page. \r\n\r\nI feel like the pace of the class caused much of the material we learned in class to be quickly forgotten. A lot was never revisited or covered in problem sets or laboratories. I would suggest they remove some material and review others more slowly.\r\n\r\nThen homework sets were often confusing and should be more closely aligned to what we are studying in class. The laboratories (especially the 1st) were WAY too hard and confusing and tested us on material that wasn't very relevant to our lectures. The second laboratory was poorly constructed. Having a time limit on the students honor is unfair. \r\n\r\nOverall, I highly suggest the class spends more time on basic material, covers less advanced topics, and creates more straightforward assignments that directly test material that was covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very poorly organized and usually seemed to lack direction. The communication between the students, TAs, and professor was quite weak and just about everything in the course could have been communicated and organized better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - N/A\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - solutions to psets are never posted, no textbook to follow along with the class, constant errors in notes that are written on the board (only source of information in the class), grading is obscure, TFs are degrading to students ",
            "\u00a0While Prof. Murrell was well-intentioned, the execution of the class was poor. It was a math concept-heavy course, and most of it wasn't intuitive and required thorough explanations that were largely neglected. I truly think the concepts would not have been hard to grasp if they were taught well, and if we had better help from the TAs. What frustrated me was I wanted to learn in this class, as is the point in any class; instead, I had to teach myself concepts that I had a bare grasp on. The TAs were largely unhelpful because they were unwilling to give too much away on the problem sets when we didn't know what we were doing in the first place. The only saving grace was collaboration with my peers, and while that was incredibly valuable, the mark was missed in having this course be proactive and effective in its instruction. ",
            "\u00a0Problem set solutions should have been posted online so we could know what was wrong with our problem sets and how to properly do them. Problem sets also sometimes were very long and took an unreasonable amount of time given that they were posted usually on Thursday and due on Tuesday. Additionally, one of the TAs was pretty terrible which definitely made the class a lot worse.\r\n\r\nThe lectures were pretty interesting and I feel like I learned a lot. I liked the professor and he seemed to care about whether or not we were learning the content. \r\n\r\nOverall the class was okay. The main issue was definitely Lorenzo (the TA). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were limited really to the professor's open lecturing style. Otherwise... uh... nothing really stood out in comparison to other classes. Any strengths were really drowned out by weak TA's, lack of instructional clarity, lack of clarity on expectations and homeworks, and more. This lead to just general confusion in the class and lots of dissatisfaction. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Murrell was a huge asset to the class - he had a fun teaching style which would make a lot of the material less painful. That said, I had a lot of differences with the course, the biggest of which being that we never put everything together. We learned a lot of mechanical theory, but didn't learn why all that was important for the motion or behavior of cells. Another weakness was grading - the problem sets and take-home midterm/final were always really difficult and seemed loosely related to concepts we only touched upon, and the TAs did a really poor job of explaining/guiding us in office hours. We were never given any corrections, so we couldn't really learn from our mistakes throughout the semester. I honestly can't confidently say I learned anything useful or applicable in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting. The course really was just a big let down because of the inconsistent grading. The course also was taught assuming students knew much more than they did, and the prereq's don't reflect that you would need all this background. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was good at understanding what concepts needed more/less time, so the time allocation in the class was good. However, it was a bit difficult to complete the assignments because there wasn't much of a formal curriculum (textbook chapters, lecture notes, etc) that we followed along with. It would be immensely helpful if we had something more structured to learn from as opposed to scraping the internet for resources. ",
            "\u00a0We were expected to do a lot with Matlab without getting any previous instruction in Matlab. This gave students who had taken the Matlab course a clear advantage at the labs. ",
            "\u00a0Frankly, I don't think the class was meant to be extremely hard, but it was. I don't know whether it was the material, the teaching, or something else entirely. I felt that Professor Murrell did a good job as an instructor, but somehow, I struggled to keep up with material and develop and strong foundational understanding in the topic. The TAs, at least initially, and for most of the semester, were ultimately unhelpful. I feel that perhaps adding section for the course would be helpful - in classes where I could not easily follow lecture material (BENG 249) or textbook readings, I have found that sections led by the TAs were extremely helpful in granting me the foundational understanding and deeper insights I needed to succeed in the class.\r\nThe problem sets for this class were aggressive, to be honest. But I cannot say whether this was because the problem sets were extremely difficult or because most of the students in the class just didn't know the material. Probably a mixture of both. It made things significantly more difficult that we did not have access to homework solutions. I feel that the material could have been awesome and interesting for me if I didn't have such a hard time with it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - teaching through going derivations is helpful \r\nWeaknesses - would have loved problem set solutions, greater organization in the teaching, more resources - following along with a textbook, for ex. ",
            "\u00a0Very little of this course was explained on a conceptual level, so most of the time the students would see the equations written on the board and not know how to apply them in a meaningful way. The TA's weren't very helpful, in that they didn't provide feedback to the students, and the problem sets didn't have accessible answer keys after we turned our homeworks in, so there wasn't a great way to learn from our mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0I wish this class had moved a little slower, it was honestly a whirlwind just trying to move your pencil fast enough to keep up with the professor's many tangents and confusing side notes. If we had a bit more time in lecture to process and apply what we were learning, instead of just seeing a bunch of new stuff on the homeworks, maybe I would have walked away remembering more information. ",
            "\u00a0Murrell was cool, but he thought we knew a lot more than we did and taught this class at a level beyond what anyone could follow.  The TAs then made the class even worse by providing impossible psets that no one knew how to do and they gave very little help.  There office hours were not very helpful and they made it clear they didnt want to be there and didnt want to help us and thought it was silly that we were confused and needed help.  The psets didnt always even correspond very well with what we did in class. ",
            "\u00a0For some reason, the professor didn't release answer keys or any example code. The made getting feedback on assignments very difficult. Since there wasn't a textbook for the class, this means that the only way to learn in this class was to take perfect notes in class and go to office hours. \r\n\r\nThe first take home exam took far too long (20+ hours), and instead of fixing the issue for the second take home exam, they just imposed an artificially low time limit that no one could realistically finish the exam in. If you want to put a time limit on an exam, please just make it an in class exam. Putting a short time limit on a take home exam does nothing except encourage academic dishonesty and fuel anxiety.\r\n\r\nI improved my Matlab skills a bit, so I guess that's a positive. ",
            "\u00a0There was not much opportunity for feedback on the problem sets as answer keys were not posted. Office hours was crowded and the TAs were not incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0While it was clear Murrell was enthusiastic about the course and the material he was teaching (particularly actin and myosin), there were several weaknesses. First, the level of engagement was low and people regularly showed up late to class, arriving while he was mid-sentence. Many of the problem sets weren't always written with the lecture material in mind, so they made going to office hours essential in order to understand the questions. There were several instances where you had to go to office hours in order to get the extra point on a question because you wouldn't have known to do a particular thing or solve an additional piece if you hadn't otherwise gone. A competent level of Matlab knowledge was assumed but not required as a prerequisite so many people were unaware of how much their grade would depend on Matlab code. Problem sets were assigned and due in less than a week, which is atypical of STEM classes that normally give you a week to complete an assignment (the standard in this class was typically Thursday post date and Tuesday due date). The TA's could be given more direction and could also work to ensure an up-to-date Canvas library of resources, which they increasingly did not do towards the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked that some of our assignments involved using MATLAB to model things like stress-strain relationships and cell adhesion/spread. I would definitely keep the MATLAB component for future iterations of the class, as I felt considerably more confident using MATLAB after this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/areas for improvement:\r\n\r\n1) Homework: The problem sets were poorly written and full of typos that were often only corrected a couple of days before the assignment was due. More importantly, we were never provided with solutions of any sort  the TAs marked questions wrong without any explanations, and Prof. Murrell didnt post solutions on Canvas. As a result, we had to go out of our way to receive useful feedback and learn from our mistakes, a challenge compounded by the fact that Prof. Murrell and our two TAs were largely inaccessible (they only held a total of three hours of office hours a week). Students cannot be expected to learn and enjoy learning when they are not provided with adequate resources. I understand that this was Prof. Murrells first time teaching, so I hope the homework assignments and feedback given to students will improve in the future. \r\n\r\n2) The TAs: At one of the first office hours of the semester, one of my classmates mentioned that the problem set was difficult; the TAs (serious) response was maybe you should switch majors. This pretty much set the tone for the entire semester  Ive never had a class with such unsupportive, negligent, and downright unhelpful TAs. On the problem sets, Lorenzo and Ron gave vague, unhelpful answers. They took off points without written justification when grading our homework, and they didnt show up to one of their own scheduled office hours. They asked us to post questions on Canvas, but took several days to respond to us. We couldnt fully take advantage of their office hours because the problem sets were sometimes not even posted until it was too late. All of these things, combined with their generally unengaged and passive aggressive attitudes, made the class an even more discouraging and frustrating experience.\r\n\r\n3) Organization: The organization of this class was incredibly poor and deteriorated as the semester went on. After fall break, we pretty much stopped following the progression of topics outlined on the syllabus, and we didnt even end up covering certain subjects. We also didnt follow a textbook, which meant we had to learn a lot of the material by looking up things online, especially since in-class derivations often had mistakes. To make matters worse, we did not see or hear from Prof. Murrell for the entire last month of the semester. This was because of a family emergency, but he became completely unreachable and left no solid plan in place for the last two weeks of class. Disappearing without any announcement and without leaving a plan in place is incredibly irresponsible and disrespectful to the class. In the end, the BME department chair and DUS actually had to intervene and make sure that the TAs set up review sessions that would prepare us for the final lab assignment. ",
            "\u00a0This class had a new professor, Michael Murrell. I think that the class was set up a little strangely and was taught not greatly but not terribly.  There were lab assignments that were worth so much of our grade and defacto midterms. For the first lab assignment we were given only a couple days more than our weekly pset and then for the second assignment only three hours. We were also assigned a final paper, which seemed completely irrelevant and had very few and vague guidelines that were not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I liked prof. murrell's lectures. I thought they were fairly organized and straightforward and interesting. I thought the homeworks could have been more connected to the lectures. Also if the answers to the homeworks are not given, the homework should be graded with enough feedback that you know exactly what you did wrong. ",
            "\u00a0The overarching problems with the course were the lack of organization and transparency. There was never any feedback for assignments, but Professor Murrell also did not go over the assignments after the fact or provide access to solutions/explanations, so it wasn't possible to figure out why things were wrong (or to see if perhaps a mistake had been made in grading). Additionally, the homeworks and lab assignments were at times disproportionately difficult or even unrelated to what we had covered in class that week. Any attempts to have these concerns discussed were met with silence. ",
            "\u00a0The class was actually quite hard to follow. Most of the time in class, it felt like we were just copying equations into our notes, without understanding where the equations were derived from. I think too much derivation is a bad thing, but I feel like there should be a balance between theory and application, and there was not enough theory. The homeworks sometimes took hours to do, with little help from notes. I think the things we learned in class were actually not that hard to understand, and was actually pretty fascinating, but the approach to learning these concepts was not intuitive. The labs (midterm and final) were Matlab heavy, and we didn't get much extra practice with Matlab in class. The days where we used Matlab in class, we really just copied the code from the TAs. The grading of the homeworks seemed inconsistent, and we were not given homework solutions to the homework, so it was hard to understand why we got answers wrong. The midterm lab was tough but manageable since there was no time limit, which I spent about 36 hours working on (this is not an exaggeration.) But I felt totally blindsinded by the fact that we only had three hours to work on the final lab, which had more questions that the midterm lab. The final paper felt extraneous with all the work we had done already, and it was really hard to research the complex topics with the limited understanding of biomechanics that I had. "

            "\u00a0If this is taught by Murrell again, be aware that it is really MATLAB-intensive. You'll get away with not taking DiffEQ, but be ready to do a lot of MATLAB and don't be fooled when they say that you don't need any prior background. If you know MATLAB or are really proficient in coding, this is a great course! I generally enjoyed it and learned a lot. ",

It just wasn't about what I thought it would be about so I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would, but it wasn't all that hard except for all the whiny pre med kids, which I guess is pretty unavoidable if you're taking a BME class ",

The second half of the course did not have a textbook associated with it and was focused on modeling polymers. Some of those concepts are really hard to grasp. The psets took longer than expected. The labs were fair. No final exam but there was a final paper, which you could work with a partner on. Professor Murrell was clear and easy to understand. ",

The information is interesting, the workload isn't so bad, and Murrell is a good lecturer. From the get-go, you should make sure you're asking many questions in class and regarding assignments to set a baseline for expectations in the class, since that was what was most unclear for me throughout this class.

It used to be good when Humphrey was teaching it, but now, it has definitely gone down the gutter.\r\n\r\nI thought I paid Yale $70k/year to make learning easier, but this course has showed me that my money would have been better spent on fidget spinners. I actually learned more off of online MIT lecture notes than I did in this class. The professor is at least interested passionate about the material, but the structure of the class definitely does not facilitate learning of any kind. Grading is ambiguous and you cannot figure out what you did wrong on the homework or take-home laboratories because there are no solutions posted (class policy).\r\n\r\nThe TFs are the worst I have had at Yale. In all seriousness, no interaction might have been better than no interaction at all. Students have been told by TFs that \"it is not too late to switch to an easy major, like art history.\" There was also a heated exchange between a student and a TF during lecture. Very unhelpful, degrading, and unprofessional. The BME department should really evaluate their graduate students as some are CLEARLY not fit to mentor students.\r\n\r\nTLDR; horrible class, your time/money is better spent on fidget spinners, degrading TFs ",

It's immensely theoretical and did a poor job of explaining applications. The grading usually seemed arbitrary, and the TAs were pretty unhelpful. If you have to take it for BME, wait and see if the class changes staff again. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it's a major requirement, but if you're interested in learning mechanics, I would recommend taking a straight engineering class. this has lot of biophysical applications, but it may not give you the rigorous foundation you're looking for. ",
            "\u00a0As it is now, I would not recommend this to another student. It was honestly really tough for a lot of people in the class - unfortunately, if you're taking this, you're probably BME, and it's required. If you're not BME, as it is now, do not take this course - it has changed from previous years. ",
            "\u00a0No. At least, I wouldn't recommend this course with the current teaching staff that teaches it. Apparently the course had good reviews in the past with Professor Humphrey, but with the current teaching staff, I wouldn't recommend this course to anybody. Sorry BME majors ",
            "\u00a0No. I took this as an elective and very much regret it. The workload was fine, but the class was so poorly organized. I came in very excited to learn the material and try something new and was constantly disappointed. Obviously, a lot of people have to take the class for their major, but I think everyone else might want to pick another elective course. ",
            "\u00a0This class used to be great, but this year there were many changes that just ruined the class.  Murrell is cool and people liked him.  He is so smart that he expected us to know a lot and taught the class beyond what we could handle.  The result was that we didnt learn very much becaseu we couldnt follow things.  There were no in class exams, which is the only thing saving people in this class.  We could always use notes or get help, and that is the only reason we didnt all fail this class.  The assignments took forever and the TAs were so horrible and unwilling to help.  They didnt want to be there and assigned impossible, long psets.  This class is a required BME class and it has potential, but this year the class just sucked.  If Humphrey is teaching again and if the TAs are better than this class may be ok again. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if it's required. I heard Professor Humphrey did a good job teaching this class is the past; maybe he should come back to teach it again. \r\n\r\nTo the BME department, please do better. Both BENG 249 last spring and this class were taught by new professors who did a poor job. There are some cool electives in this department taught by great professors. Why can't the required courses be the same way? ",
            "\u00a0No it sucks don't take it unless your BME ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless they're taking it with Humphrey or the class with Murrell undergoes a significant change. ",
            "\u00a0BENG 353 was immensely disappointing, thanks to the classs extremely poor organization and a professor/TAs who did not care about their students learning. Although Prof. Murrell was passionate about the material, he focused on concepts that didnt seem relevant to real-life applications; his lectures were unclear, his chalkboard derivations were full of errors, and he didnt even end up covering everything on the syllabus. I was mostly frustrated that Prof. Murrell did not give us the tools to succeed  he did not make problem set solutions available for us to learn from our mistakes, nor did he follow a textbook so that we could supplement our learning and correct errors in our lecture notes. The worst part was probably our unhelpful and unfriendly TAs, who made an already confusing class even more discouraging. I 100% would not recommend this class the way it was taught this semester, especially when you look at the glowing reviews from when it was taught by Prof. Humphrey. To make this class more engaging and valuable for providing a foundation for upper-level BME classes, it needs to be far better organized around actually useful concepts and have more supportive TAs. I sincerely hope that the BME department will take these evaluations seriously so that it doesnt subject another class of BME majors to the same disaster of a class. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another course, although it's required for the biomedical engineering major. The class had the potential to be good, but the TAs made it EXTREMELY unpleasant and I felt a bit lost. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I enjoyed it, and the workload was reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Welcome to BENG 353, where everything's made up and the points don't matter. Really, you will never receive any feedback at all for why you lost points on homework or labs. At most, you might get an illegible scribble or a helpful note of \"Nah\" or \"Wut\". I have no idea why any of my answers were wrong or what they should have been, and for some reason Professor Murrell is very against any form of homework solutions, so you'll never find out. You don't go over the homework ever, and bringing up that this is a problem is more likely to get you insulted than helped. I truly have no idea what I learned correctly or incorrectly in this class. Turning in homework might as well have been throwing it into a trashcan and getting back a random number as your grade, because there was really no way to know otherwise. Our final course grades were posted in spite of having no grades for our final papers; there is no transparency at all.\r\n\r\nThis class would have been disorganized and frustrating on its own, but having Ron and Lorenzo as TAs made it into something of a horror show. Unhelpful does not begin to describe them. People stopped going to office hours because Lorenzo was so antagonistic and there was little help given, only judgement. He is an arrogant, condescending jerk. He pretty obviously considers most people to be beneath him, and if you ask what he considers a bad question or ask something that a different person asked (even if you weren't there for the explanation) he will sigh deeply and roll his eyes and sometimes preface his response with something like \"this is really easy\". Ron isn't a bad person, but could be replaced with a stuffed animal and no one would notice. He once told me I was on the right track for a homework problem in office hours. I had only written down the problem on my paper. A few times, they literally snuck out of office hours while 30+ students were crammed into the tiny conference room and the surrounding hallway because no one understood the homework. It's more worth it to just work in a group with classmates. If they are TAs, DO NOT TAKE THE CLASS.\r\n\r\nSeveral people emailed Professor Murrell throughout the semester with various complaints, including the lack of feedback, scheduling of office hours during a required BME lab, TAs skipping office hours, disproportionate difficulty and/or length of some assignments, and the TAs being rude/unhelpful. These were met with either no response at all, or \"I'll look into it\" with nothing actually being addressed at all.\r\n\r\nThe lectures themselves had about 30 minutes of material each. We once spent 28 minutes of an 85 minute class doing a recap and then talking about what we were going to talk about next. Murrell stands directly in front of the board where he is writing, so you will miss everything he is saying out loud when trying to frantically catch up in your notes, which by the way are not posted online anywhere. Sometimes he made mistakes in variables or signs that weren't caught until the later classes, at which point we didn't know which version was correct. \r\n\r\nFor an idea of how this class went, picture this:\r\nYou start out a class with enthusiasm and interest; you genuinely want to take the class and are hopeful for the future. Just three months later you are debating dropping your major and getting a BA in mechanical engineering for god's sake. You started your eval four weeks into the class so you didn't forget anything. No one asks for that. \r\n\r\nThis is possibly the worst class in all of Yale. It was so bad that the department chair had to come in and babysit for the last three classes.The most useful information I gained was that when complaining to a professor just gets ignored, going to the DUS can actually get results. Don't wait to do that if it goes poorly again.\r\n\r\nReally, if nothing changes to address all of these concerns, I might recommend dropping the major to another student. You can still be MechE if you try really hard and quit now ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to students who are not required to take it by their major. I think the class was taught in a way that did not help me to retain anything. It was also very time-demanding. "
