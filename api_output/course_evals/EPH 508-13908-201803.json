This ended up being my favorite course, even though I started out being annoyed that I had to take it. I really appreciate how organized prof. Niccolai and tfs were. Made it easy to learn\r\n\r\nThe only thing I would change is that the readings are  not really beneficial.  theyre either really long studies that we had no need to read or theyre the epi book that is word for word summarized in lecture. Tbh I stopped doing readings midway through the course and I dont think it hurt. But it could be cool if we had more modern papers to read each week where you were explicitly like  hey these researchers effed up and have a ton of bias- find it?\r\n\r\nAlso I really really appreciate having the formula sheet. I think it helped me focus on the right stuff- the concepts. I would mayyybe just tell ppl a whole chi square calculation wont be on either exam bc ppl definitely spent hours of their lives doing that when they didnt need to. It is covered in bio stats in a different way and you can still test the application. ",

I think this class would benefit from an additional assignment that allows students to apply these concepts to develop their own study. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very useful class. I rarely used the book, so I was not a fan of having to purchase it. The lecture slides were informative. The tests were tricky but the final was fair. Not easy, but fair. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that when the Professor was introducing a new concept in class she would include the more traditional verbal or quantitative explanation but would also immediately after present a pictorial, as this is how I learn best. Whenever I went to office hours she carefully listened to my questions, validated my confusion, and then went step-by-step to explain in a new way. Although she did teach inline with the textbook, lecture always provided substantial material outside the textbook. For example, the Professor often cited studies conducted by Yale faculty and researchers. She also broke down the density of scientific articles to offer recommendations of why the author may have made a certain format or analytical choice, asked us to identify the concepts we were learning within the article, and offer potentially problematic study design or reporting choices made by researchers and the consequences of those choices. This was valuable to begin thinking about what kind of studies and writing I wanted to learn and produce. All of her exams were very fair for the material we were learning, even for students with no previous epidemiology experience, like me. Lastly, it was helpful she hosted review sessions prior to exams that felt in line with the kinds of problems we were given on the exams. \r\n\r\nI would have liked to see lectures include more poll questions. The Professor did try to incorporate the technology but it did not always work. I also understand why she left some lecture slides blank given she posted them prior to class, but I would have preferred to not have slides posted until after lecture if that meant the material would have been included. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class - material was good and interesting, the pace of the class was good as well. Loved the use of articles to prove points that were taught in the textbook; some of it is confusing just in that public health itself is confusing and can sometimes not have a clear answer. ",

Why we want to design the study the way it is, what kinds of measures could be used, and how to interpret the finding of the scientific papers.

            "\u00a0Maybe have three midterms and make the final out of less points. The second midterm for this class felt like an overload of material, and a 40% final is always nerve-wracking and perhaps not representative of a students actual knowledge of the material. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Really well structured with embedded review time. I truly think this is one class that I will leave retaining the knowledge I acquired. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The discussion section was a waste of time, energy, and resources. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course.  Difficult to recall any other course in which I learned so much in so little time.  I wish the homework problems were more reflective of the test questions, but other than that, no complaints!  Thank you for a great semester! ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-taught and organized effectively. I gained a very solid understanding of the material and I do not think there needs to be improvement. The course was excellent! ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. It provided a fantastic introductory look into the field of epidemiology, and provided students with the skills to appropriately analyze research papers and epi-related claims made in media (which I find myself doing more of now). In terms of the structure of the class, I appreciated the emphasis on understanding concepts rather than rote memorization of formulas, and applying these concepts to real-world examples in class and on homework assignments, as well as hypothetical examples on homework assignments and exams. I also liked that the homework assignments were graded pass/fail on \"a good faith effort to complete the assignment,\" which definitely took the pressure off of getting the right answer and allowed me to focus on learning the material, viewing the homework assignments as \"practice opportunities.\" Overall, this structure definitely helped me to learn and retain the material very well. In fact, I ended up using the statistics-related material taught in this course to help understand the same concepts taught in other courses. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, I thought that some of the homework questions were a bit confusingly worded, especially when learning about confounding and effect modification for the first time. For next year, I might recommend adjusting these questions to start with a very basic step-by-step approach to confounding and then assessing more complicated questions after that. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good class and a nice intro to basic epidemiological topics. It was well organized and I felt like I learnt a lot. The exams were fair. I thought the psets could have had better questions that encouraged more critical thinking. ",

I think there were a number of reasons for this, including:\r\n-General logistical/timing of the class: having epidemiology and biostatistics every morning at 8:30 AM was brutal. I understand that students are all on different schedules, having to be \"on\" for early morning lectures where the majority of material was read directly off of slides negatively impacted my ability to be productive later in the day. I noticed a marked difference in my overall productivity and ability to study on days where we had off from these 8:30 classes.\r\n-There seemed to be very little consistency between the TFs. Greater uniformity in teaching approach would have been useful, particularly considering this was essentially a 101 course.\r\n-Other students might disagree with me on this, but I would suggest that homework be graded rather than simply pass/fail. I found very little incentive to dedicate the time necessary to understand homeworks each week knowing that I would get credit \"just for trying\". \r\n-To that point, short quizzes during TF sections personally would have been a better way to test my understanding of the material. Part of the reason I performed so poorly in the class was due to the few opportunities to express mastery of the material outside of exams. ",

            "\u00a0It's kind of required, so you have to take it. For the most part the material is interesting and make sense when thinking of developing studies as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course! Very organized, informative, clear, and useful. You'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the content of this course is essential for someone pursuing a public health degree and you can learn a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class does a good job of helping you understand basics of epi, but there is nothing exciting or engaging about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend only if taught by Dr. Niccolai. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend to non-PH students (PH students are required to take this course).  Actually a well thought-out course.  And will you a well-rounded introduction to epidemiology ",
            "\u00a0The course in an in depth overview of the main topics pertinent to epidemiology. I would recommend it to any student going into a health care related field. You learn more than topics, you learn how to actively evaluate and question the research and work being done in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I can see how it's absolutely necessary and vital to take this for public health, but there must be other creative ways to present the material to the students. It felt more memorization heavy and not sure how long the material would stick. Not sure what an alternative would look like... ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches basic concepts of epidemiology and public health. I would highly recommend to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I struggled with the material, but once I got a hang of it at the end, I really enjoyed the class and that is especially thanks to our discussion groups and our TFs. I would definitely recommend this class to another student if Dr. Niccolai is teaching it, because you will learn epidemiology at the end of the day. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend! After taking epidemiology, I feel I can better evaluate the merit of studies/conduct a study in my own research interests. I am a better public health student and even a better patient for being able to read about diseases that affect me with an astute eye. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-tougher than you expect but a very good class. makes me wanna take more epidemiology classes ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend ",

            "\u00a0This course was essentially its title, the foundations of epidemiology for public health. Yes I would recommend as an intro course for a public health student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great introductory course to epidemiology that professor Niccolai makes entertaining and and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who want to get a general grasp on epi. It was quite work intensive compared to other introduction classes but I believe it was worthwhile in the end. There could have been some improvements here and there but for any newcomer to the epi field this would be a solid class to take. ",
            "\u00a0very useful! I would strongly recommend the course! ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the fundamentals of epidemiology and some of the course ties into other classes, such as Biostatistics. I can walk away from the course saying that I am able to read a research paper and understand the design and qualitative assessment. ",
            "\u00a0Useful course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student as it is a foundational course for public health degree. I would describe it as an epidemiology 101 type course teaching every kind of study design and it utilized a lot of descriptive epidemiology concepts and equations. ",

            "\u00a0worth taking, very helpful ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of epidemiology and related research. Upon completion of the course I feel as though I can critically think about research thats been done or is being done and its impact on public health, its implications for the field, and how valid the study is both internally and externally in terms of generalizability. I would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced the basic concepts in epidemiology. I would recommend. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a class you will have to take in public health, but for what it's worth, Linda makes it wonderful. Her slides are great (a little bare bones, but that makes it all the more important and useful to go to lecture -- it's worth it!), the book is helpful for solidifying concepts, and the homework assignments stretch your thinking of epidemiology. If you engage with the material, there is so much to learn from this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course and would recommend it to students looking to develop a strong foundation of basic epi concepts. The fact that attendance and HWs are graded more flexibility, makes you want to learn more without the added stress of getting a grade. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, she is really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a students with little to no background in epidemiology and wishes to establish a foundational understanding of the subject. I learned a lot of material in just a semester. ",

            "\u00a0Despite it being a mandatory core course, i would recommend it to students because the overview of the topics/subjects is very interesting. But I would encourage them to seek a TF that works for them - and not be shy to switch sections or speak up if its not working, like I wish I had done. ",
            "\u00a0required for YSPH so yes\r\nif you have any experience in epi though, you can't probably test out of it with a little extra studying - not a difficult course ",
            "\u00a0Good for beginners, ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend the course if one seeks to refine / reinforce ones foundational Epi understanding. Often feels like busy work, but punctuated golden nuggets of new knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most basic course for us epidemiology students. Since I've learned epi in undergraduate school, I expected this course to be better. It did illustrated some important points but how it was organized  somewhat disappointed me. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a good overview of the basic principle of epidemiology. It is a first step into the world of epidemiology. Overall, I would say that it is useful to know, especially as a complement to the material of other classes. ",
            "\u00a0it's a must-take for public health students, and it's useful. It lays the foundation for a lot of classes. So just take it!\r\nBut if you are not interested in public health, the materials could be less engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Very good learning experience. ",

            "\u00a0This course is Epidemiology 101. It's necessary as a foundational course for public health, so it's difficult for me to NOT recommend it -- that said, had I known that I could test out of it in advance of the program, I likely would have taken the course at another institution before arriving at Yale to free up my time and mental space for an additional elective course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a great class introducing students to the different types of epidemiological study design types and measures. "
