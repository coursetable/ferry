            "\u00a0Learned *a lot* about theories regarding construction of race. Gave me a vocabulary to talk about race in the context of medicine and understand western biomedicine through a different lens. Really appreciated this class, especially as a pursue a career in the health professions! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much throughout this course. We need more courses like this at Yale where we actually examine race and it's intersection with health and society. What was incredibly effective about this course what that is gave us theoretical frameworks through which we could approach the readings in a way that was really accessible. I think the single most important thing I learned through the course was that socio-political situations lead to health disparities across racial lines because of internalized responses to racism and discrimination, as theorized by Gravlee. I think that this course captured this nuance incredibly well and worked to push back against the notion that there is a biological difference between people of different racial groups. This idea has long been used to discriminate against people of color and this class was the one of the first times at Yale that I've seen that has really pushed back. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the most engaging and thought-provoking classes I've taken at Yale. I developed a foundation of racial theory that I can use to analyze the way race is discussed in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely useful in terms of integrating my knowledge from studying Ethnicity, Race, & Migration and seeing its applications in a field that generally isn't discussed - medicine.In doing so, it made the much of the theory in my major much easier to understand in practice. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes and has transformed the way I look at race and medicine. It's given me the tools to think critically and understand how race is a social construction and used to perpetuate biopolitical methods in medicine using important theories. I am SO GRATEFUL for this course- it has fundamentally dismantled my misconceptions of medicine and medical control. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in the class!!!! About Western biomedicine, about racial formation, and about myself. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about the ways that knowledge is created and how knowledge that we take for granted (such as biomedicine) carry biases while seeming like facts. I will go into medicine more prepared to think critically about the role of race and when race is and is not appropriate to consider; when, for instance, it serves as a damaging short-hand vs. when illness reflects the embodiment of racism. ",
            "\u00a0Race, Medicine, & the Body was a class that made me consider medicine in a completely different way - as a form of social control and a tool for the biological essentialism of race. Professor Martnez complicated the validity of widely-accepted medical knowledge due to the fact that its production and dissemination is dominated by a small pool of white men, which set a solid framework for the continuous questioning of medical epistemology throughout the semester. She also provided us useful frameworks to refer to in our future academic and personal dealings with the medical field. Great class. ",
            "\u00a0How to challenge normative conceptions of race through readings that spanned critical race theory, feminist theory, and racial formation theory. How to understand the roles that biopower and biopolitics play in shaping perceptions of the racialized body. How social scientific research can never be understood without considering the sociopolitical context in which it emerged. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING CLASS that really explores the intersections of race, racism, science, and medicine. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well structured, fun, and super interesting. Even though I was credit/ding the class and had relatively low investment, I still felt like I learned A LOT. In terms of improvement- would have been nice if the class was smaller and more seminar styled, but then fewer people would have been able to take the course... I wish the course was offered in future semesters! ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that the theoretical framework was very accessible and I learned a lot. A weakness was some of the in-class exercises weren't really appropriate for the situation at hand, but the professor was an open-communicator and handled it well. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, the discussions were always interesting and the reading selection was well-chosen and thoughtful. I would have liked fewer in-class assignments with lecture time as a replacement, and short reading responses with feedback instead. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was extremely strong in the construction of the syllabus, allowing us to cover such a wide expanse of areas that continued to build off of each other as the semester continued. The readings, class presentations, and activities were all really useful in helping to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0SO MANY STRENGTHS\r\n\r\n- organized\r\n- engaging\r\n- open and nurturing\r\n- clear grading system that is fair\r\n- very interesting readings ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are that we started from the basics and were given a language and framework to think about and talk about these subjects.\r\nThe weaknesses are that the class felt like a lecture; it often felt as though we weren't given the opportunity to form our own thoughts or develop our own ideas about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were incredible, and well organized throughout the semester. Professor Martinez is AMAZING, and ran a seminar that was at once challenging, engaging, and welcoming. \r\n\r\nI have very few suggestions- I only wish that we had had a slightly bigger classroom space! Also, I think once we started doing student presentations on the readings, we should have limited them to 20-30min so we could have had more time learn from Professor Martinez and to discuss as a class. ",
            "\u00a0Very theory based, which was amazing. We were able to locate moments in history and connect them to theory which cannot be said for the majority of Yale classes. Information was extremely accessible. ",
            "\u00a0I truly loved the material and readings of this class. Prof. Martinez filled a crucial gap in my education. I will be a better doctor and better thinker on justice because of her. The theoretical grounding of the class was extremely helpful for everything from my thesis to my job to my career ideas. \r\n\r\nI think that the assignments and grading were pretty mechanistic - probably due more to an adjustment to Yale than anything else, but for an upper level seminar there were low assumptions made about our skill level. For instance, I don't think we needed to review how to read an exam before the midterm. That's a minor complaint. ",
            "\u00a0This course benefitted from being a small section (25 students) led by such a stellar discussion leader. Professor Martnez was always perfectly prepared for her lessons while allowing room for class discussion to flow outside of her plan. She would always start the next lesson with anything that needed clarification and posted all of her slides online. One of the most knowledgeable and brilliant thinkers Ive had the fortune to call my teacher, she can seem intimidating but is very approachable, kind, and helpful.\r\n\r\nEach weeks readings complimented each other very well - a good balance of theoretical and case study. There were many pages each week and I struggled to keep up, but I think most others found it manageable. \r\n\r\nThe examination/grading structure was very good. 5 in-class exercises, 1 midterm, and 1 8-10 page final paper which Prof. Martnez makes you start early and peer review. Keep up with the readings, talk about the material with your friends/classmates, and youll really get a lot of out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely well-organized, with a detailed syllabus and very clear rubrics. "

        [
            "\u00a0YES! I know they don't plan to offer this course with prof. Martinez anymore but she was amazing and this course was amazing!!! If by some miracle the course is offered again, take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class as a course that is important for everyone to take regardless of major. Everyone should know about health disparities facing members of our nation and should be informed on the rampant medicalization and policing of bodies that occurs everyday through medicine as an institution of social control. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I felt that as a sociology major it greatly improved my understanding of important issues related to health and race. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Perhaps the best course I've taken at Yale, I really hope the course is taught again next year. This class will de-bunk biases you didn't even know you had and critically analyze tough questions about race and medicine. I hope Professor Martinez is able to guest teach again. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this class to another student. Not only is Professor Martinez a genius, but she's direct with her feedback and really makes you think about the weight of material at hand. Whether you're pre-med, a sociology major, er&m major, or just plain interested at all in the topic, this class is for you. Possibly one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS COURSE- it's one that will teach you lessons and open your eyes to understanding medicine and race. you will walk away from this class with major take-aways you will never forget and be able to apply to any field you are in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is important to learn this information, regardless of what you are studying. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely! If you are new to this topic, you will definitely learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class! It doesn't matter if you're studying AfAm or ER&M or if you're pre-med and studying sociology or MCDB, you will certainly learn something from this course. That's one of the best things about it, actually, I learned so much from my peers in the class because we were approaching the topic from many different perspectives. And Professor Martinez is one of the best professors I've ever had. She expects a lot from her students, and is also kind, humble, and incredibly smart. This made me excited to do the readings and come to class every week. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. But only if Professor Martinez is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if you're premed please please take this class. You need to understand the history of the profession that we both hope to go into. I truly hope that Prof. Martinez is around to teach it. ",
            "\u00a0100%. This class provided an open and engaging discussion about medicine and sociology - accessible to MCDB and ER&M majors alike. Everyone had a different perspective to offer and was welcomed into the space as an individual with worthwhile thoughts and ideas. Seriously, any class whose syllabus begins with bell hooks is one to take. Applicable and important area of study. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to other students -- the theory and case studies engaged in this course, presented under Prof. Martinez's instruction, really were perspective-shifting.  The course certainly was a highlight of my coursework in the sociology major so far. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, but only if they are willing to challenge conceptions of race and if they understand that in doing so, they will feel like outsiders when discussion race relations issues with those who do not have as much exposure to the literature and form their opinions based on hearsay or their own logical derivations. As much as I learned, I think that the next step is being able to make the material more relatable to people, especially white people, whose conceptions of race are those which ignore the fact that race is clinal and that there is more genetic variation within racial groups than between them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone, and I wish Professor Martinez was still going to be at Yale next year to offer this course. "
