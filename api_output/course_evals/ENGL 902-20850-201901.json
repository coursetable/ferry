            "\u00a0I learned how to do literary biography thematically not chronologically. ",
            "\u00a0So many new lenses through which to view Bishop's work (and not just her poetry!) that I hadn't considered before. New strategies for studying a single author/artist, and for engaging their life and archive alongside their work. More than good literature / art: useful ways of thinking about being in the world (with people, with nature, with oneself) through Bishop. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper understanding of Bishop's work, particularly her prose and letters, and learned so much about how to productively combine biographical study with critical close reading. "

        [
            "\u00a0I found many of the secondary readings unhelpful and opaque. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the organization of the syllabus: subject-appropriate considering the way Bishop thought about narrative, time, and memory, and well-suited for learning and re-learning with her work -- seeing one poem many ways, finding unlikely connections. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed when we delved into readings of particular poems, as Professor Hammer's explanations were extremely illuminating, especially when it concerned poems that I had often been exposed to but which I had not completely understood. I would have enjoyed it if we read poems in this way even more frequently. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to other students have a specific interest in 20th century poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course! I'd also recommend going in with a good bit of background knowledge (maybe some biographical detail) on Bishop, just so that you can immediately engage with the course fully. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone seeking new ways of studying literature, anyone who has ever been fascinated by the life of an author/artist, anyone who likes to look closely at writing that looks closely at things. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student that wanted to improve their biographical and critical reading and writing skills, as well as to anybody interested in modern poetry more generally. Although the level of critical engagement with Bishop's works as works of English literature was very high, I think that the course would be enjoyable to anybody that enjoys engaging with literature.
