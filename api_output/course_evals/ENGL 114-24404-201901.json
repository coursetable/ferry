            "\u00a0I learned a lot of reading analysis skills, and I also learned a lot of valuable skills for writing. I believe that I have become a more insightful and critical readr and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically read and write academic essays, especially in crafting an argumentative thesis. In particular, I learned that the best theses are ones which are specific in their scope but offer a new idea than the one provided in existing literature. This class gave me a better handle on how to put works by other authors in dialogue with my own ideas and how to distinguish between the two when writing a paper. In all, this class helped develop not only my writing skills, but my critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the big issues that you don't think are a problem in writing. Rasheed is amazing and you learn quickly that your thesis is never good enough. I thought I was doing find previously, but small issues become more evident. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the nature and applications of sound. I also learned how to conduct a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to analyze reading more closely and this helped me better understand all the texts I read. I also greatly improved on my essay writing skills and gained a lot of knowledge about music in general and in relation to other things. ",
            "\u00a0I now feel much more comfortable reading dense or philosophical essays. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the class very much and would recommend for anyone looking for a writing credit or who is interested in the topic of Sound. The professor does a great job of engaging with students and encouraging interesting discussions by nudging discussion in the right direction or suggesting key ideas that enrich the discussion even more.  This was probably one of my favorite classes taken here at Yale even though Im a very STEM-oriented person, and this was because this professor just made the whole writing experience and seminar experience that interesting and fulfilling.

            "\u00a0Strengths: The course readings were very interesting, and class discussions were always robust and exciting. I believe that the overall classroom environment was very welcoming; I felt comfortable speaking up and asking questions. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to a lot of music that I would not have experienced otherwise, like Tchaikovskys 4th symphony, Carmen, and Kendrick Lamar. It gave me new ways to understand music and sound in terms of their societal, political, and economic influence, as well as the individual effects music can have. More broadly, a strength this course has is helping me to draw out and explicate the complexities in everything. That being said, I did find many of the readings of the course uninteresting and uninformative, especially some of the more abstract and theoretical pieces. I also wish we focused more on the writing process in class, getting more explicit advice as to what makes a paper good. ",
            "\u00a0If you decide to take part in the conversation you get to have interesting discussions with your peers with professor commentary as well. Almost just becomes a discussion on the readings and elsewhere. If you have some background on musical things may be somewhat helpful but definitely not necessary. Sound and music become intertwined in a discussion that spans the evolution of sound and music in our western culture. Its not a music history course but focuses a lot more on theorists on what music means and what it can do to the communities the music is part of. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Amazing teacher and extremely well chosen course material.\r\nWeaknesses: While I always got great feedback on what I should revise, I did not always receive feedback on HOW I should make the necessary changes. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should include some learning of music sheets and music notes and how they work in order to make participation and understanding easier. ",
            "\u00a0The conversation tended not to get very deep, but the material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The professor also does a great job of clarifying complex ideas in assigned readings and communicating the essence of what they mean while also teaching us how to come to similar conclusions. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! I had so much fun with all of the readings and essays, and I loved the classroom environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It is a good introduction to humanities and to writing, and it focuses on a topic most people have some level of experience with. It helps with learning the complexities of sound and music as well as how to become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Rasheed is great and the conversations very interesting if you choose to take part. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. Prof Tazudeen is good at facilitating class discussions and his choice of readings are varied, interesting, and (usually) not too difficult. However, if the application of the reading material (which focus more on theories of sound, roles sound/music play in politics/culture, etc) to music itself is what you're most interested in, you might be disappointed. Discussions are rarely about the music itself, and any readings on the syllabus that might engage with that are the first ones to get cut (this past semester, we never read/discussed works by Bartok, Steve Reich, St. Vincent, Schoenberg, or even Kendrick Lamar). \r\nUnfortunately, if you're looking to improve your writing, Prof Tazudeen isn't always much help. He cares about his students and is more than happy to talk to you during office hours or after class, but his essay feedback can often feel like canned responses. He won't touch or comment about your prose or writing style and only gives overarching suggestions for your writing (e.g. connecting ideas, making stronger claims, deepening textual analysis). However, it was frustrating running in the same few comments on every essay. Does this mean I probably didn't do a good job of following his advice? Yeah, probably. But even after visiting office hours, discussing how to improve my writing in the ways he suggested, and going through with his suggestions, his final essay comments would always just be that I didn't do enough of a certain thing. He would never explain exactly why or how I could have done better. If you really want to improve your writing and recieve thorough feedback, you'd probably be better off taking ENGL 120 or some other course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Tazudeen is a great teacher and is FANTASTIC at facilitating and organizing discussion about sound and just about anything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it has really interesting topics and is a fun way to improve essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a s super fun and stimulating writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes "
