            "\u00a0I became much better at revising short stories and was exposed to a variety of different styles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about what makes a good story and about what I like about my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0It's an advanced fiction workshop. You will certainly become a better writer, reader, and critic, but it's also not functionally different from what you expect from an advanced fiction workshop -- and your experience depends a lot on your classmates. One unique aspect is the three draft structure -- instead of submitting two different stories, you revise one story twice (so three drafts total). I definitely learned a lot about revision, about sticking with a story for a long time, and about polishing work past the first draft. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in how to develop a story through multiple drafts -- including what to look for and common edits that can be used for future writing. My writing skills in general were improved, as was my ability to write and conceptualize fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I started to feel more comfortable with myself as a writer and learned more about how I work best in a workshop environment. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The workshops were nearly perfect. They were well-managed, productive, and enjoyable. I wish, though, that we had more consistently made time to discuss non-student stories; these were all interesting, but we usually had to gloss over them. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fabulous course. I love the concept of working on just a single story; by the end of the course, every student in the class had brought in something really well developed. It works. The workshop was awesome, and Michael is one of the kindest and most helpful instructors I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class, but your experience really does depend on your classmates and whether you click with Michael -- like all creative writing professors, he's really helpful for some people and not quite as helpful for others. I definitely became a stronger writer, and got the feedback I needed to effectively tweak my story. This workshop is based primarily around revision -- you do three drafts of the same story -- which I experienced as a strength, since I needed to learn how to revise. I really enjoyed the focus on improving one story over a long period of time rather than dashing two or three off very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well designed. I loved getting to read and comment on multiple versions of each person's story. The only thing (not sure this could be implemented) is that some people were clearly done with their stories by the second draft, and I feel like they (and the class) would have benefited more from seeing a first draft of a new story for those people in the third round of comments. It would be very hard to separate the class in that way though, and I think most people really benefited from having three versions of their stories read. It's a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The three draft structure was interesting but also a little onerous. I think it actually wasn't that helpful for me, just because the turnaround felt really quick between drafts. Michael is the highlight of this course by far and everyone should take this class just to learn from him. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Michael is a one-of-a-kind instructor: kind, encouraging, but also capable of giving sharp and apt criticism on pieces. If you get into this course, take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student interested in writing fiction seriously. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are serious about writing fiction (or serious about trying it), then take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend if you're fairly serious about fiction writing, especially if you want to get better at revising/editing. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to take this course for its relatively unorthodox format, which reframes the craft of writing as the craft of rewriting. Such a reframing is essential, but to actually teach rewriting within the timeframe of a single semester is challenging for a few reasons. I'm not sure how to phrase this, but a semester is both too short and too long. Too short in that, by the time we hit the third draft, most people clearly just needed to put their stories away for a long time and let them mellow, see them with fresh eyes in a few months' time, etc. Too long in that you can do a lot of things in one semester, and writing three drafts of one piece ultimately doesn't feel that \"productive.\" I almost wish that the workshop approached rewriting in multiple ways in order to vary our senses of what rewriting might be - i.e. having students bring in old work for revision /as well as/ writing a new piece that instigates a chain of drafts; having students rework sentences, paragraphs, pieces of flash fiction as exercises rather than for \"workshop\" per se. \r\n\r\nUltimately the only thing that improves one's writing is writing, so a writing course where /you don't write that much/ is, I think, limited in scope of improvement.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was fortunate enough to encounter an excellent group of writers and readers whose criticism was generally genuinely helpful and well-taken. Like any workshop, this workshop hinges on the characters one encounters within. I don't know what my experience would have been like with a different group of people! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Absolutely take this class. The opportunity to work with other fiction writers is incredible and you learn so much from reading and editing their work and having them read and edit yours. Michael is great! It's a wonderful class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Just know that it takes a lot of time and effort to get a lot out of this class, since it all depends on how much time you put into your drafts. "
