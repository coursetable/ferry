            "\u00a0I learned about the problems plaguing our food and agriculture systems, especially in relation to the shortcomings of the farm bill, and the right to food for the poorer sectors of our country. The research paper was also very helpful in learning how to research, find credible sources, and structure a well crafted argument for 8-10 pages. ",
            "\u00a0I did not develop any new writing skills which is unfortunate considering this is why I took the course. I did, however learn a lot about agricultural policy in the US. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned to produce a cogent argument, cite my evidence properly, and produce a conclusion that tackles the greater \"What if?\" question of my essay rather than summarizing the thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to write persuasive arguments and analyze articles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write an essay in a college setting. I learned how to do research for a large research paper, utilize the resources here at Yale, and give a public speaking presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding in forming an arguable thesis, creating an argument using the ICE method, and how to do proper research about a topic. ",
            "\u00a0How to conduct proper research and use certain techniques to identify and cite academic sources! ",
            "\u00a0I learned what it takes to write a paper at the college level.  I also learned how to properly edit the grammar and more importantly the content of a paper ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the American food system, as well as many writing skills and presenting skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better word things and better structure things. I also learned that I need to start papers much earlier to do well in this class. I learned so much about the farm bill. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my argumentative writing skills and my ability to form nuanced opinions on couples topics. "

            "\u00a0I think the readings should be more evenly distributed throughout the course rather than going through the whole house packet in a span of about a week. Not only will this be less pressure, but I think everybody would read a lot more of the assignments and be able to fully appreciate them if they were not all clumped together. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength in this course is the topic and the TED talk component. The topic is interesting and the final TED talk serves as a interesting way to present research to the rest of the class. The biggest weakness of the course was the professor. Professor Stuart never gave me helpful critiques for my writing and often took points off of assignments because \"nothing is ever perfect.\" I felt like this class was let down by the outdated syllabus and Professor Stuart's inability to guide a discussion in such a way that it poses genuinely interesting questions, making the small, seminar-style class feel like jumping through hoops for the sake of a grade, rather than learning for the sake of understanding and personal fulfillment. ",
            "\u00a0I never knew how controversial food justice could be until I joined this course. I was forced to consider the practicality of administering food legislation and food programs as well as their ethical implications. The strength of this class was that it taught students empathy which I think is a necessary quality for any good writer, and a quality that is lacking under this administration. We learned how to write a Yale worthy essay by appealing to the logos and ethos of readers, and now we can relate to our prospective audience; legislators. Students will leave this class understanding what and A paper is at a top university, but more importantly, as future leaders, politicians, economists, entrepreneurs, doctors, etc, we now have the power of the written word to advocate for the resources we need to protect our most vulnerable citizens. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and easy to participate in. However, there is a lot of material to read and get through, especially early on. ",
            "\u00a0There was not much I would change about the class. It was interesting material, well-designed, and helpful. I feel like I learned more in this class than any other I have taken this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course did a great job in immersing the students in the topic of Food Policy and the Farm Bill, through the readings assigned and discussions in class. The blog posts helped me put more thoughts into the readings. I think the course could be improved by better introducing the first two papers when assigned. I especially thought we were crammed for time in the second research paper and did not think I had a good idea of what the paper was about near the deadline. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging and discussion oriented and is very informative. The readings are very interesting, and the paper topics were interesting as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I love Dr. Stuart. She is a very kind and enthusiastic person. Although I hated all the deadlines, they did help me somewhat. I also liked the draft structure it allowed me to improve my writing before the final copy. I also thought that when the class read my draft they gave helpful feedback. \r\nWeaknesses: This course had quite a bit of work. The reading could be skimmed easily (or not read). However, there were a lot of deadlines for things that didnt allow me to work with my creative flow. I felt like I met with the Professor a lot and it didnt necessarily improve my writing as I ended up with the same grades. There were some days where I felt like classtime was a waste of time, but that was mostly at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading at some points in the beginning. "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to a student with prior interest in the food infrastructure of America because without this background knowledge, the in class conversations are much less interesting and easy to take part in. However, it is interesting to learn about these problems regardless, and we read some interesting texts as well as watching some great films. ",
            "\u00a0No. I would not. I feel like this course is not well designed and needs restructuring (possibly under a different professor) in order to make it a better English seminar. This class was more work than it should have been, and almost all of the work was meaningless busy-work. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to other students, in fact I already have. The workload is not too strenuous and their are many opportunities to attend office hours to receive feedback and continue improving your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class because it is unique in its ability to get students involved. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely, the material is interesting, and it is a good class that will teach you how to write and speak, two major skills in today's world. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. In this class, I learned a lot about writing and structuring essays. In addition, I gained greater knowledge about an important issue in the US that often goes unnoticed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, intriguing course that will open up the realities of the food process in the agricultural industry. Recieve proper information and insight on food sustainability and practices in America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  For sure ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you have any interest in the food system or nutrition, this is the course for you. I learned so much about writing and the food system and now feel like I could go give a speech on the problems with our food system and how to fix it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Although I didnt do super well, I did decently. The work was manageable even though it was a bit much. I felt like I learned a lot. And I enjoyed the research paper and the ted talk even though it was a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good course if you are passionate about/ interested in food and environmental legislation in the US. "
