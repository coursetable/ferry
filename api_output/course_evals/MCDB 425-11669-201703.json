            "\u00a0We read a lot of papers and had to write a research paper summary essay about once/2 weeks. Gained a lot of paper reading experience and summary skills. It was very refreshing to learn from the original primary research papers. We were also introduced to a lot of new genetics techniques like GWAS. "

            "\u00a0The undergrads were placed together in one section, and there were only 6 of us, so it was really nice and we had very engaging discussions with our TAs who were extremely knowledgeable. Since each lecture was taught by a different professor, the level of engagement per lecture differed, and you won't get to know one person specifically very well. Having said that it is still a really good upper level elective. It was chill but you also learn a decent amount of stuff. "

            "\u00a0Take it! You get however much effort you put in. You will really improve your paper reading skills after this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great class and you have a lot of freedom to engage in the material. The only downside of taking the class as an undergrad is that you are undoubtedly less versed in experimental details and specific topic knowledge which can bite you when it comes to the semi-weekly THQs. The instructor told us he takes mercy on undergraduates since there are so few in the class so hopefully you will be okay. A couple of the TAs are particularly great and knowledgeable and the discussions are actually really fun and you learn a lot if you prepare well ahead of them. I would take it, especially if you're MB&B. "
