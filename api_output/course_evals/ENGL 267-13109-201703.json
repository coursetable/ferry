            "\u00a0I developed an ability to compare texts, as these are all generally on the same theme. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the minor writers and artists of the Victorian period, such as the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood and several novelists who are usually excluded from the major canon. ",
            "\u00a0Research ability; engaging with literary criticism; drawing connections across texts and reading texts in conversation with one another; a greater understanding of Victorian literature and literary movements as reflections of the era and continuations of older intellectual traditions ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much richer understanding of the history of representations of love and desire in the western canon, and the ways in which these representations influence and react to one another. I learned a surprisingly large amount about art history in relation to literature as well, which was fascinating and not something I've gotten the chance to learn in other English courses. I also got better at incorporating critical scholarship into my writing, which was very helpful. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the instructor's passion for the course. Also, an accessible and universal theme. No weakness. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the interdisciplinary nature of the course, which touched on art as well as literature and combined the two disciplines in a refreshing way. The seminar usually began with a lecture by Prof. Levine, followed by really great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0So good overall! I would like more novels and major works next time. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus of this course was overall very engaging; I appreciated Professor Levine's efforts to include less-read texts and look beyond the traditional Victorian canon. The workload was consistently manageable and the assignments well-paced. While the historical material presented at the beginning of the class was always interesting but sometimes cut into discussion of the text. Perhaps some of this material could be abbreviated or be posted to Canvas before class to make more time for discussion. Overall, the course did a good job in developing themes across the texts though perhaps more focus could have been on the texts building on each other throughout the class rather than a discussion at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciate that the course was structured so that almost every class began with a period in which Professor Levine contextualized each work and author for us with background information/biography/historical detail. I can't tell you how much this enhances my ability to understand and appreciate a text or work of art, but is left out in so many classes, I suppose on the assumption that we are already familiar with this information or should have sought it on our own. I loved knowing more about the authors and movements we were discussing. I thought the reading load was perfect--manageable and interesting--and the course seemed to follow a logical progression of materials and themes. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fantastic class, and definitely one of the best I've gotten the chance to take at Yale. One of my favorite things about the course was the breadth of material that we encountered, and the fact that we got to read lots of not particularly \"major\" works like \"The Doctor's Wife\" or Lizzie Siddal's poetry, or Oscar Wilde's lesser known essays. Not only were these wonderful to read and discuss, but they are also works that I don't think I would have ever found otherwise. Also, I really appreciated the degree to which we discussed the lives of the authors and their historical contexts, and the fact that we were encouraged to relate these contexts to the works themselves, which is also pretty rare in English courses and was very refreshing. I'm really trying to think of a weakness of this course but I can't come up with any. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Good class if you like this style of literature. A few big essays, some reading responses, the usual stuff. Make sure to do the reading, we open class with personal opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class was a fantastic introduction to the minor writers and artists of the Victorian Era, with a strong emphasis on art as well as literature of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Especially if you're an English major looking for an off-the-beaten-path way to satisfy the pre-1900 requirement, this is a great class! A lot of interesting material you're unlikely to encounter elsewhere, manageable workload, and Professor Levine's sincere enthusiasm for the material makes the course a lot of fun. The art gallery visits were stellar and tbh getting to see the YUAG's secret Botticelli up-close and personal was worth the proverbial price of admission. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The material is wonderful (and often equal parts moving, eerie, and erotic), Professor Levine is a delight, and the course made me think so much deeper not only about notions of love and desire in the Victorian era, but in general. The poems and stories made me feel more deeply connected to the variety and beauty and difficulty of the human experience of love. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even to a non-English major. The course is a lot of fun and never takes itself over-seriously, the readings are fantastic and unexpected, and Professor Levine is excellent at balancing lecture and discussion time and keeping discussions interesting and on track.
