            "\u00a0I learned about the main strains of political philosophy from the time of Thomas Hobbes to the mid-20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Close analysis to each work of political philosophy. Especially, comparison among different works. ",
            "\u00a0DS guides you through a large body of important texts with an organized structure. In the course, you learn a large amount in a remarkable period of time and gives you a great foundation for in-depth study in the humanities later in your college career. A fantastic overview of the major highlights of western thought. ",
            "\u00a0How to parse a historical text and discuss relevant passages ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton by reading political philosophy and really honed my views on politics and philosophy. I also improved dramatically as a writer. "

            "\u00a0The content of the course is great in itself, but it was not clearly organized or taught. The texts had many overlapping themes and ideas, but the connections and differences between the ideas of the different thinkers were not made clear. ",
            "\u00a0One concern I had was that the course assigns no feminist readings. I think they should include more female thinkers like Mary Wollstonecraft. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great as a \"crash course\" of the western canon. However, due to the huge range of material covered, there isn't enough time to go into the works in depth. It's great for exposing you to different ideas; if there's an author you find very interesting, then you should look into their work in more depth afterwards.\r\n\r\nAlso, the three tracks of DS don't intertwine as much as it may sound (or at least as I expected). They are essentially three separate courses. While they may reference each other occasionally, and sometimes an author that overlaps, there isn't too much interdisciplinary analysis (i.e. , looking into the historical context of a philosophical or literary movement). Sometimes, the timeframes of the works across the tracks fall out of sync. However, this would probably a lot more work, and the tracks will likely give you enough to make these kinds of analysis on your own if you choose. ",
            "\u00a0The texts were great and I appreciated the way discussion was free-form ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great syllabus and great students. I think professors could do more to facilitate discussion in the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to get a good foundation in the of \"modern\" political science, then this course will be satisfying. It will also enable you to make more informed choices about political theory courses later in your academic career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is am amazing opportunity to read most of the basic works of Western political philosophy that hold their importance even today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It does an incredible job teaching you a lot over a short period of time. It gives you a huge library of knowledge for analyzing present day works, and enables you to recognize allusions, traditions, and references you could only know by reading and connecting all the texts that are conveniently and cleanly presented to you on the syllabus. Just be prepared to devote a lot of time and energy to the course: it is a lot of reading and writing compared to other Yale courses. ",
