            "\u00a0This was the most incredible class I have ever taken at Yale. We thought hard about writing as an act -- the social position of the writer, how you write for a public, how you write towards change, how you imagine possible futures -- and all became really good friends. It was a radical and revolutionary and deeply loving space and I'll forever miss it. Our class is even continuing to work together past the semester! Ugh. I could gush forever. I think, above all, I learned to think about possibilities beyond the present. ",
            "\u00a0how to challenge myself to write stronger, clearer, more creative pieces + the vision for the writing i want to do and the world i want to live in ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conceptualize the stakes of the work I do. I realized the power that writing can have and the ways in which I can learn to harness it. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course I've taken at Yale (and I'm a senior). It helped me find beauty and freedom in writing again; helped me rediscover the powerful potential that the form of nonfiction writing has to be a  generator of new truths, new paradigms, and a better world. The texts we were exposed to in this class modeled this for me, and they inspired me to write in a more original, creative way than I've ever written before. I also learned to peer-edit and to write collaboratively, which I found to be really rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Wow! Hard to summarize in this way. We did some deep deep thinking about poverty, race, violence, sexual assault, climate change, and writing. We talked a lot about what it means to write about these things we feel so passionately and urgently about. Then we put that to practice by working as a collective and creating an incredibly beautiful collaborative book (?!) as our final project. It was a little insane how good this class was. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about myself as a writer, myself in the classroom, myself in the world. We as a class prioritized pushing our imaginations to envision new ways of engaging with academia and public intellectualism. It was incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way that I viewed writing, allowing me to combine the personal and political, the literary and the academic, and reality and imagination. The papers demanded that we write together and think critically but also constructively ",
            "\u00a0I grew exponentially as a writer and thinker with this class. I gained confidence that I can be a writer by my own definition and not by Yale's definition, which was something that I had lost almost immediately after coming to school as a freshman (I'm now a junior). Beyond the coursework that we completed, I learned, from my classmates and from Professor Mirakhor, how to really and truly make a seminar feel collaborative, mutually supportive and deeply compassionate we created a  collective! "

            "\u00a0The reading list was incredible, and we were consistently encouraged to take control of our education and do beautiful, imaginative work. So good!!! ",
            "\u00a0amazing class! would not change a thing! ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is incredible; I don't know which other courses would have exposed me to some of the amazing texts we read for this class. We read nonfiction about many different topics (climate change, police brutality, racial (in)justice and gender politics) but in such a way that the texts flowed into each other and we could see the connections between these topics and the ways that people write about them. ",
            "\u00a0I have never had a class like this in my life. We thought so much about the confines of the classroom, of being in the academy, at Yale, how we could rebel against some of the learning we were supposed to be doing. It was an extremely special group of people that Im sure could never be recreated in a future year but we were always having dinner or breakfast all together, continue to have an active group chat, etc. It was truly rare. \r\nHonestly my only critiques are that 1) Im not sure what I got out of the book review project and 2) maybe we couldve spent a little less time on organizational matters at the beginning of classI was so eager to get to our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The topics you cover are amazing, but the other people in the class really made it strong, to be in a class where people are invested in creating new possibilities for writing ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class without hesitation! This class totally consumed and transformed my semester. I loved reading works of \"public writing\" (an admittedly nebulous category) for both content and style and really felt like I was being pushed to think carefully and inventively each week. Also, Professor Mirakhor is AMAZING. She strikes this incredible balance of being really tough and really benevolent and generous at the same time. She was so committed to our class and to learning as a shared project, and really pushed us to think about what we were learning as something intimately tied to who and how we want to be in the world (a priority that's often in desperately short supply among professors at Yale). I get emotional thinking about how extraordinary her class was. If you get the chance to learn with her please go for it!!!!! I promise you won't regret it. Hers was easily one of the best and most transformative classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would! This class, quite literally, changed my life. Anyone interested in thinking or writing or helping the world should consider taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Take this class it will change how you think about writing, the role of public intellectuals, and your personal voice. It will deeply enrich you as a person more than any other course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0yes! take this class! it will change your writing and your life! ",
            "\u00a01000% yes, but only if you're prepared for one of the most incredible and difficult (in the best way) courses of your life. If you're not ready to give a shit with your entire body, do not take this course. Someone else will and their life will be better for it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class, for the love of God. You'll be pushed to write and think in ways you haven't before, and if things go right, you'll be part of one of the most supportive and generative classroom environments imaginable. ",
            "\u00a0If you feel urgency about the world going to pieces, if you have radical politics, if you care about creating writing and art, if you want to put ideas into practice, if youre willing to let go of your notions of individual competitiveness and self importancewithout a doubt, do it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is amazing. Professor Mirakhor is very giving of her time and attention, and allowed the class to pursue the questions most interesting to us. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking to change their writing and perspectives, and who wants to be a part of imagining a better world, even in a university environment ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Anyone should leap at the chance to be in this course setting with Professor Mirakhor, especially if your classmates are as committed to making this class feel like a collective as mine were. This class was absolutely life-changing. I came away with a radically different perspective on what it means to be a writer and thinker in the world we live in today, and as I said above, trust that I can be a writer even if my writing doesn't look like the kind typically \"sanctioned\" by Yale.
