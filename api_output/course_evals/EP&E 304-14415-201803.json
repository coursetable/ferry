            "\u00a0The course helped introduce students to a wide variety of contemporary policy issues. Course was more of a survey of important problems -- such as inequality, automation, campaign finance, threats to democracy -- but did not offer solid conclusions about any of these topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different issues that all relate to EPE. It was cool to be able to learn about different things that I might not otherwise get the chance to take a whole class on, like money in politics, and the politics of the environment. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a very wide range of topics from multiple different angles. We would cover a new issue every week, e.g. human rights, or military interventions, or climate change. ",
            "\u00a0A decent understanding of several topics in ethics, politics, and economics. ",
            "\u00a0Broad course overview of EPE related topics ",
            "\u00a0The ability to analyze opposing arguments and synthesize them into one comprehensive argument, an excellent introduction to a wide range of interesting topics ranging from police brutality to the right to protect and contemporary scholars often overlooked in EP&E. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a wide-ranging understanding of the viewpoints from which we approached modern issues: namely, EP&E. Weighing between different arguments and doing a ton of readings developed my critical thinking and especially my ability to go through many pages efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be quite helpful, not only in thinking about specific frameworks unique to the EPE department, but also in building my confidence as an EPE major.  It's more of a course for packaging and synthesizing all of the things we've been trained to think about through our coursework, things like efficiency tradeoffs, equity considerations, etc.  Not sure that I came away with a ton of new knowledge per se, but it definitely was invigorating to stop and reflect on the things I've learned over 3 years and to start applying those concepts to the most pressing problems of our day.  A great capstone. "

            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were Professor Rosenbluth's super kind/warm teaching style and exposure to some of the most important problems in the world today. Class definitely helped to motivate undergrads at Yale to care about intractable issues like climate change and democratic threats. Plus, Professor Rosenbluth is so kind toward her students that you feel grateful for such a relaxed learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0The course is definitely fun and the topics are wide and interesting so there's something for everyone. Professor Rosenbluth got guest speakers to come in for multiple seminars, which was always great because we got to pick their minds on important topics. Professor Rosenbluth is also a great seminar facilitator and cares deeply about her students personally, remembers all of our names and interests, etc. However because the syllabus is so broad you never get very much insight into any one particular topic (can you just spend one seminar on climate change?), which I felt was a bit of a waste. I would not take this class if I was a senior. Might be helpful if you are a junior thinking about possible senior thesis topics. There are one single space paged reading responses for every week which I tend not to find very productive either. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers were largely excellent, and Prof. Rosenbluth is a brilliant and capable instructor. I wish that the reading has been less extensive--when it's that much, students often don't do it. I also didn't like the option of picking 4 readings out of a list; it meant students weren't all on the same page when we went to discussion. Picking readings in a more focused and limited way would be good. But overall, I did enjoy the course. ",
            "\u00a0Could be more organized/tailored towards one subject, but a very engaging course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the wide range of topics, the guest lecturers and weekly reading responses, which were graded for completion. W ",
            "\u00a0The course at times needs to slow down and focus on one issue. We moved by at a rate that sometimes prevented us from getting deeper into the course material. ",
            "\u00a0It was great that we covered a different topic each week, and having guests once in a while was also really interesting and informative. Professor Rosenbluth is a fantastic professor who really cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0It will never be a \"great\" Yale course in the way it is structuredthe very nature of switching topics every couple of weeks, grappling with new guest speakers ,etc. is not conducive to super deep intellectual dives.  In some ways this is also its strength.  The guest speakers were all super interesting (makes senseProfessor Rosenbluth is cool, so she has cool friends), and I liked applying our frameworks to multiple different case studies/issues.  Perhaps the class would feel a little more like a deep dive if we did some sort of parallel structure, with part of each class devoted to a detailed review of a topic in one of our \"Classics of EPE\" texts and then applying those concepts to a specific case for the remainder of the course?  I don't really want it to be something where the first couple of weeks are frameworks and the rest are applications (because those classes likewise start to feel intellectually skimpy), but maybe mixing in some more detailed readings/discussion on philosophical/political/economic questions throughout the course would be helpful.  One of my favorite sessions was week 9, where we discussed historical frameworks for economic development (e.g. ISI, etc.) and then applied those concepts to contemporary topics on immigration and global trade.

            "\u00a0I'd only recommend this course if you are a social sciences student with little exposure to the key policy debates happening today. To be clear -- this a a survey course, and you will not come away with any solid conclusions. If you'd like an introduction to political topics that you'd like to learn more about, then this is a nice way to read some of the seminal pieces on them. \r\n\r\nIt would have been very helpful to have a consistent set of themes or discussion procedures used throughout the weeks. The aim of the course was to talk about the ethical, political, and economic aspects of each of the raised issues. But, we often didn't cover any of the lenses and the discussion seemed kind of aimless at many points. Maybe the first few weeks should include foundational readings in political science, political theory, and micro theory so students have a common vocabulary to use throughout the course. I'm just not sure what I solidly learned by the end of the course. But this was the first time the course was offered, so it can definitely be improved in the future ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, for several reasons: a) the opportunity to take a class with Professor Rosenbluth, who is a great professor b) Professor Rosenbluth brought in a lot of guest speakers who were very interesting to meet, and the discussions were well facilitated c) discussion was very well-led in general d) It gave me the chance to learn about a lot of different things ",

            "\u00a0YES!! Wonderful class ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in EP&E or enrolled in EP&E YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS CLASS. It brings together all the pillars of the major with a Professor whose knowledge and passion facilitate tremendous amounts of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if you aren't in the major, it is interesting to write a final project at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it was a great course to teach students to think in a more interdisciplinary manner. In this way, it's a great course for both sophomores in the major and seniors in the major. Also, Professor Rosenbluth is a fantastic professor who is very knowledgeable and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Professor Rosenbluth is great (I'd recommend any class with her), and it was nice to have a sort of \"capstone\" course for the EPE major that nicely tied everything together (or at least gave me space to review some of things we've been learning for 2-3 years). "
