            "\u00a0Fantastic skills in speaking, reading, writing in Mandarin ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of more advanced grammatical structures, especially more formal vocabulary and syntax for written Chinese. I also gained a lot of practice speaking in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated that CHNS 140 was much more culturally focused in content; I feel like I learned a lot more about Chinese culture than I have ever before in my past of studying Chinese. "

            "\u00a0Daily practice and quizzes help you keep on top of the material, but the presentations were too frequent and not that helpful. Also, some weeks would be ok, but other weeks would have a presentation, written test, and oral test all on top of your regular daily in-class quizzes, outside online QUIA exercsies,(basically quizzes), and dictations. This made some weeks very difficult because of just how much you had for the course, let alone all your other courses. Maybe there could be a way to better spread out the large assessments? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: constant practice, constant and almost immediate feedback, lots of material to learn, pacing is rigorous but effective (we neither spend too little nor too much time on anything), in terms of actual teaching both professors are phenomenal. I wish I could have them again in a higher-level Chinese course.\r\nWeaknesses: the final video project (in pairs) seemed unnecessary. I did not see the educational value of it. We had to spend more time making and editing the video than actually filming it. It felt like we did the final video project for no other reason than for the professors to say that they had a project in their course. There is absolutely nothing wrong with sticking to the basics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the consistent engagement with the texts and the daily quizzes. Weakness that could be improved is less essays and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nConstant work means an extreme amount of immersion in the course, which really benefits the learning aspect. Everyone also loves the Chinese teachers, so even with the high amount of work, morale remains at surprisingly healthy levels. Strong engagement in classroom.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWe could perhaps use more quizzes about grammar, to help us prepare for the written tests. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the daily/weekly schedule provided by the instructors is easy to predict and follow, so students always know how to prepare for the next day's class or the upcoming week. The instructors are also very energetic and accessible and helpful. Another strength is that the class sizes are very small, allowing lots of conversation and speaking practice to happen every day. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include clear instruction, well planned and scheduled syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that because it's everyday, you are always practicing you're Chinese, so progress is inevitable. The class is also very structured, and the structure is repeated for each of the nine lessons so you know exactly what to expect and can plan in advance. \r\nThe one weakness is that  because it's everyday, it can be hard to be super interested all the time, but  and  were as engaging as they could be.
