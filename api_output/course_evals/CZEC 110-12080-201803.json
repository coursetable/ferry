            "\u00a0Karen Von Kunes is a brilliant professor of the Czech language, and this can be seen through simple research of her accomplishments. She emulates the Czech personality well - reasonable, rational and very sweet. I have picked up the rather difficult language of Czech quicker than I expected I would as the Slavic language is not easy, but it is beautiful when it is well taught. I have already built many foundations and structures of the language through speaking, reading, and writing and I can comprehend a rather large amount of it. ",
            "\u00a0You will gain a strong foundation in the basics of Czech grammar and begin to understand short Czech readings. ",
            "\u00a0Really good introduction to Czech - good foundation for grammar. Didn't learn too much vocabulary but I think that comes in L2 ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the czech language. Mostly basic grammar skills and vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0Learned present, past, and future tenses for verbs. Also learned singular declensions for nouns and adjectives. ",

            "\u00a0Taught as a near-perfect pace, the approach to teaching the foundations of the language is well done, and each lesson works into the next very fluidly. You can tell Professor Kunes has perfected the teaching of the Czech language. ",
            "\u00a0KvK is a great teacher! I wish we did a bit more small group activities and watched more films - it really helps me to hear people speak a language when I'm learning, so I wish we had done a bit more of watching Czech news or something. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Very fun and engaging ",

            "\u00a0If you want to spend every morning with a unique and renounced professor, then yes. It is an amazing course taught by an incredible professor. The Slavic language of Czech is beautiful, and this class has aspired me to look to Eastern Europe for graduate school opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Def take it. KvK is really funny and is very understanding - Czech is pretty complex grammar wise, but she's great at judging where the class is and slowing down if we need it. ",
