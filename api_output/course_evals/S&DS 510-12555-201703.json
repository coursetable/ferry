            "\u00a0The class is great in getting your feet wet with programming. The class really sped up in the middle and spent a lot of time using loops. Knowing what I know now, I'm not sure if loops are a high enough priority to spend so much time on in this short class and so early in the course too. I think spending more time on apply functions and learning dplyr would have been more useful. I also didn't think spending class time working on problems together was very useful. That could have been done in office hours/discussion sections. I would have appreciated learning from Jay and doing a quick practice problem on our own or in groups, but not the entire class period. ",
            "\u00a0The pacing of the course was a bit fast at the end. The skills we were developing were very useful. I would have liked to have had more opportunities to practice them. I enjoyed the format of the class. I was nice to practice the skills with others and learn as a team. However, I would have preferred a bit more guidance through the in-class examples. ",
            "\u00a0For such a short course, it started off somewhat slowly. I would condense the first couple weeks into the first class after shopping period. \r\n\r\nThe course provided exactly what it said it would: a concise intro to the concepts needed to use R, so that I was able to continue using R for assignments in my statistics class I was taking concurrently.

I would recommend the course to another student, but would stress that they block off enough time to adequately prepare for class and complete the homework exercises. ",
