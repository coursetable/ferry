            "\u00a0I learned much more about Leibniz and how to better approach his work. It gave me a greater appreciation for his thought and how he interacted with other thinkers (early modern and before). "

            "\u00a0Strengths: we covered a wide range of Leibniz's writings and we spent time talking through some very unclear areas. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a few students dominated the class discussion. I wish professors were more aware of how this negatively affects the experiences of other students in the class. Firstly, these students rushed to answer every question (even easier questions that other students may have felt more comfortable engaging) and when another student made a comment they seemed to rush to tear their point apart without looking for any point of agreement. This made many students, like me, reluctant to speak up more. Secondly, this makes it harder to get a good grasp of Leibniz's thought. So many students were talking and we seemed to spend a long time on their points when I wanted to hear more about the main positions on different topics in Leibniz based on those who have a better grasp of his overall thought and writings. I think more lecture would have helped here. More lecture seems like it could have set up more background on Leibniz so that (maybe) we covered more and had a better bird's eye to discuss things. Perhaps even just good lecture notes that we all read before class would have helped. This would have gotten people more on the same page prior to class. Without this, I came into class not knowing where we were going (even with emails indicating which readings to focus on) and the more confident students seemed to set the agenda for the class. Maybe I should have just adapted to this but it seems like a deficiency in a class if the method of teaching is only conducive to such a specific learning style. "
