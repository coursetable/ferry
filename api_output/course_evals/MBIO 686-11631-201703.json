            "\u00a0The variety of topics covered was good. It allowed everyone in the class to learn something new, regardless of their background. The variety of professors teaching ensured that the teacher knew the field in detail. I feel more connected to the department as a result of taking this class. The structure of the class (lecture on day 1 and paper discussion on day 2) was a good balance between breadth and depth.\r\n\r\nI would eliminate or dramatically change the written summary of the paper. It effectively gave us one fewer day to read the paper, which combined with late posting of papers to become a source of stress and late nights. Additionally, we rarely received feedback on our summaries, so I do not feel I benefited significantly from writing them. \r\n\r\nLack of feedback on progress during the course is another weakness. Perhaps instead of answering a question for each week during the final, a similar style question could be given for students to answer the week following the class. The professor who wrote the question grades it and returns it with feedback, so that students have a better idea of how they are doing in the course. Then, the final could be to write a mini-review on one of the topics covered during the class. ",
            "\u00a0I love the fact that this course is in the seminar form while experts from different fields can give us different insights.\r\n\r\nI hope the slides for each lecture can be uploaded beforehand so that we may take notes on the slides instead of copying everything from the slides.\r\nI wish I would receive some feedback on my reading responses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course: Different lecturers every week talking about what they know best was great. I also enjoyed the lecture and discussion format.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The paper discussions could be hit or miss. I think it was best when we all volunteer to talk about figures or insights as opposed to going around the table or being called on. It made for a more lively conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Would be helpful if papers were posted a week in advance\r\n\r\nWeekly paper summaries and the long end-of-semester final could be replaced by weekly short answer questions (in the same or similar style as the final) from the lecturer of the week. \r\n\r\nMore professor feedback for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The papers should be posted earlier. Additionally,I wish that the questions that the instructor asked us would become available after they taught their session, and graded by the end of the next week, so that there isn't so much work piling up by the end of the semester. Also, feedback on the summaries would have been useful. "
