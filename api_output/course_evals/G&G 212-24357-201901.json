            "\u00a0The most definite skills I gained were the ones learned on the Spring Break trip, so aspects of geological mapping like taking a strike and dip, making a cross section, etc. Besides that, we covered isostasy, reading and interpreting paleomagnetic data, calculating age of seafloor based on temperature and depth. I will definitely remember that crust has a density of 2.8 and mantle has a density of 3.3, besides that the concepts are a little bit fuzzy. The lectures weren't good at tying everything together and giving me a sense of what information was really important, so I didn't retain much of it. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Evan's teaching philosophy seems to be that short-term memorization shouldn't be necessary for the course. However, I think if we had some quizzes or if the problem sets were more definition-based, it would've made the class and field trip more enjoyable. I found this to be a particular issue during the field trip; because we weren't familiar with the geological vocabulary, it was difficult to understand the concepts being explained to us. I think this also would've made the paper-writing process easier. Overall, though, the class never felt too long and I enjoyed the hands-on parts (when Professor Evans brought in some rocks for us to touch). The paper is also a good summary of everything you learn. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: NO TESTS NOR MIDTERMS. LITERALLY FOUR PROBLEM SETS. FIELD TRIP TO SPAIN ON YALES MONEY AND OFFTRAIL MOUNTAIN CLIMBING AND WINE AND DESSERTS AND CLUBBING IN MADRID. Also fun professors \r\nweakness: the paper is tough. Could be improved with more guidance on the paper ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is honestly the trip. The hands-on experience was a lot of fun and made me feel really genuinely interested and invested in geology. The weakness is probably the lectures though. I think the way the material is arranged doesn't particularly flow from one thing to the next, so it ends up feeling like each lecture is a series of related facts. I think the course would work better if there were more coherent themes to each of the lecture and if it felt like the lectures tied together in some way. I really wanted to love this course and be invested in it, but (partially because it was in the morning) I found myself struggling to stay engaged sometimes, especially towards the end of the semester. I do think that Professor Evans love and enthusiasm for rocks is very evident and contagious, and Sophie, similarly, somehow managed to make me care about chert just by force of her own love for the topic. This isn't really a critique of the teaching itself, but just a sense that the topics covered should maybe be edited or rearranged. ",
            "\u00a0The material would be too easy sometimes and too hard some other times. The psets were all really easy. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures sometimes contain so much material that it's hard to follow along. you also have to go to class to get most of the information per slide because so often a slide is a picture that illicits questions and teaching moments not available online. The trip helps to clarify a lot of practical details of geology. "

            "\u00a0The field trip was a major draw of this class, but be cautious: the hiking on the field trip is a lot more physically intensive than Professor Evans made it out to be. If you are just looking to go to another country, and getting up and down very steep mountains doesn't appeal to you, I am not sure that the class is worth it. Almost every morning and afternoon was spent hiking. Also, we spent a lot more time doing work on the trip than I thought we would, and spent very little time in the cities. ",
            "\u00a0YOURE STUPID IF U DONT TAKE THIS. THERE ARE NO TESTS. U DONT NEED THE PREREQ NO ONE TAKES IT. the field trip is so much fun and beautiful. You get close to your professors and class. You'll never get to experience going out with your entire class in Madrid and getting pricked by cacti on your way up mountains in Malaga if u don't take this. Oh and yea u might learn some geology. ",
            "\u00a0So I was REALLY excited about this course, which is why, despite my reservations coming in about the fact that I didn't have any of the prereqs, I took this class instead of another guttier science credit. The spring break trip was a really wonderful experience (although logistically bumpy in some places) and I would recommend this course for that alone! The workload is pretty light, since the p-sets finish up before spring break and then it's just the presentations and paper left. I was really invested and enjoying the class at the beginning (and honestly did fine on all of the psets without the prereqs if that's something you're worried about) but as the semester went on I slowly lost enthusiasm. Part of this is probably because the topics become less clear once they're no longer preparing you for the p-sets, and it's also harder to focus knowing that the information isn't going to be tested or used in any way, but I think it's also just because the lectures didn't really make it clear what was important or build all of the facts into clear themes (although I think Professor Evans definitely tried to). I came away from each lecture with no real sense of what I was supposed to have learned or what was important, which was frustrating because I really did want to learn. I think the topics covered feel pretty hodge-podge, especially after spring break, so the course as a whole just doesn't feel cohesive. By the time the paper rolled around I honestly didn't feel at all prepared to write it, and I was just really over it. To be clear, I wanted to love this course, and I did at first, but in the end it just wasn't as fulfilling as I had hoped for and I don't feel like I came away with a particularly clear knowledge of geology (maybe this is just because I came in without prereqs and was in over my head though, so take this with a grain of salt). I'm still definitely glad I took the course, and I would still recommend it, I just think I came in with my expectations too high. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good science credit in that it's not gutty, but the subject matter is approachable for students with little geology background ",
            "\u00a0Yes and I have. Going to Spain was an incredible experience and I learned so much about the techtonic history and present day culture. ",
            "\u00a0The spring break trip is a great time. If you need a science credit, this is great. Also good if you like rocks. "
