            "\u00a0I learned some music theory and compositional skills. What was different about this class was that we actually went into different theories of musical harmonies rather than only learn about part writing or techniques in music, such as the Tonnetz. We also covered meter and chromatic sequences, which was interesting. I also feel that Knar had expanded my knowledge of music by always providing examples of what she is saying. I became more familiar to different works of music but also different aspects of art and culture, such as various paintings and works of literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a lot of techniques used in the nineteenth century to compose interesting and complex music, including harmonic mechanisms like modal mixture, augmented sixth chords, and chromatic sequences, as well as rhythmic techniques like hemiola, syncopation, and metric reinterpretation. I also got better at analyzing music and interpreting the overall structure of a piece, both harmonically and rhythmically. ",
            "\u00a0The class helped significantly with the learning of more advanced music theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use a specific set of tools of analysis for 19th century music. Some of the theories and academic work we learned about helped me think in new ways about music more generally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned various compositional techniques common in 19th-century European art music, both how to recognize them and incorporate the into original compositions. The unit on meter was particularly interesting, since many of the concepts it covered are not part of traditional music theory curricula. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a full understanding of the scope of 19th century music theory. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the class is Knar. She is so kind and understanding, and she is always willing to meet outside of the class to discuss anything. She is extremely supportive and open to new ideas. Another strength was the variety of topics we covered. We learned about some music history and theories that led to why we write music a certain way, which was interesting. The final project as a composition was also extremely engaging. I think the only weakness was sometimes we could have moved a bit faster to learn more, such as in the topics with the Neapolitan chord, introduction to meter, or the syncopation lectures. I also wish we had some more resources on how to compose. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome material, passionate teacher, very kind teacher, fun lectures and a completely chill classroom environment where people respected the teacher but still were not afraid to speak their mind. Knar is the loveliest grad student in the music department and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise.\r\n\r\nDisorganized, could have been more rigorous, I would have liked more practice and more homework to feel experienced in really writing the music and using these devices comfortably. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that the material is fairly straightforward, and we spend a lot of time on each topic to ensure that everything is clear. The homework assignments are not too time consuming but still test the concepts well, and the final composition assignment had a great balance of freedom and structure. Knar was also a very kind and fun teacher who made most classes interesting while still teaching the material thoroughly. The weaknesses are that sometimes we moved so slowly that it became a bit boring and so it was hard to pay attention. Also, the class focused almost exclusively on instrumental music, and I would have liked to have listened to some choral or other vocal music that illustrated the concepts we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good overall. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the small class size and the availability of the instructor to help us individually. The biggest weakness was the rather slow pace of the class - it hurt my engagement with the class at times. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very flexibly designed and allowed for lots of student input as to what topics should be covered in most detail and how assignments should be structured. On the other hand, I often felt that this flexibility impeded the course from being as rigorous and comprehensive as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0I adored the course - I do wish there were more frequent, shorter composition assignments to prepare us for the final project. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Even though I have taken many music theory classes before, this one was quite different. It was super engaging to take, and I think I learned so much. It was fun, especially with the visit to the Art Gallery to learn about program music, or our final performance of all of our compositions. Also, the workload is extremely reasonable while reinforcing certain concepts we have learned in class. This class was one I looked forward to because the amount of stress from this class is really minimal while I am able to grow musically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but definitely shop around between sections first and try to see what your options are. Different teachers have vastly different styles and their classes will vary massively in difficulty. However, I do still recommend the class for sure for musicians, it'll really improve your knowledge/understanding of music and it probably won't be that hard. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who enjoys music theory and would like to go past diatonic harmony without having to put in too much work. The class was not very time consuming, but I still feel like I gained a good foundation for further study in music theory as well as for composing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anybody looking to further their knowledge of music theory, this is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you want to formally learn about music theory. It won't do much for you otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a good introduction to 19th-century European compositional practices as well as some review of artistic trends during that period. I felt that my overall comprehension of music theory improved over the course of the semester, though perhaps not as much as it might have, had assignments been more rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students, especially with Knar as your professor! It was taught very thoroughly, and I really felt it clarified my knowledge of music theory. "
