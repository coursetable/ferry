            "\u00a0I learned a lot about anthropology and theory on neoliberalism. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new ways of evaluating corporations, in the context of history, legal structures, gender, diversity, etc. In addition, I also learned how to conduct an ethnography, which was probably one of the most rewarding things I have done at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated being able to learn about the history of corporations as a structural formation and how both capitalist economic processes and Western notions of personhood were instrumental in creating the corporation as a fixture of the last few centuries.  Even for a discussion-based lecture, we were given experience in doing archival research, which was highly appreciated both because another class of mine included an archival research component (this helped me navigate the logistics of things like registering and browsing without alarming the staff).  As well, we were able to conduct informal (i.e. needing to use only consent forms rather than IRB approval) ethnographies--a process from which I learned much about both the difficulties and advantages of doing them.  I also appreciated that the class seemed to draw in a confluence of people from often-divergent backgrounds, with almost as many anti-capitalist activists in the class as those interested in corporate law and finance.  The dynamics of the confluence were interesting given the amount of Marxist and Marxist-adjacent literature that was included. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about corporations (and the world) from this class. If you're looking for an econ or business class, this isn't it... you're not going to learn about business terms or business law. Instead, you learn all about how corporations exist in our society. What they've been historically, and what they are now. I can't even articulate how cool and helpful the ideas are. It will really change how you see these institutions that impact every day of our lives. It is theory heavy, but in a good way. Oh, also, the first two lectures are a little slow so don't be discouraged by the classes during shopping period. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me look at the world from a different perspective. The course readings centered on the history of corporations and their effect on the capitalist system and people and cultures that are often overlooked, making me think more critically of my interactions with corporations. More than anything, I learned to examine both sides of the story, and ask questions about the motives and consequences of corporation's actions. ",
            "\u00a0None, I learned nothing ",
            "\u00a0Before this class I didn't even know what anthropology was!  You get to learn about corporations and capitalism through an anthropological lens (so you learn stuff about Wall Street and also how to do ethnographies, study the way people behave, etc.).  This class is super great at exposing you to new materials.  You do a primary source research paper, a mini ethnography fieldwork paper, and read many great anthropology works.  This class is very cool, and you learn so much about the capitalist world we live in today and how we got here in the first place.  An extremely relevant class!  You don't need to know econ or anything for this! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. Looking at corporations from an anthropological lens helped me think about capitalism and the economy in entirely new ways. These topics are rarely explored through a cultural lens, but this course showed me the limitations of exclusively thinking about them through an economic lens. I learned to ask questions I hadn't ever thought to ask before and to challenge my own assumptions about topics like corporate personhood. I gained useful historical background on corporations and also developed tools to think more critically about corporations today. Corporations are relevant to everything, and what I learned from this class has already helped me think more deeply about my life and the world around me. I also learned about how to read and conduct ethnographies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about corporations impact on the formation of states and society. ",
            "\u00a0I become more mindful of the presence of corporations and the impact they have on our daily lives. I think more critically about both the pro and cons of different corporate actions and debate regarding corporate personhood. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first anthropology course I've taken here (took for a Hu credit), and it was fantastic! Professor Rodgers was great, and the material is super interesting. You learn some important theory for thinking about the corporation as an institution, and even have the opportunity to do a (very very small) ethnography, which I found one of the best parts of the course. Overall this gave me a lot of interesting ways to think about Wall Street, corporations, and corporate culture especially in the modern day! ",
            "\u00a0This course has given corporations and their practices a human dimension. A brilliant course stretching the way you think about the corporate world - perfect for all them corporate sneks out there ",
            "\u00a0I learned about analyzing corporate behavior as apart of a much bigger system than just economics. ",
            "\u00a0We learned on a broad scale about the nature of capitalism through a study of corporations. Topics like exploitation, supply chains, corporate images, and the development of the corporate firm were covered. ",
            "\u00a0Ethnographic research; critical thinking about corporations and neoliberalism ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the most engaging and formative classes I have ever taken. I learned about the history of the corporate form, how corporations have shaped politics, how shifting production strategies have reshaped society, evolutions in corporate personhood, how corporations interact with personal identity to shape labor forces and consumers, the culture of finance and Wall Street, and much more. I became familiar with ethnographic methodology and interview strategies. And, generally speaking, I learned to think more critically about the vast and opaque entities that do so much to shape our world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the rise and fall of capitalism, the relations of corporations to people, and discussed the question of corporate personhood at length. ",
            "\u00a0This class offers something no other class at Yale can: in-depth and rigorous analysis of the corporate form (its impacts on identity, culture, economy, etc) that from a non-economic perspective. It offers an incredibly valuable skill, which is learning to analyze the ways corporations impact all aspects of life using case studies and ethnography. This course is a foil for the classical economics classes that are prominent at Yale. I learned so much from this class, which traced the legal history of corporations from Hobbes' Leviathan to Citizens United, and got to read some incredible analyses/critiques of the way corporations dominate our society today. I feel much more equipped also to have conversations about the corporate world, including complex financial systems. Overall, a phenomenal class that everyone at Yale should take. ",
            "\u00a0I've developed a new way of looking at corporations. I think the anthropogenic lens through which we analyzed the corporate world gave me a new set of tools to think critically about the role of corporations and capitalism on our everyday lives. I learned how to question institutions that appear to be immutable and understand the deliberate processes that came into play in order to establish these norms that we accept. I've gained knowledge on the history of corporations and the various theories of corporate personhood. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how different perspectives on what a corporation is and how it lives inside our society today.  The course teaches to ask questions about an entity that we often take for granted in law, business and environment. ",
            "\u00a0An anthropological/wholistic approach to viewing corporations in historical and contemporary contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes an anthropological approach to studying corporations. The main concept that this course wanted us to focus on was the idea of corporate personhood, and we approached thinking about corporate personhood in a variety of ways.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, with this course, we started by thinking about corporations under a framework in which we have state-as-corporation before the 1500s, corporation-as-police from 1500 to 1900, and government by economy/liberalism in the 20th century. With state-as-corporation, the idea is that people are being made into one body, governed by one thing, the state, the sovereign. With corporation-as-police, the state grants charters to these smaller bodies, these corporations, to expand for the state. With government by economy/liberalism, the Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co. extends the 14th amendment to corporations, which leads to corporations being able to incorporate themselves.\r\n\r\nUnder government by economy/liberalism, we explore private Leviathans, scientific management/Taylorism, Fordism, and then post-Fordism. In particular, there is a crisis of over-accumulation that occurs around the 1970s that leads us into post-Fordism. With post-Fordism, we explore what corporations look like during this time period (which is essentially up to modern day), thereby studying globalization with production, consumption, and supply chains. In the 1980s, there is a shareholder value revolution: Corporations move from managerialism to focusing on shareholder value. As a result of all of this, we have anti-corporate critique. Corporations react to this with corporate social responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe also look at corporations in terms of thinking about cities as corporations and ethnicities as corporations. ",

            "\u00a0The paper topics were pretty interesting and many of the readings were thought-provoking. However, I felt the class could be better described as \"Introduction to Anthropology\" than \"The Corporation\". While the course content was focused on corporate power and neoliberalism, it felt over theoretical and descriptive. I could now describe with greater certainty the development of corporate structures, but lack any new lens to evaluate, critique, or identify alternatives to corporate dominance. tl;dr if you expect this class to shift your thinking or offer imaginative commentary on the soul-crushing capitalist world order which we subsist in, you will be disappointed. If you love anthropology or haven't considered neoliberalism in other classes, this course might be of interest. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging professor, clear and concise powerpoint presentations, interesting mix of assignments / essays, reasonable midterm and final, good progression of concepts throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated being able to learn about the history of corporations as a structural formation and how both capitalist economic processes and Western notions of personhood were instrumental in creating the corporation as a fixture of the last few centuries.

The dynamics of the confluence were interesting given the amount of Marxist and Marxist-adjacent literature that was included.  One way in which the class could broaden its scope is by de-centering the United States in favor of a transnational analysis of transnational capital--a critique which I understand is probably a bit tricky given the sheer salience of corporate politics in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is fantastic. I really, really enjoyed it. Some small notes... I think that we should only read excerpts of the books we read (especially Collin's Threads) and maybe spend a tiny bit more time on the historical side (and take some days off from when we discuss the really niche examples of today's corporations). ",
            "\u00a0The readings are diverse and touch on a variety of subjects. Lectures are a great way to summarize those readings and get the essence of the arguments. The papers are interesting, and I enjoyed doing research in the Haas Arts Library special collections for the 2nd paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  great powerpoints to aid in lecture, really liked the laptops in back half of room to avoid distraction, really interesting readings, engaging lectures, exposure to the process of ethnography and actual field work, opens the mind to a different way of seeing the world\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  a LOT of reading that can be very dense ",
            "\u00a0I loved that the course did not push any one school of thought on us -- rather, it gave us the tools to critically assess each answer we were given to the difficult questions that Professor Rogers posed. I didn't end up with any one way of thinking about corporations, but I think that's a good thing. The readings were also incredible! I can't think of any improvements. ",
            "\u00a0The course strength lies in its diversified topics of interest in the discussion regarding the corporation. Professor Rogers does a good job of explaining anthropological concepts. I really liked the ethnographic project. The course could be improved by having more interactive discussions during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0There is definitely a lot of reading in the course, but most of it is definitely necessary to understand the material and is pretty interesting. We read one book that could definitely be removed from the syllabus in the future (Threads) because we didn't really discuss it, but the readings at the beginning of the semester really were integral in providing the theory and background to discuss modern day corporations. The course was really well taught, and assignments (two papers, section participation, midterm, and final) were graded fairly. ",

            "\u00a0Was a good course, but very high in dense readings ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a broad range of topics, but at times doesn't provide proper background, especially as Marxist and specific terminology come into play. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured in the best possible way to facilitate student's learning -- the order and structure of the material were clearly very well thought out (as opposed to a bunch of random concepts relevant to the topic). Amazing instructor; very interesting, intellectually challenging and thought-provoking readings. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: well chosen readings, engaging TAs, engaging teaching style\r\nWeakness: Not enough direction with paper-writing, could have provided more/better resources ",
            "\u00a0Prof Rogers gives really amazing lectures. He did a really great job teaching pretty difficult concepts in an intro-level class, by making himself clear and available to students and allowing a lot of audience participation during lectures. The readings were great -- although there were quite a lot. On the more difficult readings he would send us reading guides to help. This course is so great because you learn content (I'm a senior and really took it for that) but also you learn essential academic skills like reading social science papers and writing an ethnography that underclassmen really benefit from. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very stimulating, every lecture is engaging, attendance at lecture is a must to understand the readings or to glean the key aspects from it\r\nWeaknesses: readings are quite dense at times, Barkan was terrible to begin with but I've grown to understand his convoluted wording ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturing, engaging and informative mixed with discussion and class participation. The discussion sections are a highlight, cementing an understanding of the often complex reading. Some of the reading can feel a bit overwhelming in volume and in complexity, especially Barkan. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rogers is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course. It really furthered my interest in anthropology, and I've learned so much more about corporations and the way we think about corporations. I just think anthropology in general is really fascinating in terms of thinking more deeply about the structures and institutions that are so central in our lives, and I found this course to be really helpful in terms of thinking more critically about the role of corporations in all of this.\r\n\r\nWith weaknesses, I might suggest improving a bit of the organization of the course. Specifically, I just felt that, sometimes, lectures would cover specific examples of ethnographies, but then, I would leave without really fully understanding how to put these pieces together to see the big picture. Also, a lot of the readings were very lengthy. ",
            "\u00a0Good course ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Biased TAs, It is really a hit or miss. If you get an easy TA expect easy A-range grade. If you get someone by the name of Theo, well God help you. \r\nStrength: Doug Rogers is an amazing lecturer that truly cares about you as individual students and ensures you understand the material being thrown at you "

            "\u00a0If I could do this semester over again, this course would be the one I'd forgo. If you need it for a requirement, go for it, but it was not an inspiring or game-changing lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you want to understand how corporations came to be and play an important role in our lives, you should take this course. I never missed a single lecture because they all built on top of one another, and Prof. Rogers is such an engaging presenter. Fascinating theories about supply chains, labor movements, and corporate personhood are all discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in studying one aspect of the history of capitalism, especially if they want the histories they learn to be contested in sections where students often come from divergent perspectives (e.g. on corporate social responsibility).  Professor Rogers also has extensive knowledge of the material given the fact that much of his career in anthropological research has centered around this exact topic, which makes him a great resource and highly-qualified person to present an anthropological approach to corporations that in important ways troubles abstracted, economistic, individuated notions of corporations.  The class is about questioning dominant assumptions, whereas economics is often about affirming them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student but only if they are willing to do the readings and not fall behind. If you miss one reading, then it's hard to catch up on some concepts that can already be hard to wrap your head around. This class is very theoretical is very critical of capitalism, so know that going in. I personally didn't agree with a lot of the viewpoints shared in class, but it was a valuable experience to learn other perspectives. ",

            "\u00a0Everyone should take this course!!!!  It is so eye-opening to the way we interact with corporations today and how we have come to do so.  At the same time, you learn about anthropology and ethnography.  It is a great introduction to the field.  Prof Doug is THE BEST.  While there is a lot of reading, you can choose to do it or not.  I found that doing the readings helped me get much more out of the lecture, but if the workload is turning you off from taking this class, then take it credit/D/fail because the material taught in lecture alone is worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! I really believe that everyone at Yale should take this course -- and that this information should be more accessible to the public! It deconstructs so many myths about corporations. As Prof. Rogers said at the beginning of the course, whether you will end up protesting corporations or running them, this course will provide SO many useful tools to think critically about your own role in harmful systems. I've honestly left this course with a completely different perspective on so many of the topics we covered. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course truly helped me evaluate and analyze corporations. ",

            "\u00a0By all means, take this great class! Professor Rogers is awesome: approachable, an engaging lecturer, and a sharp thinker. The course will help you think more critically about corporations, production and consumption cycles, finance culture, colonialism, and postmodernity. The readings emphasize 'weak theory' approaches and humanize broad-stroke economic paradigms that tend to obfuscate culture and identity. You'll think about economy and the law differently, but also personhood, statehood, and the way our whole world operates. The course is a great introduction to ethnography, too. Really recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great way of thinking about the world and learning more about the economic system that we live in. ",
            "\u00a0Would HIGHLY recommend. Prof Rogers is one of the best teachers I've had in my four years at Yale. The course teaches you about highly relevant and important concepts in a critical way (i.e. open to questioning trends in corporate influence in American life that are taught as teleological in other classes) that allows students to form their own critiques and original thinking about corporations. This class is GREAT and, of course, the harder you work the more you will get out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It will change the way you look at society. Very applicable knowledge. Whenever I see news reporting corporate scandals or other corporate news, I can evaluate these issues with a wealth of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This has been one of my favorite courses at Yale. Every student should know how corporations operate as they have massive power in politics, business and almost every other realm of our lives. Yalies going into any field will appreciate the skills and knowledge from the course, especially the ability to ask powerful questions and conduct ethnographies. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I absolutely loved this course. The material that was covered in this course was just incredibly fascinating. In particular, corporations are such an integral part of our lives, so being able to think about them critically and understand how they enact their effects on the rest of the world and the economy is really useful. Since taking this class, I have already noticed how often issues related to the material we covered in this class come up in the news (e.g. financial crises, Amazon headquarters). The material in this course is just incredibly relevant to everything that is happening in the world today, so I am really grateful to have had the opportunity to think about these issues more carefully through this class. I especially think that, in studying this material, you really engage in critical thinking, which is really important. In general, I would recommend the lectures offered in sociocultural anthropology. ",
