            "\u00a0The content of this course covered European history from the first to the 18th century, delving into some topics (such as the Reformations, monasticism, mysticism, scholastic theology, etc.) and briefly covering others (barbarism, secular history, etc.). The course relied very heavily on the reading and discussion of primary sources. Major themes, such as the polarities of Christian thought and actions, were discussed throughout the course. Important individuals and major periods of continuity and change were focused on, and the thoughts and arguments of various scholars, theologians, and assorted thinkers were analyzed and compared. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of 5 weeks, I gained insight into how Christianity was used to validate the Crusades, the shift away from orthopraxy and the return to orthodoxy, the breadth of reform present before and after Martin Luther, and the continuation of the debate between Faith and Reason going into the Scientific Revolution. The course showed me how much there was that I did not know about the state of the world and the dogmatic beliefs held by the people in it before the Enlightenment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about history and religion. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about Medival history, fun! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The lack of graded assignments made it difficult to gauge my own understanding of content and themes as I progressed through the course. I also found that, despite the class being a survey, discussion was dominated by those with extensive experience in this and related subjects. It was difficult at times for a student such as myself, who entered the class with little to no prior knowledge, to meaningfully participate in peer-led discussions. The lectures were overall very engaging, and moved at a quick but manageable pace. The quizzes were an unusual format, but were not overwhelmingly challenging or complicated. The final essay was left open to interpretation and students were given a lot of freedom on this assignment to delve deeper into their interests. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it gives a detailed survey of almost all of the events and people in both the New World and Europe from the Fall of Rome until the Enlightenment. \r\n\r\nWhile we took a deep dive into Medieval history and the various aspects of the Reformation, I hoped that we would spend more time on the Enlightenment and dedicate more time to its impact. ",
            "\u00a0no. this course is extremely good, and I love this course so much. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who has either a demonstrated interest or experience in the related topics. I would hesitate before recommending this to someone who is completely new to the subject, or does not know how to study and learn from historical primary sources. Overall, the experience in this class is enjoyable and the content is relevant, even to a non-religious STEM student such as myself. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the teacher brings the course to life. Professor Eire tells us many stories from the time periods to tell and the class was very intellectually stimulating as we observed and made connections between Enlightenment philosophy, religion, and history. ",
            "\u00a0yes. Professor in this course is very very interesting and knowledgable. and this course can help me learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's way funnier than I thought before. This course invoked my interest in ancient history! "
