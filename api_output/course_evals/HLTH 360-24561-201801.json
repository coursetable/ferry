            "\u00a0How to analyze media campaigns, how to create an effective media campaign, what works/doesn't work, how to target an audience ",
            "\u00a0I was able to gain an in-depth understanding of the media influences on health, particularly the research that has been done on various health topics, the campaigns organized to mobilize communities, the graphic design and creative aspects of media, as well as working as a team to finish a media product. We also had the opportunity to hear from various media professionals in the field, which was extremely informative and inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge and insight into the history of a number of public health campaigns and I developed skills that allowed me to create my own public health campaign. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how media has more of a direct correlation on health than most people think! Also, how punitive campaigns are bad. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about successful and unsuccessful media campaigns and the theory upon which they were built. Also learned to develop a media campaign ourselves which culminated in a proposed nutrition video, pamphlets, and policy change for first-year orientation. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to evaluate a media campaign for their strategies and effectiveness. It also teaches you the skills to create your own media campaign. From this course, I learned about the influence of media on alcohol prevention campaigns as well as anti-tobacco and anti drug campaigns. This course connects you to resources as well. For example, Mark Saba, the head graphic designer of Yale, came to class and helped us with creating posters. He taught us valuable skills of how to engage the audience and how to avoid drowning out the message with too many colors. Additionally, we had a chance to go Sesame Street headquarters in NYC as well as sit in on a meeting with representatives from the CDC to learn more about their anti-tobacco campaign. "

            "\u00a0Overall a great course that balanced learning theory behind designing a campaign with applying these skills. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the small class size, the enriching conversation, the opportunity to produce media products, active engagement with the professor, interaction with media professionals, and the opportunity to learn about the intersection of media and health. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths are its professor, the course material, and collaborative, hands-on approach. Dr. Berland is fantastic, knowledgeable and a joy to be aroundAs a seminar, the course offers a deeper look into topics and campaigns covered in Media and Medicine (HSHM lecture),  as well as, other campaigns, which were inspiring and informative. Besides learning about campaigns, we learned skills like graphic design and messaging approaches that allowed us to try our hand at designing a Yale based campaign. There are few weaknesses, but one might be that the schedule/order of readings and topics. The conceptual information was helpful but might have been better integrated throughout the course rather than all up front. ",
            "\u00a0It was all great! ",
            "\u00a0One enormous strength was the hands-on approach to the course. As opposed to simply reading about and analyzing media campaigns we applied our knowledge to current pressing public health issues affecting the populations we were intimately familiar with. We were then able to develop two different campaigns targeted at Yale students, one addressing mental health and stress and the other nutrition and eating habits. ",
            "\u00a0The course was more unstructured than I had initially expected, which made it a bit hard to follow and connect each week together, but it later provided opportunity for students to delve deeper into specific areas of interest. The course could benefit from more structure but the general approach of introducing general themes prominent in various public health issues and then moving to case studies was very helpful, especially if there's a variance of previous exposure among the students. I particularly loved breaking down initiatives by Sesame Street, Beyond Blue, and The Bigger Picture, as well as talking with the CDC and Sesame Street representatives. The final project was also very meaningful, proving to be a fitting culmination of what we had talked about all semester. It, however, felt a bit rushed, so perhaps starting the brainstorming and planning a few weeks earlier will allow more time for production of materials, presentation to people of interest, and even implementation among our peers on campus.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Dr. Berland is an amazing teacher - she is really chill and really let us take assignments and discussion in whatever direction we wanted. The workload is very manageable and our main graded assignment was designing our own health campaign as a class. The material felt very relevant and was also really interesting. Take this class!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course provided an intimate discussion about media and health, and the professor provided thought provoking questions to enhance the conversation. It is definitely recommend to people who are interesting in working in the health space or the media space, while it is the perfect class for those interested in working at the intersection of media and health. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course. It is fantastic and gives students a chance to learn about campaigns, as well as, create them, which is a skill that is lacking in most courses. The small seminar nature allows students to collaborate easily and have intimate discussions of the course material. We look at how media influences health in many shapes and forms, and how each marketing and campaign decisions is intentional and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic! Most definitely would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0YES. If you have an interest in public health, this course is for you. If you are curious about how companies try to manipulate us as consumers, this course is for you. If you have any interest at all in Sesame Street, this course is for you. I think there is something for all to love about this course, and it's quite hard to pinpoint one special thing about this course because it was truly such a wonderful class. "
