            "\u00a0close reading, paper writing skills, theme analysis, historical movements and central ideas to every era, evolution of principles in Western society ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to find bias in seemingly objective historical texts. ",
            "\u00a0critical thinking, reading efficiency, writing style, developing arguments, understanding writers' philosophy on history and politics. ",
            "\u00a0Learned to read lots of material and determine what was important; writing became much more precise ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of the varying perspectives on history and political philosophy from antiquity to medieval times as well as the general trends these perspectives demonstrate. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading and writing, analytical discussion ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to examine texts from a historical perspective and think critically. ",
            "\u00a0Most importantly, I learned to do what could be done in five pages: how to contract the focus enough so that the relevant issues could be treated in appropriate depth, but not so much as to trivialize the profound questions raised by the work as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I could tell I learned a lot this year when reviewing for finals, I picked up Thucydides and much more genuinely enjoyed and understood it (two things that did not quite characterize my first reading). I was surprised at my own sense of familiarity with \"what to look for\"  when he was commenting on human nature, on regime, on transfers of power, on moral values. Before getting through the first semester, those themes seemed muddled together. I realize that I've learned how to identify them separately, and also discuss how they work together or influence one another, as most of our texts did. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about early Western history and the political thoughts that accompanied each of the time periods therein. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think comparatively across thinkers about different themes in history, such as citizenship, justice, custom. This DS approach to history was different from other exposure I've had to studying history in the past in this kind of thinking, rather than memorizing facts and themes from each individual era. ",
            "\u00a0I got A LOT out of this course, but not consistently. There were certain books and topics that seemed to really resonate with the students to produce amazing and meaningful discussions mediated by the professor. Overall, I learned how to see history/politics from not just different viewpoints but different kinds of viewpoints (for example, the purpose of the stories was not always historical accuracy) and about the kinds of questions we should ask when faced with particular moral dilemmas. In answering specific moral/historical questions, I feel much more confident in my ability to discuss and consider different points, but I still struggle with taking a decisive stance. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: compares historical accounts based on truth, bias, evolution of themes, and writing style, manageable workload, engaging texts (not like historical textbooks at all), a historical book type for every student (narrative, fictional, adventure, biographical, etc), focuses on the deeper questions which can be answered rather than the questions which will never be answered but which immediately come to mind\r\nWeaknesses: NA ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is much more political thought than historical thought, although it is obviously focused on both. I didn't learn history like I did in high school, through textbook facts. Rather, I learned the philosophies of historical authors like Herodotus, Thucydides, and many more. I think the curriculum was well planned out to coordinate with DS Literature and Philosophy. This course gave me context for many other authors I read. ",
            "\u00a0no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really thorough examination of several different cultures/time periods from a historical/political lens\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: reading amount could be reduced  at times it seemed like there was too much material to read anything closely ",
            "\u00a0This course does an excellent job at conveying its broad subject, that said a more specific course description might be beneficial. When discussing H&P with students from other sections, it seemed like some classes were history classes and others were primarily political science. Having a more clear goal would probably serve Directed Studies well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include Professor Nakhimovskys teaching and the Canvas discussion reflection requirement, which helps to ensure that our reading analysis is meaningful. Weaknesses include the often excessively long reading excerpts, which can sometimes include less relevant parts of the text. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a wide range of works and gives us a good introduction into important political thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Extensive, in-depth feedback; continual focus on comparison. Main weakness, of course, is the shortness of time allotted to (most) texts. ",
            "\u00a0Each H&P lecture was incredibly engaging and fun to listen to, and each seminar was incredibly conducive to gaining a better grasp of the material. I would say that the major weakness stems from the unavoidable D.S. problem of not being able to spend too much time discussing any given text. ",
            "\u00a0Because H&P is such a broad collection of thinkers and writings, it sometimes felt like there was no unifying question we were asking throughout the semester to help us feel the material and themes cohered. For example, the \"What is history, and how tell it?\" question dropped off mid-semester, while questions about law and faith surfaced later in the semester. I recognize that this is a function of going through works chronologically rather than thematically in the Western Canon, but I think it would have helped me if the instructor had laid out where we were and where we were heading more clearly to mark our movement through time periods and themes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I got a lot out of the pre-Thanksgiving readings but not nearly as much out of the post-Thanksgiving readings. I enjoyed Livy the most, and I cannot remember when we read Augustine's City of God, but I found that reading to be unnecessarily long  perhaps it was also just painful to read. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. Going into it, I figured we would be focusing our attention to historical periods and move along chronologically (like history class in high school.) Instead, the course focused on major events but covered them through multiple authors which I found fascinating. Assessing the different writing styles, accounts, and principle-analysis from every author became enjoyable. Would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course will give you so much context for other humanities classes you might want to take. ",
            "\u00a0yes!! especially those interested in philosophy, political science, history. ",
            "\u00a0yes - learned a lot about foundations of historical thought and writing improved tremendously ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the material is interesting and valuable. I learned the origin, details, and context of stories which I had only know secondhand. I was exposed to entirely new ways of conceptualizing why history unfolds the way that it does and what we can do with this information. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to those interested in political philosophy and willing to handle a heavy and dense reading load. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I really enjoyed this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in early Western history and political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Probably my least favorite out of the DS classes because of the lack of cohesion mentioned earlier. If you're doing DS, pay extra attention to documenting key themes and ideas as you go along to help keep your head straight. ",
            "\u00a0Of course I would! When someone says DS teaches you how to think, I think I most felt that in H & P. Sure, the books and discussions are not always easy /direct connections to modern events and global issues, but the questions we learn to ask, our thoughtful responses to certain kinds of issues, those are directly relevant. Outside of the class, I find myself more competent to tackle not just modern political and global but also moral issues. "
