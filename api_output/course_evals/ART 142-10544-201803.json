            "\u00a0In this course I learned to use Final Cut Pro X, as well as other film apps. I learned editing techniques through practice, as well as an understanding of the process of making a documentary and what it really takes to get out there and make it happen. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think and focus on the narrative of a film. I learned how to view my own projects critically and have become a better judge of how to tell a story through film. I feel like I have more ideas and am more creative when thinking about documentary projects as a result of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more from this course than I did from any other this semester. Filming techniques and advice from experienced professionals (both in terms of story and cinematography), how to use the Filmic app, how to learn from critiques, how to take an assignment you know isn't your best work and turn it into something that shows what you want it to show... This class is so rewarding, especially if you are seriously interested in making any kind of film someday. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches some technological skill and provided me with a lot of insight into what makes certain shots/sequences work. It's really a trial-by-error type of learning but in a very good environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about documentary story structure as well as how to produce film projects in a consistent, timely fashion. ",
            "\u00a0I had never made any kind of film before. This course was a good, step-by-step introduction to the process of planning, shooting, and editing a documentary. "

            "\u00a0Sometimes the classroom time didn't always felt super productive. I do wish there was more discussion amongst the students themselves. Using your phones forces the tendency to use a fancy camera as a crutch or an excuse and makes you think more critically about the shot you are actually making. ",
            "\u00a0Sandra is very intelligent and provides very helpful and insightful notes on each project one turns in. However, the way the class is set up makes it hard for these to be beneficial notes. Normally, the notes come too late. For example, the final project was by far the most enjoyable to work on and the most successful because we had multiple chances to receive notes from Sandra and then implement them. The weekly assignments, generally, felt unsuccessful because the notes would come after we had turned in the projects in, and, therefore, we did not have a chance to make adjustments. Also, sometimes the \"mistakes\" or choices made by the filmmaker that were, perhaps, unsuccessful could have been avoided had clearer instructions/expectations been provided the week prior. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly assignments were very helpful in breaking down the filmmaking process into discrete parts and focusing in on each one. I think it would have been helpful to spend time towards the beginning of the semester working through a definition of documentary to have some theoretical basis for what follows. I would also suggest shortening the class time. I often felt that much of class was given over to anecdotes and chats that didnt have much to do with the topics of discussion. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about filmmaking and pursuing this as a career, definitely take this course. It is a lot of work but is super rewarding! You have to commit and stick to it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants the space and time to create. The nature of the class demands a lot of filming and if you are someone like myself who just want the excuse to get your hands on a camera and work on projects as much as possible, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0If you're serious about film, ABSOLUTELY! This is not the kind of course you want to take as a \"fun elective\"; it's very hard work, and you will probably have some late nights. But it's so worth it. You'll get to know your other classmates (and the professor) due to the small class size; you'll get useful feedback; you'll end the course with an 8-minute documentary; you'll have an unforgettable learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was my favorite course that I've taken so far, and I feel as though I learned a lot about documentary, filmmaking in general, and myself. ",
            "\u00a0I might not recommend this course to a student who is interested in non-conventional kinds of documentary storytelling. "
