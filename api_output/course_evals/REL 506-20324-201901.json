            "\u00a0Timothy created an environment that encouraged all students to participate. I was most impressed that he answered our questions versus previous TF's who say \"I don't know what do you think? ",
            "\u00a0Timothy is very well equipped to teach about the NT. He has an abundance of knowledge that he is able to share effectively and joyfully. I really appreciated how he enabled each member of the class to speak when they felt called to do so. He is very good at leading discussions and facilitating group work during class. He is encouraging, and persistent in helping his students get their learning where they need it to be. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - Matthew was consistent with his attendance. However, section was drudgery. His classroom management skills were not adequate to support student discussion. Students argued or sat in silence for long awkward spans of class time. He was often unable to answer legitimate student questions but would say, \"what do you guys think?\"... Also, he did not review for exams or make time to answer questions about upcoming exams. One paper review session was provided but only used materials already available on the course canvas site. ",
            "\u00a0He is a very young guy with a great domain of the course material, but limited knowledge otherwise. He is sweet, approachable and willing to help and given the circumstances I think he did his best. ",
            "\u00a0Tim was an excellent TF.  He created a warm and inclusive classroom each week.  I grew more confident to raise my hand a make comments over time.  He also brings a unique perspective to the texts, and his passion for his study inspired me as I wrote my papers and studied for my tests. ",
            "\u00a0Timothy was good at encouraging our section to talk and was responsive when I requested feedback on a paper thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel that Matthew was always entirely ready for section - some of the days appeared to have notably more structure and planning than others. He been more prepared to respond to lulls or confusion in the section discussions. ",
            "\u00a0By far the worst TF I have had at YDS. He was terrible at facilitating discussion, was disrespectful of women, and was an unnecessarily harsh grader. It very often felt as though he did not prepare for section at all. It is such a shame to be forced into his section for such a bread and butter course. ",
            "\u00a0Tim's knowledge of early Christianity and New Testament scholarship is first rate! His sections were engaging and he was accessible for questions outside of class. He would often ask if people wanted to carry on the discussion after the Friday section met. "
