The readings were distributed unequally so some weeks I would spend a solid 6 hours on them and other weeks I would spend only one hour, which made this course hard to plan around in terms of time commitment.

            "\u00a0The structure of the course made it very easy to connect concepts. Also, the lecture didn't exclusively cover the readings, so I feel like I was able to learn more. However, I disliked the reading responses because they're graded out of three, there's only 10, they're worth 35% of our grade, and if you make a mistake you get bumped down to a 2, which is a 66%/D. The reading responses weren't difficult themselves but they made it feel like it was hard to do well in the course. ",

I really enjoyed the selection of readings from outside the Noba textbook, although the ones within it were a bit dry and laden with obscure terminology. The lectures were very good, and the reading responses were usually interesting and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nMy one complaint would be that the exams often seemed to be valuing raw memorization over actual understanding. While I understand that a multiple-choice test may be the only feasible option for such a large class, I still think that rote memorization of overly-specific details does not constitute learning and thus should not be required. ",
            "\u00a0-weaknesses: grading homework out of 3 ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: the reading responses were only out of 3 points, so it was hard to get a good grade on those even if you worked really hard. The fact that we had to spend five hours on experiments that did not add anything to our final grade, but could only hurt us. There should've been a participation grade for that. The TAs were pretty unhelpful- I was told that they were not allowed to give us feedback. I don't really understand the point of having a TA that isn't allowed to help me.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Professor Bloom. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes there were a LOT of readings assigned for one week, and then little to no readings assigned for the next.  I understand that some topics have more material/coverage, but readings for all topics would give more depth to them. ",

You will learn a lot while being engaged in every single lecture \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The reading responses do not add much value to the class other than creating a rushed homework assignment every weekend--they are busy work. The weight placed on the 2 exams also create extreme stress; would be much better suited to have some of the grade be based upon our experimental participation ",

",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness was the reading responses. For some reason, they are out of 3 points, so if you have one little thing wrong, you're suddenly down to a D+! They were also graded pretty harshly. I also think that 600 words is kind of a lot, I could usually state my ideas in 300-400 and had to just add fluff to make it to 600. The biggest strength is Paul Bloom. He is an excellent professor! Coming to lecture was actually fun, and it was the class I looked forward to most every week! ",

Very reasonable workload, and the exams were a good balance of difficulty, although maybe overly detailed-oriented, but nothing unmanageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures are engaging and easy to follow.  The TFs answer questions promptly if there are any issues.  Paul Bloom seems to really want to teach the course and his enthusiasm is infectious.\r\nWeaknesses: I was never really sure how I was actually doing in the course.  It was hard to compare my performance over time or to others.  Feedback was slight; limited to a single sentence or two for every reading response and the marks on the midterm exam.  This could be improved by maybe a quiz or two.  I tend to think that most college courses should have more evaluation, though I realize that this creates more work for everyone and less time for teaching.  A second practice midterm might also be good. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very entertaining, with fun video clips and Dr. Bloom's engaging teaching style. The information is extremely interesting, and I often found myself noticing and applying concepts we had learned from the course in real life scenarios. However, the grading on the reading responses was very specific (only one point off gives one a grade of 66%) and I often felt like the tests were focused on small details from the TED talks, articles, or readings rather than the psychology material itself. It was sometimes hard to know what information was pertinent. Overall, this was definitely one of the most interesting and engaging courses I have taken, and I always looked forward to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting course, but I hated the textbook. Not only was it poorly written, it also did not cover the same material as the course. Also the exams were a tad bit unfair due to the fact that 95% of the material came directly from the readings and covered unimportant facts that would need to be memorized rather than main ideas and concepts. For an intro psych class there should be less of a need to recall one tiny piece of information from a reading that you did literally three months prior to the exam. I also hated the mandatory research participation component. It did not teach me anything and was a complete waste of my time. ",
            "\u00a0Very good overall. The course moves quickly, which keeps things interesting but means that some topics get very little attention (all of \"attraction\" was covered in one lecture). I don't have any advice for improvement, however. ",

One of the strengths is how applicable and fascinating all of the information is; I never felt a moment where I wasn't completely engaged and interested in what was being discussed. Professor Bloom also made sure to post all of the slides on Canvas so we could go back and review some of the key points and examples presented in the class. This course was definitely my favorite course that I took this semester, and I will really miss it! ",

The reading responses can be Super interesting but sometimes t just feels like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Like any survey course, we flew through material at a more superficial level than I would have liked, but there's no other way to handle so much information. TAs and Professor Bloom were always available for questions or further information. ",

If you take this class with Bloom, be forewarned that his tests aren't 'hard' in the traditional sense, but rather choose to focus on very different aspects of the course than his lectures/the readings do. ",
            "\u00a0The reading responses could be a bit excessive, but ultimately they did contribute to my learning for the exams. I would have preferred if they were graded out of 10 rather than out of 3 so students wouldn't risk a 66% with one mistake. ",

I also found some of the prompts to be a little unclear, and would have appreciated a little more guidance on what the earlier prompts wanted (the open ended news article analysis questions were a good feature though).

I appreciated that the readings didn't feel excessive or waste time; they seemed to be chosen thoughtfully to provide new supplementary perspectives on the material and encourage us to think critically. I think it could be improved by perhaps some expectation of synthesis or further investigation into a certain area, such as a paper assignment or related project; it helps students to have more grades, and requires a bit more thought than the weekly reading responses alone.

That was the most annoying thing.

A weakness of the course is that it gives only one or two lectures for some of the major fields of psychology (including clinical psychology and abnormal psychology), so it truly is an \"introduction to psychology\" with a moderate but not rigorous level of detail.

I think the instructor had too many slides for each class and went way too fast through them. You were then forced to go through the slides (which hardly had words on them) to try and fill in the gaps. Further, there was so much reading assigned for the course that it was hard to keep up. In combination with the dense lectures this made it very hard to keep up with the course content in a way that set up you to good on the exams. The exams themselves asked many oddly specific questions that required you to do all of the readings in their entirety. The other part of the grading were reading responses, which were only out of 3 points and NOT curved. This means a 2/3 netted you a 67% for that week. Also, some TAs were more generous than others (mine was not). Overall this made the course stressful. ",

I think it would be better to grade the reading responses on a ten point scale. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class include professor Bloom and his engaging lectures. The weakness of this course is the lack of clarity on what details are fundamental to our understanding and learning. It could be difficult at times to learn the material without knowing what is expected of the students. ",
            "\u00a0The obvious strength of this course is Professor Bloom - you will rarely meet an instructor who keeps such a large lecture engaging. The downside to these engaging and fun lectures is the amount of read you need to do outside of class. There was way too much of it and most of the articles didn't pertain to or build on what was discussed in lecture. I also disliked how heavily based on the reading the exams were - it felt like they were mostly testing irrelevant details from the readings instead of big concepts and experiments from lecture. The reading response prompts could have also been more inspiring and I think the study requirement is a complete waste of time. The lectures made it worth it for me but the rest of the course could really be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Bloom is a great lecturer as he included historical examples, videos, specific experiments, and humor into his presentations. Additionally, the work we had to do was not unreasonable and they extended to real world examples of psychological phenomena. I didn't like how the course was graded, especially how the weekly reading responses were out of 3; if one doesn't get a perfect score, they get a 66%. I think if it was out of 5 or something, it would be better. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. It was a fascinating overview of psychology and made me want to take more classes in the department. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lectures, but weakness is when the readings and lecture do not overlap for the same material and this could be improved by being more consistent across the two-- that way we know what we have to know. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are that Paul Bloom is an extraordinarily compelling lecturer-- class time flew by, I looked forward to it every day, and it was as mesmerizing as a great TED talk. One weakness of this course is that the exams (1 midterm and the final) seem to test whether you did the readings by quizzing you on minor details, but not whether you actually understood the overarching concepts. However, the majority of the course-- including the articles, textbook chapters, videos, and reading responses you engage with each week-- is about big ideas. So most of the learning you do for the course doesn't align with the way the exams are designed. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the lectures. I always found Professor Bloom's lectures to be very engaging and the material to be interesting, and I also enjoyed listening to the guest lecturers. However, it is difficult to keep up in the class, as we tried to fit in too much content in some of the lectures. The reading responses are also only graded out of 3, despite accounting for 35% of our grade. I thought sometimes my grades on the reading responses weren't quite fair given that one mistake could drop your grade from 100% to 66%. There are only two tests in the class, so for people who did not do well on the midterm, including myself, there was really only opportunity to improve my grade, which was the final. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was definitely Professor Bloom. He is one of the top 3 lecturers I've taken a class with at Yale. He just does an incredible job of teaching while still being a really fun and funny person. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in that it offers a general, cursory look at all of psychology in just a few weeks. Paul Bloom is a wonderful lecturer, and I enjoyed going to his class. My TA was also very specific in his comments on my reading responses, so the class was pretty well-organized and lectures were incredibly fun to attend. However, the exams are CRAZY specific (like one question will ask about a concept or theory mentioned briefly in a single TED talk or about an idea discussed for 5 minutes in lecture. I wouldn't mind if the exams were particular about details relating directly to psychology, but it felt as though the exams were measuring our ability to memorize the content of all the readings rather than evaluating our ability to rationalize and comprehend psychological phenomena. I would love it if the exams were more general, rather than specific, and I'd love to have more chances to bolster my grade (two exams plus reading responses doesn't leave a whole lot of room for error). ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was great, maybe having a paper could be good ",

            "\u00a0I loved the structure of the class, however, I felt that the exams were kind of unfair--they really tested minute details from the readings, and it didn't really help to study the lectures, and so that kind of messed me up for the first exam ",
            "\u00a0This is a strong course because the professor and guest lecturers were very engaging and kept the info interesting. The workload is also very manageable (although the Saturday deadline for reading responses was strange). Since it is such a big class though, perhaps an optional section could help make it more personal and welcoming? ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures and not too much work, good general overview of psychology. It didn't feel super rigorous or challenging, which is both a strength and a weakness. ",

            "\u00a0My biggest concern for the course was the reading responses. I dont feel as though they were very applicable to the course in terms of their topics and also the grading. The grading did not seem constant across sections and it was graded on a 0-3 scale which was extremely unfair when given a tough TA. Additionally, not all of the readings were very applicable to the course and took a lot of time to read outside class. ",
            "\u00a0I found that the exams were quite difficult in terms of focusing on the small details ",
            "\u00a0Paul Bloom is definitely the greatest strength of this course. While the material itself was super interesting and engaging, Paul Bloom does a phenomenal job of taking it to the next level and presenting it in a way that grabs your attention. I think the only thing that could be improved perhaps is trying to link the different course modules with each other better so that it doesn't seem so much like a random assortment of topics, even though I understand that the course aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the different areas in psychology. ",
            "\u00a0It seems like there's a lot of writing (approx. 700 words per week), but perhaps they make up for it with the absence of final papers. ",
            "\u00a0The class is super super interesting. Sometimes the readings were extremely long and hard to get through, and sometimes felt a little unnecessary. Also, I don't like how term-dependent a lot of the assessments were. I think that's a big thing in Psych overall, but it was frustrating when I understood a concept but didn't specifically know the exact term. However, I really enjoyed the course and never felt like going to class was a burden. Instead I always looked forward to it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was incredibly engaging and very fascinating. I think more review sessions would've helped students do better on the final ",
            "\u00a0The class overall was very good. I do wish we received more guidance on our weekly responses as well as feedback on them when we didn't do well. Exams were extremely challenging, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bloom is obviously a strength. He was an astounding lecturer. I also really enjoyed the reading responses. I didn't really feel like the exams truly measured what it was we learned, however. The emphasis on rote memorization over content mastery was something I wasn't a large fan of. I don't feel like reading responses alone covered the measurement of content mastery, and would like to see more of that problem solving on exams. ",
            "\u00a0There are a vast number of weaknesses within this course. One of those weaknesses was that a third of a student's grade balanced on a weekly reading response that was subjectively graded on a scale from 0 to 3 out of three (with the percentage being the grade). If a student were to not write exactly what the teaching assistant wanted to see, they would lose at least one point. Following this, the teaching assistant would not give clear reasons as to why they took off the point nor how to improve in the future. I recall that at one time I did not explicitly restate the prompt for the reading response and I was penalized one point for that. The fact that one would lose 33% of their grade because they could not guess exactly what the teaching assistant was expecting is ridiculous. Another flaw with this class is the material that is tested on the exams. The exams would have some questions pertaining to the field of Psychology, but many of the questions were based on specific articles or videos that the professor requested that we read. For example, on the mid term, students were asked what the conclusion of a single Ted Talk video was. Although this seems like a trivial complaint when acknowledged alone, with how much information that we were responsible for knowing, no one was going to consider watching an up to forty minute long Ted Talk video as an important use of time. An individual well versed in the field of psychology, unless they knew the very specific references that the professor chose to use, would not be able to answer many of the questions present on either of the exams. This class was poorly graded and did not inform the students very much about the field of Psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I'm sure it's really hard to teach an intro psych coursethere is such a wide array of material to choose from and so many different perspectives to offer on it all. However, I think Prof. Bloom did a good job of organizing the the lectures in an intuitive way, and I found the material overall really fascinating. He always stuck around to speak with students after class, so the opportunity to interact beyond lectures is definitely there. This year I think was the first time using a new sort of textbook for some of the readings, and although the chapters seemed pretty accessible and easy to comprehend, the information in them didn't seem very tightly integrated into the course. ",
            "\u00a0Paul Bloom and the content of the course are quite engaging. I wish that the reading responses were posted as assignments on canvas and that the prompt was more easily accessible rather than having to dig through lecture slides. I also wish that reading responses were not out of 3 points, as it was a common sentiment among classmates that grading was quite harsh on the responses. The exams were possibly a bit too specific - I wish there was more of an application approach to them rather than rote memorization of a VAST amount of reading material. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course are that Professor Paul Bloom is brilliant, engaging, and hilarious, and the material itself is fascinating. The amount of assignments and the amount of reading was also very reasonable. I can think of no major weaknesses of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were not as friendly to what we focused on in class as they could have been. Mandatory discussion sections could improve this class so that we would be able to discuss aspects of the readings more in depth and make sure we understand them. ",
            "\u00a0Some students who have previously studied psychology were likely frustrated with how broad this course was.  However, as someone who has never taken psychology, I appreciated the courses introductory nature and now that I have learned the main ideas of psychology, I can choose to study one of these topics more deeply in another course.  All in all, I believe that the broad nature of this course is one of its strengths.  On the other hand, one of the weaknesses is the excessive number of assigned readings.  I found myself strategically choosing which readings to choose because more often than not, the readings were briefly mentioned or were only peripherally relevant (I would mostly skip the news articles as they were typically far too long and would likely be just one question on the exam).  Another weakness was the variance between teaching assistants.  Many TAs were extremely harsh in grading reading responses while others were very lenient.  As result, a good portion of our grade (35%) was dependent on what TA we were assigned.  A possible solution to this would be to standardize the grading of reading responses. ",

There's just too much information to digest for tests. The exams will quiz you with questions like \"what did so-and-so say in [insert title] TEDx talk\" rather than simply taking the CONCEPT from the TEDx talk (or articles, etc.) and testing your actual understanding of a certain idea.

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great course which covers exactly what it says that it will.  It is very important to do the readings and to show up to lecture.  Prof. Bloom taught it without a textbook, yet followed a rigorous and clear structure of the course.  The class is not easy, but the material is intuitive and easy to remember.  The class requires concentration and attendance in lecture as the powerpoint slides are very hard to follow without having heard the lecture.  There are often small insights into the material through pop culture (or at least what Prof. Bloom thinks is pop culture) and these would make little to no sense without having seen the lecture first.  It is also very important to do the readings. You will be tested on them and they are a good supplement to the lectures.  I found it boring to do the reading before lecture as the lecture then felt repetitive.  (The readings generally contain much more information than the lectures).  \r\nThe lectures overall are stupendous and fun.  The grading is not harsh and is fair to all.  There are weekly reading responses, though these offer little insight into how well one actually understands that material and instead seem to reflect the ability to regurgitate material from the readings.  The tests are cake if you can memorize information and harder if you can't.  They tend to be based on overly simplistic representations of the material and distill lectures into 2 or 3 questions.  But they cover the material evenly and fairly, and they are very similar in style and tone to the practice tests on Canvas. ",

However, I would only recommend this course if the student understands that there is a great deal of work and detail-oriented reading and studying first. The two exams test very detailed information, the reading responses take time, and the experiment portion takes up more time than one would think. But overall, very interesting and mostly fun! ",

All of the material is so interesting in this course, and there's never a dull moment in the class! I personally always left class talking to my friends about all of the things that fascinated me from that day's lecture, and that is one of my favorite feelings to have with a course.

He captivates the lecture hall with humor and easy-to-follow presentations of ideas and concepts. He is a fantastic professor and the best lecturer I've encountered in my life. \r\n\r\nThe material itself is all easy to learn if you keep up with the reading and pay attention to the lectures. There are no 'tricky' questions on exams or assignments. If you do the work, you'll succeed. The peers I know who struggled in this class did so because they never did the readings. (The exam directly asks questions pertaining to the readings.)\r\n\r\nOverall, the class was engaging and stimulating while very very manageable. Favorite class of the term. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. If you are the token therapist in your group of friends, if you like theorizing human behavior, if you want to know why humans do what they do and are interested in the origins of religion, please take this course. Paul Bloom is also an amazing professor. I am a rising senior now and can say that ithout hesitation that this has been my favorite class are yale so far. You really can't get any better. Take it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. The material is interesting and the lectures are engaging (I was usually able to pay full attention the whole hour and fifteen minutes, which I usually find difficult!). It's a good fairly low-stress class for anyone who thinks they might have an interest in psychology - although it doesn't delve deeply into any particular subject. ",

The workload was not excessive and I think the exams were very fair as long as you studied. The course was able to cover an impressive range of subjects in a short time, all of which were fascinating. And you certainly don't have to be considering a major in the social sciences to appreciate the content. ",

            "\u00a0This is an interesting course that teaches you how to explain your actions through a psychological lens. However, it's not easy-- there's so much reading that is on the exams, and it's a bit overwhelming even for MCDB/premed people who are used to rote memorization. Take Bloom's class if you want a great lecturer but hard exams. The other intro psych professor (Dunham) apparently gives easy exams (with the class avg being at least 10 points higher than the avg on Bloom's exams). But Bloom is so passionate about this material that his passion really rubs off on you and inspires you, and the class is curved with like 40% of the class getting A- and above, which makes up for the hard exams. ",

            "\u00a0I would be cautious in recommending PSYC 110 to another student (especially with professor Bloom). The course has a suspiciously high work load (lots of dense readings, oddly specific exams, weekly reading responses ~600 words). I heard a lot of good things about professor Bloom and so I waited to take the course with him. While he is by no means a bad professor, he also isn't that great. His lectures are a bit unstructured and the slides provided hardly have words on them so they're not really helpful. He also does this weird swaying thing during lecture which I found annoying and often glossed over details. Overall this class was just kind of average but also hard. It was an okay choice for premed and SO but be warned ITS NOT A GUT. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course overall just for Paul Bloom's lectures (and the guest lectures) which were a highlight of my week, because the rest of course was average (lengthy readings, nitpicky exams, not so interesting reading responses and 5 hours of PSYC studies). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Whether or not you are interested in pursuing psychology, it is fascinating to learn about how your mind works and is a valuable experience for any student. ",

If you are interested in why humans are the way they are, from relationships to emotions to child development to dreams to morality, you should take this class. Professor Bloom is not only brilliant but also entertaining. The class feels less like a college course and more like a snappy TED talk you feel lucky to attend, full of cool tidbits and ideas that will make you think about yourself in a totally new light. Be prepared to memorize a lot of information for the midterm and final exam, but if you've been keeping up with readings, which are manageable, it's not too bad. ",

I initially thought the class was be a straightforward introductory course, but the exams were much more detail-oriented than expected. A lot of students will have to take this class, and if you are forced to do so, just make sure to study for the exams WELL in advance and to take details notes over all of the readings and lectures. Even if you're not interested in psychology, the class was still a lot of fun and the intellectual payout was nice--I do feel as though I understand how and why individuals think, behave, or believe in certain ways better now than I did before.

            "\u00a0Take the course if you would like a broad overview of psychology. Paul Bloom is a very good lecturer, and he makes the class engaging. The weekly responses are fine if you stay on top of them, and the midterm and final come directly out of readings and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an introduction to psychology, just as the name suggests. If you have already taken AP Psych, or perhaps Intro Cognitive Science at Yale, then much of the information will be repetitive. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly highly recommend this course, especially with Paul Bloom. His class is one of those must-haves that completes your Yale experience. The lectures are very engaging (I never once fell asleep in a 1hr 15min lecture) and there will definitely be at least one point in the class when you will want to become a psychologist. And I'm saying that as an applied math major. Definitely take it, even if you're a second semester senior and are just looking for a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take intro psych you should take it with Paul Bloom or Dean Chun (they will entertain you and help you learn the most).

You understand others and yourself better, and you can use a lot of the knowledge to your advantage. It is also just an extremely interesting course, and like I said I looked forward to going to lecture. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student! Prof. Bloom is an engaging lecturer and does a nice job of covering a lot of different concepts. The reading responses can be a bit of a hassle, but so long as you don't wait till the last minute they can also be a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend that every Yale student take Intro to Psych. Psychology is a really interesting field that is related to so much in life - current events, history, medicine, philosophy, economics, etc. Professor Bloom sets up the course such that even if you have no background in psychology (like myself) you can still very much succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Totally would! Psych is a fascinating area of study, but a class like this is necessary if you want to do more upper level stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course.  Not only was the material truly interesting but Professor Bloom is a fantastic lecturer. I waited to take this course until after he returned to teach because of all the great things I had heard about him (including that he was like a bloomin onion  layered, crispy, and well-seasoned) and I was not disappointed.  He is quite the character and presents the material in a very memorable and humorous way.  In fact, this was the sole course that I was truly excited to go to every week (and my favorite from this semester considering how many things I learned).  All in all, take this course and take it with Professor Bloom!  But be forewarned, it is a large lecture class so you will have to study to do well in it.  He is very detail-oriented when writing his exams so you will need to remember his passing comments, the odd statistic, an obscure theory, etc.  His exams (multiple-choice) are basically fact recall from both his lectures and the readings which sounds easy at first, but everything is fair game.  Also, pray that you get a nice TA because reading response grades are largely based on how nice your TA is.  Other than those few things, this course it truly fantastic, I learned a lot, and I am very glad to have taken.  If you wont take it for the interesting field that is psychology, then take it for Professor Bloom! ",
            "\u00a0yes, there are many concepts that I found very interesting and are applicable to my everyday life ",
            "\u00a0Take it if Bloom is teaching it again. "
