Marney also allowed us class time to work with our groups, which helped dramatically. Discussions were helpful and relevant to our projects. I see no weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Learned a lot about questionnaire development. Some of the lectures could be combined at the beginning to give an extra week for SPSS during the data analysis phase. The first session in lab could be Dr. White doing SPSS on the projector showing us basic things. The next two weeks could be data analysis as it was this year. ",
            "\u00a0Fine ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING COURSE!! It was fun working in groups creating a questionnaire on a topic that interested us. The class had a good structure: half of it lecture, the other half working in groups. This class is very much learning by doing. ",
            "\u00a0I loved making a questionnaire. It was a practical skill and I felt like I really had to think about our project rather than do a bunch of busy work. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so much fun! I really enjoyed learning through doing. It was great to learn something in lecture and then immediately practice through our own questionnaire. The only weakness I can think of is that what you get out of this class probably depends on the group you work with for the semester, so if you choose a group that doesn't work well together, that could be a problem. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course, however, there were too many students and the groups were very large, making it hard to coordinate and also to learn. I did not get to spend as much time learning SPSS as we chose to divide and conquer and I ended up just working on a description of our measurement scale. Groups should be smaller if possible. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course! I really liked the structure of the class and how each week's topic build upon the previous week. To improve this course, I would suggest spending more time on the data analysis section of the course. It seems like we sped through that part of the class and a lot of students were learning SPSS for the first time.  We had to rely on group members who were more familiar with SPSS to lead the analysis part of the project. It would have been great if an optional SPSS 101 workshop would have been offered at some point during the semester to prepare us for the data analysis section. Also, it was slightly difficult to find files on our Canvas class site, so I would suggest organizing Canvas a bit better. Overall, great course! ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. It's helpful to have a topic in mind as you go in, and supporting yourself with a reliable and productive group with shared goal. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to questionnaire development and its use in research. \r\nGroup project based, and group project deadlines were coordinated in order to illustrate the material presented in class - this was excellent, as it gave the course a very practical application and illustrated how one might use questionnaires in research and academics. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how this course directly developed applicable skills in developing scales to measure various psychometric qualities. I see this as an important skill to have in my future research and feel like this is one of the only courses where I left feeling like I had accomplished work that could be published. Dr. White structured the course in a way that offered effective pacing of the course concepts and the tasks were ordered cumulatively to match the process that one would normally use to develop such scales. I am so glad to have taken this course and refined these skills and am excited to move forward with the project I started here. ",

            "\u00a0This course was good. Marney was such a personable professor, and learning how to write a questionnaire was such a great skill to gain. The teamwork component of this class was also a critical component of the class. A weakness of the course is that I sometimes didn't know what was going on. Concepts could have been explained better. ",
            "\u00a0Very practical in terms of the skill set it develops. The set-up of the assignments are also such that you learn as you do them. Very group-centeered, so it's fun if you are with a good group of people who are invested! ",

            "\u00a0Although it is very important, I believe questionnaire development is a skill that is often overlooked. The class was very helpful in that it highlighted all the different things to consider when creating a questionnaire in order to achieve high reliability and validity. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent ",

Further, she is extremely responsive and helpful when responding to student questions and I felt that our group was very supported throughout the whole process. The class moves quickly but I felt like she never asked anything unreasonable of us and respected how much work we put in by turning around assignments quickly and giving high quality feedback. I wish she taught more classes here, I would take all of them. ",

            "\u00a0Very interactive and effective speaker as well as group discussion coordinator.\r\nIn this setting of a group project dictating most of grade of course, her communication was key to ensuring everyone was on track for the completion of their projects and for assuring a standard of quality for the projects, and the professor clearly navigated that without difficulty, even in a year with a higher than usual number of groups. ",
            "\u00a0Very good, the instructor is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor provided an excellent balance of humor and content in each class. I felt like I learned so much from each lecture. More importantly, I feel like Dr. White was dedicated to the learning process over the grading process, something other instructors have faltered around. Ultimately, this is why, in my opinion, I learned more (instead of memorizing more only to forget it immediately after the class). I really appreciated all of the time Dr. White took to offer constructive feedback on our projects so as to push us to do better and be successful. ",

You learn SPSS so well as well has analytical methods. The class was engaging and fun and she was an entertaining professor. One of my best classes taken at Yale so far. ",

I'm a PhD student and find that we don't have that many skills based classes here at YSPH, but this class was so well designed and executed that I feel like a have a real solid foundation in questionnaire development and that I will able to apply these methods directly to my research. So glad I took this class! ",
