            "\u00a0Scientific writing, familiarity with neuroimaging and spectroscopy techniques and analysis of their images/data. Understanding of neurological disorders. ",
            "\u00a0As a student who was not pre-med, I was hesitant going into the class about the accessibility and relevance of the material. I know now a lot more about the physics behind different neuroimaging techniques and specifically how they can be applied to study different diseases and disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Learned quite a bit about neuroimaging. Every student led a lecture in pairs so we worked on our presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0In this course -- you develop very niche knowledge regarding neuroimaging methods/studies/applications. I have definitely developed a new vocabulary regarding neuroanatomy/the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about neuroimaging techniques, the fundamentals of calibrated fMRI, and the applications such neuroimaging techniques have/will have in the future. "

            "\u00a0Strengths- small class size, I think the seminar type design works perfectly, tons of feedback\r\nWeaknesses- feedback was sometimes not as timely as it could have been ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the small seminar setting of this course--it promoted discourse amongst the teachers and students, and the timing/frequency of the course was also ideal. I enjoyed hearing the insights of the instructors, too--they were clearly very experienced researchers. ",
            "\u00a0The essays you write are challenging, but very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is hard because it feels like it requires a prerequisite that doesn't exist. I definitely felt it was very hard to follow at times, so I would suggest having a more clear introduction to the course in the beginning and more clear goals of what we are learning. It is also quite a bit of writing -- about rather challenging material. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that I can actually learn all the material through the lectures alone. Even though lectures in the second half of the semester are given by the students themselves, professor Hyder and professor Rothman provide enough commentary during the lectures such that any points of confusion are clarified. At the end, professor Hyder often gives a brief summary of the points to take away from the lecture, which was really useful in learning from the lectures.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course might be the long nature of the lectures. Lots of people lose focus into the second hour of this class (which usually runs for 2 hours due to meeting once a week). ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of this course - I think the weekly synopses were especially helpful for me. However, I wish there had been clearer grading guidelines for the midterm and final papers, as they were sometimes difficult to structure since we could choose any topic of interest. I also wish there had been more lectures given by the professors (there were only 4 and the rest was covered by student presentations) since even though most student presentations were great I think I would have gotten more out of each chapter if it had been covered by the professors who know what the key takeaways and experiments are.

            "\u00a0If youre reading this youre probably someone that is Stemmy, isnt very fond of academic writing, and is desperate for a writing course. If you fit any of those three, take this class.\r\nYou will love it. Two papers- one 10pg that you can do over spring break and 1 15pg you can do during reading week. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it was an excellent, low stress way to get a science credit while still learning a lot of relevant facts about medical technology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend. You learn a lot of cool stuff & it's pretty chill. The two research papers and the presentation allow you to delve into specific topics that you're interested in so I found those pretty interesting to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'd take it if you're a neuroscience major, if you want a writing credit, or if you'd just like to learn more about neuroimaging. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is an interesting course as it a science credit that is also a writing credit, and would recommend it to those who are interested in scientific writing and specifically about the technical details of neuroimaging -- but is rather niche and not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in our current understanding of the brain, neuroimaging techniques, and its limitations, then this is definitely the course for you! Be warned that this class is full of bio and neuroimaging majors, but as a electrical engineering and computer science major, I was still able to learn a lot, contribute to the class, and write interesting papers relating the course material to computer science. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a deeper understanding of the range of neuroimaging techniques available, as well as the limitations of some of these techniques and of current methods to analyze neuroimaging data. "
