            "\u00a0I learned about some recent problems in mathematical machine learning, what sort of bounds are considered good, what interesting mathematical methods are being used, etc. I got a sense for the techniques used to tackle these problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of Statistical Learning Theory and theoretical machine learning in this course. I also got a glimpse of active research topics in theoretical machine learning. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the field of statistical learning, picked up very handy mathematical tools. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of theoretical background behind widely used statistical learning methods, and it is great for developing a better understanding of why these methods are used. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bunch of the math behind theoretical machine learning and statistical learning. Now, I can read a theoretical machine learning paper with pretty high confidence. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you a lot of the basic proof techniques for main topics in statistical learning theory through classical examples. Overall a solid survey of stuff in the field (probably). ",
            "\u00a0Concentration inequalities, various bounding techniques, and other statistical learning theory topics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course covers interesting material, but it severely needs more problem sets to actually reinforce the material. It also drew almost entirely from lecture notes -- an outside textbook, or more varied set of links/resources, would have been helpful. Lectures often were too fast, given that backtracking and correction had to happen sometimes, and were most engaging when they weren't based on the MIT lecture notes. The content is really cool and I enjoyed the course overall, but the lecture speed/carelessness and lack of problem sets undoubtedly prevented me from getting as much out of it as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job of organizing and teaching important topics in statistical learning theory. I also appreciated the opportunity to deeply understand a recent research paper in statistical learning theory. ",
            "\u00a0More regular assignments to reinforce learning. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great, although more frequent problem sets might have helped with reinforcing the material. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered was pretty interesting and really relevant to keeping up with modern developments in the ML world. However, it was structured pretty weakly (as is normal for graduate classes, I've heard). We only had one problem set all semester and one final paper, and I think I'd have learned the material more if there had been more problem sets. Also, we didn't get feedback on any of the work we turned in, which didn't facilitate student learning or give us any idea what our grades would be. That said, the low workload made this a nice fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well organized. There could be more problem sets and practices. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is extremely interested in mathematical machine learning, comfortable learning on the fly, with a decent background in math/ML, and who is willing to overlook the other pitfalls of the course in light of the content. The lack of assignments and speed/improvisation of lectures makes it hard to get as much out of it as you would another course. However, the material is very cool and varied, and covers a nice variety of topics in statistics, math, and CS. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anybody who wants to dive deeper in the theoretical aspects of machine learning and anybody who wants to really understand why certain machine learning algorithms work the way they do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good advanced stat class to take, but you need to have good study habits yo actually learn the materil in the class, since there will be few psets. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in the theoretical aspects of learning methods. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this class if you're looking for a low workload fifth class and you're a very independent learner. You won't get much structure out of Sahand -- so don't take this class if you're looking for a steady one-pset-per-week sort of thing. But the material covered is pretty interesting, Sahand really knows his stuff, and you'll get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an interesting class and students can learn about useful inequalities (and other things that I do not know the use yet). "
