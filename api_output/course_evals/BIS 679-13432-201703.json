            "\u00a0I think this was a great class. One comment that I have is that I felt that there was a stark difference between the difficulty of the SAS section and the difficulty of the R session. Obviously this is just my opinion but I have about the same level of familiarity with the two programs. I found that for the R assignment I had to spend a lot more time learning functions that weren't in the notes than I did for the SAS assignments. I guess one recommendation I have would be to spend more time covering basic R functions and leave out the final lecture (which was interesting but I would have appreciated front-loading with more information that would help us do the assignments). Also, I felt that the difficulty of the homeworks escalated dramatically from the lectures - going from simulating coin tosses (pretty clear, very intuitive) in class to simulating election results felt like a dramatic jump in complexity. Perhaps the lectures could cover material that is more closely the same level of complexity as the homeworks (for the R section)...\r\nOtherwise this was a great course!! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: you get to learn the details of working in SAS and R that are not really useful unless you plan to go into biostatistics\r\n\r\nWeakness: Poorly taught, assignments/projects are poorly worded, grades are very inconsistent with directions given, instructor assumes students know how to work with R and assigns things that were not covered in class ",
            "\u00a0productive skills in learning SAS and R programming.\r\n\r\nStrength: organized programming notes which allowed self-learning if I missed something in class. Also good explanation during class of logic in code.\r\n\r\nChallenges: homework assignment and examinations not necessarily directly related to skills learned in programming class. A lot of it required some element in ingenuity to figure out what was desired and thus resulted in much time being spent working on homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be structured more clear. Some of the concepts are hard and the instructor should give students more time to learn. The difficulty level of each homework is also very different. Some assignments are really hard. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very helpful for learning to program in SAS. The R portion could be improved as it was much more difficult and some students had less background in R than SAS. The projects were massive and difficult and grading was pretty harsh ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the format of this class. It differed from AAMIE in that the code was right in front of me (to run and annotate), as we were in lecture. This vastly improves learning these statistical programs. I also think there is value in learning to code efficiently, and to know the basics of more than one program. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the second half of the class (R) was rushed, and focused on different things. Rather than learning the same methods, but in R, we did a lot more simulations and the second project was much more ambiguous than the first. To aid in faster grading, maybe it would be better to have the projects be in groups. \r\n\r\nAlso, the assignments could have benefited from a rubric. You could complete an assignment according to the instructions, but still get an arbitrary number of points off for efficiency or something else unexpected. ",

            "\u00a0The instructor's delivering was fine, but the grading was late, so timely feedback was hopeless. I think the instructor should be more clear on what she expects from the student. I was often getting points off for things not stated in the assignment. It was obvious that students will discuss the approach towards writing the code but you can get many points off for a really small mistake, which is understandable but is a poor reflection of what students actually learn from the course. The amount of points taken off should reflect the fixability of the error. \r\nAdditionally, the instructor stated that she will only accept universal codes, meaning there should be no error in the code when she ran it. However, the class note code that was prepared by the instructor was also prone to error. There had been many times that I could not run her code and could only saw her doing it on her computer. And I was not alone. If that's the case, it seemed unfair for her to ask the students to provide universal code. I understand that if the code didn't run on her computer, she couldn't grade. But it's only fair that she show some empathy and understand that this was not the student's intention, and it actually ran perfectly well on the student's computer. ",

It's not understandable to take off 20 points for just a typo. It's a way of denying student's actual work and only focusing on code style. Some of the homework took a lot of time to write. And if a simple typo can cost 20 points deduction, it's like if I did the homework for nothing. The instructor should really learn to understand students and improve her teaching and grading. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Esserman was a good teacher in the class room and helpful in office hours one-on-one. Everything she taught in class was taught clearly, and her notes in the code were thorough. However, my issue comes in with the assignments and the grading. In the R portion of the class, the assignments were well beyond what was ever taught in class. For instance, the class lecture would go over a simple example of simulations but the assignment would ask for something so much more complicated than what we learned in class. Furthermore, the assignment would be so much more complicated that it wasn't something we could apply the class notes to as we could for the SAS portion of the class. The grading was very confusing as we often got points off for things that were never expressed in the actual assignment. Although I learned a lot in this class, I think my grade unfairly suffered because of the points I mentioned above. ",

She took 30points on a little mistake. She took the spelling mistake for 25 points. The full points is 100. Homework is so hard for programming beginner. The difficulty level is much higher than the class notes especially for the project. ",
            "\u00a0Denise is overall a good lecturer. She has clearly annotated notes and projects her voice well in lecture. Everything was well organized and neat. During office hours, she was very helpful and nice if we didn't understand how to move forward with an assignment. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would suggest a quick break in the middle of lecture. It is difficult to sit through 2 hours of lecture without losing focus. It would be great if we took five minutes or if there was two shorter lectures a week.\r\n\r\nAlso, the console in R studio can be moved so that it is not at the bottom of the screen. It is virtually impossible to see if you are anywhere besides the front. Speaking of which, it is really hard to get a seat and get situated with all the files when there is a class exactly before ours and people don't leave. Five minutes grace period  to get logged in (or just getting a temp check \"are you guys ready?\") would also be great. ",
