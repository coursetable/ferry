            "\u00a0I developed critical thinking skills in the Chinese language. I learned how to do literary analysis on Chinese works. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about modern Chinese literature and how to write a good Chinese essay. ",
            "\u00a0I gained exposure to the incredible world of modern Chinese fiction, at a very high level. In this class, you read the unabridged texts from several very famous authors and then discuss them. My writing improved dramatically.  But by far the best part is hearing Prof. Su's stories. ",

            "\u00a0The course was wonderful in piquing interest and improving Chinese skills. The works we read were very interesting and rewarding. I do think the dictations were a bit excessive, though. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. It taught me so much about Chinese fiction, culture, and history in such an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0You get to read a diverse selection of texts from modern China, and Su Laoshi has a bunch of interesting personal stories to go with each author you read. However, I wish there wasn't so much dictation (sometimes we had to prepare over 150 words for a quiz)! I also wish there was more class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The ultimate strength of this class is Prof. Su.  He is someone who lived through some of the most tumultuous times in China's recent history, and even played a part in those events. His stories are just incredible. But it's not only his stories...he has very deep insight into the texts we are reading, and under his guidance I got so much more out of the materials than if I had read them alone. \r\nThe course materials are very interesting and challenging.\r\nThe dictation forced me to learn characters again.\r\n\r\nBut you should note that this is a literature class; it's not a class intended to improve your oral proficiency. Yale has many other classes for that. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, no complains what so ever. "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. Su laoshi is incredible. You'll never get tired of his amazing stories and he really does a great job of walking you through the difficult short stories. I learned so much from this class and it was very low-stress. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is curious about modern Chinese literature. If you aren't really into literature, then perhaps this class isn't for you. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in gaining confidence and proficiency at reading modern Chinese texts, it is a great course.  It's only problem is that it ended; I so wish I could have taken it all over again. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take whatever class Prof. Su teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Gives you a great introduction to some of the key texts and writers that defined modern Chinese literature. So many lessons about Chinese culture and ethics that you won't get anywhere else. "
