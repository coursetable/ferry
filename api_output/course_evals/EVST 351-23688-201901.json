            "\u00a0This course would be a great course for anyone, not just environmental studies majors. Professor Weiss lectures on very interesting things, and traces certain patterns throughout human history. The workload for the course is also remarkably low. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's not a ton of work (weekly readings, take home midterm, and take home final). You end up learning a lot about the Anthropocene without even realizing it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who has NOT taken a course by Professor Weiss before. The material was fairly analogous to some of his other courses, so it was repetitive at times. Students must be prepared to listen to him talk for the whole class because discussion is minimal. "
