Class topics also seem fairly disjointed so it's hard to get a broad course understanding. Class features mostly guest speakers but would like more input from the professor himself. Making discussions but not lectures mandatory and having no relationship between them makes it hard to justify the need for students to go to lectures. ",

It was sometimes difficult to see how the outlined learning objectives were being met by the course. The debates were always very interesting and fun.
