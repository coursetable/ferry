            "\u00a0very little skills, some knowledge about dev econ ",
            "\u00a0We learned a full history of development economics, as well as thoughts on topics such as poverty traps. Finally, we read about the relationship between health and development, and learned a lot about how that frames AIDS policy in different countries and got to do some modeling of or own. ",
            "\u00a0Use of spectrum ",
            "\u00a0A lot of development theory, as well as an understanding of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa ",
            "\u00a0An expansive base on Development thiking is provided, as well as a nuanced take on healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly the AIDS epidemic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use STATA and glean concepts from high-level development papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about economic development theory throughout history and how to apply these theories with modeling tactics to better understand a country's development path, evaluate the impact of interventions and make policy recommendations. ",
            "\u00a0The first part of the course, a somewhat brief but heavily in-depth overview of development practice through the decades, allowed me to place current development thought as a reaction to historical development context and criticism. I learned a lot about development practice and theory as a whole, and frankly wished we had spent even more time on that part of the class. I also learned how to make use of the UN's Spectrum program, which is a mathematically complex model the UN uses to predict the future of HIV/AIDS in specific countries. "

            "\u00a0The seminar is very disorganized and feels a bit superficial often times. The final project is a joke... I found very little value and learning in it. Grading is WAY too generous ",
            "\u00a0No one except for a few people pay attention in class- incorporating participation into the grade would change this. ",
            "\u00a0Really excellent if you have aspirations to do anything in sub-Saharan Africa or NGO work. Also useful dataset skiills are taught and explored. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I went into this class expecting it to be more anthropological, more human. But it felt disconnected from the human and cultural side of development. But the course definitely taught a lot in development philosophy, and I now realize that development thinkers themselves don't really know what they're doing--which is foundational realization. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job creating an overview of the prevailing development ideas and the modeling process was interesting and made the ideas we were learning in class tangible. The discussion was also interesting but sometimes it we did get stuck on certain ideas and it was hard to move forward or jump in on the conversation. The prompts for the essays were a little vague but it provided some freedom on what we could write about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Weeks 1-5/6, where we took a deep dive and analyzed aspects of both theory and practice of development from the 1950s until today, and determined what worked, what didn't, and started to answer the question of why things worked and didn't work. This was incredibly enlightening, and a short paper allowed me to synthesize my views after this unit. \r\nThe structure of the class at the beginning worked very well- I appreciated the 2 shorter papers, the presentation, and the longer final paper. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Towards the end of the class, we started working with Spectrum, the UN modeling program used officially to model AIDS epidemics in countries. We were required to complete presentations and write our final papers based on this model. This program is just too complicated, with too many variables to fully cover in the two sessions we had to work on it. Even after probably 40 hours of outside work, I still couldn't grasp the mode completely, and was forced to submit poor work, even though I was highly engaged in the class. The class also took a week and used Stata to parse out some of the determinants of child and infant mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa, which was a good exercise, but I also thought we needed more time on that to delve into it. A recommendation for future years would be to take out one of these modelling exercises, and focus more deeply on either the Stata work or the Spectrum work, so Prof. Nattrass can really teach students how to use them and meaningful work can be produced.\r\n\r\nI will say, though, I did love the seminar overall.

            "\u00a0Yes, this is an interesting class. It's important to do the readings in order to understand what is going on in class, but if you do, you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nattrass is really intelligent and really good at explaining tricky economics topics. She's also done a lot of important work in the field of AIDS in South Africa. Otherwise, it's a fairly chill class, but you definitely still learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0I would not- I thought the grading was inconsistent and the material was interesting but the class didn't engage with it through conversation that everyone took part in. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wants to acquire introductory skills in working with datasets or a more nuanced approach to development thinking. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in development theory, then this is your course. But if you're hoping to get a more up-close look at development projects, then I would steer away. The readings are not too bad but definitely hard to understand. A lot of the class was going over readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great senior seminar that isn't too heavy in terms of workload but is very rewarding once you finish the final project. The development theories are really interesting to learn about and discuss, and the flexibility of assignment topics allows you to write about what you want to, which is great. ",
            "\u00a0Without hesitation, I would recommend this course. Take this course only if you are genuinely interested in discussing development theory and practice and diving deeply to discover the causes and solutions to some of the worst health crises facing Sub-Saharan Africa. The workload is reasonable (2 short papers, a final presentation, and a final paper), but from experience I can tell you that doing the assigned reading and participating in discussion in the seminar will lend you an infinitely more rewarding experience (bc it is possible to skate by and not talk all semester and probably do fine, but that sucks for everyone else). Prof. Nattrass is a wealth of knowledge (she is South African, and has spent years practicing development, so can call bull when needed too), and manages to be both relaxed and engaging as a discussion leader.
