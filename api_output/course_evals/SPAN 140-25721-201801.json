            "\u00a0I became more comfortable with the Spanish language, and I could have full conversations in a different language. I also gained a deeper appreciation for the culture and history of SPanish speaking countries that we learned about in class. ",

            "\u00a0I advanced my written, speaking, and reading Spanish capability. In particular, I advanced my usage of the subjunctive. ",

            "\u00a0pretty well run, not a lot of suggestions ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely my teacher and the materials that we read in our course packets about dictatorship, Batallas, etc. However, I did not enjoy the short films from the Enfoques book. I thought the videos were very cheesy and really did not help with anything like the readings or movie 'No' did. ",
            "\u00a0It definitely teaches a lot of grammar and vocab, but there could be more discussions to develop oral skills. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that sometimes the lessons could have been taught a little slower and a little more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the excellent instructor and the incorporation of literature and film into the course. Also the variety of modes of engagement - testing, speaking, and compositions was good.  The weaknesses were (a) the skill level of the students in the course varied too widely; (b) the book \"Batallas\" was not nearly as interesting as the short stories we read and the courses associated with the novel were rather dull since they involved mere reiteration of what all students wrote in their homework assignments the night before, and were thus not very interesting conversations. Also, it would be great to incorporate an at home longer essay into the course (perhaps with drafts corrected by the instructor.) ",
            "\u00a0Number of assessments was somewhat high and not very well spread out ",
            "\u00a0The grading system was a huge weakness of the course. I have classmates with different professors who graded so much more leniently than my professor. The problem was that the sections were not normalized, but instead based on a strict 94% A cutoff and so forth. While it is true that grading tests and quizzes can be objective, I think that the grading of presentations, participation, and the oral exam were subject to variability among professors. Thus, courses which involve sections taught and graded by various professors must be normalized before applying the final grade. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student. Coming from high school, I was anxious to get my language requirement out of the way with this class, but it quickly became my favorite class, and now I am excited to take many more SPanish classes in my future studies. ",
