To be honest I didn't do many of the readings but I think I'm getting by ok. Sometimes I found the lectures very boring and moving too fast, like I couldn't take in all of the info but I don't think other people found that. I like the grading structure. My TF was great. ",

            "\u00a0The course is designed to invite student participation and engagement with the material. The policy memos are particularly useful in analyzing the information given in lectures. The lectures themselves typically fit within a larger \"module\" on policy, but sometimes it is difficult to discern the connection between individual issues and those modules. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more class engagement. Though there was only 40 people, it felt like a much larger lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0Too much reading. Lectures don't seem to be connected to assignments at all and lectures don't adequately prepare you to write the memos. Lectures also tended to be hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The modules were great. I gained specific insight into issues such as climate change and criminal justice, allowing me to apply general concepts to specific issues. ",
            "\u00a0This class has many great parts that all feel disconnected, and the papers are all pushed to the end... which makes the workload crazier. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED writing memos for the class. Honestly my favorite assignment. I thought the material was interesting and Professor Hacker is super charismatic and interesting. He and the TF team clearly put a lot of care into the class. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how detail-intensive the course could be in order to provide a substantive backing for policy memos as well as the space given to students in section (or at least my section) to argue their own positions in relation to the material.  I might recommend incorporating a broader range of voices among the various policy narratives covered in the course.  This does not have to do with Professor Hacker's progressive leanings, but rather with the class narrative remaining hemmed in by the liberal-conservative binary and the domination of political science by economics, making it difficult to speak of policy analyses and justifications in any other language.  For instance, the unit on environmental policy makes reference to various policy typologies, but ultimately the full extent of the given policy spectrum is between carbon taxation and cap-and-trade. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers really interesting topics and my TA was great. However, there is too much reading and the lectures sometimes could have been more focused at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) I appreciated the broad and comprehensive survey of many different American policy issues. 2) The memos were very helpful and I feel like I improved a lot in my writing. Improvements: 1) Please put your readings online! The books are expensive and posed some financial challenges for me, especially the Democratic Policymaking book. Please consider having an online course reserve system that can be accessible by students or uploading the readings to canvas. This would make life so much easier for many students who have financial constraints that make it harder to participate in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures were well thought out and engaging. The module system made learning class concepts much easier. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: First, we spent a disproportionate amount of time on the history of US governing institutions. Additionally, for the writing sections, students typically had to write the first drafts of their memos before we'd covered the material from class. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting modules that cover both general public policy issues and specific and current debates including health care, budgetary spending, and environmental policy. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the term, Professor Hacker had expressed the desire to engage students in discussion but he didn't really achieve that. His slides also were not very helpful for students taking handwritten notes as he would jump around in the slide show making one's notes out of order. That said, I think his presentations were very well thought out and he clearly has a firm understanding of what he is speaking about. ",
            "\u00a0An overall weakness of the course is its assignments. The three policy memos essentially ask students to solve the most pressing issues facing the nation in the present moment. I was left discouraged since many of these issues really have no solution, and as a rational person, I was asked to come up with something and defend it, when essentially any of the options I chose weren't really great. If these problems were solvable, someone would have solved them already. It is a large task.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the grades for the three memos were placed in the second half of the course. Even when we had handed one memo in, when asked to receive my grade before the credit-D deadline, I was denied. Thus, students were faced with the decision to remain enrolled or enrolled for a grade with absolutely no bearing of how they were doing in the course, how their teachers liked their ideas, and how rigidly the papers would be graded. Knowing how the memos would be graded, I would have credit-Ded the class, but was denied this opportunity because of the inconsiderate placement of assessments and grading schedule. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were extremely relevant and helpful, however there was sometimes simply so much reading that students would either skim it or not read it at all. Many of the readings were chapters from books, and perhaps smaller selections of those same chapters would have held students' attention and been more effective. Aside from this, I think the class structure was effective and the assignments were extremely relevant and actually helped us learn (especially the policy memos). ",
            "\u00a0Cut down the reading lists, but I liked the real-world aspect of the policy memos ",
            "\u00a0This course is fascinating. The material is interesting and the topics are all different and important. Professor Hacker is engaging and incredibly knowledgeable. The readings are an excellent sampling of the different ways professionals think and write about this material. The readings are a bit too long, and this is sometimes very discouraging. There are no midterms, and you can choose to write a paper instead of taking the final. This is a nice feature, but also means that I did not master some of the more confusing parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself is good as an overview but rather disorganized, so can be hard to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0I think there was so much reading that a lot of it was unnecessary. I wish Prof Hacker would refine the readings required. If the amount of reading was more manageable, more people would actually do the reading. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is great. I would have preferred to spend more time on the specifics of each policy module, and less time on political philosophy and the more general political science models (like pivotal politics). Some of them were cool, but I think it would have been really interesting to hear about how the politics of public policy were actualized in specific legislative scenarios, like the ACA fight for healthcare. ",
            "\u00a0Policy memos were great. Learned a ton from researching for those. The lectures were a weak point. They rarely related to what we were studying, and didn't teach us how to research or analyze properly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the memo writing assignments, these were the most valuable part of the course. Biggest weakness was how disconnected lecture was to the assignments. Going to class was almost completely irrelevant if you're doing a writing section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The writing assignments in the form of the policy memo was the best method to get me to understand the course material and how politicians think. Professor Hacker did an excellent job of bringing in current events into lectures. The TFs were also very well-versed in course material which helped promote my understanding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was a lot of reading material that was not incorporated into lectures nor assignments. The prompts for the memos were exceptionally long considering we were limited to 4-5 pages. Also, Prof. Hacker's lectures began to get more dry as the semester went on. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone with a basic knowledge and desire to learn more about health and environmental policy in the US. ",
            "\u00a0No - I took this class thinking it would be great to learn how to write policy memos and sorely regretted it. Lectures don't help you at all in writing memos, so it really depends on your TA whether or not you'll know enough to write them. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Not too difficult, interesting material, and fun assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone in the Political Science department looking for substantive engagement with policy writing.  Professor Hacker is skilled in not only explaining the details of public policy, but situating the policymaking process within the power hierarchies that produce policy outcomes and make certain policies harder to pass and implement than others. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a good overview of important topics in public policy. If you care to learn about the material, you can get good information out of it. However, it can at times be somewhat basic if you already know a lot about politics and lecture isn't always the most riveting. Some units (like the one about healthcare policy) are more informative and useful than the others. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I thought it was a great opportunity for writing policy memos and learning from one of the top figures in health policy. If you've taken other political science courses at Yale, you will likely be learning a lot of the same concepts in the beginning of the class until you get to the actual concrete policy arenas. When you get there, however, the material is extremely interesting and insightful into today's politics. I think this class would be a great foundation to any student remotely interested in public policy-- even if you don't intend to go into a political or policy-related career. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah I think they should, as long as they get a good TF. Mine was terrible, but a few of the other were really good. Some of the reading is actually really interesting and profound, and if given the chance to engage in productive discussions about it, a lot could be learned. With a poor TF, even these good readings are tedious. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a political science student (or related major) with an interest in American policy, then definitely take the course! It is a great survey course for understanding the huge breadth of American policy issues. A great course for people interested in going into government or politics. It's definitely detail-heavy, which was great for me, but might not be good for students who don't care about public policy as much. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Not only do you learn the tools of policy analysis but writing memos provide the opportunity to apply those skills. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the lectures are very informative and the assignments are very interesting to research and test your ability to come up with creative solutions to policy issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in fostering political change. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  this class explained key, underlying factors that influence contemporary American politics and I think this is important for all students to understand. I would recommend this class to any student, regardless of major, because it will provide them with a strong understanding of American politics and allow them to articulate their political views clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Its super interesting and all the material is relevant and important. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you're not a poli sci major, this is a class anyone can benefit from.  You gain a much deeper understanding of the political dynamics in America and the policies that really matter in our lifetimes. ",
            "\u00a0Only if youre considering the polisci major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, especially as a course you take early on as a political science major or to see if you like this area, if you want to work in policy or something. It's a pretty chill intro. Lots of different topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in politics and current events, this is a great course for you. Professor Hacker is really excited about the material and an excellent resource. If you have little to no background in the course topics already and are looking for an introduction, the course is designed less for you and isn't organized for that purpose. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have a much increased understanding of policymaking and public policy. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course! The memos are very worthwhile, and the lectures are fun. I would highly recommend taking a WR section and doing the final paper, rather than taking the exam. There is too much readingso I hope that'll changebut if not, just be prepared for that component of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes i would recommend it. If you have a good TA, and are at least slightly interested by the lectures, then the policy memos will make it worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would because the writing skills are extremely worthwhile and marketable for future careers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was a phenomenal introduction to the art of American policy-making. We covered great topics that were relevant and learned political science concepts behind them that allowed us to formulate our own policy approach. "
