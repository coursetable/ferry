            "\u00a0Most of all, an awareness of the fact that writing regularly is good for (a) reflection as a human being and (b) for developing style and good writing habits. It taught me how to be productive in a fairly regimented way, which, as a junior, will be helpful as I tackle a thesis next year. (Even though my thesis will be in history and not creative.) Meetings with my tutor were helpful, as she emphasized the finer points of style and narrative and gave me an opportunity to reread my own writing critically. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to get better at writing fast, there really isn't any other way to do it but this class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought I learned a lot by having to produce thoughts, not just consume them, every day. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything, the exercise of writing every day pushed me to think more carefully about the words that I use and how my writing voice comes across. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciate that this course forced me to write every day. It has helped me to make writing a much bigger part of my life which I love. It also has encouraged me to experiment and to try writing in a variety of different styles. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible course. Really challenged me and helped me grow as a writer. Real, applicable critiques for all of my writing, a variety of prompts that push you outside your comfort zone in a positive way. My favorite English class ever, hands down. ",
            "\u00a0The act of writing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved so much this semester! I learned to experiment with many types of writing, pay attention to what words convey the meaning I want, view paragraphs as architecture rather than polished prose. ",
            "\u00a0Too many to name. Daily Themes is advertised as an \"experience\" which it truly was. The most ovbvious result of taking the course was improved writing, but I was surprised to see how writing everyday also improved the way I communicated in daily conversations. Forced to articulate myself in the most alluring way on paper, I found that the course also taught me to be a better conversationalist. ",

            "\u00a0None. ",

            "\u00a0I really loved this course! I think my writing improved a lot and I really enjoyed the work for it.  I had great conversations with my tutor and felt like I gained a lot of confidence in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more with an open mind. I learned how to write under pressure, and I learned how to be creative with my memories. I learned how to approach different topics of writing in creative ways (ex. punctuation, sentence structure, diction, etc.). Finally, I learned how to self-evaluate my writing in an honest and critical way! ",
            "\u00a0Daily writing was helpful for my writing, but way more intense than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more efficiently and concisely. ",
            "\u00a0I became very introspective and appreciated having to write every day - didn't really appreciate all the quotes though ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about writing, and what it means to revise, and how to try to disengage perfectionism from the process of trying to find the right words to describe a feeling or an experience. I learned to tolerate a style of teaching that was at first uncomfortable, and I learned to produce a consistent output of work. ",
            "\u00a0Writing everyday has greatly expanded my range of skills. Going into the course I definitely focused on creative nonfiction, but over the course of the semester, I have developed the ability to write longer fictional pieces. ",

            "\u00a0Point blank, this course improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0Developed skills not only as a writer but as an observer of the world around me in ways that I didn't expect to improve coming into the course. As Prof. Zarin would say, I improved my ability to \"have the next thought,\" that is to take one thought and explore the whys and hows of how it came to be and to take it somewhere new. "

            "\u00a0A clear strength is the pedagogy: you write 350 words a day, 5 days a week, 12 weeks of the semester. I think this is such a good way to become a writer and to carve out a comfortable writing space in one's life (both psychologically and time-wise within the day). It felt good to set aside 45 minutes or an hour to spend on my themes, knowing that it didn't have to be a huge daily commitment but that it would be a present one.\r\n\r\nI did not find the lectures particularly engaging. It would have been nice to spend more time close-reading fewer texts instead of quickly reading over a larger number of texts. The themes also sometimes got a little bit repetitive maybe the tutors could have submitted theme ideas (or maybe they already do, in which case perhaps students could). ",
            "\u00a0I had a great tutor, but some friends weren't so lucky. Your tutor really makes or breaks the experience, Donald Brown was able to advise and push me towards better writing gently and effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were quite uninspiring and didn't usually make me think about new ways to approach the themes for the week. The course's biggest strength is simply is structure; it would be difficult to get nothing out of writing every day. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. The themes are diverse and it's helpful to hear other students' work. I think the lectures could have been more relevant to the actual writing we do, and the feedback could have been more improvement-based and less vague. ",
            "\u00a0The tutor meetings and prompts are excellent, as is the workload because it's heavy but manageable. However, the lectures were boring, vague, and had little to do with improving our writing or writing at all, really. This class really should be taught seminar-style in my opinion, and definitely by a better instructor. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were consistently great.\r\n\r\nOne element of personal preference, if it would be possible next year for the lectures to be on a Monday (maybe in the morning) so that themes fell M-F instead of T-S that would be vastly preferable. I found the themes later in the week through my schedule off-kilter. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could relate more to the act of writing and be less philosophical. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: open-endedness of work; writing tutor sessions were extremely helpful. I love how the course allows for so much consistent feedback. Weakness: the lectures were a little dull sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not an efficient use of time. They rarely inspired for the week of prompts. Although, that being said, all the guest lectures were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0That there is a very specific right way to write in this class and its hard to feel creatively free ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the tutoring sessions, but I didn't think lectures were that helpful. It was really cool to have the guest lectures, but I didn't like the lectures Professor Zarin gave. ",
            "\u00a0Very few strengths to this course, many weaknesses. The primary weakness is that your experience depends on the people chosen to teach the class and tutor, and I was out of luck with both. None of the lectures were at all helpful, nor were any of my tutoring sessions. The prompts were bland and didn't make me think--I can't believe I wasted a credit on this class. ",
            "\u00a0More guest lecturers! I also think X themes make the class more stressful and less condusive to positive perceptions of our own pieces, though I would love to read more of my classmates writing!! ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course.  I thought the themes themselves were the best part of it and the one-on-one interaction with the tutors was really helpful and engaging.  I thought overall, the lectures could be improved though.  They often seemed a little vague and I would've appreciated more concrete advice (which of course is hard to give in creative writing courses). ",
            "\u00a0Writing regularly is a great way to improve, so the course obviously is strong in that regard: Its greatest attribute is the daily writing. A second strength is the focus on student work: each lecture features a sampling of \"exceptional\" student submissions from the week; I found it very helpful to see what and how my peers were approaching the week's prompts--I learn a great deal just by reading what others had written. The lectures are not incredibly structured or comprehensive, but they are often interesting (in a lofty, abstract sort of way). And it is very helpful to receive regular, one-on-one feedback from tutors. That said, tutoring sessions are a bit brief (30 minutes). When you have five ~400 word essays to go over in such little time, the feedback becomes very broad--or it is specific, but some pieces go nearly unedited. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Creative assignments, great tutors, manageable workload\r\nWeaknesses: HORRIBLE LECTURER. ",
            "\u00a0More flexibility to take time off from writingit was very difficult sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a good course but it would be good to be able to skip some days. I also felt at times that the prompts were too specific, and that I didn't always know what my tutor was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the TF's - mine was Shifra Sharlin. I learned so much from hearing her talk about mine and others' writing. She structured the learning process in an interesting way, whereby she helped me treat my last week's writing as launchpads for the next. Some of the lectures were interesting, although it was hard to tell whether I was learning anything, but I think that's related to my being a poor judge of my own work. I really enjoyed a couple of the guest lectures. I think the course needs to be more aware of itself as a space that's not universally accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the structure of the class. I find that a lecture and a meeting once a week allows the writers to go off on their own during the week but still get the support they need. The one weakness was that sometimes the lectures felt a little scattered. ",
            "\u00a0The best part is the part you do yourself, namely the daily writing. The lectures dont add much value to the class and should really be revamped to actually focus on writing. ",
            "\u00a0The daily theme assignment format and the prompts are great-- challenging and engaging-- and it's a type of course structure that you can't find anywhere else at Yale. The lectures were not very focused or useful. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly one-on-one meeting with your writing tutor is the greatest strength of Daily Themes. Sometimes lecture was a little dry, but it's only one hour a week. ",
            "\u00a0Although Professor Zarin's prose is nice to listen to, I didn't come away with much of anything walking out of a lecture. I would have appreciated more textual analysis or some kind of writing skills/perspective focus for each week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the 1-1 meetings with the tutors in which we were given specific feedback about our writing. The weaknesses were the lectures! Can't say I learned anything from any of them. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures can be incredibly boring. However, the one-on-one work done with the tutor is invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the guest lectures, especially the quasi-guest lecture on character (the guest lecturer couldn't be there so Zarin ran the activity), but sometimes the lectures felt a little disorganized. The tutorial sessions were the most worthwhile part of the course for me, and having direct feedback greatly improved my skills as a writer. "

        [
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the pedagogy and the theory behind writing daily, definitely take this class. The lectures are kind of dry, but the tutors are phenomenal and will help you think about your writing in new ways. There's also lots of space to try out different kinds of writing in this class analytical, more poetic, fiction, non-fiction. But do be aware that it is a significant commitment: you will be spending 45 minutes or more 5 nights a week writing your themes. ",
            "\u00a0A classic! Lecture is short and only once a week, and a great excuse to make yourself do the writing you've been wanting to. ",

            "\u00a0I think I would have a conversation first about what they were looking to get out of the course. I think that having that idea going in would have been useful. Or at least framing it in a way that was more self-reflective than anything else. ",

            "\u00a0Unless you've taken an intro language recently, you probably won't be used to doing daily work. Be sure that that's a commitment you want to take on. I found some days more of a slog than I'd like to admit ",

It is obviously a large commitment and I would recommend taking it while also taking a literature course or one that involved reading a lot. The course itself does not have much or any reading which would have been useful for a course on learning to write. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless they really enjoy writing a specific way every day ",

            "\u00a0DO NOT take this class. Lecture is abysmal, and not helpful at all. Your experience mainly depends on your tutor, and I got almost no feedback from mine. The whole class was a waste of time. I can't believe I wasted a credit on this class. I love writing and have taken many creative writing courses at Yale, and this was hands down the worst. Might have a better experience with a new Prof or a different tutor, but I'm not convinced this class is worth it at all. Even the prompts were bland and didn't make me think or push me as a writer. Over all, useless. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class, whether you are a writer or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is good writing practice and one-on-one tutoring is fantastic! I write good now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anybody and everybody, humanities majors, STEM majors, people who've never written in their lives, etc.  It was such a great experience and I wish everybody at Yale would take it. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED Daily Themes. Before I applied to the course, I knew I wanted to take a class that would really change the way I write, and I knew that I learned best by actually writing--not just by being told how to write well. Daily Themes was the perfect venue for that kind of intense, fruitful learning experience. When you write five days a week, sometimes you write well, sometimes you don't--but it is always comforting, and motivating, to know that each theme is just a single attempt at better writing. Indeed, for this reason, Daily Themes offered me the chance to learn who I was as a writer more than had any other class: it gave me opportunities to fail (as all writers inevitably do) without great consequence, and it also gave me many (60!) opportunities to try and succeed (whereas in other normal writing courses you may write 5 or 6 papers at most). If this sounds like heaven to you, take the class! You won't be disappointed. You will be disappointed, however, if you are taking this to learn grammar, or to sit in a mind-blowing lecture, or to read great writing. You'll  do none of that, especially if the course maintains its current structure. Sure, there are small tips on clarity, and the lectures are interesting, and the selected readings are helpful, but this class is first and foremost about the daily assignments and your own will to learn through them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Writing every day is super fun, and it helps you become a better writer regardless of which level you start out on. The meetings with the tutors are invaluable, and you get to develop a great relationship with someone who reads your work every day for 5 days a week. Also, you just get to reflect a lot on every aspect of you life. It's so fun!! ",
            "\u00a0If you are certain you want to take it, and if you don't have other high-workload classes. ",
            "\u00a0YES! your writing may not improve recognizably, but you will feel accomplished and definitely have more writing samples than you did beforehand! some guest speakers are fantastic also ",
            "\u00a0I think I would. It's an important exercise for anyone to take on. And it's a different kind of work output, which helps when you're trying to balance a lot of different classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take this course! In the rare case that you get nothing from the lectures and TA instruction, this class forces you to write everyday, and that in itself will help you improve. ",
            "\u00a0If youre willing to write a lot and frequently, this is the perfect class for you. But what you get out of the class depends a lot on you (and which tutor youre randomly assigned). ",
            "\u00a0The great thing about this course is that you're forced to write 5 days a week on various different topics. If you want to grow as a writer, particularly a creative writer, this is a great way to push yourself and just get in those hours of practice. I would recommend it, just for the sheer quantity and variety of writing you do. It's fun and challenging! But the actual instruction in the course itself can be pretty useless, so be prepared for that. Lecture is boring and scattered, and I never really got much out of it. And I'm sure your experience varies a lot based on who your writing tutor is. ",
            "\u00a0Yee ",
            "\u00a0Take Daily Themes. Take it if you're an English major or a computer science major or anything in between. It will make you a better writer and a better student. This feels like a quintessential part of the Yale experience and you should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Being not much of a writer, I had a huge deal of difficulty with the first few weeks of this class, even up until the end. You will get a lot out of the class, but know what you're getting into. It can be incredibly frustrating and time-consuming. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IF YOU WANT YOUR WRITING TO GET BETTER. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. There is a reason this course has been offered at Yale for more than a hundred years. At times it is frustrating and difficult and annoying, but the simple act of writing every day is an exercise that has an unmatched impact. The tutorials are wonderful, and it's awesome to see other people's work through X Themes. "
