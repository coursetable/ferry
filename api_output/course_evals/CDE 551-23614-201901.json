            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of global non-communicable disease. I think a strength is the breadth of topics, but the weakness would be the depth of which we explore these topics. That being said, it is impossible to have both. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot in this class! It's well-paced, and I appreciate that you're mostly able to choose assignments based on what interests you. Be aware that it meets during reading week, so if you have a lot of exams this might be an issue. The class is small, which helps in terms of the learning environmenta lot of student-led conversation and in general a pretty relaxed vibe. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great introduction course to NCDs. The first half focused on specific diseases seemed more useful to me because you walk away with concrete learnings. Some of the readings in the second half were a bit vague and might benefit from a case study to focus conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. It was structured to first provide an over view of the problem that NCDs pose to global health and then work through the different sectors and potential solutions to take action on this issue. Every class involved both lectures and discussions that were engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Thought provoking (particularly towards the end when we start focusing on potential solutions for the global NCD crisis), the lectures were phenomenal (I really liked the group activities)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly reading reflections were very time consuming, I would prefer to do reading reflections every other week or by theme. Also there was a very quick turnaround between the group paper and the final paper, which made it difficult to do well on both. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course. Dr. Hawley gave us an overview of noncommunicable diseases across the globe, explained different strategies to intervene in public health issues and encouraged us to think critically about data and studies. It's difficult to come up with something that should be changed, but perhaps it was a little back-loaded in terms of assignments. I think it would have been helpful for the group paper to be due right after spring break so there could have been more time to focus on the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class; it provided a great overview of the Big 4 NCDs (plus some others!), tuned us into the high-level conversations taking place around NCDs, introduced us to several new public health tools, and curated phenomenal guest speakers and readings.\r\n\r\nIt was interesting for me to take this class after Big 3, which I'd say is the communicable disease equivalent of this course. I actually think that it could work well to establish some formal links between the class to minimize redundancies (e.g. who are the big actors in global health, tools for looking at burden of disease, etc.) and share best practices from each one (though this might speak to the larger need to strengthen the global health curriculum). One thing that I liked about Big 3 is that I feel like I left with a more solid understanding of the biology of the diseases covered and what the treatment guidelines are; I actually think that the Big 4 NCDs could be spread out so that we cover one per class, and spend time diving into how it affects the body, what medication or behavior change is required, etc., perhaps with the help of an MD guest speaker. Big 3 also had quizzes (only worth 5% of the grade) on each disease, which honestly was a good way to solidify that knowledge.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed covering possible solutions, and thought that the guest lectures on essential medicines and health systems strengthening were particularly great. I also enjoyed all of the interactive exercises that Dr. Hawley set up for us, such as integrating communicable/NCD systems, the exercise of what to do with an NCD grant in Samoa, and mini-case study presentations.\r\n\r\nThe readings were almost always interesting and a reasonable workload. I liked the flexibility of the weekly write-up format, but also think that customized questions for each week's topic might be more interesting than the current template.\r\n\r\nOne other thing--having two papers due at the end of the semester was a lot of work, especially for second-semester second years who are writing a thesis and/or recruiting. I actually really enjoyed both papers, and the systematic review was particularly interesting because I learned new tools in the process (more classes should require meeting with the medical librarian!), but perhaps one could be due at the mid-term and one could be due at the end of the semester? ",
            "\u00a0It was very good! Lots of interesting discussion and coverage of global NCDs. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing. The course material is very interesting and gives students a great overview of what global health really is, especially in the context of NCD. What really made this course superb was Nicky herself. She is so passionate about the subject, is clearly an expert in the field, and really developed a positive and collaborative learning environment. My only quip is that the course was very heavy on the coursework. We had weekly reading summaries, and then two term papers and a group presentation that were all due at around the same time. This was particularly taxing for graduating students working on theses and post-grad plans. I didn't really understand the point of having two huge papers due at the end of the semester; one would have been fine. "

            "\u00a0Professor Hawley is a great teacher. She facilitates a positive learning environment and encourages participation. My only suggestion would be that we have one assignment due around midterms and the other due at the end. It was a very back-heavy course load. ",
            "\u00a0Nicky is great! Super down to earth, obviously knows her stuff, brings in great guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hawley is dedicated to her students and provided feedback on our reading summaries each week to ensure all questions were answered. Class was comfortable and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Hawley is one of the best lecturers that I have had. Even though the course was based around lectures, she constantly engaged us in discussion that deepened our understanding of the topic and made the material even more engaging. She really passed on her passion for this subject and the importance of advocacy in this area. She provided great feedback on our projects and papers as we worked on them. ",
            "\u00a0I love Prof. Hawley! She is very open to hearing from all students and is very engaging with the class. Her lectures are very interesting and I really looked forward to class. If I could nitpick a weakness it is that at times she seemed pretty inflexible regarding papers and sometimes it was hard to reach her (but this semester had some extenuating circumstances which is understandable). ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Hawley was an incredible instructor. She gave her students lots of support and individual attention, as well as regular feedback. Even though it met for 2 hours every week, her lectures and class activities were always engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hawley is one of the best teachers I have encountered at YSPH. She quickly created a great learning environment where everyone was engaged and felt comfortable asking questions and presenting their ideas. She clearly put a lot of time and effort into preparing for class, and I always walked away feeling as though time was well-spent. Perhaps most impressively, she provided an incredible amount of very specific and personalized feedback on each and every assignment. ",

            "\u00a0Nicky was absolutely amazing. She is so approachable, passionate, articulate, and provides great and timely feedback. You can tell just how much she cares about the course and the students. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides an overview of global noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and ways that governments, NGOs and individuals can intervene at various levels. It's important to take a course like this alongside others on infectious diseases, as NCDs affect a lot more people than most would know. ",
