            "\u00a0This was the best class I took at Yale University. ",
            "\u00a0Best class ever! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I know, I know, the course has a weird name and may not sound like the type of course you should be taking in law school... But that opinion is wrong. As an undergrad, I never had the opportunity to take philosophy classes but I always had a desire to do so. This class gave me an opportunity to do so during law school and I am so happy I took it up. Twenty years from now, this may be the only course I still think about and that continues to impact my world view. This class is all about the deepest questions in life: what is existence? what is my place in things? what is a good life? And Professor Kronman is an absolutely entrancing, kind, genius who will guide you, week-by-week, to having, at the very least, a framework for thinking about these questions. Do yourself a favor, enroll in it and embrace the journey. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an absolute gift. Tony brings a fantastic energy to the classroom, to compliment his vast wealth of knowledge on the thinkers we studied. In short, it's everything one might hope from a class about big ideas: our discussions of philosophy and theology were always engaging, always open to different perspectives, and always collegial. Tony was a great instructor: friendly, in complete control of the material, and always up to answer hard questions. I'll miss this course next semester, and I'd heartily recommend it to anyone with a shred of intellectual curiosity. "
