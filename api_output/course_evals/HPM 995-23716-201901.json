            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting topics, very experienced professor, workload is fair\r\nWeaknesses: learning expectations not always clear, expectations not balanced between students with very different levels of healthcare industry experience (ex. should encourage non-MD/MBA students to feel qualified to speak up) ",
            "\u00a0Great! I learned so much about new ventures and ways of thinking in public health. The team did a great job of picking cases and curating the syllabus to provide insight into what can be a crowded market with new ventures happening in various field. ",

            "\u00a0The class does not need to be 3 hours, especially in the evening with no food provided. While there was a lot of good information in these sessions, it always ran over by a minimum of 15 minutes. It also would get off topic and the professor would expect answers that weren't covered in the class preparation materials. ",
            "\u00a0Poor facilitation of discussions, excessive amounts of repetitive readings, and not challenging enough to actually critically analyze or study anything interesting ",
            "\u00a0strengths: a broad range of topics covered by this module. highly encouraging environment to speak up in class. ",
            "\u00a0I was very much looking forward to this course, but was overall left extremely disappointed and annoyed. I hate to say this because all my experiences and courses at SOM have been nothing but positive, btu this was easily the worst class I took while at SOM. It is unfortunate this is considered our capstone and a 'culmination' of all we have learned. The strengths were that the case studies could actually be interesting, but weaknesses were the professor, lack of structure or any key takeaway points during discussion. There were one or two interesting guest speakers, but some also got carried away and did not offer helpful takeaways. ",
            "\u00a0- too much emphasis on class participation and discussion. This motivated students just to speak for the sake of getting participation points and also skewed the grading in the favor of those who did that. Not every student is very talkative or comfortable speaking repeatedly in such a large classroom setting. The grading was completely fair as the final course grades were heavily weighed on this one portion of the class\r\n- the grading for the presentation was also unfair and harsh. It also favored those who were free and able to present earlier, by giving them bonus points that truly give them too much of an edge and skewed the average grade. \r\n- there were never any comments on the written assignments. I received a 2.5 or 2 out of three on majority of assignments with no feedback and thus, I had no way to improve or understand the nature of my grade. Even though I was doing above average on the assignments, my grade reflected participation much more heavily. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very interesting but they were lengthy and the case write-up was a way of synthesizing all of that information. Overall, the discussion was thought-provoking but I do think there was too much emphasis on asking us open-ended questions rather than sharing actual facts/industry trends. If the time of this class changed from 4-7 to 1-4 that would be amazing ",
            "\u00a0interesting course that focuses on a variety of innovation examples for health care (not just the expected \"tech\" innovations)\r\nreally cool to have the founders/leaders of the companies studied sit in on class with us to hear our input regarding the case study and answer our questions personally. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learning about new innovation in the healthcare space\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: a little too much class conversation- appreciated that everyone spoke, but it came to a point that people were speaking just for the sake of getting the participation points. ",
            "\u00a0My favourite course at Yale so far. It effectively combine so many different concepts in healthcare strategy, innovation, economics and finances, to think critically about the future. I enjoyed the discussions in each class session and the professor does an exceptional job of leading the discussion in a methodical manner. I would take this course every year if I could.\r\n\r\nImprovements - a session on international innovations; there is much to be learned from other countries too ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course.  Excellent topics.  I would like to see more stuff on operations of a hospital, but it only a soft suggestion. \r\n\r\nHowever, I would recommend that having a pre-conference call with the presenters is very important.  Some of the presenters were asked very pointed questions, and they were not ready to answer them candidly.  So its important for the presenters to be ready to be candid with the audience, if they try to hide behind something else it shows through in their presentation, ",

They have a patch that goes across the stomach and a digital sensor in the pill that allows for drug compliance to be tracked. Innovative? Sure yes. Useful? Maybe. Sustainable? Hard no. The course repeatedly talks about the problem of rising costs in US healthcare, yet we're presented with stuff like this in class?\r\n\r\nHave absolutely no idea how this was marked as a Capstone course for the health policy MPH track when there was virtually no discussion about policy. It's a supposed to be a joint course, but was so business orientated. Class participation for credit also highly irritating and just forced people to say stuff for the sake of saying it to get. Getting rid of this will actually facilitate genuine discussion. \r\n\r\nClass ran late every single time despite being 3 hours long!! ",
            "\u00a0- Unorganized canvas - it takes a long time to comb through all the files to see which ones are required readings\r\n- Artificially extending classon a Monday night please let students leave at 7, it has been a long day\r\n- Professor has a really soothing voice, which can unintentionally put you to sleep on Monday night\r\n- Presentations are supposed to take 25 min.. consistently take up 40+ mins each \r\n- MBA/MPH students arent the same as eMBA. We are much younger but also have existing content knowledge re: PBMs, basic healthcare things ",
            "\u00a0The course content was fine, but there was a large gap in the understanding of those in the room. It felt like a lot of our class time was spent reviewing things that everyone knew and understood and it was dumbed down too much. However, the subject matter and speakers that came in were both very interesting ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - great guest speakers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - classroom dialogue is not well-facilitated and comments did not build on each other/people weren't redirected if they were going on a tangent; wish there was more time for guest speakers (or that they were put at the beginning and then allowed to leave); student presentations did not relate to the content of class ",

However, some discussions and presentation Q&A's seemed to have digressed greatly from the main point of the student group presentations, causing the class to go significantly over time. Would be great to follow what was stated in the syllabus, instead of having some project groups present and answer class questions for an hour, while others presented for the expected 20 mins. Doesn't seem fair for some groups to answer questions for 40 minutes while other groups only had to answer questions for 10 minutes and still be graded on the same scale. ",

It's great to get opinions and hear about the vast experience of those in the classroom, but this cannot be used to guide the entire class. It is completely reflective of who says what in the class that day and there is no structured key-takeaways. \r\n- The speakers often handled Q&A inappropriately and came off as them defending their product/service. ESP the mental health app speakers ",

I do think he didn't really teach that much and wanted us to just candidly debate with each other and talk about our opinions. It was more of a seminar which wasn't what I was expecting given how large the class size was. ",

At a certain point, Dr. Licholai is an accomplished leader in healthcare, we all want to hear what he has to say rather than 3 hours of opinions from fellow students. ",

Also didnt help that he kept our group in front of the class for 45 minutes when the expectation was 10 minutes for group presentations - his standards felt very inconsistent across the board and based on his personal preferences.

Felt like a really bad way to wrap up my coursework \r\n- going over much too basic of information which really discouraged me from participating further (I was already wary because the whole class depended on participation/people wanting to get participation points) --> No real lecture/insight from the professor\r\n- we needed more tangible strategies/information that we can take with us in the future. I thought this class was simply an open forum for people to exchange ideas that were regurgitated over and over again. ",
