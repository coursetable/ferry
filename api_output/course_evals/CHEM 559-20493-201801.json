One way to improve the course would be to allow students to have more time to read the articles for discussion, either by enforcing that the articles are submitted earlier or by learning about a technique on Wednesday and discussing on the following Monday. As someone who had an extremely busy Monday schedule, it was frustrating to have to read the article and write a discussion report because a classmate couldn't be bothered to submit their article until late Sunday night.
