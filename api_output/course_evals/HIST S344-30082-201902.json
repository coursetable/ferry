            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about the Middle East from the end of the 18th century right up to today, and helped me understand the different relations between states, and how they developed. This course also helped me improve my ability to read and analyse primary sources, using information from the classroom to contextualise the sources. It definitely sparked an interest, which I will develop further by reading more about Middle Eastern history! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a little bit about the history of the Middle East from the decline of the Ottoman Empire to more modern times. This class slightly helped me get a better grasp on the context for which modern conflicts in the region today came from. ",
            "\u00a0The reforms of the late Ottoman Empire, the creation of the mandate system after WWI, the rise of the Arab nationalist states and Gulf monarchies during the Cold War.\r\n\r\nIslam, orientalism, colonialism, imperialism, oil and gender ",
            "\u00a0I learned detailed information about modern Middle eastern history as well as how to engage with complicated texts and larger political and philosophical issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Ottoman history from the early 18th century to its fall and the history of surrounding states up to the most recent Arab Spring movement in Bahrain. I also learned how to better analyze source material through first-hand engagement with primary sources. Furthermore, I improved my essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0One major insight Ive obtained from the class is how much the Ottoman Empire has impacted the Balkans, as well as letting me know why do the modern middle eastern states and borders exist and are at its place today. Ive also learned a lot on 19th-century onward diplomacy between middle eastern states themselves and with the west, and I have also learned about how that have changed throughout the last 200 years, and what happened between these countries diplomatically that eventually lead to a major historical or modern day event. ",
            "\u00a0I mostly learned about the Ottoman Empire and all the factors involved in its dissolution, which helped me to understand the ''why'' behind Middle East diverse politics and culture. I also learned about modern politics in Iran, Israel and North-African countries. This led me to understand much better the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and also the political context in Egypt during the 1960-1970s, related to Pan-Arabism, indebtedness and massive development projects. In addition, after taking the course I can identify better what part the Middle East has had in world politics and in what ways it has been subject to major powers domination and influence. Lastly, I could say that I gained better skills in the way I organize the information I receive in class. We used a method of ''ID concepts'' that helped me to notice the relevance and general info of each event or idea, and in that way they kept stuck in my mind. "

            "\u00a0The course content was very fascinating and relevant, and the readings set were interesting. Mr Kynn's PowerPoints and resources he made (his timelines) were extremely informative and useful, and they helped me study for the midterm and final! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that the material was very interesting. I personally felt like the class had many weaknesses in the summer. Whoever is to blame is open to debate, but the class was not well-suited to the structure it had this summer and felt very disorganized. The activities that few did in the first half of the course felt like mostly wastes of time. The powerpoint toward the end of the course became hard to follow, as there was often not enough helpful information of the slides itself and rather just a list of terms or dates. The exams were not well-structured; the ID questions, while a fine format in theory, did not work well since so few were picked that it was not representative of the knowledge gained in class at all. The essay questions were also a bit frustrating, particularly on the first exam, where it felt like the professor wanted us to all answer a specific way, which did not occur. The readings were good, but often not utilized or necessary for class. All these issues aside, I think the biggest issue was not drawing together all the different topics/themes/events together in a cohesive unit, which is the point of the class. Mostly, it felt like we would just jump around from event A in Country A to event B in Country B with no connection at all, making studying for the exam very difficult. The final was hard to study for since we also had to plan the outline for the essay right before then. I think the whole class needs to be restructured, at least in view of the way it was this summer. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very good course for students who want to learn about modern Middle East history, the reading assignments facilitated the understanding of the topic and the syllabus was very structured ",
            "\u00a0I feel that there was quite a bit of group work, which was fine considering how long the lessons were. I also liked going to the Beinecke and the YUAG to look at primary material.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think perhaps a few more written assignments would have been better for us to better engage with the reading we were allocated. ",
            "\u00a0A particular strength of the course is that every single detail that we have to learn are organized properly in lectures and on review materials, as well as a rather chronologically ordered timeline for everything we have learned. However, I would think that it is better for students to begin the session by refreshing on terms and ideas taught in previous classes, so that not only are students getting a chance to refresh their mind and talk about what have they learned, but also a good way to prepare for the finals as a class on top of having review sheets. ",
            "\u00a0For the strengths, I can say that it was well organized and the professor seemed very dedicated with the preparation of the material. Also, I could tell that he knew about what he was talking about and how passionate he felt about the topics. In addition, I know he tried to make the 3-hour class more entertaining with group dynamics or activities outside of the classroom. In the last place, the professor answered the emails quickly and he showed interest in answering our doubts. For the weaknesses, I have to admit that besides all the positive part, this has not been one of my favorite courses. The reason is that it was really difficult for me to understand the broader picture of the historic events that we were taught. Also, I think the explanations were not meant to connect the history with the contemporary era. Sometimes, I felt that I was receiving a lot of facts that I couldn't connect or fully understand. And there were a lot of readings (which I understand because the course was meant to be dense) but sometimes I didn't have the time to read everything and those days I was simply lost. This was disappointing because I wanted to rely on the explanation but I couldn't. Again, I felt that I was listening to a bunch of facts. As I said, Kynn is a passionate professor and he knows the material very well, but he should improve the way he explains, so we can connect the dots and understand why all modern Middle East history is relevant now.

            "\u00a0Yes - I would recommend this course to another student. It helped me understand the intricate relations between states in the Middle East, as well as how each nation developed to the way it is today, and why it developed in that particular way. Reading news about the Middle East will be a lot easier for me now, and I'll be able to understand contemporary events in the Middle East much more now with a clearer understanding of its history. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend the course to another student, at least the way it was this summer. I really felt like I didn't learn much at all in this class and was mostly just frustrated. It was hard to study for the midterm and final because I realized I had fundamental gaps in basic knowledge of the region that should have been better taught in class. The final essay seemed like it was changed last minute and seemed like busy work. Class was also frustrating because there was really only one (sometimes two) person(s) who would speak and were sometimes disrespectful to other students in the class, leading most of the rest of us to just kind of sit there for 3 hours. Overall, I was really excited for this course because it seemed interesting, but I acme out feeling like I had wasted my time but more importantly a lot of money. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it was a very good course for students who want to learn about modern Middle East history, the reading assignments facilitated the understanding of the topic and the syllabus was very structured ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is quite helpful in learning the context behind a lot of the issues happening in the middle east right now. So I would definitely recommend it to another student in that sense. However, I understand some students prefer a more lecture based class, and some may not agree with the group work/discussions held during the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course is very detailed, and it allows students to understand the Middle East and their development from rather traditional, industrially-behind monarchies into modern states, as well as the background understanding on why the Middle East is what it is today.
