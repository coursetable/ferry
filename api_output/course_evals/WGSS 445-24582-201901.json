            "\u00a0Professor Browne's class helped me develop critical thinking skills that linked modern manifestations of the surveillance state to long histories and large systems of control and power. I learned to think about surveillance and resistance as both manifold, and to question the premises on which surveillance is justified. Professor Browne did a great job of demonstrating how race and gender both undergird structures of surveillance, and also helped us learn how to apply what we were learning to our everyday lives. Perhaps what I most appreciated about this class is that, though it was academically rigorous and substantial, it also insisted on bringing the conventionally \"non-academic,\" like pop culture, into the discussion. I am so grateful for this, because I feel like I'm leaving the course with a real toolset for how to approach daily life, and for how to think about the things that I interact with commonly, through a lens of surveillance, race, and gender studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the field of surveillance studies and how race and gender intersect with the practice. I learned to think critically about different forms of technology and the history of how surveillance practices have evolved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about surveillance in this class, both its history and contemporary applications. Professor Browne connected the state of surveillance today in with histories of surveillance through slavery and the Black Power movement. I learned to make critical analyses of cultural objects and performance art, including videos, images, memes, memoirs, etc. I learned so much about airports, surveillance that is both gendered and racialized, and about modes of counter-surveillance/refusal/resistance.  We also visited the archives, where I learned about critically engaging with primary sources and Yale's legacy of archival collection. ",
            "\u00a0Analyses of the differing surveillance of Black, Muslim, and Indigenous cis/trans men and women. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about how Surveillance manifests itself in the world ",

            "\u00a0There were so many strengths of this course, but I think its attention to student growth and engagement was one of the biggest. Prof Browne always delivered interesting, informative mini-lectures that substantially helped me work through the readings and theory we discussed, and also left plenty of space and time for students to talk through their own ideas/feelings. I have rarely had classes that felt so comfortable and honest and committed to each other, and it is all thanks to Professor Browne that we could create and support that kind of learning environment. I felt like I was learning more than in most classes, while also connecting with my peers in a meaningful way that often doesn't happen in class. Another strength was the fact that Prof Browne created an intense and amazing syllabus but still made it accessible to people, like me, who aren't versed in surveillance studies. The course also tied together so many topics and fields that often need this kind of intersectional approach, and which I feel like is hard to find in Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar brought together some incredible students from multiple disciplines. The conversations constantly were fluid, rich, and deep the dialogues enveloped critical theory and intellectual thought as well as narratives and stories that brought students together to interrogate their own everyday lives and histories. The assignments allowed students to bring together current events and memoirtheir real lived experiences and theory to parse out these experiences. The seminar was always organized, beginning with clear and thoughtful lectures to set the tone of the seminar, while also giving students power to take control of the conversation and develop the space as they needed or saw fit. This created a space in which students had a strong stake in their own learning, their peers, and the course material. Students were able to demonstrate their understandings of the material (and experiment with new forms of writing/thinking) through many forms of assessment, from film analysis to weekly reading responses, brief (and worth-while) student presentations, to office hours. The office hours that were required in this course led many students to go back, every week, to discuss course material and current events/campus life the course not only invested in student intellectual growth, but it made a clear and unparalleled investment in student-professor relationships and student personal growth. I would not change anything about the course, except to ensure that such an incredible visiting professor be given more resources/training by other Yale faculty so that she/they can not only access funds, but also be able to have a stable community at the university. This class would have been improved greatlyor it would have deepened the community bond if the professor was able to have funds from WGSS or the university to hold dinners or invite colleagues from other geographic locations. My regret is that the class only really met in the seminar room, and with such an incredible group/such enriching material, it was clear we could have met many more times and become a group that worked on deeper projects across the university. This class could be a Franke Lecture series. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite parts of this class was that Professor Browne meaningfully incorporated so many different types of text for cultural analysis, and also significantly engaged with (overlapping) material realities of race and gender, which some classes fall short of. It is so important in social studies to value modes of knowledge production beyond typical academic essays, and this class walked the walk rather than just talking the talk. Professor Browne also came to Yale in an academic environment where surveillance studies are not generally taught. Professor Browne spent considerable amounts of each class lecturing, which usually I don't love in seminars but her lectures were super engaging and, given the sparsity of surveillance scholars here, here in-depth knowledge and insight were really valuable to me as a student interested in pursuing this field. The main weakness for me was that, without an established field of surveillance studies at Yale, I came into the class without the foundational knowledge of the field I would have liked to have before taking this class, e.g. how is surveillance defined? But it's not Professor Browne's job to catch up where Yale is behind. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Browne is so knowledgable and her lectures are always super informative. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course! Simone Browne is amazing and I'm so so sad to see her go "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, and so wish that it would be offered again next year. It was one of the best courses I've taken at Yale, and could benefit any student regardless of major or interest. The readings are all insightful and fairly accessible, but you are definitely learning new, important stuff that is constantly relevant. The assignments all help you synthesize and apply the coursework to your life/interests. Every class meeting was interesting and brought new information to the table. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Yes! A great way to learn something new on a topic you may know a little about ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I've taken at Yale. I will probably pursue PhD work because of Professor Browne and the course material. This is a class that leaves you with so much to think about for your career, your life, and your intellectual work. But more importantly, Professor Browne is engaged with her students in a way that surpasses all her peers. She shows up for her students, makes time for them, and gives detailed/thoughtful feedback that helps students feel incredibly supported and invested in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so well organized for student learning and the material was rich, expansive and in-depth all at the same time. Students were able to bring in material and experiences from across their own lives and readings, as well as critically examine the texts we had to read. The texts were so well selected, honestly everyone should read them. The assignment of creating a zine at the end of the semester also allowed students to really lean into non-linear multimedia exploration, a regrettably rare occurrence at Yale even in social studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was one of my favorite courses I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor. Simone Browne is indespensible to Yale College and should absolutely stay for more terms, and should be hired if possible. Groundbreaking work on surveillance that can be tied interdisciplinary to many different majors, including arts, architecture, urban studies, and African American studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Browne is funny and kind but also critical and will call you on your BS if need be, she's the perfect professor, and fills an academic discipline that's all but missing here ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes. You're always being surveilled--and sometimes the one doing the surveilling. Maybe you know and maybe you don't. Either way, it is important to investigate your role in the world through the lens of race and gender with a foundation of surveillance studies. This class truly changed the way I experience life on a daily basis because of that. "
