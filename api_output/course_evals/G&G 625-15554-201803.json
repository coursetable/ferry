            "\u00a0Great intro to all three areas. Needed more structure throughout. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the more organized courses I've taken here, and definitely one of my favorite courses. Its strengths were planned lectures, a syllabus prepared ahead of time, a topic that was useful and pertinent, three instructors who coordinated with one another and were expert in their relative fields, and regular consolidation of material in the form of oral exams and class presentations, which were well-run. It was particularly helpful that all three instructors attended and paid attention in most lectures; too often with these courses with multiple professors switching out there's a lot of time and energy lost, but in this course the transitions were very smooth. I thought the class presentations were a great way to deal with the topics of regional oceanography and paleoproxies, and to keep them from being too boring. \r\nIts weaknesses were that it could have been still more organized, some of the lectures could have been better prepared, the reading assignments needed more thought, and it was the first time the class was being run so there were all the usual kinks to work out. Sometimes it wasn't clear why we were spending time on a particular topic. I liked the questions on Canvas, which were a good idea for getting us to engage and useful for giving us time to mull over something before asking about it. They did take up a large amount of class time, though, and were sometimes invented just because one was required. Perhaps there could be a single paper or textbook reading assigned to accompany each lecture, and we could comment/ask a question about that? Or do a problem set? Or answer a short-answer question? 1-2 assigned readings for each lecture topic would be really helpful; yes, we can find it on our own, but we could find any of this on our own: the point of taking the course is to more efficiently learn the material, and taking time to select a really good, relevant reading helps. Going over the exam questions in some detail also helps so you know what you got right and wrong, particularly because oral exams are hard to remember.\r\nThe three units were pretty separate and it would be nice to see how they fit together a bit more.
