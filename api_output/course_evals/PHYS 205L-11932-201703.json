            "\u00a0This course was helpful in learning to construct measurement plans for experiments in physics. We also covered information regarding error analysis and different types of statistical distributions, which will likely be helpful in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of physics concepts before seeing them in class, somewhat helped when I had to study before my actual Physics class. ",
            "\u00a0Most prominently, I learned lab techniques in this course. I believe it has prepared me sufficiently well to continue onto 206L and future physics labs. This type of lab was something that I had never experienced before; I didn't have any previous similar experience in high school. On the physics side, though, I didn't learn much. Although it was interesting and beneficiary to see the application of ideas from other physics classes, many of the new ideas (admittedly, only a small percent of the content was new) were poorly taught through confusing pre-lab handouts. In terms of content, I probably really only learned data analysis techniques, such as error propagation, and not so much physics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use some interesting equipment, particularly an oscilloscope ",
            "\u00a0In this class we learned to use many basic tools of physical measurement while properly accounting for error. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what a torsional oscillator is. ",
            "\u00a0learned how to operate an oscilloscope i guess ",
            "\u00a0How to use equipment such as an ammeter, voltmeter, oscilloscope, and Loggerpro. How to develop a plan to measure an experimental variable. How to apply concepts learned in physics lecture to real world scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to operate various types of lab equipment including oscilloscopes, function generators, torsional operators, and circuits (to some extent). I also learned data analysis and error propagation skills that I had not known before. ",
            "\u00a0This class is devoid of knowledge. This class teaches nothing because there is no teaching. The most beneficial thing are the four psets from the Taylor textbook (a textbook that is poorly written and can benefit from actual teaching). That's not to say that more psets would be better. It would just get screwed up like the massive amount of prelabs and lab reports already have: the homework and work in the class are unenlightening -- there is nothing to learn from them. It is just all busy work. \r\n\r\nThe class is a weird balance of experimental design as well as just following instructions. The class doesn't know what it wants to be so it chooses to be an abomination as a mixture of both. We should have learned error propagation but the only \"teaching\" of it is to read a poorly written explanation followed by a 15 minute explanation before a long and boring lab. ",
            "\u00a0In general, lab set up and procedure for physics labs. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me the basics of error propagation and why it is important. I also learned how to use basic physics laboratory equipment such as digital multimeters, gyroscopes, and oscilloscopes. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at analyzing error and understood some of the practical manifestations of physics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about setting up experiments and deepened my understanding of physical phenomenon. ",

            "\u00a0I found the labs in this class to actually be quite interesting and diverse in subject. I appreciate that we didn't rigidly adhere to the concepts covered in the lecture class and were instead able to expand into topics that are more interesting to study in a lab. In terms of workload and grading, this class was fair and reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0The labs, particularly those at the end, tend to be a little longer than the allocated 3 hours. ",
            "\u00a0The general premise of the labs were interesting, but we used the same apparatuses many weeks in a row (which became boring), and the labs often felt poorly designed in terms of too much content to get through in one lab section and a structure that didn't foster independent discovery. I find labs that ask a general question (find the mass of this object, find the resistance of this resistor, etc.) more interesting than ones that just ask for you to follow a set of directions. For example, the lab on the final was much more interesting and engaging than ones we did in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that the TAs are pretty good I suppose but this course really isn't for someone who doesn't have some type of understanding of both mechanics and e&m, wouldn't recommend if you don't have background in both because it gets conceptually very difficult ",
            "\u00a0I wish that this course lined up more with the topics we cover in physics, as I found that I was often trying to learn complicated equations and concepts of physics in 15 minutes before applying them to a situation which requires a fairly deep understanding of all of their consequences. ",
            "\u00a0This course did everything which I expected it to do. It is a good course, which is set up well and if it were required, i would happily take it or something similar again. ",
            "\u00a0The material is alternates between being extremely basic (like find the spring constant of a spring basic) and being theoretically very difficult, such as coupled differential equations in oscillatory systems. Definitely a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0the labs were pretty unbearable ",
            "\u00a0Most of the experiments were really interesting and helped me to better understand the material I was learning.\r\n\r\nSome of the experiments were a little too long and felt rushed. Also, towards the end, I often wished the Pre-Labs had a little more explanation of the concepts and theory behind the experiments we were about to perform, as I often had not learned the concepts in lecture yet. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course had a good number and variety of labs/subjects; I had never gotten to work directly with radioactive substances before, which was cool. The lab classroom was well equipped, and I was introduced to machines I had never dealt with before.\r\nWeaknesses: The lab handouts often did not have enough information to actually conduct the lab. The instructors were very helpful in filling in information, but often it was frustrating trying to understand the concepts and mechanics (esp. during the pre labs) when the information simply was not present. I still don't fully understand RC circuits. ",
            "\u00a0This is the worst class I have taken at Yale. It is boring and uninspired; the work is just busy work -- there is no soul. The labs were long, boring, poorly designed, and didn't illuminate underlying concepts at all. It takes what makes physics fun and crushes it in 3 hour periods. The homework is lazy: the prelabs require almost zero critical thinking about the concepts and the lab summary is just rehashing the tedious lab notebook you need to keep. I dreaded going to lab each week to see what uninspired lab report I would be tortured to write later on. \r\n\r\nThe experimental design in this class is so mindnumbing. The actual point of lab is to design an experiment to measure something that you don't think you should be able to measure from something simple and easy to measure. Doing 4 labs with the torsional pendulum, no one cares about them, these should be redesigned. The gyroscope lab is also awful: there is no experimental design involved. the best labs were the RC circuits and AC current lab. It was a coherent lab the had parts of the lab that related to each other. The electromagnetism lab is an example of a poorly designed lab: the components don't relate to each other so the lab feels like busy work. \r\n\r\nYou need to fix lab 205. Potential physics majors get so turned off by the lab that they switch out of the major. ",
            "\u00a0This course is rather boring and unengaging. Furthermore, there is a real lack of instruction, both in the physics concepts and in the actual laboratory parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job teaching the basics of error propagation. I felt the labs were engaging and each lab clearly helped us learn something new about physics. The instructors were very willing to explain concepts and give advice on lab procedures.\r\n\r\n I would have enjoyed a bit more of a discussion of systematic errors and how to identify them. Furthermore, I would have preferred a bit more material on statistical analysis/error propagation and less emphasis on physics concepts themselves (many of which I hadn't learned yet in the intro physics sequence). ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more time devoted to understanding some of the pre-labs but otherwise this course was engaging and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I feel as though the lab report and notebook together are redundant. I really enjoyed the experiments and what they taught us. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was its breadth, in that we were able to study many different topics in physical measurement. I also liked how engaging some of the labs were, especially hands-on components. One area it could be improved is what we are expected to do outside of lab sometimes seemed unnecessary. I found that I gained absolutely nothing from writing out the measurement plans... often I would just copy down the experiment guide, so that was a waste of time. Also, the pre-labs often had questions that were not answerable from the information contained in the pre-lab. I would have to do extensive outside research to figure it out. I found this a little unorganized and counterproductive. ",
            "\u00a0No idea how homework is supposed to be done, need more samples/ explanation  on sample lab notes etc. ",
            "\u00a0It focuses on trivial details rather than the overarchig concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The course just seems quite monotonous; also, our review of the relevant statistical tools seems perfunctory and isn't rigorous in the slightest. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that you learn some useful skills, such as learning how to use Logger Pro. Also, some of the labs were somewhat interesting, like the optics lab. Conversely, most of the labs were boring, like the radiation lab (you sit there watching a Geiger counter measure radiation from a piece of Cobalt-60). The practical exam is fair and actually tests you on relevant material that you will need in the future. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this class to another student, especially since it seems to be the more interesting of the two introductory physics labs. The workload is totally acceptable for a half credit course, and the professor and TAs will help prevent you from getting lost. ",
            "\u00a0Lab reports take a long time, if you're really into Physics then I'd absolutely recommend this course. However, if you already have a busy semester// can't spend a lot of time on lab reports, go for a lower level lab course. ",
            "\u00a0I suppose yes, I would. This course is an easy lab credit and a nice introduction to future physics labs. It perhaps serves as a disservice to physics majors by setting expectations for workload too low - I expect future labs will require significantly more work/effort, so this course does not prepare us well for that. Overall, though, it was interesting enough and I think a student interested in physics would enjoy it. ",

            "\u00a0This sucked. I dreaded every Wednesday. As a physics major already past the intro sequences I felt belittled by this lab, whose power to render me sad and frustrated was rivaled only by that of my ex-girlfriend. The material of this course was not hard at all, but doing any work for this class, whether it was in the lab or at home was just so painful and unrewarding that I willingly took the L several times. \r\n\r\nWith that being said, all of the instructors were super nice and helpful, and I felt bad that they had to be there too. ",

But I cannot recommend the class to someone with no previous interest in physics/engineering. To a non-zero extent, the frustration I felt associated with trying to understand, conduct, and write up the labs was greater than the benefit and knowledge I got out of it. ",
            "\u00a0If you HAVE to take this class, I'm sorry. \r\nThis class is awful. It is all busy work, so it's not hard in terms of intellectual challenge. The only difficulty is staying motivated to finish the piles of coursework that are assigned. I recommend taking this class maybe when you only have 4 more classes so you can have enough time to procrastinate the work in the lab and still be fine. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not augment my curriculum at Yale. I would not recommend it to a student, unless it is required for a major. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a good introduction to physics lab work and error propagation. The labs are interesting and really help understand physics concepts better. The class is, however, a very substantial time commitment: weekly work includes a short problem set, a 2-page lab summary, and a pre-lab assignment. Expect at least as much work as in the average full-credit class. ",
            "\u00a0If you like physics and want to see some practical uses by all means you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you take this class, you probably have to, but it's a lot of busywork, if you can get beyond that the material is somewhat interesting. ",

            "\u00a0If you are planning on taking this course, then you are most likely going to major in physics or astrophysics or something of that nature, so you have to take it. But honestly it's not that bad and is probably a better option than 165L. "
