            "\u00a0I gained insight into several incredible philosophical minds. Kapustin did an excellent job explaining complex philosophical concepts of nonviolence, violence, emancipation and oppression. I have much better grasp on the likes of Fanon, Guevara, Havel, Arendt and more because of Kapustin. ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult to describe what insights I gained from this course as we covered an immense amount of writings. I think I've gained several frameworks for thinking about civil disobedience, nonviolence, power, and the like from the writers we read in Moral Choices in Politics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and analyze a lot of texts, as well as how to write (long) papers about them, and make comparisons across thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin, apart from being a very passionate person when it comes to sharing his knowledge, really tries to make you question and become more critical of what you already know. I personally believe that this course made me develop more analytical skills specially when it comes to applying political theory into real life events or facts. ",
            "\u00a0The moral frameworks for different philosophers, how to adjudicate between strong but opposing moral accounts ",
            "\u00a0A greater command of political philosophy and works outside the typical EP&E canon, as well as applying political philosophy frameworks to emancipatory movements throughout history. "

            "\u00a0Professor Boris Kapustin is the Napoleon of the lecture; after one of his monologues on the course material, you will want to storm over the Alps and conquer Europe.\r\n\r\nHe is perhaps the best lecturer at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Kapustin's lectures were incredibly insightful and beautifully produced. While I relished the time for discussion, I also benefitted most from when he presented. ",
            "\u00a0This course only has strengths! Professor Kapustin is an incredible seminar leader. He balances just the right amount of lecturing with seminar discussion, and is incredibly attentive to student needs. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course! Professor Kapustin is excellent and very inspiring, and the readings are all very engaging. I can't think of a way to improve this course; it was great. ",
            "\u00a0I believe only two weaknesses, one the classroom!! It was always too hot or too crowded. The second is that some days we did not keep on schedule and had to miss a couple of authors in the end. Although I understand that this was done to have more engagement with certain concepts or readings. \r\n\r\nThe level of engagement and diversity of students is definitely a strength, as well as the course material and the Professor's mini lectures or as he called them 'monnologues'. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the expertise and passion of Boris as well as his excellent syllabus and willingness to help and be there for his students. Weaknesses are that we got behind and had to play catch up each class which required us to be able to speak to two philosophers at the least each week which is a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin is such a brilliant and caring manwe were all hanging onto his every word whenever he launched into a mini lecture.  The discussion portion of the class never seemed that helpful though.  We were just waiting for our Professor to begin speaking againhe would essentially summarize the better points made by students and then give deeper insight anyway, so it kind of felt like we could've gotten more out of the texts just by listening to him speak for 50 minutes.  Still a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent professor and syllabus (many of whose works havent been encountered in previous courses in the EP&E department). Well-structured course revolving around core central themes that are carried through over the course of the semester (political violence, civil disobedience, defining justice, etc.). Reasonable workload and assignments and stimulating (albeit intellectually challenging) readings.\r\nWeaknesses: No major ones come to mind. "

            "\u00a0More of a leminar than a seminar, but a great overview of important thinkers and historical figures who deal with moral choices in politics...the course spends most of its time discussing political violence and civil disobedience. Overall would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in applied political philosophy and the politics of justice. I was able to read authors and understand them in such a profound way. You'll read the likes of Fanon, Che, Arendt, Havel, works that you should definitely try to pick up at some point, and hear Kapustin's brilliant thoughts on the matter. Kapustin is absolutely brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to other students. This is definitely one of those courses where the more you put in, the more you get out -- although you'll gain an incredible amount just from listening to Kapustin lecture. I would say be diligent about the readings and make sure to keep as falling behind makes the class less enjoyable. This class is an incredible opportunity to spend time reflecting on ideas related to non violence, power, and politics that is both insightful and challenging. Take this if you can! ",
            "\u00a0This class should be a lecture. For the first half of each seminar everyone goes around and guesses at their interpretation of the philosopher that week and for the rest of it the professors gives his interpretation, which is always far more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend it to anyone interested in politics or philosophy; it completely changed the way i view certain thinkers and approach texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Kapustin is really interesting and he will grasp your attention easily. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this course! Kapustin is amazing, and discussions are always stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely amazing course. At first, I had a hard time concentrating on the material for a straight 2 hours, as the philosophies are often quite complicated and difficult to understand. However, Professor Kapustin is simply brilliant and makes every session an enlightening experience. I highly recommend this to any student interested in political and moral philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The content is appropriate for anyone who wants to think about morality in their life and kapustin is funny and brilliant and attentive. He will meet you more than halfway if you express energy and interest. A really important and  highly engaging classs. ",
            "\u00a0A definite yes if you are keen in the topic. Professor Kapustin is simply amazing. each lesson is like a passionate delivery of a well written essay - both in the way it is delivered and the insightfulness of the points. It's by no means an easy course; only in-depth study of assigned readings each week can sufficiently prepare you for each class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Kapustin is so, so great.  I'd take anything he's teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it for Professor Kapustin's excellent introduction to the moral dilemmas in politics ",
            "\u00a0As someone who greatly enjoyed Prof. Kapustins Classics course, I was excited by the opportunity to take another course with him, and this one did not disappoint. The syllabus is structured around key themes in political theory, including political violence, emancipatory struggle, justice in politics, civil disobedience, and others. However, as opposed to being strictly canonical, the course applies these frameworks to the political philosophies of emancipatory leaders and thinkers like Che Guevara, Mahatma Gandhi, Henry David Thoreau, Vaclav Havel, and others, while also drawing on thinkers (like Fanon and Arendt, for instance) outside the classical liberal traditions more often seen on EP&E syllabi. Kapustins lectures were compelling and engaging; he was a strong discussion leader and provided tremendously helpful feedback on essay outlines and submitted assignments. This course, along with Classics, has been among the highlights of my Yale career and are not to be missed for anyone looking for deep intellectual challenge and exposure to critical works in political theory.
