            "\u00a0Learned SO MUCH Chinese, got even more comfortable in conversational settings, and had a buncha fun. ",
            "\u00a0During this class I was able to achieve a better grasp on more complex conversational Chinese, and at the same time was able to get a better understanding of Chinese culture, whether that be through Chinese customs or holidays. ",

Profs are absolute pros, the schedule proceeds like clockwork, and you always know exactly where youre standing. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the biggest strength of this class was how enthusiastic our professor was and how that morphed into the students being just as enthusiastic about the topic. One of the weaknesses was that I think the work could be a little more streamlined, at times I felt like our homework was spread over too many platforms and that made things a little confusing. ",

            "\u00a0Yes very good for learning chinese ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. It picks up in my opinion more than l3 quite a bit. The higher level vocabulary and grammar needs more detailed review. But you wont regret it and is a big step for real fluency in the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take the class if you want to be better at Chinese. Lots of work but worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! By L4 you know what youre getting into, but if you put in the work youre practically guaranteed to learn a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it if you are truly keen on improving your Chinese language abilities. The Chinese program at Yale is really impressive, and the fact you meet everyday really has marked improvement on your ability in a very short amount of time. ",
