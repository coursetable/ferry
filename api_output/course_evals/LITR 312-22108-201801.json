            "\u00a0This course primarily gave a great deal of practice in literary analysis, as could be expected. Within that, we discussed genre, literary form, and construction at length. Though I don't speak or read Russian, questions of translation were also discussed occasionally, and were interesting. I also gained a broader knowledge of pre-revolutionary Russian authors, and some sense of the dialogues occurring between the authors. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to the Russian canon. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned an incredible amount about Russian literature theory and history, as there were a number of Slavic PhD students in the course who took our discussions to great heights. In fact, this was one of the first literature classes I have taken at Yale in which we have not strictly looked at the world of the text, but rather put each piece in some sort of broader context (which I found absolutely thrilling!). In addition, by the end of the course, I found myself asking questions about the autonomy and dimensionality of characters, their relationship to the narrator and the author, and whether the character itself is a modern concept. I found myself thinking about certain terminology and themes, and the time periods in which such terminology became a part of the literary discourse. ",
            "\u00a0I got to dive into the world of Russian fiction, and developed a deeper and more nuanced understanding of the short form while I was at it. "

            "\u00a0The course was strong! It was a mix of graduate students and undergrads, which lent itself to slightly diverging interests for discussion. As an undergrad, it would have been more accessible at a few points with less emphasis on comparative literature outside of the syllabus, but those were rarely long discussions. There were many readings, which gave a good breadth of study, but could have been winnowed slightly in order to focus the class discussions more. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the readings were roughly chronological. It made the course cohesive. I personally didn't like how we only had one prompt for the midterm paper. I felt like I was much more excited about the final paper because I could pick from a wide range of options. I also felt like there were a few weeks when I was so stressed about doing all of the readings that I didn't have time to think that closely about any of the short stories I had read. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the biggest strengths of the course was the fact that Professor MacKay assigned each of the graduate students a week to present. As a number of them presented on authors and works to which they have devoted their graduate studies, it led to a number of really enriching discussions. I also think the syllabus and the way it was organized chronologically and thematically was brilliant. Perhaps one thing that could be improved is finding a way to create a more balanced discussion, in which the undergraduates feel better equipped to participate. Indeed, while I loved listening and absorbing the conversation, there were times when I felt the conversation was so removed from the world of the text that I was not sure any of my own comments were relevant. That being said, I learned a tremendous deal from listening! ",
            "\u00a0There was a ton of reading, which was a strength and a weakness. Professor MacKay clearly loves the material and works to choose stories that will be generative in class. Every reading was fascinating, and seminar discussions were always rich. But it was a challenge to get through everything in time for class each week. "

            "\u00a0If you're considering comp lit courses, take it! MacKay is great and has a lot to say on the stories. The stories themselves are fascinating, and there isn't too much required by way of analysis - just a midterm and final paper, with weekly discussion posts. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! The class discussions were engaging, the weekly readings were enjoyable, and I learned a tremendous amount about Russian literature, history, culture, and theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you're interested in the material, take it! I learned so much and got to read so many interesting stories I would never have gotten to on my own. And Professor MacKay is a fabulous and passionate professor who makes sure everyone gets something out of class no matter how much or little background you're coming in with. "
