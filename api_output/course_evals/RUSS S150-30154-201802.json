            "\u00a0The workload is a bit heavy, with too many assessments ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the holistic approach to improving the student's Russian proficiency.  Reading, listening, and talking were all studied and practiced.  The weakness of the course was the massive amount of content which was given to us with little time or expectancy for us to master.  We were doused with a firehouse of information, expected to learn how to swim, but just left soaking wet still being unable to swim.  A better approach would be to limit the amount of information being taught while focusing on mastering what remains.  There were multiple people in my class who can prepare a well written paper at home and read it in class the next day, but are still unable to read a menu and order lunch at a Russian restaurant. "

            "\u00a0Yes, best summer abroad experience I could have imagined. The course itself is fantastic, paired with a summer in Petersburg, you Russian will vastly improve and you will learn a lot of cool Russian history. Plus, Constantine is the best Russian professor I could imagine! ",
            "\u00a0Depends on the student and what they are trying to gain from the experience. "
