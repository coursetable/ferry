            "\u00a0The Western Marxist Canon: Marx, Althusser, Lukacs, Jameson, etc. Not only were the texts fascinating in and of themselves, the weekly reading responses and presentations really helped me digest the material. Reading such lovely writers also made me a better writer. BUT most importantly this class 100% completely CHANGED MY LIFE. I became so much more thoughtful and critical of the world around me, and wow I don't know how I went around the world before this class. It changed the way I look at everything. Please take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class. It will teach you a long tradition of thought that is ignored at Yale. Whether you are a Marxist, on the left, or not, take this class. It will allow you to truly engage with the left and literature in a way no other course at Yale will. John and Moira are a dynamic duo that know these texts inside and out, from different perspectives. They are so so so knowledgeable on the polemic debates around these texts and help you understand them too. Amazing class with amazing professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an incredible introduction to Marxist theory (cultural and otherwise). Actually changed the way I think! ",
            "\u00a0So much Theory! So much Praxis! So many insights! I can see clearly now the task at hand. ",
            "\u00a0Necessary body of text that is no longer widely taught involving cultural theory, literary and linguistic theory, and a bit of psychoanalytic texts. Skills wise, these involve some of the densest texts I've encountered at Yale, so I learned to carefully make sense of them, on my own and in discussion. Despite the seminar format, I feel like this was a survey course in the end-- I learned of many thinkers and texts that I want to return to over the summer and later in my life. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a challenging, thorough, and exciting introduction to Marxist thought. I learned about the theoretical development of an intellectual tradition that has had such a profound influence on the contemporary world. I gained a valuable lens through which to interpret contemporary global culture and politics. The intricate, rich texts made me a better reader. ",
            "\u00a0intense survey of marxist cultural theory. Fills a gap in the university's curriculum ",
            "\u00a0I learned different ways to analyze the production and consumption of culture on a global scale. The thinkers we read, though challenging and dense, were very insightful and it helped me understand the many dimensions in which culture is actually political. I learned that the term 'marxist critique' means different things to different people because even the terms crucial to marxism like 'base' and 'superstructure' are problematized and negotiated in every thinker's reading of a certain aspect of culture. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of the different ways political theories have thought about Marxist cultural theory, the major debates in the field, and a bit of historical overview of the different movements thinkers were engaging in. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me so much. It was always very challenging but in the best of ways. Every class I walked out of there feeling like everything I thought I knew was turned upside down (in the best of ways). "

            "\u00a0The beginning of the semester was a little disorganized, but that's because it's the first time this class has been taught, and the professors are more used to teaching graduate seminars. However, they immediately responded to feedback and changed the syllabus to be more in touch with what we could handle and were absolutely receptive towards everything we said. Moira and John are absolutely amazing. They care so deeply and so passionately about their students. I've never seen a duo like them and I don't think I ever will. Once you take a class with them, they are your teachers for life. Class discussion was also fascinating. I was lucky enough to take the class with many graduate students and seniors who were very knowledgable about the topic, and they brought a wealth of information and experience with them. Class felt like conversation, and still so intellectually rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really good overall, even as a first time/trial run. Sometimes a little confusing as to whether we were doing specifically marxist cultural theory or marxist theory more generally, but great still! ",
            "\u00a0No Weaknesses. It's perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Because it was the first iteration of a marxist theory class, a significant portion of the semester was learning where the class stood on the material and how best to work through the material at a pace accessible to everyone. Through conversations held class-wide with the professors, we agreed it may be best to change the format to a lecture, as graduate student participating often took the discussion to topics the undergrads were unprepared for. ",
            "\u00a0I'm glad that the syllabus contained so much canonical Marxist theory. However, it would have been nice to read more works by third-world Marxists, who in many cases did the most to turn theory into praxis. I liked the seminar format, although the class often became more of a lecture due to the complex material and the professors' personal enthusiasm. This was usually helpful, but sometimes made it hard to break in with questions and comments. ",
            "\u00a0the set up and community of the class is one of the most intellectually stimulating experience I've had. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and the professors were great at explaining the terms from the material. However, since the material came from all over the world, it would be better to focus more on the context in which the text was written and focusing on historical events that happened that caused the writing of these works. Building up an understanding of Russian history / Latin American history would have been useful to tackle some of the thinkers we came across. I enjoyed class discussion even when sometimes it was difficult to contribute. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of the course are the professors who were thoughtful and extremely knowledgeable about Marxist cultural theory. They drew from a wide range of thinkers in their syllabus, and helped us engage deeply with the material. The only weakness of the course is that it isn't necessarily geared for intro level students, but I thought the material was valuable nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was in the carefully selected texts, the students, and the professors. Everyone always seemed so wiling to learn and teach each other. The only ay it could be improved is making sure the amount of reading is scaled back a bit from the beginning. "

            "\u00a0Yes wow please. It will change the way you think about the world. The people we read and the professors teaching the class... this has just been an unbelievable experience. I came out of class every week just amazed at what we had read and discussed. Literally could not stop talking to my friends about how great this class was. Just do it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class. It will teach you a long tradition of thought that is ignored at Yale. Whether you are a Marxist, on the left, or not, take this class.

They are so so so knowledgeable on the polemic debates around these texts and help you understand them too. Amazing class with amazing professors. ",
            "\u00a0definitely take this! john and moira are great, and its both challenging material and good fun. ",
            "\u00a0Classes like this are rare at Yale. Marxist and other forms of materialist analysis are often sidelined or glossed over. Here you get to dive in and try to actually figure the stuff out. It's good. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Must take! one of the best classes I took at Yale. I wish, groundhog day style, I just redid some of our sessions day after day after day. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt-- there will seldom be a chance to study these texts with such engaging professors and with a cohort that will invariably become a community of ideas and discussion by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an exciting, challenging, and thorough summary of one of the most influential movements in the modern world. If you want a new perspective on how cultures and economies function, and why the contemporary world is structured the way it is, take this class. Moira and John are a great and eccentric team. They turn the the class into an immersive intellectual environment. ",
            "\u00a0yes, especially for those who only understand the political philosophies of marx. The course offers a critical framework of thinking that is both intellectually challenging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!! macKay and Fradinger are  incredible people, and this is such a gem of a course. Be warned that the material can become a bit advanced, but if you're willing to put time into what you're reading, I'm sure you'll come away with a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! Everyone should take this course. It really challenges you to question why society functions the way it does and provides you with a theoretical understanding of how to challenge it. It's a must -- especially at a place like Yale. We need more classes like these! "
