            "\u00a0This class was an excellent survey course about evolution of planning practice with ample case studies in Northeast U.S. region (CT/NY/NJ). Professor Kooris and the readings he selects impart to students a comprehensive understanding of major key terms in the planning space - and the course is designed to help students begin to make complex connections among weekly topics, from zoning code and urban deign guidelines to transit-oriented development planning (effectively, like a planner would - wedding a variety of different considerations/interests). ",
            "\u00a0I gained exposure and knowledge into a wide range of urban planning topics and challenges, and I was able to read and think about these topics within the context of a particular city of choice. ",
            "\u00a0Upon taking this course, I now have a much better understanding of urban, suburban, and regional planning. Prior, I did not have a good grasp on local/city zoning, street development, and transit oriented development, but after taking Prof. Kooris's class and learning from his unique insights I have a much better understanding of the topics as well as the resources applicable to these areas. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introductory course into the field of planning. It provides a good combination of lectures, readings, group work and independent research. The group work was beneficial in allowing students to apply the ideas they are learning about to real cities and think about how the different pieces fit together for a real community. It also allows students to be creative and develop solutions to community specific challenges. The paper allowed for a deeper dive into a subject area of the student's choice. Overall, this class helped me have a better understanding of the history of planning, different strategies planners have had throughout the last two centuries, the different elements of a comprehensive plan, and more recent focus on resilience and climate change from the planning perspective.

Clarified a lot of stuff we talked about in class. ",

I appreciated this perspective, although he sometimes went on big tangents. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history and evolution of urban planning throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. I am focusing on land conservation at FES, and I took this course to complement some of my studies in that field because I think that it's important for conservationists to have a grasp of the other side of the coin, development.\r\n\r\nDavid was great in setting up each class under a particular theme, whether it was a history lesson or a particular aspect of planning (zoning, transit-oriented development, etc.) Each week's lecture had a lot of information in that particular area, but the course itself built on each week's knowledge. \r\n\r\nWe talked not only about cities but about suburbs and regions, and how development in those areas has been impactful as well.\r\n\r\nThe group project also allowed us practice diagnosing urban planning problems in a particular city, which was a neat exercise designed to get us thinking about how we would work if we were planners. \r\n\r\nI also particularly enjoyed the final research paper because I was able to really dive into a topic of particular interest to me.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this course, I am more thoughtful when I go out into urban environments. I'm able to get a better sense of development patterns - what that place did right and what could have been done better. It also has given me perspective as I think about my future career - I don't necessarily want to be a planner but I think an understanding of the concepts will be critical to my conservation work and understanding of how problems arise in urban and suburban environments.

            "\u00a0I went into the course hoping to clarify my understanding of the urban planning space, what the profession entails, and how the profession has (in different ways) shaped the cities/suburban areas we inhabit.In particular, the weekly group assignments that asked us to apply each week's lecture and reading material to analyze a city of our choice helped to solidify concepts learned in class - and move beyond abstract urban theory. ",
            "\u00a0The level of engagement and depth in this class surpassed my expectations. The course enabled students to bring in and discuss their own insights and interests, and Professor Kooris went into a lot of depth about how idealistic urban planning topics are handled and managed in practice. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very much an overview, but would be a good introductory class for further engagement in urban and land use classes. Sometimes I felt that the news/current events portion of the class was too long and took away from the core of the lectures, so I would limit the amount of time that can take up. Finally, I thought that the lectures with powerpoint slides were more effective at conveying the overarching concepts and information in the lecture than those without powerpoint slides. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are Prof. Kooris's experience and practice in planning and course content, the field trips and access to local/ real-world planning activities, creative and flexible group research projects, and the open-ended nature of the course that allowed student interests and current events to guide discussion. There were no true weaknesses to the course, however, I would have liked for movement through some discussion topics to proceed at a slower pace. ",
            "\u00a0David is a great asset to the FES community. It feels like he knows everyone in the planning world and has been an integral part of Connecticut planning over the last decade. He has so much experience to share with the class that is really valuable. The readings were also really great and the group projects were fun and interesting. \r\n\r\nThe one weakness of this course was that it sometimes felt a little disorganized, and some of his final lectures felt less structured than the initial ones. I think organization and structure are really important for a 3 hour class, especially an evening one when everyone is tired anyway. It also would have been nice to get our grades back on the group projects earlier in the semester, so we could know how we were doing on them before working on more. ",

            "\u00a0Great anecdotes from real professional situations (especially in the tri-state area), and good to learn all the urban planning terminology.\r\n\r\nThe weakness was that the course felt pretty unstructured at times and some of the lectures were a bit rambling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Instruction, assignment feedback, field visit ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: David is a great teacher: he has so much to say on each topic and is such an expert in his field that it was a lot of fun to be taught by him His anecdotes about his work experiences were funny and informative. He is so clearly passionate about planning, and teachers who are passionate about their subject are the best kind. The field trips were also a lot of fun and highly informative. We did a walking tour of Stanford CT and attended a planning commission meeting in New Haven. Both field trips were great. Also, Katie Murray was a great TA!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class time. Not David's fault, and I know he has a day job. But Wednesday night class time was difficult because it was 3 hours and by that point in the evening, I'd been at school since 9am and was just hungry and ready to go home. It's hard to pay attention at that hour no matter how great the class. In addition, there were a couple of lectures that David didn't have powerpoint slides for, and that made it a little difficult to stay engaged. "

The workload for the course is very fair and Prof. Kooris is often available before and after class. I would highly recommend this course! ",

David covers a lot of really important and interesting material throughout the course but sometimes that information is more anecdotal than a normal class. However, it is still really enjoyable for a student interested in planning. ",

I think this course could be improved it incorporated a bit more theory/ideas to chew on rather than just very practical and current knowledge. ",

            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course! David is a great resource and so knowledgable. The workload is about the same as an average FES class, but it felt very manageable to me given how much work my other classes this semester were. My one regret with this course is actually that my other classes had so much work that I was unable to complete devote myself to the work of this class, and had to do things like skip readings and such. It was a shame, because this was one of my favorite classes I've taken at FES and I wish I could have been able to really put 100% effort into it. That said, I still learned a lot. I'd highly recommend it to folks interested in urban and suburban planning and gaining and understanding of how urban environments inform our understanding of the world. "
