            "\u00a0I learned mainly about the development of racism and how people of color are at an unfair disadvantage in cities around the world. We started with a historical look the first half of the course and ended with a what's happening in the world now look with topics such as gentrification and environmental justice. ",
            "\u00a0This definitely counts as one of those famous perspective-altering classes. The way I look at urban centers has completely changed, and I'm able to analyze what I see much more critically and connect these observations to the effects of historical and contemporary discrimination. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do field studies and how to engage with course readings to build proper arguments. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really great intro to urban studies course, and I learned a lot about the way race/class/gender interacts with physical spaces, both historically and currently. ",
            "\u00a0I better understand the structural factors that contribute to racial, class, and gendered inequality in American cities and their surrounding metropolitan areas. I also rode a New Haven city bus for the first time. I also thought about the role of private capital in gentrification for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped me to understand the modern day inequalities that exist in larger American cities. It also helped me decide on what I would like to possibly major in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much more not only about the process of cities and the roles of people within them--both in terms of people with incredible amounts of power within cities as well as often marginalized and underprivileged citizens who were more likely to suffer from the laws and principles put into place by the people in power in these cities. Through the field projects, I learned so much more about how to interpret my understandings and notice every day concepts like gentrification in my community, both New Haven and at home, and I also overall gained a greater understanding of concepts of inequality within cities than I had before. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about systemic oppression in cities, but also about the agency of the oppressed peoples. That dual emphasis was the most fascinating part of the course for me. The course is in two partsthe first half focuses on American urban history, and the second part focuses on current issues facing cities. Seeing the history lead into the current issues was great; I really like the design of the course. I also began to learn about spatialization/urban studies, something I definitely want to learn more about at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be more aware of my surroundings while walking around New Haven. Racial and socio-economic disparity, gentrification ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different inequalities that people face in cities, especially low-income communities of color. I really enjoy the lectures on gentrification, because they taught me things that I never knew about my home, Brooklyn. ",
            "\u00a0this course helped me learn a lot about the historical processes that have created the city as we know it today and helped give me the vocabulary to talk about space in ways that I hadn't been able to before. ",
            "\u00a0How to read sociological theory ",
            "\u00a0How to look at issues in american cities that affect different groups of people and why this is historically. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded knowledge of how cities came to be based on earlier historical processes. Taught me to consider how structural institutions contribute towards inequality in race, class, and gender. Learned why people of color and women are disproportionately low income and subject to worse conditions in cities. ",

            "\u00a0I feel like I gained a greater insight into the processes perpetuating inequality in American cities. I think the course successfully identified high level, easily understandable factors contributing to inequality concerning race, class, and gender. ",

            "\u00a0Learned a lot about structural inequalities in cities and how they were/are constructed and maintained, e.g. through transit inequality, discriminatory housing practices, suburbanization, and gentrification. Learned a lot, too, about New Haven through the field projects, which I really enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to the socially created inequalities in the US. At times it was dry and prof Barraclough would say some fufu white people shit, but she means well. It's also deceptively a lot of writing, so be careful. Also, she should make it clearer that the take home final is actually a final paper, don't be deceptive. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of various contemporary urban issues to do with race, gender, and class inequality--I now can identify instances in which these issues are relevant and have the vocabulary and historical knowledge to talk about them in a meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0This course tries to frame modern urban issues of race and class in the context of historical routes. However, I think the lectures, readings, and assignments execute this objective poorly. Having completed this course, I do recognize certain processes and power structures in New Haven and in my home community that I did not before -- but the course provided little to no discussion of how to think about these issues beyond identification. Put more simply, I feel like this course taught vocabulary, but not substance. Course readings were often narrow and anecdotal, offering not broad, scholarly arguments about the social processes we were supposed to be studying but instead giving personal accounts of small aspects of certain urban issues. Paired with odd field assignments that required students to jump to hasty conclusions about the efficacy of public transit after spending just 30 minutes riding a bus, the readings and the course at large lacked any balanced, comprehensive, empirical arguments to back the material on the syllabus. This was disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course. You really learn about how urban history has contributed to the racial, class, and gender inequality we see today. ",

            "\u00a0So much. I learned a lot about urban history and contemporary urban issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze our nations urban history and how that has shaped the social constructions of race, class, and gender in our society today. I learned about the evolution of our country's relationship with business and public space, from learning about the industrialization era and Fordism to gentrification today. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insight into the different processes and issues present in New Haven today. I learned a lot from completing the field projects and thought it was really useful to have that hands-on experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a real eye-opener. From the field projects, I saw that if I just opened my eyes, I could visually see everything discussed in class in the landscape of New Haven. The applicability of the knowledge made this class exciting and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty crazy how much you can learn in one class. I learnt so much about historical processes that have been inequalities in race, class and gender in america. Hopefully i will not only be more interesting at dinner parties but i will be aware when i am in a position to do/contribute something positive. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly eye-opening, and probably one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I truly look at urban centers -- or just American inequality in general -- in a whole new way. Loved it. ",
            "\u00a0historical and contemporary inequalities in urban spaces. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to analyze the history of inequality effectively even if I have not experienced many of the inequalities. I learned how to structure essays in a caring way while being analytical and strong in an argument. ",
            "\u00a0The course enlightens students on the discriminations that pervade everyday life, and have become so naturalized in America. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of historical processes underlying urban inequalities. Examples of topics: role of bilingual-biracial people in navigating Detroit's early fur-trade, housing discrimination in US cities during 1900s, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely interesting to take, given current events and the political atmosphere right now. I gained a much greater insight into the historical and daily struggles of people you don't interact with every day on the street. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about the history, social processes, and spatial constructs that have shaped race, class, and gender relations and inequalities in American cities. I came into the class not knowing much about the forces that have transformed and defined cities in the last two centuries, and I walked away knowing a lot more about the cultural attitudes and intent behind decisions made by governments, corporations, and individuals. ",
            "\u00a0It's like a review of U.S. history since slavery, with more focus industrialization, urban renewal, neoliberalism, and various practices of housing discrimination. I definitely learned new things, but everything felt intuitive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of race, class, and gender in cities in American and understand how historic legacies of discrimination manifest in the contemporary built environment. I think I also gained the language to be able to talk about social issues and understand better the historic context of many urban issues. ",
            "\u00a0As a survey course, it is super informative about the creation of whiteness and systems of oppression in the United States. Specific histories that this course elaborated on were urban renewal and discriminatory lending.\r\n\r\nAn insight that overarches through the class is the compounding effects of history on contemporary lives. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a very formative understanding of the importance of space and how we infuse emotion, power, and control over societal constructions of space, especially in very dense urban environments when many different types of people are in contact. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about race, class, and gender relations in contemporary and historical American cities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the spatial and systematic ways through which people of color have been disadvantaged for many years. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting history and its relation to current urban issues. I wouldn't say that I developed any knew skills but the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I can give you a bunch of examples of racism in Detroit and explain to you how parking lots can be symptoms of gentrification ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic AMST concepts that will guide me through the major going forward. I learned to think critically about the city as I walk through it every day. I learned to look at housing, employment, public space, etc with a greater sense of history and context. ",
            "\u00a0This class educated me on the entrenched policies, social implications, literature, and laws that have created and deepened the racism in American cities. This class was incredibly instrumental in my understanding of the division, inequalities, and inequity that exists today. ",
            "\u00a0A historical and contemporary understanding of issues regarding race, class, and gender in American cities ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of the historical roots of discrimination in US cities, and the main problems affecting cities today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of urban inequalities, and contemporary urban inequalities. I was able to observe and thinking critically about contemporary urban inequalities, and think about solutions. I became a better informed citizen. ",
            "\u00a0This course got me very interested in the stories of the communities we \"studied\". I feel like it's extremely easy to look at statistics and research about various underserved communities, but one will not begin to understand the complexities of individual experiences until one intentionally communicates with members of that community. In other words this course was helpful in showing students the importance of valuing humanity and not just the statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much all I gained from this class was slightly heightened awareness of my surroundings in a city. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class! ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of our society's structure. Much of it I kind of knew intuitively but learning the actual processes and systems was really valuable and made me think of things in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned MANY things about American cities, public policy, group culture, and discrimination. I had never realized that discrimination could manifest itself in physical built space, but this course really opened my mind. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of race and class inequalities in cities throughout America and how they have derived over time. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt really learn anything new in this class but it definitely provided me with background and language for these topics ",
            "\u00a0This class definitely opened up my eyes to the injustice going within major cities across the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about historical processes and practices that contributed to present-day urban inequalities. Through the 3 field projects, I developed my ability to write argumentative essays relating my own observations of the real world to class themes. ",
            "\u00a0This class wasn't the most intellectually stimulating but I am now able to talk about things I observe in urban environments with a little more sophistication. ",

            "\u00a0I learned to view the urban landscape in a unique way. I found the course especially relevant and exciting as the content related itself back to local New Haven. I felt like I had many opportunities to apply what I learned through field projects and papers. ",
            "\u00a0- Was shown the historical foundations for inequality in American cities, with a focus on the geographic distribution of inequality (not just wealth inequality) and how it came about\r\n\r\n- Got some experience doing observational field research in a sociological / anthropological style\r\n\r\n- Got to see and study parts of New Haven I otherwise wouldn't have ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write historical papers in a different format than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0The main focus of the class is to tease out the way contemporary urban processes and issues manifest as the products of history. The class starts with a historical account of state-sanctioned and extralegal discrimination in housing, immigration, urban planning, employment, and transit throughout the 20th century. This is I think the strongest part of the course, and should be required learning for every student at Yale in understanding why our cities and society have the inequalities that we witness every day. Professor Barraclough and her teaching team then link those histories of inequality with their contemporary consequences. I will never look at the built environment in the same way. Eye-opening and crucial learning. There's good reason why this class is one of the largest taught in Yale College. ",
            "\u00a0Greater awareness of the urban issues of race, class, and gender inequality and the historical processes that created them ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to truly think about space and the what the decisions about space, such as that in American cities, says about how parts of society creates inequality among different peoples. I've never been so aware and inquisitive about where I'm from, where I'm going, or where I am, as it relates to other people's quality of life. ",
            "\u00a0While I have always known that the present day inequalities that plague this nation are a product of this nation's history, this course shed light on the many layers and complexities of such inequalities. Moreover, this course taught me that breaking through legal barriers does not necessarily result in any social or economic changes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the systems of oppression within American cities and how these have affected the ways in which space has been used as well as the communities within this space. ",

The first field project centered more about artistic analysis than it did about the course material, and especially as the first project, I felt like there were probably better ways to engage with what we were learning. \r\nFor the second one, I think it is worth considering the issue of a large amount of Yale students descending on the bus system in order to analyze the habits of normal people in New Haven. It felt very invasive and insensitive. Additionally, there was some language in the assignment itself that was questionable (specifically when we were instructed to \"Analyze the demographic profile of the passengers inside the bus and at the bus stops. Consider\r\ntheir age, sex, ethnicity/race, and apparent socio-economic status.\" I felt like we were ending up completely stereotyping in order to prove our point). I really enjoyed writing the paper, but the research I did to get there felt like I was exploiting people's daily lives and struggles for a grade. \r\nFor the third one, as someone very new to New Haven, I wished I had more insight on the city in order to complete this project. Since the assignment was given over Thanksgiving break, I wish we would have been given the option to write about our hometown. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone has something to learn from this course, and the sense of inclusivity that Professor Barraclough fostered here was greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI did not get the chance to attend either film screening, but I did watch both films. Perhaps more time in between the screening and its direct relevance to the course would help. ",
            "\u00a0My only concern with this class is that I felt like lectures and readings were sometimes repetitive because lectures often summarized the findings of the readings but didn't always expand upon or challenge those findings in any significant ways. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were certainly the material--I learned so much and Professor Barraclough was an amazing professor who had an incredible amount of insight about the topics she was discussing, and I think that the Field Projects were a unique way of getting students to consider concepts of inequality and what they might mean around them, and interpret them through firsthand experience. Sometimes the prompts for these projects, however, were incredibly broad which made it hard to know what questions should be answered in the project. And, the second Field Project made me feel a little uncomfortable because, even though I understand the purpose was to observe transit inequity in person, I thought the whole observation process was a little strange since we were supposed to be observing people going about their everyday lives in a way that made me feel a little weird. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nPerfect amount of reading, and great readings (about 50-70 easy pages a week): not too much, but enough to feel like I learned a lot every week.\r\n\r\nProfessor Barraclough is phenomenal: her lectures are incredibly engaging. The 50 minutes passed so quickly every time. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe filmsthere were two \"\"\"\"mandatory\"\"\"\" film screeningsdid not fit into the course as effectively as they could have. Instead of doing the first paper on a piece of art, which is academically confusing, since this class does not talk about art at all all, we should do a reflection on a film in connection to the readings. \r\n\r\nThe food and water section at the end felt a little thrown in: I would appreciate more discussion about food and water in the history section so the current section feels more grounded. \r\n\r\nMy section all agreed that we wanted to follow up about Native Americans in the \"current events\" side of the coursewe started with discussions of them, but then did not revisit them. \r\n\r\nThe \"gender\" section of the class was lackingit often felt somewhat thrown in. The class could either be changed to \"race and class in American cities,\" and keep the same amount of gender stuff, or should include more feminist theory, history, and current movements to balance out the gender aspect. Also, one reading about queer urbanism would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were good but at times felt a mile wide and inch deep. I wish we spent more time talking about how race plays into healthcare access. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is Professor Barraclough and my TA Joey's dedication to teaching. The weakness is that there is not enough time to talk about the weekly readings in only one section. ",
            "\u00a0The field projects were awesome! Getting to go out into New Haven and take the bus or identify gentrification was a great way to apply the theories we had learned in class to the realities of city life which was awesome to be able to do! ",
            "\u00a0This course does not push its students. The readings were uninteresting and had very little to do with the lecture material. The only time we ever worked with the text was in papers, and even that was very infrequent. Section should have been about the readings, but so few students did the readings that section became useless.\r\nMoreover, the class failed to be an intellectual space. Instead of discussing theory or readings, we simply spoke of anecdotes or experiences that we have had. While recognizing the importance of lived experience, this class took it too far in that it became difficult to even talk about the theory because certain students wanted to hear themselves talk about their lives. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are amazing and readings are relevant ",
            "\u00a0Professor Barraclough is an engaging lecturer and there are interesting readings. The midterm is structured well, however I found some of the field projects and the final paper to be a bit vague and pointless. Also what you get out of of the course is largely based on how good and engaging your TA and mine personally was not great ",
            "\u00a0strength was very informative, weakness was readings were SUPER long ",
            "\u00a0This was definitely an interesting course, and I enjoyed going to lecture. However, I feel like the assignments did not do a good job stimulating thought outside of what was covered in lecture. The assignments were my least favorite part of the class - they weren't \"hard\", but they were so uninteresting and structured that it was a pain to get through each one. While the assignments required observation of real-world processes, the instructions and guidelines for what to write about were so strict that leaving campus was not able to do much to inspire your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the assignments weren't great, especially field assignment 1. I thought the lectures were excellent but they often talked about certain specific cases and ranged across a variety of cities, never giving a comprehensive history of the specific cities talked about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include Professor Barraclough's teaching and clear passion for the topic, as well as the sections as opportunities for students to discuss, for instance, their experiences growing up as members of different communities and cities across the country.\r\n\r\nMain weakness is that the class sometimes felt less like an academic setting and more like a gathering of \"woke\" students trying to show that they were more knowledgable about and sympathetic to the plights of the urban poor than you were. This was especially true in section and often went unchecked by the TA.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was very disappointed by the format of the \"final exam.\" First of all, it was a final paper, not a final exam. Don't even call it a \"take home exam\" when it is literally just a final paper. Take-home exams typically do involve writing an essay of some form, but are usually administered with time restrictions. I was extremely frustrated to learn that I would have to write an actual, 10-page final paper that would eat into the rest of my reading week.\r\n\r\nSecond, and related to the final paper, I thought the prompt was extremely unimaginative and limiting. After everything we had learned in the class, it would have been so fulfilling to be able to write about a particular urban issue, perhaps specific to a city that we cared about, and to be able to do some outside research. Being limited to the in-class readings made the paper feel like busy work, a regurgitation of what we had already discussed in class and in sections. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Barraclough has crafted a good course. i'd love to see more focus on things like education and natural spaces, in the context of race/gender/class. ",
            "\u00a0The class for the first half focuses on historical events/processes that shaped the contemporary issues discussed in the second half--it's great to understand how current inequalities arose, but the structure limits the number of contemporary issues that can be covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course was superficial and unbalanced. Complex issues like housing discrimination and transit inequity were boiled down to sets of bullet points in lecture, presented as the totality of a subject, and rarely attempting to explore or even acknowledge the nuances of certain views on the issues. Readings never painted opposing points of view on certain sociological issues -- in fact, the readings rarely addressed the issues with clear, scholarly argument at all. Instead, the course material was a soupy mix of buzz words and political opinion. I am a liberal student extremely interested in the concepts this course seemed to offer in its syllabus, but its sheer lack of substance made it extremely difficult to engage with. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Barraclough is a gem. Truly loved going to lectures. The films were not scheduled at good times, and you didn't need to watch them to do well in the class. I would recommend doing away with those. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Field projects are extremely helpful and interesting, but don't take too much time. Lecture is interesting and well-organized, easy to take notes on. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pace of the course varies wildly, and it was hard to tell if we were moving forward in time or just shifting around to different subject areas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures are pretty interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are many readings, and not all of them are very accessible (as in easy to understand, they're very convenient to find). Our section was too big; I think it was about 30 people? ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: Professor Barraclough is a fantastic lecturer and makes class clear and interesting with personal anecdotes as well as well-selected information. The field projects were all incredibly informative and forced us to evaluate our place in New Haven and to see a different perspective of life in this city. The readings were all enjoyable and captivating while not being too overbearing. The class was a relaxed setting for discussions of race, class, and gender without feeling too forced or contrived.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: We talked about Aative American history in the beginning, but we never mentioned it again. To me that is a huge hole in our nations urban history that should have been touched upon a little bit in a modern setting. Also, the films Professor Barraclough selected for us were never really discussed in the classroom setting, so they felt pointless. Though the name of the class is Race, Class, and Gender, we didn't talk about Gender other than reproductive labor in the era of Fordism. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nI like how integral the class was to the human experience; all of the topics we studied in class were presented with a sense of reflection on how they impact real people and their families. I was particularly wowed by a picture of an old Hispanic woman crying when she lost her mom to build Dodgers stadium. I appreciate how the class taught me about important aspects of how policies and cities contribute to disparities amongst identity constructs of Americans while still discussing how the very powers of cities that are used to oppress them can be turned around to support them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI don't think the field projects were all that well designed. Though I enjoy that they are physically engaging with New Haven, I don't think that they are all equally helpful for long-term learning. In particular, riding the bus was a passive experience. Perhaps it would be more interesting for students to go to local libraries and partake in the education system in New Haven, or to attend a local event I like the essay regarding gentrification. I think that the final is too vague. The grading standards of creating novel ideas is absurd. We are college students (some straight out of high school); novel ideas related to the class are potentially worthy of PhDs or Master's degrees. I think that given that there is a rubric/standard for the class that is known to the TFs, why not share it with students? There is clearly a way to write an essay that the class wants and letting students blindly guess what the standards are is unfair.\r\n\r\nGiven that the class is about urban studies, it would be helpful in the final remarks of the class to contrast it to rural communities. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was being able to apply the information learned in the class in scenarios which lead us to learn more about the city we occupy--New Haven. A weakness is that is sort of felt like a high school course in that the lectures were extremely broad and often times, I found myself already knowing everything that was being taught. ",
            "\u00a0I found no real fault in this course. The readings were all pertinent and insightful. I looked forward to them each week. Lectures were clear and thorough. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great, no complaints. Even the assignments were interesting to do. ",
            "\u00a0The course involved field projects based in New Haven, which were awesome though also felt a little voyeuristic at times. One weakness is the sheer size of the class -- I appreciate that Professor Barraclough did not cut anyone from the class list, so it isn't her fault, but it would've been nice to have a smaller class size. ",
            "\u00a0strength: interesting enough \r\n\r\nweakness: just copying slides ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, but it could shorten industrialization and cover more contemporary topics concerning race, migration, and refugees, ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting. However, the class followed the powerpoint pretty closely, so I didn't always benefit a huge amount from class. A lot of the information is also intuitive if you have had history courses before. Section styles seemed to vary greatly and there was little wiggle room when it came to either switching section times or extensions. I also felt that the field assignments were somewhat superficial and would have benefited from outside research (i.e. looking up news articles about New Haven bus routes to complement our one ride). ",
            "\u00a0This course was eye-opening, but it could be improved by being more than just a reading off the slides or a reiteration of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the field projects on transit equity and gentrification, which pushed me out of my comfort zone and taught me to view New Haven and Yale  and my own relationship with both  in a new light. This was a fantastic, interactive way to apply the more abstract concepts and theories we learned in class to real-life situations. The readings also supplemented lecture material well, and I enjoyed discussing them in the context of both academic theories and our personal experiences in section.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class focused too much on the academic discussion of inequalities and not enough on what it means for people to actually be influenced and disadvantaged by specific policies and ideologies. For example, we learned that poor women of color suffer many disadvantages from dependency on public transit, but I wanted to know how this actually played out in their day-to-day lives. For neighborhoods affected by gentrification, I wanted to hear more firsthand accounts from displaced residents, newcomers, government planners, and corporate voices. The readings helped a little with this, but overall I wish there had been more opportunities to see the real-life impacts of the laws and attitudes we explored in class. I was also disappointed in the lack of attention given to the Asian American experience, especially given that there is a long, complex history of discrimination against Asian immigration on the West Coast and gentrification in Chinatowns. ",
            "\u00a0Having to go out for the field projects is valuable (inconvenient of course, but valuable). Prof. Barraclough is great. She's really considerate, and it's worth meeting with her during office hours to discuss whatever interests you. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very engaging, and the readings are very relevant and interesting. Professor Barraclough does a wonderful job of drawing and synthesizing the main points from the readings in her lectures. However, not much of the course focused on gender in cities, so I would have wanted more readings and more of the course dedicated to gender and the intersectionality of race, class, and gender. I also sometimes found it hard to follow one issue across time because the class is so broad, i.e. it was difficult to track changes in class struggles over time because a lot of that information was presented in disjoint entities in different lectures, and because the readings were from different time periods and geographic locations. \r\n\r\nIn section, we also talked a lot about the relationship between Yale and New Haven, and I think the course would benefit from the addition of some readings specifically about the changing relationship between Yale and New Haven over time and about \"university cities,\" or cities dominated by a major educational institution. It would be interesting to explore this relationship formally.\r\n\r\nThe field projects are good in theory, and I understand the significance of them, but  I sometimes felt like I was treating New Haven residents and the city as \"objects\" of observation in order to benefit my own personal education. For instance, with the transit equity project, I felt uncomfortable observing people on the bus and taking notes and then drawing my observations from that single bus ride to talk about transit equity in all of New Haven. I'm not sure if there's a way around this, perhaps a restructuring of the prompts or just more discussion of academic practice and respecting residents' space. ",
            "\u00a0The second half seemed not as strong as the first, historical half. It was not structured chronologically, which is not a bad thing; it was an awkward transition perhaps between the two modes of historiography.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this course is SEVERELY lacking in queer histories of urban space. Gender (and sexuality) seemed to have less emphasis in relation to the other words in the course's title. \r\n\r\nFinally, the course historicizes indigenous peoples in America. Focusing only on how Native peoples shaped early settlements, there was ZERO mention of termination policies, rural-urban migration patterns and the contemporary experiences of urban indigenous people. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides a very empowering sense of understanding the world in a new way and using that knowledge to challenge structures that have been exclusionary or oppressive on the basis of race, class, gender, sexuality, nation, etc. I feel very grateful for taking the time to learn how these overarching historical ideas impact the very land we interact with everyday. Because this is an introductory course to urban studies and spatial understandings of environment, there was definitely a lot to cover, and I would like more concrete relations of the contemporary movements we learned about with the historical processes of conquest and colonization. I heard from some students that they did not like how Native American influence over space really stopped with historical conquest, and they would like a reintegration of these narratives that are usually forgotten in mainstream understandings of the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structured well to connect the historical to modern issues in American cities, but I found that we often \"villanized\" one group of people, which made the course uncomfortable sometimes. Especially, when I was part of the group that was portrayed in a negative light. I also wish there was more on gender discussions, for that seemed to be shoved in on the end of sentences or lectures sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting. The lecture is easy to follow, and section really reinforces the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course would definitely be the lectures and the readings and the way my section was run. I've never had such a rich but accessible selection of readings in one course. And the lectures were so coherently structured; every single one constructs a narrative that sticks with you. I'm not sure whether to call this a weakness, but I felt ambivalent about some of the assignments. But this is probably something I should have taken up with the professor mid-semester. This course also kinda upheld a gender binary by talking exclusively about women when it came to the gender components of the course. How do these policies impact trans and gender nonconforming people? Also, there was no discussion of disability and this seems particularly important when we talk about the built environment. I think this course could stand to expand its imagination vis-a-vis the various modes of subjection it takes up. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths is that you learn a lot from this class from the lectures, readings, field projects, and discussion sections.

            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures/lecture slides were very insightful. The \"Field Projects\" were engaging and required students to leave the \"Yale Bubble\" and interact with the New Haven community. The topics of study were generally very interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The wording of \"Field Project #2\" felt ostracizing to members of urban communities. It had a very \"zoo exhibit\" feeling where the students were asked to go in the community and observe as an outsider into a habitat that is both unfamiliar and alien. Then, the students were expected to report on how to make an aspect of the community better without having had any prior experience with the issues that members of the community face everyday. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was definitely targeted towards underclassmen, which is fine. However, it was so large that it was easy to disengage. As a matter of fact, I did-- I stopped attending lecture because I felt I wasn't learning anything at all. I stopped attending section because I didn't care enough to do the readings at some point.  Lecture slides were disappointing and even laughable. I just could not justify taking such a class, which seemed so illegitimate and a waste of time as compared with my other classes. I never thought I would be so disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0While this course obviously cannot cover all city scapes and the history of different ethnic groups, I found it problematic that the only instance in which Asian-Americans or Asians in cities was discussed was in the example of ethnoburbs.This brief guest appearance, only depicted Asians as being the cause of white flight from the suburbs b/c Asian children academically competed with white children. I found this problematic as it introduced racism against Asians only within the context of model minority stereotype, honestly PERPETUATING this narrative as the presentation didn't necessarily justify whites being racist against Asians, but it present the racism as normalized, and like they had good reason to be racist due to\r\n the competion. As this is an introductory class on race for many, and this is THE ONLY context that  most studnets will receive on racism against Asians, this is incredibly misleading. Maybe including a something on Chinatowns? Something that gives better context on how whites and Americans have always been racist against,  Asians, BESIDES MODEL MINORITY FOR ONCE. \r\n\r\nThank you for reading this, I very muc appreciate it.

A final paper and a take home exam typically fit very differently into that puzzle, and it felt disingenuous to label a paper as an exam.

I felt that many presentations discussed topics only on the surface and thus seemed somewhat self-explanatory. Additionally, I think this class's assignments could be improved.

However, the TAs for this class were great and were always eager to help. ",

Although I understand the purpose of the assignment was to get individuals who have never ridden a bus to ride one, I was very uncomfortable with it. After attending high school in New Haven and having rode the bus frequently, I was uncomfortable with the fact that we were asked to make grand assumptions based on experiences after one ride. It felt very judgemental and elitist. ",

I also felt as though the sections were not very open to discussion and creating conversation, but more about harping on democratic ideas and not really talking about issues from the other point of view. There was also a lot of conversation about the issues that occur in cities and not a lot about what is being done to prevent that. ",

There should be more intro classes to ethnic studies so that classes like this do not have to spend time on basic material such as the fact that racism exists. The weaknesses are not a fault of the class, but of the Yale population. ",
            "\u00a0I found that a strength of the course was the quality of lectures, quality of discussions, and the number of ideas we discussed. My main complaint is that we were not able to delve deeply into many ideas, and ended up skimming across the surface of many. I would have liked to see more time spent on some specific issues. ",

Also, some of the readings (ie. Walker) were fascinating, but others were dry and very difficult to get through. The field assignments-- the actual trips to the museum, the bus ride, and the trip to a site of gentrification in New Haven-- were awesome, but the related writing assignments were not really that interesting. They would have done better either as pure reflections or as research papers, not the weird in-between that required a lot of generalizations and regurgitation of lecture material. ",

However I really was not a fan of the assignments or \"field projects\". I felt like they were all the result of the instructor trying to do something ~different~, but they ended up just being mainly confusing and kind of problematic. I felt weird about observing regular people on the bus who were just trying to go about their day, and for the group essay (how the hell do you write a group essay???) we had to write a full paper about the process of gentrification occurring on a block after merely walking around the block for a couple of hours.

It's obvious that Professor Barraclough meticulously planned the lectures/outline of the class. The readings overlapped well with the lectures, and everything flowed together well. I enjoyed getting a historical background before diving into more recent developments/perspectives on American cities. The sections are great, and the assignments are very enlightening and helpful. The assignments certainly help you learn. Honestly, not that many weaknesses. Perhaps, the class would be improved if we DID NOT get the essay prompts ahead of time. That could make preparing a bit easier. "

Also, at least my TF was NOT a difficult grader. \r\n\r\nMake sure to go in and talk to Professor Barraclough just to get to know her.

Although the beginning half of the class moved rather slowly (covering topics like slavery and indigenous history in the US that many students had learned about in other classes), the historical processes are nicely tied to contemporary urban issues discussed in the second half of the semester. If you're looking to better understand current events and issues of equality without having to spend an entire semester on one topic, then this class is for you! ",

The lectures were soupy mixes of buzz words and political opinion, and vast majority of readings were void of any concrete, empirical argument. The assignments were frustrating, asking students to make extremely hasty and inevitably inaccurate judgments by riding the New Haven bus once and walking around a block, investigating gentrification. I entered the course wanting to gain concrete understanding of the political, economic, and historical structures behind the social issues in US cities, but I quickly realized that this course was teaching mere vocabulary-- that the issues we were being taught were presented in an overly-simplified, politically-tinted manner that did not engage any intellectual challenge. I do not write this because I disagree with the politics of the class (I dont) and I understand the merit the courses objective. Nevertheless, I was very disappointed with this class. ",

The workload was incredibly manageable if you put in an ounce of effort, and the course materials and themes are so applicable to those who might feel like they have a narrow view of social dynamics of the country. I come from a sheltered suburb in New Jersey, and I now have so much more perspective on the country from taking this class. ",

            "\u00a0I have mixed feelings about this class. On the one hand, it does a great job of explaining how race, class, and gender in American cities have been shaped by cultural attitudes, explicit policies, and historical trends. I especially liked learning about how race, class, and gender inequalities are not only social constructs, but also spatial constructs, and that these inequalities are often a result of deliberate decisions made by governments, private corporations, and individuals to disadvantage certain populations. This class changed the way I view public transportation and the organization of public spaces and public culture, and I think Ill come back to the things we learned throughout my life, especially now as I consider what it means to be a Yale student in New Haven. However, I hesitate to recommend this class for a few reasons. One, I think the class is overly ambitious and tries to cover too many things as a survey course. There were many times when I was left dissatisfied with the broad generalizations and oversimplifications we made regarding policies, ideologies, and peoples experiences. In addition, I think the class was unnecessarily stressful in some ways. The midterm was very fair, but the field project and take-home final instructions were vague, and it was hard to know what the expectations were regarding how much we were supposed to infer vs the limitations of our observations. Finally, I was disappointed that the class focused so much on abstract academic theories and not a lot on how specific policies and ideologies actually affect peoples experiences in practice. We also missed some great opportunities to tie what we learned into the current events/debates happening today, such as those related to police brutality, mass incarceration, and affirmative action. Overall, I think its important to remember that this is a survey course, which benefits someone for whom this material is new but imposes noticeable limitations on the depth of coverage. ",
            "\u00a0It didn't live up to the hype of last year's reviews, but wasn't bad. Lectures were almost 100% from the PowerPoints, which was a bit dissatisfying.

At the beginning of the semester and the first class (which I will say was a great class), I expected the class to go one of two ways: a very theoretical analysis of the titled concepts or an engaging analysis of spatial relations and how they affect power dynamics. Ultimately though, all I got out of the class was just more examples of racism in Detroit. Also, one of the assignments is just poorly constructed and,despite trying to increase engagement between Yale students and the New Haven community, does the exact opposite by furthering the wall between the groups.

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any student. I would especially recommend taking it during your first year as a means of exploring New Haven in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0yes! everyone should take this to understand basic inequalities ",
            "\u00a0This is a good introductory course to contemporary American urban social issues and their historical causes but might not be appealing to students who are already well versed in American urban history. I would recommend this as a manageable fifth class, especially for someone unfamiliar with policy problems in U.S. cities. ",
            "\u00a0100% recommend this - it is a fabulous course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course! It was super insightful, the lectures are always fascinating, and there is not too much work. The tests are also super straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because I loved the material, the teacher, and the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, every student at Yale should take this course as most students could stand to learn something about New Haven as a city and the places they come from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Barraclough is an incredible lecturer who clearly cares about her students even though it's a large lecture class. She is very approachable and willing to help students on a variety of issues. The class itself I, at first, thought was going to be a basic intro sociology course on inequality in cities, but this class truly taught me a myriad of different concepts. I was surprised about how much I learned from this class, and I consider myself well versed in contemporary sociological inequality literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Everyone would benefit from the class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Greatly applicable and fun class that taught me a new way to look at the world. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class to another student. It truly changes the way you understand contemporary social issues because it provides a historical analysis of them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class gives the student concrete examples of how discriminatory practices shaped the inequalities we see today. Good field projects too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other Yale students. ",
            "\u00a0This is arguably a must take. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course should be required, if Yale ever had any required course. New Haven is a really unique case study and this course allows you not only to interact with the city that Yale has such a deep relationship to but with any city that you grew up in or will ever visit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course is really important and great in learning how American society has gotten to where it is today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Both the professor and the TAs are great and do everything they can to help you be successful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class!! If you want to gain a better sense of issues that affect our society today (in terms of race, class, and gender) and how they have gradually become embedded in society over time take this class. Professor Barraclough is an amazing lecturer, each lecture goes beyond what she prepares on the slides and connects very much to the readings. Not too much work, but engaging field projects, ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as an introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of the greatest classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student! It gives you a knew point of view about cities and the field projects really let you see the topics that we talked about in person. Professor Barraclough is amazing and the TAs are great! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone interested in American history or urban studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are a STEM major and want to gain some knowledge on many important topics that affect our everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I would as long as they are interested in the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was an interesting course and not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes of course! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this to any student who wants to understand more about how American cities are created. The field projects we have done such as the bus transit project and the gentrification project are really eye-opening and informative! ",
            "\u00a0Only a good course if you havent had much exposure to standard liberal perspectives on inequality in policy and history. It felt like I was being told exactly what I already believed, without supporting those perspectives with much nuanced evidence. ",
            "\u00a0Race, Class, Gender, and American Cities was a good class overall. Professor Barraclough was wonderful and clearly cared about the class a lot. She organized the material really well and she put a lot of thought into the content of the class. This is a very good intro class for ER&M, but I wouldn't recommend it to people who have done similar or more advanced ER&M/ AFAM, classes because you might find it a little bit too intro-y. As an environmental studied class, however, it is really interesting, because it is one of the few urban studies classes at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe class has a fair amount of work, with three projects, a midterm and a take-home final, so it is definitely not an easy class. There are also two film screenings, which really added to the class. Lectures are good, and the readings are very manageable. It is very 'survey', and we dash through history and themes very quickly. There is not much opportunity for you to explore your own interests because the projects are quite narrow.\r\n\r\nLastly, Prof Barraclough is very approachable and kind, and she made the class enjoyable overall. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class for understanding current American social politics. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! This is the perfect low work/high reward lecture. If you show up you're basically guaranteed to get an A, but you'll want to show up because the lectures are so interesting. And you'll honestly learn a lot about the cities you call home. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course that is both very accessible and highly engaging. I took it as a social science credit, having no background in the material, and found lecture and section very interesting. There were 3 short papers plus a final, but they were fun/easy to write. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches the consequences of neoliberalism and racism in a real and applicable way. Great for anyone and especially those interested in domestic legal or policy work. ",
            "\u00a0Yesthis course counts for many majors, is interesting, is not very difficult, and has a reasonable workload and reading load. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants an introduction into American studies and has not studied inequality a lot. ",
            "\u00a0It's an amazing class and you'll be able to see New Haven and other cities in context of inequality. There is so much history in the buildings and spaces we occupy, and this class really puts all of this in context, and it's quite powerful. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're not super well informed (like I was) about race, class and gender issues and want to get a slightly better sense of why the country looks the way it does today. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE. IT. Easy assessments, good content, nice professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it makes students consider a variety of perspectives they may not have considered on their own and pushes them to apply what they have learned to understanding New Haven through live urban studies projects ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! Professor Barraclough does an amazing job of outlining the processes and histories of how we came to have the segregation and class disparities that we are seeing today. My only regret about this class was that I took it C/D and did not pay attention and learn as much as I could have. (Btw...this class is extremely manageable in terms of workload and a great 5th class). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who are seeking to have a better understanding of processes such as gentrification and neoliberalism and how these processes continue to perpetuate inequalities in groups that have already faced oppression for as long as history can show us and how to begin thinking of ways to remedy these sociopolitical issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend AFAM 196: Race, Class, Gender, and American Cities to another student because the material is important, but I do have some reservations. It's definitely a survey course, covering a broad range of material but in very little depth, which can be frustrating at times. The first half of the course discussed history from the beginning of civilization to the current day. I found it to be the more interesting part of the course because I learned about historical foundations of injustice that I had never been aware of. The second half of the course talked about modern-day issues of inequality, ranging from transit to gentrification. It was still interesting, relevant, and important, but it felt a little scattered. The focus was largely on racism, with discussion of intersections with class and gender. Professor Barraclough is a great lecturer and makes very good slides, so the lectures were the highlight of the class for me. The readings were hit or miss (probably about 50-100 pages per week) and section was a bit of a drag. The field assignments-- the actual trips to the museum, the bus ride, and the trip to a site of gentrification in New Haven-- were awesome, but the related writing assignments (three papers of 3-6 pages each + 1 final paper of 7-10 pages to be written during reading period) were not really that interesting or fulfilling. There was also a midterm exam with some short answers and an essay, but we were given terms and essay questions to prepare in advance which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Everyone should have the opportunity to engage with this curriculum and think critically about historical processes. I feel like it made me a better citizen. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I think this class really does make you more informed as a person living in a city and as a citizen overall. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely I would recommend this course to another student, this is information everyone should be learning! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS YOU WON'T REGRET IT. This class changed my life. I learned so much--this class will forever influence how I understand policy and analyze the built environment (not only in urban centers, but also in suburban and rural areas). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an amazing course. "
