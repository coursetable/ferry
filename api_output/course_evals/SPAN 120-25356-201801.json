            "\u00a0This course enhanced what I learned in Spanish I and really covered a good portion of the language. This course really set a good foundation of Spanish speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0You definitely learn more tenses in L2. This level also challenged us to be more creative and vocal about applying Spanish in class skits and presentations, something I found so valuable. I think this course overall built up a large foundation, having taught us how to conjugate verbs in past, present, and future tenses. We also read numerous texts in Spanish, which was exciting as a way to finally see how Spanish is actually used in culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Spanish, both grammatical structure, vocabulary, and how to speak. I also learned (or at least, I began to see) the differences between how a Spanish speaker and a English speaker might think about the ways they talk. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The manual clearly sets out the schedule so you always know what to expect every day. The workload is sometimes a lot, since the class meets everyday, but it is definitely manageable. The professor I had was AMAZING.\r\nWeakness: The course was definitely fast-paced than I expected, and we learned so many tenses extremely quickly. It was tough trying to keep up with all of them at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0We learn a lot of grammar and conjugations very quickly at the beginning, which doesn't give us a lot of time to practice them or actually remember it. It would be better to spread this out over time so we can actually remember it.\r\nThe speaking assignments were helpful, it would be better if we didn't have to memorize things though because actually memorizing it doesn't help spanish skills, it just gives us a lot more work and stress. \r\nThe course was well organized and clear which was really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very organized, follows textbook very well, always know exactly what you have to do\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that the readings at the end were over our heads, so that we basically had to look up every other word, which I do not think was helpful. ",

            "\u00a0weaknesses: \r\ngrammatical concepts are rushed through. need more time to practice application of new verb tenses, instead of learning them all in 2 weeks and then not revisiting them\r\nfriday exercises not helpful because could be prepared for. need more practice with spontaneous speaking\r\n\r\nstrengths:\r\nprofessors\r\nbreadth of knowledge covered\r\nreading Daniel Torres book ",
            "\u00a0Not enough verbal skills, too much grammar ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus with daily assignments was great. I thought that the Flash Cultura activities were mostly busy work. ",
            "\u00a0There was too much range in skills. Kids came in close to fluent while others had only taken L1. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Professor Symons. I think some of the cultural material that we covered was not as well integrated into the grammar as others. ",
            "\u00a0A HUGE strength of this course is the curriculum. I loved the grade distributions and I think the course was set up in such a way that it was easy to make up for a poor quiz. I think having quizzes was great because it allowed us to now fall behind and it also lessened the burden and stress of having three bigger exams like in L1. The workload of the course was super fair, so no complaints there. \r\n\r\nA definite weakness is that there were times when the readings were definitely so out of my league. I found myself really stressed trying to figure out what every little word meant. Especially for Don Quixote, I didn't feel as connected to the text and because it was so challenging, I think I enjoyed it less. \r\n\r\nI also was wished we had more time to know about the prompt for the skits we did in class, because it was hard to arrange time with my partner(s) outside of class to outline/prepare for the skits. However, I really loved the skits and am so happy we did them! They were the highlight of my Fridays. I also loved that we got to do oral presentations in front of the class and I liked that the oral exam was partner-based because it lessened the anxiety of speaking one-on-one with a professor. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a nice pace. I felt like we covered a good amount without going into stress-overdrive. I particularly liked the communicative activities on Fridays, when we would act out prepared scenes, or in one case, improvise a court of law. I think the course would benefit from a little more flexibility on the part of the teacher. The course is organized by someone who may or may not be your instructor. Either way, the syllabus is rigid and can't be adapted throughout the course. I felt that my experience would've been improved if my instructor had more of a say in the way things were taught. But, I recognize that I had a particularly fabulous instructor, and that my experience was not necessarily applicable to students in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0The class was way to big to facilitate learning of a language, especially at such  low level when students need closer engagement and more opportunities to speak. I did not feel that I was pushed to use my oral skills and that was quite detrimental to my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It facilitates Spanish learning with writing and reading very well.\r\nWeaknesses: I think there should be even more conversational Spanish. "

            "\u00a0Sure. I certainly felt like I got a lot out of the course. It was certainly not my most stimulating course, but if you have a good teacher it's worth its weight in salt. ",
