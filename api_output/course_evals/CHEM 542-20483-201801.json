The assignments, although challenging, proved to be very helpful. The organization of the course could be improved, with refined/revised notes for the future of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course content was interesting and useful, and the workload was not overwhelming. The biggest weakness of the course was that it was sometimes very disorganized. However, this lack of structure allowed for aspects (such as the problem sets) to be improved as the course progressed. ",
            "\u00a0Building from the foundations of E&M up through spectroscopy provided a much more complete picture of the science of spectroscopy than generally happens. The use of analogies and visualizations to describe the concepts was very helpful.\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness is that sometimes the transitions from one topic to the next lacked clear connection and needed to be reiterated.\r\nSummarizing  was often done at the beginning of the class about the previous class. Doing this at the end of class with info fresh in our heads would help to solidify the topics discussed. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is very useful for an intro to electronics, optics, and spectroscopy. ",

            "\u00a0For any student using spectroscopy this course is highly valuable, particularly for those building lasers. "
