            "\u00a0I learned how to connect more deeply with philosophical texts, and how to write better philosophical papers where I engage most closely with the argument being made in each given text. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about modern skepticism and philosophy and how to better write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of philosophical arguments and deep thinking about the meaning of life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how not only to talk about the questions of influential past philosophers but also how to begin to question their questions and their philosophies for myself. One of the ways in which I found myself improving through taking this course in comparison to fall semester was I became more comfortable in bringing up my own examples or hypotheticals to support and counter the ideas presented in the works we read. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that, of all the DS courses, DS Philosophy gave me the most substantive knowledge, because the readings encompassed very specific arguments. I felt that I got a sense of how thinking about mind/body, God, etc. evolved throughout the years. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of modern philosophical canon; ability to trace patterns of influence. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to read and halfway understand things that otherwise would have been impossible for me to read or halfway understand. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking. Textual analysis. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course brought me much closer to an understanding of philosophy, and helped me think more philosophically in general. At times, I wish that the professor had answered certain questions I had more directly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the breadth of the course but it was often very rushed. We could have skipped some philosophers to better focus on others. ",
            "\u00a0Seminar setting, but a more structured class format would be better especially regarding defining difficult philosophical terms and proofs. There were important parts of the text that we did not always cover. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course is that philosophy while a completely different experience if studied in seminar discussions truly does seem to require the amassing of information only a lecture course can provide. This is further complicated by the low attendance during Friday DS lectures and by philosophy lectures being at the end of the week instead of the beginning meaning seminar discussions on a work usually came before the lecture on that work. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course, and I thought that the reading was the most manageable out of all the DS courses, as difficult as it was to understand some philosophers. I also felt that the lectures gave a great overview of the context and parts of the intellectual background for certain ideas. As a whole the course was truly really fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broadness of study; progressive, steady expansion of knowledge base/philosophical vocabulary.  Weaknesses: little time to delve deeply into critical comparisons (a lot of time spent simply explaining material as opposed to putting it into discursive practice). ",
            "\u00a0It feels like it focuses on Hume and Kant a bit more than it needs to, and so misses some important folks later on. Reading some of the later thinkers was a bit challenging because of those gaps. ",
            "\u00a0Instead of presenting a random train of thought in the lectures, perhaps giving an explanation of the work (especially if its more challenging that others such as Kant or Hegel) and adding an interactive element would ensure comprehension. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think this course was extraordinary. It has changed the very way in which I think, and writing papers for this course was actually fun. ",

            "\u00a0If someone has a genuine interest in this course, I would definitely recommend it. I became a better writer and more deeply engaged with the writings we read this semester through the three papers required by this course. Though it is a lot of work and will take a lot of work put in outside of the classroom, since these philosophical proofs and questions are not always easily taught in the seminar context, it is well worth it if you are willing to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend DS philosophy to anyone who has a general interest in philosophy. I did not have much interest in certain recurrent preoccupations in philosophy at first, but reading about them made me understand its importance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  A necessary and exciting introduction to the key thinkers of modern philosophical thought. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Directed Studies is very fulfilling and helps you to gain skills that are relevant throughout your Yale career and beyond. "
