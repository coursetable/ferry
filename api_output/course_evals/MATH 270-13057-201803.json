            "\u00a0The instructor should aim to cover the content on the problem sets before they are due. Having to learn from the textbook everything is fine, but that is something I can do without taking a  course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, very different from other Math courses. Slow paced so easy to keep up.\r\nWeaknesses: hard to do well if you do not have a strong background in proof writing, material not presented in lectures (you basically have to teach yourself the course from the textbook). ",
            "\u00a0This course should be recommended to freshmen as an alternative to math 230, especially for kids who have never seen proofs before. This class could be a fantastic introduction to higher mathematical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0few problem sets which is both good and bad, lectures are kind of a regurgitation of the textbook instead of engaging with new practice but the professor is very iwlling to help outside of class ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with more frequent due dates for smaller assignments. The same amount of work, just more spread out. There should also be a peer tutor and I believe that the university should hire a student to type the lecture notes for the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the subject matter is itself very interesting. The workload was manageable, and the problem sets were helpful. The grader was also nice and provided constructive feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Zuckerman, while a kind teacher and funny guy, taught the class in a way that did not allow the best parts of set theory to shine through. Proofs in class were confusing, the pace was slow (in a way that detracted, I think, from the overall experience), and the exams---while challenging---were also quite different from the kinds of questions/approaches that the textbook emphasized. ",

            "\u00a0This course moved very slowly. That could be a good thing, because Prof. Zuckerman definitely wanted to be very thorough about everything, but it means that you really need to know your stuff come exam time. The lectures could also be a bit difficult to stay engaged with because they were so slow, but it does make it so that it's not too difficult to follow along. \r\n\r\nI think a main weakness of this course was that we only had the one textbook and our class notes for reference and there wasn't really much help available outside of class. Zuckerman did hold office hours and those could be helpful, but they were best for if you had a question about a specific problem on the pset or on some example from the lectures and they also moved quite slowly. It would have been very helpful if there could have been a peer tutor to help outside of class, since the material is very different from other types of math that most students had taken before. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are extremely clear and Professor Zuckerman always provides examples. Problem sets solidify what was taught in class. The class could cover more; I think we dragged at times. "

            "\u00a0The course content is interesting, but you should be comfortable teaching yourself the material. The second midterm, the material was fairly difficult to predict, which was frustrating. The first midterm was exactly what we'd learned in PSETs and in class though. There were 4 psets in this semester, and the workload is low. Course is backloaded, however. ",
            "\u00a0No. You will likely stop going to class once you realize that you're better off just reading the book on your own and working on the problem sets during lecture. ",

Professor Zuckerman is a fantastic prof who cares about your introduction to a topic he loves very deeply. Take this class if you're new to advanced math because it offers a good introduction to proofs. Take this class as an easy 5th class too. ",

Zuckerman is a nice guy and some parts of the material are kind of interesting, but I found this course frustrating. It wasn't so much that the math we did was necessarily harder than other math that I had taken before, but that some of it was hard to get used to and I didn't feel like there were a lot of resources available if I had trouble with something or wanted a little extra help on a problem set. It ended up being that day to day the class was fairly easy and the problem sets weren't too heavy or frequent, but then I wouldn't do well on the tests because they could be quite challenging and Zuckerman graded kind of harshly.
