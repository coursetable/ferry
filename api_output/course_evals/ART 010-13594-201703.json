            "\u00a0This course gives insight into how to work with the medium of watercolor largely through practice and trial and error rather than through formal instruction. We learned how to critically observe the works of renowned watercolorists, then attempted to adapt their styles to our own work. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot about watercolor in this class; I had never worked in the medium before and highly enjoyed it! Also, I learned a lot about color theory and more \"abstract\" representation in painting, both of which I had not encountered in my previous art experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about artists and their styles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some drawing fundamentals, how to see, mix, and layer watercolor pigments, different techniques of watercolor masters and how to apply them. More profoundly, as someone with very limited visual art experience, I learned how to take a visual scene in front of me, unpack it, and reinterpret it on my canvas. I became more confident in my own artistic potential and better informed to engage with art around me (especially at Yale's amazing art galleries!). I also learned a bit about the history of watercolor, which was cool.\r\n\r\nThe class's structure this fall (I noticed in spring 2018 it will only be two hours??) was a once-weekly, three hour seminar. For the first half or so Prof. Van Doren would lecture with a slideshow (and student engagement/questions encouraged, he sometimes provided chocolate to question-answerers) about a topic/master in watercolor's history. Then we'd go (usually outside) and paint. The minimum requirement for the course was to finish that in-class painting and do an additional full painting and a sketch in your sketchbook. There were also weekly 'required' readings which were super interesting but to which we weren't held accountable in any way, so I stopped doing them about halfway through the semester when my other work ramped up :( ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better manage the medium of watercolor, and I learned a lot about various watercolorists and their techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I had never done watercolor or any painting before taking this course. I was given the opportunity to paint different subjects and explore different styles. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far my favorite course I've taken this semester. More than just learning proper watercolor techniques, I learned to about how powerful and valid my own expression is. Art is supposed to be for oneself, and I think that through this class I remember that. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of freedom to experiment, few restrictions on what you can and cannot do, professor is very nice\r\nWeaknesses: wide range of skill levels, little formal instruction for beginners, work outside of class can be quite time consuming, powerpoints sometimes dull, unclear grading system ",
            "\u00a0A strength and weakness of this course is that it meets once a week for three hours; on one hand, it's great that we get a solid block of time to work (very useful when painting outdoors especially), but class sometimes felt really long and students would start to get tired out by the end. \r\nI liked how we visited a lot of different locations, which also allowed me to explore Yale. I particularly enjoyed our visits to museums/meetings with curators, which were definitely highlights. ",
            "\u00a0Fun class. I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses, I loved this class! Great for beginners and more advanced painters! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProf. Van Doren is very personable, accessible, and generous in sharing his enthusiasm and expertise to help students individually. His advice helped me improve my (mediocre) art, and he made the class a fun, welcoming place to be and inspired a love for watercolor which I had not had previously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone of the course material was online-- no Canvas with assignments, no grades. I have no idea what my grade is; we had one term paper and then Prof. Van Doren said that regular critiques (to which he never attached any rubric) would also be taken into account. So, despite its regularity, the course generally felt a bit disorganized, especially in terms of expectations, in a way that was disconcerting.\r\n\r\nI always found myself wanting to put more into this class and spend hours that I didn't have doing paintings.... so sad. You can get by with not doing a whole lot in this course, but you really do get as much from it as you put into it, and it's an amazing opportunity, so if you do take it, invest in it! ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful to know some grades/our grades as the course went along. I have no idea what my final grade is, as we've gotten no feedback in terms of grades, which makes it hard to adjust your behavior as the course goes along, and which makes checking your final grade increasingly nervewracking. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed visiting the Yale Art Gallery and British Art Museum. I thought this course was interdisciplinary in the sense that it not only taught me the basics of watercolor painting but also some history as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Van Doren is teaching this class perfectly. He himself is very cultured and has years of experience and notoriety with watercolor. However, never did I feel like he looked down on any of my paintings or the choices I made in my work. He encouraged constant experimentation in a very low stress environment and i think that really brought out the artist in many of my peers. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Even if you have very little art experience, as long as you are interested and willing to try, this course will be good. Although the lecture half of class sometimes felt tedious, the painting portion was always fun and relaxing; the work outside of class can be rather time-consuming, but it is a nice change of pace compared to other classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The professor is very engaging, there's no shortage of learning by doing, and you get to really explore Yale and its art resources. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0HIGHLY RECOMMEND ",
            "\u00a0If you can get into it, yes! This is a really unique opportunity for non-art majors, to get to take a niche studio art course (that fulfills a Hu credit), supplies provided, and learn how to make awesome art with a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Fantastic course, well organized, fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students whether they have done watercolor before or not. It is a relaxing class to take along with your other course work and allows you to explore many elements of art. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you don't know how to paint of draw, this course is for you. It's a nice break from the fast pace and rigidness of a typical Yale schedule, and it became my happy place this semester. Professor Van Doren doesn't expect anything from you except that you come in with and open mind and a willingness to paint. "
