            "\u00a0I learned much more about Spanish grammar, use of tenses, and vocabulary. ",

            "\u00a0Learned more spanish ",
            "\u00a0I feel more comfortable speaking and I learned key grammatical skills. One insight I've developed by taking this course is that I need to put in more independent work to elevate my skills; this means going beyond classwork to review concepts or vocabulary that I struggled to grasp completely. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my Spanish (speaking, reading, writing, listening, grammar) with new grammatical structures, thematic vocabulary, and cultural activities like short stories and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0We covered many aspects of Spanish grammar and vocabulary. Leaving the class, I feel like I've learned a lot more about the language and culture and that I can now have a conversation with many of my Spanish-speaking friends. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my grammar particularly and my vocabulary a bit. I learned a number of new tenses which I can use to read, write, and speak more like an adult. ",

She is very knowledgeable about spanish grammar and culture and is always willing to explain something to her students. She has countless office hours each week and is always available to help her students. ",
            "\u00a0Course was thorough, not many improvements necessary ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor was high energy and very committed to preparing engaging  activities. \r\nWeaknesses- Needed more incorporation of older material into current activities ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job between balancing practical Spanish and culture - there is a good range of activities, like presentations, dialogues, role play, and short stories. \r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved would be to spread out the grammar/vocabulary more evenly across the semester so that there's better retention, and to do more review of previous material learned throughout the semester once in a while in class or through the homework. For example, more review of grammatical concepts could be integrated into those activities (e.g. requirement to use x structures) so that we're applying/connecting what we're learning. ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized, you know what you need to complete before every class, engaging. Nothing to be improved upon. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the practical components, getting the students to speak to each other. I'm worried that though we covered a number of tenses, it appears that students weren't using the latest ones in conversation after learning them, suggesting they weren't sufficiently comfortable using them. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great. The pacing is nice and the course forced me to go out of my comfort zone in regards to my spanish ability but I never felt like there was anything that I couldn't do. That is Amazing! "
