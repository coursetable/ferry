            "\u00a0I learned how to blow glass! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work with borosilicate glass using an oxygen/natural gas torch. I learned about glass chemistry, how glass it strained and broken, how to make marbles, round bottoms, strait seals, side seals etc. I made a distilling column and an aeolipile. Glass blowing is a very cool skill and I'm glad to have learned the basics. "

            "\u00a0This course was great! I learned so much about glass and glass blowing. The course structure with projects makes learning new techniques exciting and manageable throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class is excellent. Its good that its so small so all the students can ask questions and get help easily. I think the project-based structure was very cool, especially the Hero's engine at the end because I have things that I made in this class that I get to take away. I think it could only be improved by Yale giving Undergraduates some credit for it because it was as much work as most art classes. "

            "\u00a0100% absolutely take this course! The glass shop is one of Yale's hidden gems. The course is on scientific glass blowing but that is mostly the lens through which you are learning the skills. You can use those skills to make anything you want! Glass blowing is a great way to start any day. As both a scientist (in training) and an artist I had so much fun in the class. "
