            "\u00a0Siena culture, history, and pride.\r\n\r\nIntro-level film analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0While taking this course I was able to develop a depth of knowledge on Tuscan history, art, and film. The course allowed me to first learn the facts to facilitate the capability to use this insight and see how it plays into these art forms. ",
            "\u00a0The Italian culture course was a great complement to the Italian language aspect of the program but at the same time stands out on its own. With Professor Tylus, I learned a lot about the medieval art and literature in the Tuscany area, and read a lot of Dante (both in English and occasionally in Italian) which I never imagined myself doing. With Professor Marcus, I got to appreciate the WWII era history of Italy better through media like films, and it was a unique approach for me to understand the history and society at that time. ",
            "\u00a0With the first half of the course, I learned about to look at Tuscan art to understand the society of Tuscany in different era; I learned how to think about cities; I gained an appreciation for italian literature.\r\n\r\nIn the second half of the course, I learned a bit about fascist history in Italy and about movies relating to Tuscany. ",
            "\u00a0Italian and especially Tuscan culture and history in Classical, Renaissance, and Modern times. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good introduction on Tuscan culture: the first half focused on art and literature, and the second half on film. The entire course also discussed history and culture, especially the unique Sienese culture, as well as the history that molded it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Tuscan history, literature, and film as well as about Italian politics and wider significance of Tuscany on the world stage. I sharpened my comparative skills by comparing cities and films. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Italian film. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Italian culture, especially the history and traditions of Siena and its people, ",
            "\u00a0Very little, we did almost no technical analysis of films, the films were often only shown because they were related to Italy and had little significance on the things we were seeing on our trips around Italy. ",
            "\u00a0For the first half of the course with Professor Tylus, I gained a deeper appreciation of Sienese art and history. Professor Tylus' lectures were incredibly clear and engagingshe brought the city to life. She made Sienese history accessible and relevant.\r\nThe second half of the course with Professor Marcus centered around watching film. Life is Beautiful is one of the best films I've seen, but the other ones were mediocre. "

            "\u00a0Too much time spent for just 1 credit. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is definitely how well the excursions aid in putting all this history and theory into context. It really helps paint a very clear picture of what is being taught. Something that could be improved is maybe more of a tie between the two parts of the course. I was unclear whether we should take them as two separates or try to fill the gap in history/culture. ",
            "\u00a0I think the two components of the course really complement each other to help me grasp a more holistic understanding of Tuscany identity. I definitely learned more elements of Tuscany culture through discussions about different eras and exposure to different media (art, literature, film, etc.). It also helps that I can witness some elements of the class material in person (the Palio, the art, the cities in the movies, etc.) I do feel like the film selections in the second half could be better though, because I felt like there should be more renowned and acclaimed Italian filmography that we didn't touch upon. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course ran much better than the second half, and for the future, the second half should really be reevaluated. The movie screenings and long classes in the second half eat up a lot of time which is especially frustrating because it took away from the time to focus on the most difficult part of the italian course -- the course we all actually came for. Instead of being a complement to the Italian class like the first half was, the second half was a competitor. The movies selected, excluding one, weren't particularly interesting which made engagement difficult. We never really had a thorough explanation of Italy's role in 20th century, since we only had one lecture on it. I was realy excited to learn this history, so it was disappointing to not get a more thorough historical perspective. I would have gladly cut out a few of the movies for more history. \r\n\r\nThe first half of the course was really engaging because of Professor Tylus's wonderful enthusiasm and because of how she strucutred the course. We spent little time in a physical classroom so the learning was very much about engaging with the city. And, (to me this was crucial), Tylus held discusion sections with smaller groups than the whole class which made discussions actually engaging and inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who is neither European nor religious, the class did an incredible job of acquainting me with knowledge of Italian history especially through lenses of Christianity. We benefit immensely from being physically in Tuscany, and one way to improve the course would be to assume less about our familiarity with European history (this was less of a problem) and biblical texts (this was much more significant issue for me). ",
            "\u00a0The workload trying to get one credit was ridiculous. And if you're going to put in writing that its only going to meet a couple times a week and last for 75-90 minutes, I'd like for that to be true. ",
            "\u00a0More preference should be given to hands on learning and location based programming such as museum visits over film viewing and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course taught by Jane was wonderful- very engaging, interesting, and was meant to put us out in the environment around us. One weakness was that some of the visits ran long, and it was difficult to keep focused for such a long time, especially after we'd had language class in the morning. The second half on the other hand, was mainly designed to keep us indoors, whether it be through watching the films, writing papers for the films, or working on our final film project. The second half also had an immense workload, which seemed pretty absurd for the fact that it was only 1 credit whereas the language class was 3 credits for the whole summer. ",
            "\u00a0The engagement with primary materials and in particular with sites themselves (Ie on field trips) was fantastic. More clarity on class times and expectations would have been helpful, but the classes themselves were great! ",
            "\u00a0Could have a better selection for choice of movies. Choices were either problematic or of much shallow analytical depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very instructive and interactive, especially the first half of the class taught by Jane Tylus. Thanks to the class I visited museums, churches and many other places that I wouldn't have otherwise. \r\nThe second part taught by professor Marcus was instructive although not as engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: very disorganized, as much work if not more than our intensive Italian class despite being worth a third of the credit, poorly chosen films and very choppy discussions that never really got flowing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tylus' class was amazing! Absolutely loved the lectures. The papers felt too open-ended at times, but it was also nice to write about anything that came into your mind. Professor Marcus' class was so-so, which stemmed from the fact that some of the films that we watched were average. In discussions, it sometimes felt like we were being pigeon-holed into a particular conclusion/analysis of the film. Could be improved with a more open discourse of the films. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, with Professor Tylus (I was interested in her area of expertise: Sienese history) -- Probably not with Professor Marcus (I was not interested in her area of expertise: film analysis) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. As someone with little background knowledge on world history and art, the course was able to spark this interest in a very fun way. The learning experience was also very interactive and the information really stuck. I would imagine for those with some background knowledge on these things it would be even more enlightening and informing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student. I got to write my very first novel (which is about Dante of all people) and make my very first film in this course. Definitely exposed me to a very different field from what I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0The first half, with Professor Jane Tylus, yes yes yes! She is incredible. Even if you aren't very interested in the Middle Ages, she will make it interesting. She is a thought provoking professor who truly cares about the material she teaches and the students she engages with.\r\n\r\nThe second half was flawed because of class structure taking up too much time during the time you need to really focus on Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and by this point I would recommend the entire summer program itself. It was incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. I was very unhappy the whole time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Professor Tyluss portion of the course to anyone interested in the topic but would not recommend Professor Marcuss portion to anyone under any circumstances. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely an interesting course, but very niche. It was interesting to learn about such a specific part of Italy, and gain an in-depth understanding of this one area rather than a very broad knowledge of the entire country. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course strongly. I found it very fun and exciting, and the wide range of subjects and time periods about which we learned was very helpful and grounding during our Siena experience. I loved watching and analyzing films I (and Id guess many other American students) hadnt seen before. I also loved reading Italian Renaissance texts in English but with a companion Italian version (Ie Purgatorio) while learning the Italian language. ",
            "\u00a0Not if it remains the same. If there is a bette selection of movies then sure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, however, the work assigned should count for more than one credit. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend Professor Tylus' class! She's so passionate about the topic, and it's infectious. Would recommend Professor Marcus' class if you're really into film. "
