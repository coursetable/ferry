            "\u00a0I developed the skills of thinking analytically and methodically, I learned how to more effectively conduct research and write large papers. I also learned how food is a relevant part of culture today in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned of the nature of the discipline of food history and how it relates to greater historical ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of cuisine and the origins of many traditions around the world. Extremely interesting content. ",
            "\u00a0You get to learn a lot about food history and how significant it really is. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class I learned about the history of food and cuisine. I learned a lot interesting information about the topic. I also learned how to write longer papers. ",
            "\u00a0An new appreciation of food. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths include the Socratic seminar style of teaching and conversation, including inviting speakers to talk to the class. I wish this course counted as a writing credit as well as a humanities credit. ",
            "\u00a0Taught as a seminar, the class is heavily influenced by how much the students themselves put into it. Luckily for me, the people of the class were attentive and we all participated frequently however this may not always be the case. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought we had a very interesting professor and a  great learning environment with a small circle of people. \r\nWeaknesses: Definitely should've been a writing credit. And I thought the food trip to NYC was a little underwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0This class is just overall one of the best classes you can take here. The only weakness is that the grading can be very harsh. ",
            "\u00a0I think the the strength of the course is the topic and Professor Freedman's extensive knowledge on the topic. I think the biggest weakness is the lack of structure in the course. There was very little guidance and feedback on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, but I think we could've focused more on the modern disparity of wealth and what the different social classes eat. ",
            "\u00a0Could go deeper and have more meaningful/challenging conversations about race and gender. ",
            "\u00a0This class should be a lecture. It was very dry and hard to pay attention. The material is interesting but taught in a bland way. ",

            "\u00a0While this course does not have many papers, they are still somewhat taxing and if writing isn't your strong suit I would recommend auditing or taking it Credit/D. Otherwise, this is an intensely enjoyable class and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in food. Most of the people in the class were not History majors and they all enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think the content was good, but I would warn other students about the workload. Decently sized readings due every Tuesday and Thursday. Along with that, the in class midterms are pretty challenging and require you to know every reading to great detail. And two \"short\" papers and a long paper all with no writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you'll love the subject and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students if they are interested in the topic. While there is not a lot of work, it can be graded harshly with little feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure! Super fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it gives great insight into an industry that can be secretive sometimes, and Professor Freedman is a fantastic lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would tell somebody to shop this class but I dont think I would recommend it highly because it often felt boring and went on tangents. ",
            "\u00a0yes, i learned a lot about the history of food and restaurants and i found it very interesting "
