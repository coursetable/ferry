            "\u00a0This class begins with quantum physics and, from there, builds up to a reasonably complex understanding of semiconductor devices. While heavy on theory and light on practical (there were only two small labs), this is really a great class to understand the foundations of modern digital devices. ",

            "\u00a0Mark Reed is wonderful both as a person and a lecturer. Class was almost always entertaining and engaging. This class covers a ton of material (quantum physics, bulk semiconductors, junctions, diodes, transistors, optoelectronics) but is relatively well-organized and manageable.\r\n\r\nHowever, with so much information, this class often becomes a bit hard to follow, especially considering the admittedly cursory introduction it ends of providing. I always felt like I understood all of the material when I walked out of class, but when I started working on problem sets, I got lost I understood the material conceptually, but not well enough to be able to solve tricky questions with arbitrary assumptions. On a good majority of homeworks, I felt like I was flipping through the chapter, looking for applicable equations with appropriate units, rather than really understanding what quantities I was given and looking for. This is probably my own fault, to a degree, and may also be the fault of the textbook, which Mark had mentioned he might replace for future semesters.\r\n\r\nPerhaps my main issue with problem sets, then, was that they were too analytical and not conceptual, while class was very conceptual and not very analytical. Homework and exam questions usually looked something like, \"Here is a semiconductor device with the following properties. Find this quantity,\" rather than more conceptual or theoretical questions about the design and operation of these devices.\r\n\r\nLabs, too, weren't super organized and also a little useless. Our first lab was really quick just doing some experiments with a silicon wafer. Our second and final lab involved measuring the characteristics of a transistor, which required a ton of time in the lab for not much of a result (the information gained from the lab could have easily been taught in lecture in 10 minutes, rather than six hours).\r\n\r\nThere was also a cleanroom tour on the last day with the whole garb (booties, jumpsuit, head covering) which was a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nSo while I leave this class feeling very informed about semiconductor theory, I don't think it would be fair to credit our homeworks and labs with that understanding, and would love to see more alignment between lecture and homeworks, as well as more interesting labs. ",
            "\u00a0The theory is glossed over quite a bit, and it often felt like hunting for equations. However the pacing is quite reasonable, so keeping up with theory on your own is doable, although not ideal. Textbook was pretty abysmal frankly. ",
            "\u00a0Better clarification of which topics are important and which are not. Lots of equations were used for derivations, but not many were necessary to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course presents a difficult topic very well by introducing conceptual equations and relationships before getting into complex practical applications. Very manageable homework load. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized and interesting. The pset problems/workload was manageable and the content was interesting. The labs, themselves, of which we had only two, were interesting but the write-ups were very in depth and took a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0Material itself is interesting and critical to basic knowledge to EE application... but lecture was not engaging and problem sets were long, tedious, and sometimes unnecessarily difficult "

            "\u00a0This is a great class for anyone who's EE, physics, applied physics, whatever and curious about the microscopic world of semiconductor devices. It neither required a lot of previous knowledge in EE or physics, though that would be useful. I think it serves as a good general introduction to EE and related physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the content is useful and fairly interesting, and Mark is a very reasonable and engaging professor. Would recommend having a background from EE200. ",
            "\u00a0Great course if you're into physics and want to learn more about semiconductors! ",

            "\u00a0Yes if taught by Professor Reed. This is a challenging subject, but Professor Reed was very clear in lectures and great at teaching difficult concepts. This class is pretty technical and gets very into depth with the equations and theories behind semiconductors. If you are interested in semiconductors and good at understanding concepts and then applying equations to them, this is a good class for you. ",
            "\u00a0No, but if you are an EE major you have to take it. "
