            "\u00a0This class was extremely helpful in showing me my strengths and weaknesses in academic writing and how to work those into papers that one wouldn't normally write, and come up with a good result. It's also a really fun seminar, and the topics covered ranged from the most arbitrary questions like \"why do we take selfies?\" to the hard ones (the class actually starts with it) like: \"What is the self?\"\r\n\r\nEvery single class was fun and informative and made me think in new and unexpected ways, even appreciate myself and my (and others') opinions on the self and perception more in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to become a better writer ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me the space to creatively approach academic essays in philosophy, and certainly improved my writing process, structure, and style. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write cohesively. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great English class for my first semester at Yale. The material was engaging and the assignments were meaningful. I loved the material. Overall, this was a good class. ",

            "\u00a0I developed a more consistent and thoughtful writing style that produced more supportable claims. I also learned a lot about how to break down and view different human identities. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a great first transition into college writing, and I gained a greater understanding of the expectations and style of college-level writing. ",
            "\u00a0A much more sophisticated writing strategy and more advanced close reading technique. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: really engaging topic. Great discussions in the classroom. I wish that the professor did not have to follow a strict schedule common to all 114 courses. Also, I would have liked if I had access to more sample essays. ",
            "\u00a0This class is demanding but very fun and chill and will not make you ever want to miss a section. No negative comments; I found it engaging, informative, and the feedback was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very fascinating course. I loved learning the material. I also thought the feedback from the professor was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well rounded, with great attention given to improving our essays, understanding the content, and also helping review others work. I really cant find an awful lot of faults, it was a great course! ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be better structured. ",
            "\u00a0As this course is part of the collection of English 114 courses, it had to follow the same schedule and rules as the other classes. For our section, we always felt rushed as we skipped from one paper to the next within days. We would have loved to have more discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher feedback but not much help with learning citations ",
            "\u00a0The readings are extremely interesting and not too lengthy. The discussions in class are very productive and engaging. The essay assignments are fun and allow the student to take the reigns in shaping their own prompt. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class has a lot of strengths. It forces students to be very thoughtful about themselves and world around them.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course may simply lie in the pseudo-philosophical nature of the subject material. While looking at human identities in an English class is a good way to make interesting writing pieces, its a poor way to actually come to any conclusion about human identities. I think the class could have used a bit more cohesion between each view of human identity we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course was the content and enthusiasm from the professor. Students were really able to engage with course materials and gain interest in the topics they were writing about. Craig was also great and available to meet with students after the first draft of every paper in order to get feedback. Can't really name any weaknesses that come to mind immediately. ",

The readings are extremely interesting and the topics of discussion are varied enough to  catch the interest of students regardless of what they're studying. Moreover, Craig is an excellent professor and will push you to think harder and to really improve your writing with a great attitude and sense of humor. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if the student has an interest in writing and a fair amount of time to spend thinking about the subject matter. Its an easy class to grow in as a writer, and we read a lot of great pieces of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend this as a first writing class to any Yale student, learned a lot about the style needed, how to go about writing a research paper, and all of it was done in a lower-pressure environment. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I saw a visible improvement in my writing abilities and engaged deeply with the material. Students will enjoy interacting with the professor and students in this seminar-style course. "
