Just generally, I got everything I hoped for out of this course.

Although I initially had difficulty with the material, once I grasped the concepts, I started to look at events in my daily life in a different way. For example, in one class lecture we discussed how to prevent runoff from construction sites to waterways. Two of those methods were silt fences and haybales. A day or so after the lecture, I happened to drive past a construction site. After observing runoff from the site, I mentally criticized the contractors for not properly installing the silt fences and haybales. ",

A missed opportunity to spread a love of chemistry and bring people along. \r\n\r\nThe non-chemistry stuff was a review of what I have learned in other classes at FES, but not as clearly articulated. Felt scattered and cursory. ",

His delivery could be better, but he has reasonable expectations, and his exams test your knowledge - not just what you cram into your brain the night before. \r\n\r\nIf he could structure his lecture delivery (his slides are well prepared), then it could help with people who don't have as much background knowledge on the topic.

            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are the wealth of material, the knowledge and expertise of the professor and the informative field trips that reinforced in-class concepts. Weaknesses of the course were the layout of the syllabus and organization of lectures. The course could be improved by including a weekly breakout of dates on the syllabus and providing a more detailed outline of lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides for this course were useless. I never referenced them and wrote all my notes by hand. Gabe is shockingly disorganized. We would organize study groups to try to go over the material and reorganize it in a coherent manner before exams. It felt like 25% of the workload in this class was figuring what was going on in terms of logistics. I still don't know when (or even if) our second problem set was due. Gabe came to our final exam late, with only the first half of the exam ready. When he returned with the second half, he was still correcting errors in it for the next thirty minutes. It was extremely distracting and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0correspondence with the professor was difficult.  Topics covered on assignments did not always reflect classwork; it facilitated student learning in a bad way. ",
            "\u00a0It is a course covering a unique topic. A focus on applications such as problems like part two of the final exam throughout the course could help connect concepts and prepare students for future work. Course and field trips utilize nearby resources very well! Definitely a highlight of the course. Readings were not well integrated into the class or not covered at all. Doing this and making sure students are doing the readings could help with understanding. Problem sets were important in the skills they covered but much of what was in the problem sets was never talked about in class or covered on an exam. For example many of the problems on the first problem set were completely separate in style and topic. Telling students to study the problem set in preparation for the first exam was misleading and led many students to prepare incorrectly for the exam spending much more time on quantitative skills. Finally, this class was very unorganized! The calendar on the syllabus had overlapping weeks and no dates leading students to be confused about readings and topics covered in class. Additionally, field trips, problem set due dates, and even communication about cancelled classes and midterms was always last minute and made students scramble to do everything or rearrange their schedules last minute. This is very hard for many students and led to some feeling like their time was being disrespected. Better communication and organization is a must. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of information delivered very fast that can be difficult to capture. Gabe often just says the important concepts without writing them down, so you have to be very attentive. I think the red and green desk flags to indicate our level of comfort with the information that is presented will be very helpful going forward. The field trips were great, wish I could've gone to all. ",
            "\u00a0The examples, props, and field trips were the strong points of this class.\r\n\r\nThe course lacks coherence. The Hubbard Brook lens was a good one to look at these issues through, but the readings and lectures jumped around so much it was hard to follow what systems we were talking about when. \r\n\r\nThe material was not particularly hard, but my sense of frustration with the problem sets, midtems and course content was very high because so much was unclear or felt like an inside joke. \r\n\r\nSlide contents are vague (lack clear titles and descriptions, content that is there is often not in common language or is a detail relevant to only part of the slide, while missing the key information). I took copious notes on paper and on the slides and was often baffled by what professor might mean when going back to look at slides. I learned much more on my own online and from other students than from lectures.\r\n\r\nObviously, coming to a final that students invested a lot of time preparing for late with a half-written test and then having to correct the second half of the test content multiple times during the test is unacceptable. Starting 10 minutes late, sitting there for 15 minutes between finishing the first half and receiving the second half and then being told that the professor would \"let\" us have \"extra\" time to finish a test he was late and unprepared for is a good example of a strange tone-deafness that happened throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is very knowledgeable about the subject.\r\n\r\nPoor communication and organization throughout the class. Often I was unsure of what the important parts of the lecture were. ",
            "\u00a0mentioned earlier ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Topic is interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: Disorganized - hard to follow. Not really case study based. Problem sets are only somewhat useful, as having math-based problem sets seems unnecessary in this class. \r\n\r\nI would create more structure and organization in the course. What are the exact learning expectations and flow of the course? Organize the slides better. Rehearse lectures. I would also make the course case study based - have 5 or so case studies in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class lectures are generally pretty-well organized, slide decks are good, etc. \r\n\r\nThe only issue I have is with readings -- I wish readings were (1) more extensive; and (2) better tied to the class. ",
            "\u00a0The field trips were vital to this course. They really helped me to connect the conceptual to the practical. Having real-life examples made the hard science concepts more tangible. \r\n\r\nAnother strength was Gabe's willingness to accommodate those of us who were less familiar with the subject content. The student-professor dialogue was always open and that made the course stronger over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was that Canvas was not utilized to its fullest capacity. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness was that Gabe was not always fully communicative when he was sick. None of the students knew whether we were having classes, if the midterm had been canceled, etc. Letting us know what is going on prior to a few hours before class would have been helpful during midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) The number of exams/problem sets - having a few midterms I think was a good thing because it forced you to check in and review concepts periodically throughout the semester.  2) The lectures - Gabe is an engaging professor, and I really enjoyed the in class time/lectures.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought the bibliography assignment was really interesting and useful, but felt like kind of an after thought.  I would have liked if there was a bit more emphasis put on this - maybe a class period or portion of a class period dedicated to some aspect of research/why this assignment was important? ",
            "\u00a0The field trips were some of the best parts of the course. Learned a lot of hands on materials.\r\nI felt we might have spent too much time and efforts on the first 1/3 of the class, making the most interesting final 1/3 of the class a bit hasty. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was very disorganized. Our final wasnt done being written until 2 hours after the final started. He also has opinions about certain topics that dont align with most scientists, so it was confusing at times to try to understand why he was teaching something different than other professors in STEM. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the content; this is really interesting and crucial stuff to understand! \r\nThe weakness is in the organization of the course.The instruction was very difficult to follow and I found I learned a lot of the information through my own research while studying for exams. The lectures could be much more effective if the material were presented in a more organized way, including background information on concepts that were persistent. ",
            "\u00a0Better syllabus, with dates (not week numbers).  \r\nBetter communication by instructor regarding due dates, assignment expectations, field trip dates, and exam logistics.  \r\nMore organized slides (order often changed).  \r\nMore problem sets to practice material. "

Takes a while to get used to his teaching style. Exams are challenging but fair. ",

I think this is unfair and misleading; I was able to understand the material due to background knowledge of chemistry and ecology and think this course would have been extremely challenging and more confusing than helpful had I not been able to sort through the material with some familiarity. \r\nIn reference to question 9, I loved this class and wish I could keep going and take more Biogeochemistry courses! The structure of the course and engagement/patience of the instructor was poor and leaves much to be desired. ",
