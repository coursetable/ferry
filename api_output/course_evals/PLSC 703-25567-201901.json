            "\u00a0Name a week and I could extract an insight gained. On the very first day I learned that Russian autocracy is highly bureaucratic, with the president working through the parliament much of the time, after I claimed that autocracies were defined by arbitrary rule of law. At another point, I discovered that autocracies often hold elections as a barometer of public opinion, as a method of promoting party elites, as a manner of coordinating elite competition, as a manner of balancing against the autocrat  and that was just from one reading. Not only did I read the first formal model I feel I ever fundamentally understood, but I actually incorporated that model in the final research design project.\r\n\r\nThe most important insight I gained was an appreciation of how important internal within-party competition and tension is in understanding autocratic policy. Bureaucratic cultures can operate in an entirely predictable way, but that fact may make the state under control of those apparatuses seem unpredictable. As a detail-oriented type myself, I found this analysis appealed very much to my sensibilities. The basic intuition for this argument already existed in other fields of IR that I had studied, so parsing it one level beyond made perfect sense. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus is superb. I say that first because I have never ever thought this about any class Ive ever taken and would not be at all surprised if I never say it again. Unlike almost every other class, this syllabus arranged readings in such a way as to communicate the fundamental insights on the given sub-field of the week and especially to give a sense of the contrasting schools of thought in such sub-fields. The readings for each week were also extremely well-chosen; even the formal models were still highly readable and communicated their insights very clearly. With most classes I tend to absorb them once and then make absolutely no use of them whatsoever in the rest of the class, let alone my academic interests in general. With this class, I actually found myself continually referring to the readings throughout the entirety of the course.\r\n\r\nIf there is any weakness at all to the course it might be that more time should be allocated to helping the class understand the models  perhaps taking extra time out of two weeks early in the course to specifically examine the subject, as well as posting a document with a quick run-down on the meanings of certain notations.\r\n\r\nI think having each student lead discussion on one or more weeks is extremely helpful, not only in helping marshal ones command of the literature but also in learning to communicate it well to others. For those planning to pursue PhDs this is also good training for future teaching.\r\n\r\nThe final project idea was quite creative and I would love to see more courses at the graduate level employ this idea. Students are asked to create a research outline rather than a typical final essay; this enables students to take on larger-scale projects and hone their method and literature review far more than they would with a paper. Best of all for graduate students, it allows them to develop an idea for later research. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course is genuinely jam-packed with information and Prof. Hartnett harnessed it very well. It is an excellent synthesis of theory, practice and empirics. I was strongly driven to do good work and take on an ambitious final project that I plan to revisit for future research. "
