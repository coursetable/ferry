            "\u00a0Professor Helene Landemore introduced her students to the most important literature on representative government and democracy and encouraged us to identify and think critically about the fields frontiers. We also had to contribute to a Wikipedia article for the class, which amounted to a pleasant balance between heavy policial philosophy reading and writing and more easily accessible encyclopedic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about democratic theory, the practice of governments, and proposals for new governments beyond the systems we have in place today.  Also about Icelandic, Irish, Tunisian, and Egyptian politics as well, but that was independent research for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned theoretical approaches to analyze democracies. This course challenged students to think beyond current representative systems of democracy and explore more deliberative alternatives to democracy both from a theoretical and applied perspective. ",
            "\u00a0- Undemocratic elements of representative forms of governance \r\n- Ideals of democracy in ancient athens \r\n- Democratic forms of governance in firms \r\n- The intersection between the values of citizenship and democracy \r\n- The undemocratic constitutional making process in the United States \r\n- Democratization of conflict zones \r\n- The benefits and limitations of online deliberation and constitutional ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was able to learn the basics of Wikipedia and actually submit my own information to the site. I also learned about the governments and traditions of a few different countries that I would have never known about had it not been for this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the philosophical underpinnings of democracies across the world as well as new forms of democracies. I was particularly fascinated by crowdsourcing, e-democracy, and the Swiss example . More than any other course I've taken before , it really changed a lot of my views- made me less of an elitist. "

            "\u00a0This was an excellent course, and the conversation in section flowed very nicely, though at times it turned into dialogues between individual students and Professor Landemore.  Even those moments were very interesting though, as they were generally about some area of expertise a particular student had.  It was also an exciting feeling to be discussing research that had been done or concepts which had been invented only a few years ago. ",
            "\u00a0This course is built on a wonderful theoretical reading list that allows students to evaluate the more practical readings. The professor is both a practitioner in this field and a theorist on the cutting edge of the literature. This class has been one of the best run and best curated ones in my Yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Really specific topic that students get in depth knowledge about the most relevant discussions around the discourse of political representation and electoral democracy \r\n- The Wikipedia article project is one of the most interesting learning experiences I had at Yale. \r\n- Great reading and challenging reading list that deepens the knowledge of the studnets interested in the topic \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I wish there were a little fewer readings so that we get a good in depth discussion in class about one or two of them\r\n- I wish there was a clearer communication about grading and participation criteria \r\n- Guidelines about the grading criteria for student presentations were not provided in the beginning ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it provided us with the encouragement to delve into a topic of our choice and research it in a way that kept us interested. Being able to pick a subject instead of getting it assigned to me was vital in keeping me interested in my assignments and helped me have fun while doing them.\r\nThis course could be improved by giving students a little more time to present their readings and have more time for discussion on them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent readings excellent lecturing style in seminar.\r\nWeaknesses: could have been more clear about deadlines and spent more time in class working on wiki articles together "

            "\u00a0Of course! I highly recommend Professor Landemores seminar. Any student interested in politics, especially American politics, should consider Beyond Representative Government. You will be introduced to the requisite relevant scholarship and encouraged to think more critically about policy solutions you werehithertoconvinced would work. Many Yale students take criticism of democracy for granted, without unpacking just how its deficiencies manifest themselves in government/governing. You can do that unpacking in this class! Professor Landemore is also very accessible to her studentsand it seemed like the students took full advantage of a faculty member that is so invested in teaching undergraduates. Every time I went to office hours, there was a line. Whether youre interested in political philosophy or the topic of government, this class will challenge you in new ways, and give you the opportunity to develop a relationship with a terrific professor (and eminent democratic theorist) who cares deeply both about her work and students. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in anything to do with government, take this course ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone that wants to think beyond the current constraints of representative government. This is a great course that straddles the theoretical and the applied. Professor Landemore is highly skilled in this field and her idealism and strong stances are something I found inspiring. Take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Landemore is one of the smartest, most genuine and self-critical political theorists about the topic. I enjoyed the reading list and class discussion a lot because of her. She also is able to balance student participation time with her input in the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in political science of any nature because this course revolves around discussions and the sharing of observations of our government and the governments of other countries. If a student was not involved in government or didn't have interest in it, this course would not be suitable for them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You will rethink democracy question whether our current government is democratic at all and you will become hopefully a revolutionary just like Professor Landemore "
