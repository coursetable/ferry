            "\u00a0I developed the ability to set out a schedule for learning a topic independently, which is very useful as it's the modus operandi in Grad School. The relationship one has with a professor is also quite different when a lot less structure is involved and you have to take up the work of selecting materials, and evaluating how long things take. In terms of topic, I learned a lot about the structures of neural networks, and its different applications. "
