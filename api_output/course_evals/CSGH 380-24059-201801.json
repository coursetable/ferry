            "\u00a0This class was super personal just because it focuses on songwriting, my main form of self-expression. I learned how to say more with fewer words and how to make the words I say really mean something. I learned how to conjure poignant images through journaling, how to collaborate with other writers, and got closer to figuring out what my artistic voice sounds like. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze popular songwriting, experiment with different styles of songs, collaborate in the creative process with other students, deliver feedback and see its results, and develop my voice as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my skills in collaborative songwriting. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the structure of the music industry, co-writing and collaboration skills, feedback on strengths and weaknesses of current work, insight on personal artistic values and preferences. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about song structure, the basic structure of the music business, and collaborative songwriting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class gets you writing, which is huge because successful songwriting is all about quantity. We also focus on the quality, critiquing each other's work and offering ideas for revision in a safe, collaborative space. Forcing you to think about writing in different styles and in different working environments allows you to explore how songs work for other people and broaden your horizons. The guest lectures by people in the industry were also great for seeing how people think and how prepared you need to be before putting yourself out there. Because there's so much the syllabus wanted to touch on, we don't get to everything, like the readings, but it's nice to have those resources. ",
            "\u00a0This course is much-needed at Yale to fill a niche very important to many students. It is great for developing the community of songwriters at Yale who have no other academic outlets for their craft or sites for feedback. It sometimes felt rushed because at NYU each class is longer. ",
            "\u00a0I think the model of the course is slightly flawed. We would simply collaborate with a new partner every week. I think there should be one longer project at the end, more opportunities for revision, and more time to hone one's own songwriting technique. There doesn't feel like an overall arc of the course--just one random collaboration after another. ",
            "\u00a0Great opportunity to do a lot of writing and discussing. Sometimes classes were entirely lecture with less room for discussion--more balanced format throughout would be good. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible and so necessary. Where Yale's course catalog contains many opportunities for classical musical development, there practically no courses that provide opportunity for contemporary music making. I was so happy to see something like this being offered and the course didn't disappoint.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would have changed about this course is the amount of collaboration we did. Over the course of the entire semester we only had the opportunity to write one song alone. Yes, technically we could write songs on our own outside the class, however, the feedback that the class provided would've been really helpful had we been able to present more of our own work. I would DEFINITELY change this next time the class is offered. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked workshopping each songs, but I wish more songs had been written individually, or if the focus was going to be made so heavily on collaborative songwriting that had been established at the beginning of the course. There was a lot of deviation from the syllabus which was totally cool, but confusing when it was not acknowledged. "

            "\u00a010/10 would recommend. Songwriting is something every musician could get better at, whether it's to hone their artistic voice or to explore other ways of saying what's important. Everyone comes here at different places in their journey, so it's great to do something so personal with people who are also in it with you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a unique opportunity at Yale to learn a practical but eye-opening new perspective on songwriting. ",
            "\u00a0As a fun, 4th or 5th elective, it can work. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone who is seriously attempting to hone their songwriting skills. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course with Mike Errico for any songwriters/producers. Much more practical/hands-on than most Yale courses. Mike is a really dedicated, experienced professor who fosters a supportive classroom environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Must take for anyone interested in writing songs as a hobby or a career. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone looking to make connections to other songwriters at Yale, and interested in working with other artists, and hearing their music. You do produce a song a week so you're writing pretty fast and that is another thing to consider because not all artists work like that. It was a fun fifth class and I definitely learnt more about song structure, and popular song writing, which I think is important to have in my toolkit moving forward, but people looking to do more experimental music this is probably not the class for you.
