            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course. It grounds my thinking with anthropology. We really need a historical and anthropological approach to research cities and globalization ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent exploration, both theoretical and with case-studies, of the urban experience in a globalised world. I gained familiarity with the history and present of globalisation, so to speak, from a truly exemplary instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I attained a greater understanding of the kinds of approaches modern anthropologists can take, especially those that attempt to challenge or at least remain cognizant of the continued prevalence of orientalism and eurocentric discourses in the field. It was also helpful to discuss the formulation of a research question and proposal. "

            "\u00a0Perhaps students can get more involved if they could have more time to raise and discuss their questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- excellent course design\r\n- fantastic teaching\r\n- engaged students, and inspiring classroom environments\r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- only twelve weeks long (we want more!) ",
            "\u00a0The reading selections and format of the class were excellent.  I greatly enjoyed Prof. Siu's lectures as well as class discussions with the diverse class make-up. The only less than ideal part was often not having enough time for discussion, or getting delayed in the overall schedule. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I also recommend having a copy of the syllabus, and read more about the authors work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, and very strongly! It's a great space to learn from a highly acclaimed scholar, while also making friends in a variety of departments. We had students from Anthropology, Forestry, Architecture, East Asian Studies to name just a few programs, with a mix of both under-graduates and post graduate students. \r\n\r\nThe readings are very-well chosen, and the classroom discussions were nurturing and stimulative. This was because the instructor herself set the tone for such a collaborative and rewarding classroom experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course as helpful both for thinking about methodology and for learning about some of the trends in urban anthropology. "
