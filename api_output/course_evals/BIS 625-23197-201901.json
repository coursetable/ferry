The examples are taken from the book, so there is little advantage to attending class. There are few slides-- many times the professor starts writing on the board and it's unclear if this is to improve understanding or if there is a derivation that is an important point that is NOT in the slides. I took this class to get deeper into logistic regression and feel that I did not accomplish that goal given the slow pace of the first 2/3 of the class. ",
