            "\u00a0The new vs traditional reading of the Tractatus, Kripke's paradox with respect to meaning, family resemblance concepts, hinge commitments, skepticism, philosophical writing and research skills. This course was one of the strongest and most rigorous philosophy seminars I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough introduction to Wittgenstein's corpus and a wide array of Wittgenstein scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0Went through Wittgenstein's major works as well as modern takes on them. ",
            "\u00a0The class equipped us with a deep understanding of how Wittgenstein's philosophies changed over the course of his lifetime, tracing his three major works. Wittgenstein's powerful insights can really fundamentally change the way you think about philosophy and about reasoning in general. The seminar environment also helped me hone my skills in discussion and learn from fellow Wittgensteinians. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fantastic introduction to a new approach to philosophy and a generation of philosophers whose work I hadn't read before. I became a clearer writer and a subtler thinker as a result. ",
            "\u00a0This class changed my view on philosophy and on the task of the philosopher. It opened me up to a completely different way of viewing the world. More specifically, I gained a better understanding of much of 20th century philosophy by virtue of my better understanding of Wittgenstein's thought. The class did a good job of balancing specificity with generality, that is to say, of focusing on specific sections of text and specific textual issues, while also taking the time to appreciate Wittgenstein's import as a whole and his influence on later thought. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we surveyed the works of Ludwig Wittgenstein as well as his influence on the philosophers that have followed him. ",
            "\u00a0Close analysis of wittgensteins seminal works ",
            "\u00a0Read a lot of Wittgenstein, as well as a lot of secondary literature about his work and the questions it raises. Gets at philosophy of logic, of language, epistemology, and even some ethics at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the progression of Wittgenstein's thought from the Tractatus through the Investigations through some work on mathematics and ethics. I also learned about how various authors have responded to Wittgenstein. Professor Winkler's feedback on papers was tremendously helpful in terms of clarifying my ideas and pushing them further. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of Wittgenstein's work and legacy. Through the comparison of several of his works we traced how his thought changed and developed, as well as how different later philosophers interpreted his positions. "

            "\u00a0This course was unquestionably excellent in every respect. Professor Winkler is the best discussion leader I have ever had in any class at Yale. The discussions inspired me to try and work as hard for the class as the Professor was, which was a very high bar. The handouts were so helpful in guiding the discussion as well as when writing the two papers for the course. Because the class was mostly undergrads rather than mostly grad students, I thought the discussion was always intelligible. I think the discussion would have been less beneficial for undergrads if more grad students were in the class, so it was fortunate that the enrollment numbers worked out as nicely as they did. I have two suggestions to improve the course. (1) to let us know the dates the reading responses are due on the course syllabus. We only ended up writing one of these responses due to unforeseeable circumstances, but I would have been happy having two or even three listed on the syllabus. (2) to make the class size smaller. The seminar was 20+ people, which was just too big to give everyone a chance to try and grapple with the material by posing questions. While I got more comfortable with participating in the second half of the course, I think a smaller class size would encourage more participation across the board. ",
            "\u00a0It was fantastic. Fewer auditors (i.e., fewer total people in the room) might slightly increase participation. ",
            "\u00a0\"Wittgenstein\" was one of the best philosophy classes I've taken at Yale. Professor Winkler did a brilliant job organizing discussions each week -- his selection of texts, arrangement of thorough handouts, flexible availability, ability to draw everyone into conversation, and unrelenting earnestness are remarkable. The only suggestion I would have for the class is offering a slightly larger lecture/seminar version that meets twice a week. This would allow for more people to take the class in a less cramped setting (we already had quite a full seminar this year) and would spread out the material in a way that would allow for even more engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging material ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured as it is and has a good mix of primary and secondary sources. The secondary sources were aptly chosen to represent different viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0Wittgenstein's highly varied writings, and Professor Winkler's thoughts on them, were constantly thought-provoking. I liked the assignment structure of a very-short response paper, a short midterm paper, and a long final paper. The secondary readings (i.e. not Wittgenstein) were fascinating and very complementary, so they were a major strength. It was also very satisfying to read so much of Wittgenstein's work, to get to know his philosophical trajectory so well. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great. The readings are manageable and engaging. The discussion was usually pretty good, and there were some really smart people in the class. Professor Winkler did a great job of introducing the texts in a way that created room for productive discussion. The one thing was that opening with the Tractatus was difficult for me. I know that it makes the most sense to open with the tractatus, but I felt very lost in class discussion and found very little room to participate as opposed to class discussions on later texts. ",
            "\u00a0It was great. ",
            "\u00a0The class was perfect in every way. The only minor improvement for me would be for it to be slightly more lecture based. ",
            "\u00a0I find it hard to participate in seminars, and having a seminar with over 20 people made that a little more difficult. That being said, I appreciate that Professor Winkler wanted to let as many people as possible take the course, and I think that is the right move. ",
            "\u00a0This course's material is exceptionally interesting, and the chronological structure of the course is probably the best structure it could have. Professor Winkler is an exceptional instructor, and the material is stimulating and extremely powerful. I would however have enjoyed there being a bit more work on Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics, and would have also appreciated a bit more discussion of the ideas of the Tractatus (discussion tended to be more exegetical in a lot of places). Nevertheless, this course's weaknesses pale when confronted with its strengths. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a wonderful course. I think it may be improved by increasing the number of writing assignments. Engaging with the text by writing about it really forces you to rigorously understand what the text is arguing. Perhaps just having a few more 1-page assignments asking students to explain a certain part of the text (one for each major work we read) would help. "

            "\u00a0A fantastic course: fascinating material, and Prof. Winkler is an excellent seminar leader and very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the strongest and most rigorous philosophy seminars I have taken at Yale. Professor Winkler is the best discussion leader I have ever had at this University. He fostered an extremely high level of discussion, and the handouts for each class were helpful to reference when writing papers and reading responses. In addition, his knowledge of the relevant secondary literature for whatever you are interested in writing a paper about is virtually guaranteed to be extensive. His office hours always felt very productive for this reason. I cannot recommend taking a seminar with him more highly, and Wittgensteins philosophy could not be more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Wittgenstein is amazing. Professor Winkler is amazing. Professor Winkler teaching Wittgenstein is amazing. The reading is fairly heavy, but all of it is interesting. Professor Winkler is highly accessible outside of class (and even outside of office hours), does a great job leading discussion, and gives extensive feedback on all written work. Plus, he's probably the nicest professor you'll ever have. Can't recommend this course highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any philosophy student. Wittgenstein has influenced an astounding amount of intellectual work in the twentieth century and he should be a mandatory point of study for any student of the Humanities. If you have the chance to take the course with Professor Winkler in the future, don't pass on it -- he has designed an outstanding and necessary course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, without hesitation ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Because Wittgenstein. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The content is fascinating and Professor Winkler is an incredible discussion leader. ",
            "\u00a0You must take this course if you get a chance. It made me a smarter reader of philosophy and it was one of the first classes I've taken at Yale that actually changed the way I view things. Professor Winkler is a gem and has a great balance of professionalism, hilarity, and kindness. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if it is offered again. Wittgenstein is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class. Wittgenstein is an indispensable thinker for understanding all modern developments in philosophy (and even literary theory). This class covers the core of his corpus. Also, in my view, Professor Winkler is the best professor to take a seminar with. He organizes the discussion very well, is always available for questions, and is excellent in extracting the substance of the comments made by students. He is also extremely philosophically open-minded, which is great virtue to have when teaching Wittgenstein. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor Winkler clearly planned this course with a great degree of thought and foresight. It is a fantastic class on wittgenstein, we grappled with many of the key issues in his work. ",
            "\u00a0It's INCREDIBLE. I don't know when Winkler will offer it again, but I'd highly recommend. To be honest, any high level seminar with Winkler is going to be something special; he's stellar at running a seminar that feels both like it's going in a direction and that it's actually being led by students. I also really like one-author philosophy courses. It's a different kind of seminar from a topical one, but I think it gives you a different kind of perspective. And this was history of philosophy at its best -- you got to see how ideas interacted with each other, but the questions and theories still felt like they had contemporary relevance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in Wittgenstein or philosophy of language. Or, if you haven't tried a philosophy course before, and want to try one, I would recommend taking a class with Professor Winkler. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing and any student interested in one of the most important philosophers of the 20th century should take it. Wittgenstein's ideas permeate what we talk about every day and being aware of them is extremely useful. Also, seeing the intellectual honesty of a writer who drastically changes his views halfway through his life is extremely awe-inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Winkler is a must-have philosophy professor. He has changed the way I think about philosophy (both in reading it and writing about it) for the better. This class is really difficult, but Winkler keeps it engaging by igniting a series of collaborative searches into the meaning of texts. We had two main assignments, a mid-term paper and a final paper, but most students in the class extended their first paper for their second. The class has a large number of reading assignments week to week which are often fairly dense. "
