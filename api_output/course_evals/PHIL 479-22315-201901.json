They really forced people to properly debate and defend positions and interpretations from the text which contribute to better conceptualisation of major debates. Although, i personally would have appreciated if there were at least some short lectures to better tie the different books and concepts we read into a common theme, and to put them in conversation with each other and the field of deontology and ethics as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a thorough treatment of 3 prominent contemporary ethicists, all of whom fall under the broad category of \"deontology\". Shelly is great, the books are interesting, and the class as a whole was wonderful, so I don't have much feedback to give besides \"keep up the good work.\" But maybe a clearer working definition of \"deontology\" would have been nice (albeit borderline impossible).
