            "\u00a0I learned about ethnographic and anthropological methods; gained an understanding of theories about war across time; and thought about how conflict relates to human nature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read archaeological and anthropological academic works with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0I got a basic overview of anthropological concepts and some interesting theories about war ",
            "\u00a0This was a super interesting class. Having three instructors with different focuses  primatology, archaeology, cultural anthropology  made for a really unusual perspective on a tough issue to tackle. However, it also made for a fairly confusing class, as the units were not so clearly delineated as to create logical breaks between each of the professors' specialities. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting.  I developed lots of insights about war, but not necessarily a lot of conclusions! I feel more knowledgeable of the controversies and disagreements within the field.  I feel like I can talk about current events with a more rigorous framework for understanding the issues at stake.  I especially enjoyed the sections at the beginning of the course, about the ancient (or recent?) origins of war, because that was something that I think most people do not consider, but it really matters to our understanding of the present! ",
            "\u00a0I gained lots of information about war from a lot of different perspectives. We covered an extremely wide range of topics, and we had really interesting readings. I gained the knowledge of what anthropology is, entails, and how it's related to war. I really liked learning about the different modern discussions on war. ",
            "\u00a0Anthropological survey course. ",
            "\u00a0The three subfields of anthropology in lecture was really fascinating to have all together! The professors have really different styles of teaching and it works well. ",
            "\u00a0The origins of war, human conflict, and other features of war analyzed with an anthropological view. ",
            "\u00a0With this being the first anthropology course I've ever taken, I was introduced to the discipline and developed a basic idea of the interdisciplinary nature of the major. I would say I developed my critical thinking skills, especially when it came to writing these reading responses and being required to extend the arguments rather than just summarize. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting interdisciplinary approach to warfare. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about archaeology but not as much about anthropology as I would have wanted. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at war through an anthropological lens, while learning the basics about anthropology and how anthropological studies are conducted. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of different forms of conflict and indicators of violence dating back to the history of prehistoric man. I'm better able to analyze how different lenses are applied in efforts to understand warfare. "

            "\u00a0Because ANTH 223 is a mid-size lecture and there are not many sections, the one section absence rule can be very difficult as there are no make-up opportunities to attend an alternative section. I wish I had realized this going in. Additionally, some of the topics can be so in-depth that their immediate relevance to the course could have been better explained. I liked the juxtaposition of each professor's expertise. In addition, the use of varied texts and media for reading and engagement was great. This is also a wonderful course for someone to take if they have only studied war from the international security slant. I appreciated the form sent out to get feedback half-way through the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the three professor structure of the class. We often did not follow the syllabus, and I would have appreciated an updated version, but assignments and readings were still provided in an organized way, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could have more continuity between lectures ",
            "\u00a0The reading was inconsistent, ranging from way too much to fairly irrelevant. The guest lecturers (when they showed up) were great. The supplemental requirements, like viewing movies and listening to interviews, were often too much too. Also, a significant chunk of the class disengaged so in-class discussions and sections were like yanking teeth. I attribute this partially to the challenge of doing all the readings and the lack of connection between the readings and the lectures. \r\n\r\nI think this class should reorganize itself. It needs to go chronologically (which this class approached) or thematically (via schools of thought). The current structure isn't conducive to any sort of big-picture conclusions, as there's so much jumping around. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of strengths: lots of perspectives from the professors, lots of interesting readings, really fun discussion section, and an opportunity to write a paper on a topic of your choice.  The weaknesses of the course came mostly towards the end.  The first half of the semester was well organized and progressed from topic to topic, but the last half of the course seemed to lose focus and it was harder to locate the discussions within a larger framework.  Making the different units more explicit would help this. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are really the broad range of topics, the guest speakers, and the interesting readings. The readings can be really heavy sometimes though, and some of the information in the beginning of the course could be a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Fun topics. ",
            "\u00a0I wish I could have heard more of Professor Lombard during the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The three professor pattern is good in that it brings in expertise but it sometimes get a bit confusing. ",
            "\u00a0While I understand where the value in student-led discussions lies, that often leaves the effectiveness of the discussion sections far too inconsistent. I think it would be more productive to have the TF lead the discussion, but have the students lead one activity each week. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course is the dynamic set up with 3 professors. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly wish it had been taught just by Professor Lombard! ",
            "\u00a0This course, though cool in concept and full of interesting fun facts, suffered from the lack of any over-arching coherent organization. Only near the end of the course did I even realize that the class was structured into units, no lecture having ever made mention of them. For some students this might really be a non-issue, but I personally felt unable and unmotivated to absorb nearly any details without a sense of the larger point they are supposed to give perspective on.\r\nGuest lectures were all great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the style of class, with three professors, is really engaging and students benefit from having different perspectives. Everyone involved in teaching (TAs, profs) are extremely helpful and willing to meet, and the course material is presented in a really interesting way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the profs would talk over each other, but it wasn't too bad. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting topics and readings, wish there were fewer readings to make the class more manageable, great discussion section , very passionate professors which is a plus ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are it's a pretty chill course, but the class is really fun and you will learn a lot, especially at the beginning; weakness is that towards the end of the semester, I thought the class lost steam and became more disorganized; it wasn't as engaging as it was before "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting course, though a lot of time (two lectures, one section, and reading response per week) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It approaches the subject of warfare from three distinct angles (archaeology, cultural anthropology, and primatology), which interact with each other in very interesting ways. I learned a lot about the three fields and the readings are very interesting and well chosen. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another Yale student.  At Yale, we talk about war and armed conflict and world events all the time, but without a theoretical framework and understanding the deep history of human life and conflict, we cannot approach these issues as effectively or in as nuanced of a way.  This class offers new tools to understand war.  It is a very interesting class with great readings and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it really introduces you to anthropology in general and especially in relation to war. It also gives you a lot of knowledge about issues that aren't talked about that much that are going on right now. It also makes you realize how debated all of these issues are. The instructors are all really good as well. ",
            "\u00a0no. while the course material is quite interesting the lectures, assignments, and materials are not engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Take it, especially if you are considering anthro but unsure which field. Or if youre a history major or whatnot. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good introductory course across the anthropological spectrum. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I think it's a good course to take to get an entry-level idea of all different disciplines of anthropology, from archaeology to medical humanitarianism. The readings were all interesting and unlike papers I've read in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course even for a student who had never taken an anthropology class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was okay. I kind of wish wed read more foundational texts or something. The lectures felt long and like you could miss them and not have consequences because there werent exams and sections were based on readings. ",
            "\u00a0Not a good class if all you're looking for is a social science. Take if you love anthro enough to be self-motivated and to be excited by the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is very interesting while still being manageable ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! It's a good course and low workload "
