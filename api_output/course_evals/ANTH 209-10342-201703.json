            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about how socialism was actually experienced by Soviet citizens and about how the idea of Russia converting straight to western capitalism is completely wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the details of life in late USSR and post-Soviet Russia. I also learned some about what it means to take an anthropological approach. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge about what ethnography is and why it's useful\r\nalso particularly in the postsocialist context as it gives a more full and complicated picture of both the USSR and the subsequent social and political formations in the region ",
            "\u00a0I developed my understanding of anthropology and was able to learn how a cultural anthropologist could see history through a different perspective than a historian or a political scientist. I also leaned a lot about what it was like to life in the Soviet Union and in Russian up through current day. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at issues through an anthropological lens, and about the USSR and Russia. ",

            "\u00a0The course could benefit from increased focus on the readings in lecture. While learning about herding cows in Russia was interesting, I found it difficult to tackle the writing assignments (while few, they were a pain to write) for the course effectively without some sort of logic flow through them. As a survey course, it is understandable that there would be a wide breadth of readings on the syllabus, but the connections between them were not always clear/sometimes a bit too abstract. These abstract concepts could have been clarified better in lecture. \r\nAlso, I would only take this class again if the people in it contribute to conversation in section. Our section ended up being us sitting in a room awkwardly for ~40 minutes until we were allowed to leave (we left early often because no one said anything). It was hard to engage with the readings and develop new ideas as a group with this setup. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Portrays Russia and the Soviet Union in a new light that people are guaranteed to find interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course has a discussion section that is not necessary whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0The course explores a fascinating era of history from a perspective you do not get in a more traditional class. Professor Rogers obviously has a great depth of knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nThis class did not work as a lecture. Professor Rogers would cover material at a fairly superficial level in powerpoint slides, and then we would read great readings, but not unpack them or clear up confusion in section. This class would be amazing as a seminar with Professor Rogers though. ",

            "\u00a0I would personally not take this course if I could do my semester over again. \r\nThe course could benefit from increased focus on the readings in lecture.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The course focuses much more on learning than on work. There are articles that must be read for every class, but only three assignments are given all semester. The content is interesting and the workload is completely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I was very excited to take this course, and the material was very interesting. However, while Rogers is a great lecturer and expert in the field and area, lectures often got to be rather dry. The biggest pitfall was that readings were not always fully discussed in neither class nor section, and that's where full comprehension of the material wasn't gained. We had absolutely no discussion in section and it honestly became awkward by the end of the year, but that was reliant on the TA, not the professor. I'm sad that I didn't come to grasp the material as well as I could have if proper teaching had been implemented in addition to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This class is fun: you get a fascinating new perspective on everyday life in USSR and post-Soviet Russia. The readings are a great deal of fun and are more like stories of people's lives than dry history. The class raises a number of interesting questions about national identity, political identity, truth in a political context, different perspectives, etc.\r\n\r\nThat said, the class really isn't intellectually challenging. Professor Rogers is great and knows a lot, but with the class organized as a lecture, he goes over stuff superficially and then section didn't really answer questions or dive deeper into the material. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class, but kinda dry. Didn't try very much, didn't have much work to do, didn't learn much. Gutty and interesting if you enjoy cultural and political anthropology. Otherwise, might be a bore. ",
            "\u00a0yes I would recommend it. it is a great intro to anthropology on one hand, and provides cool insights into the crazy times of transition in Russia and Eastern Europe, providing nuanced context for contemporary life in the region ",
            "\u00a0Personally, the topic of Russia and Eurasia was very interesting to me. As a result, the readings and essays were engaging and easy to write about. If you are interested in this subject matter, I would absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if there was a TF from a relevant department.  Rogers is a good lecturer, however this year the TF was not from the same department. The sections were required but not helpful, and the grading appeared arbitrary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes very interesting ",
            "\u00a0A good introduction to both anthropology and Russian culture. This class provides a really interesting perspective on Russia that is different than what you would get in a history or political science class, and covers recent history that which makes it really relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is a great way to have an anthropological approach to the Soviet Union and its collapse. "
