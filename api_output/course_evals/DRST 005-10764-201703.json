            "\u00a0I learned how to read large quantities of text while retaining information and making interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write better, as well as how to effectively engage with these texts in a short period of time while still getting a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0how to glean important points from longer historical/political texts\r\na better sense of how to identify larger patterns through and across works\r\nthe definition of \"autochthonous\" ",
            "\u00a0Many, if not most, of the authors we read in H&P this semester I had previously not heard of-- Herodotus, Thucydides, Livy, Tacitus, Polybius... I guess all of them, actually, except Aristotle, Augustine, and Machiavelli. I am grateful that now I have been exposed to these thinkers, even I did not find their writing particularly gripping. H&P lectures were the ones I looked forward to most every week, as I loved following the context of the works we read. The burden of contextualizing falls mainly on the H&P lecturers, it seems, but it was quite helpful, so please keep it up. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze different historical methods and gained a general understanding of major concepts in early political philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about history (it's almost as if it were a history course). It's interesting to see patterns emerge over time, and see how history builds on itself. This course has prepared me to analyze our modern history by relating it back to previous events. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at writing ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to look for major themes in dense works ",
            "\u00a0I learned what political preferences and ideas go with which political thinker. I also learned about where ideas like democracy came into play and which nations took part in creating Western government. "

            "\u00a0I think this course could benefit from a clearer statement of its mission - there were several points in the semester at which I felt confused about the purpose/point of the class and about what I was expected to be doing. ",
            "\u00a0Many of the readings could be considered excessive, even for a course with a high reading load. The final was also far more involved than the other DS finals. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the variety of texts and the quality of the discussion and lecture. The sheer number of texts seemed excessive as compared to the other DS courses, meaning more was skimmed in discussion than should have been. ",
            "\u00a0This class had phenomenal discussions - even though this is not my best subject I felt I made some of my best points in these discussions because I understood what was happening to a greater degree than my other classes.\r\nOne point of improvement is that sometimes with longer, more intense texts like Herodotus or Thucydides, it would be very helpful to have a family tree or something like that to guide the reader through the massive amount of names ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in its 2:1 seminar to lecture ratio. Lecture provided essential context, and seminar was when we got to think critically about the work and grapple with the issues. The principal weakness of H&P is the same as the other DS classes, namely that we don't have the time to address 80% of the issues raised in the works. Everyone who signs up for DS knows this in advance, though, and it doesn't seem like there's anything we can do about it. I appreciated that H&P often tried to give us excerpts of books, instead of the whole book, so that we could focus class discussions more. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings and lectures interconnect well to form a coherent narrative of political and historical thought in the West. However, some parts of the readings could have been excluded, as the added reading burden did not contribute much value. ",
            "\u00a0The books could definitely have been selected with better interpretations. At times, some texts just felt illegible. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in that it taught how to write effectively and to detect the nuances in historical works. It could be improved by minimizing the amount of reading for certain works (especially City of God) so students can actually be able to process what they've read. ",
            "\u00a0I think that by looking past historical bias, we miss out on a major component of historical analysis ",
            "\u00a0The nice thing about this class is that a lot of the subjects are things that are interesting and fun to think about. The issue with the class is that we never got to the cool discussions. My teacher never wanted us to apply the pieces to the world today and everyone in my class was quite judgemental, so no one ever felt comfortable arguing about topics that should have mattered more. This class was just dry. "

            "\u00a0This class provides a good grounding in political philosophy and historical thought from the Hellenistic era through the Renaissance. It also offers a good deal of opportunities to improve one's writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking H&P with Professor Semmel, but I believe DS as a whole is a set of courses that fits some people and not others. A genuine appreciation for the texts themselves is one of the most essential yet overlooked attributes of a happy and successful DS student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because I found it very enjoyable and rewarding ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to someone who liked reading and writing. It's really helpful to spend the time in DS constructing a foundation that will ground my other humanities classes. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course is a good idea if you want to gain a strong foundation in the historical methods and political ideas of the western canon. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was very comprehensive and interesting, and improved my writing skills a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was extremely informative and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who knows the subject. I went into this course not knowing anything about political thought, and I felt like nobody was on my side. "
