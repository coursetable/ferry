I think this would enliven discussion by giving students the chance to think from different points of view. Also, I think it would be worth talking a bit more about countries outside North America and Europe (particularly India, which I don't think we mentioned) in future iterations to put backsliding in its global context. With all that said, I really enjoyed the course. "
