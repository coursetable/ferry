            "\u00a0I improved my writing significantly throughout the time I spent in this course. As someone who has never really studied sociology before, this class opened my eyes to the power things easily overlooked have over our society and world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the state of the world with regards to climate change, and also what factors in today's world contributed to the state of our climate. With this being my first seminar sized class, I learned how discussions work and also how to navigate for help when I needed it. I found out how to logically organize paragraphs, which helped improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my overall writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class pushed me to develop my essay writing skills. In doing so, it also taught me how to use Yale's resources to get help for essays, which is an extremely valuable skill that I didn't expect to receive from this class.\r\nI also learned a lot about climate change and logistic systems, and their relevance to the world. Overall, I was able to learn a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge! Thanks to the professors willingness to help during officer hours and his insightful comments from reading our drafts, I was able to improve my writing as a whole in such a smaller period of time. I learned how to pick and choose relevant arguments into an essay, eliminating tangible arguments. I also learned the organizational skills needed for my essa ",
            "\u00a0Primarily, I've honed in on my writing skills. I feel that I've established a stronger foundation for the rest of my writing career at Yale and beyond. I realized I was unfamiliar with some of the basics of writing like proper sentence structure and grammar, and the course helped clarify these things. I have also understood how to shape a logical argument and how to transition from topic to topic. I definitely feel that I am more ready to tackle scholarly writing. The course also shed light onto the logistics industry and its relationship with climate change. This was a topic I felt that I was already familiar with, but after the course I feel that I am well versed in the nuances and implications of this issue. Additionally, I learned how to analyse and critique scholarly articles, which I hadn't done before. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my writing and also learned about various approaches to academic writing through our assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how climate change and the logistics revolution are affecting our world today. I also was able to learn some writing techniques that made me a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Improved structure of writing, transitioned to writing for college, learned a lot about logistics, a field I knew nothing about. "

            "\u00a0A weakness is that it is very selecting: the majority of people are passionate about climate change which does not leave much room for diversity of thought. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: covered interesting topics, pulled a good range of readings, had insightful assignments for essays. Also liked the choice of films used to breakup different sections of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Going into the course, I was advised to take an English 114 course to help improve my writing. I felt that I did not get that much help in how to write a college worthy essay collectively as a group, and submitted assignments without clarification for certain expectations that went against what I learned in high school. ",
            "\u00a0The tempo of the course is really fast and we have few classes that focus on our mistakes on our past papers. On the other hand, the classes are super interesting and informative. I like that everyone has to participate and engage with the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely good at promoting class discussion about the readings that were assigned. There was always a good amount of reading assigned, never too much or too little. The essays assignments were also very clear and also allowed us to explore our own topics of interest within the overarching topic of climate change. \r\nI would have liked to learn more about actual essay writing in class. While this was briefly discussed, a more extensive presentation of how to structure and elaborate claims and arguments would have been very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: engaging, intellectually- captivating, fun, \r\n\r\nWeakness: the essay are assigned subsequently and instantly ( this is not to say it is the instructor's fault rather ENG 114's structure may be a little bit too harsh in terms of workload) ",
            "\u00a0The course was quite well organized. I felt the reading was relevant and progressed in a manner that gradually improved my understanding of logistics and climate change by creating links among the texts. The course is primarily a writing class and the vehicle for that was through the topic of climate change, but I felt that the two could be integrated more seamlessly rather than treating them as separate objectives of the class. An improvement would be to expose us to writing from climate scientists or politicians, and to introduce us to some of the vernacular or argumentation that is common in discussing climate change. Rather than developing our writing skills generally, the course could help us become better writers in the field of environmentalism. I didn't quite understand the purpose of the P4, the final presentation at the end of the course. For me, it was just a reiteration of my P3 in an audiovisual format. Although I appreciated the opportunity to learn about others' research, I did not understand how the P4 fit into the objective of the course which was to improve our writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I thought it was a well designed class and really enjoyed it. The only issue I encountered was with purchasing the course reader and then not actually using all of the included documents. I just love trees and wish I hadnt wasted that paper. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is the in class discussions. One weakness was that we did not spend a lot of time focusing on learning how to write better outside of individual questions and practice with the essays. "

            "\u00a0If you enjoy the topic of climate change like I did, I would recommend this course. Be wary that this is a writing-intensive course and will take up a lot of your time. ",
            "\u00a0If the subject is interesting, then I'd say most definitely take it! There are so many angles and perspectives to look at climate change and the business/tools we use that contribute to it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they had a strong background in writing in high school or thought of themselves as good writers. The topics are also well worth the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this to anyone that is willing to improve their essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0HIGHLY recommend this course to anyone interested in climate change and wanting to improve writing skills. The workload is not extreme and promotes a learning environment not only about the topic of climate change and logistics, but about how to write multiple kinds of essays. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Definitely. It gives us an insight into how things before our eyes - like containers - all contribute to climate change indirectly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student is interested in the topic. Since the course material delved pretty deep into the topic, an interest is crucial for the course to be enjoyable.   I would also recommend students to take this in the first semester of their first year because of how writing intensive other Yale courses are. Establishing a firm writing skill set will be super useful for the rest of their time at Yale. Even for me, the skills I gained from this class informed the structure and the logical progression of the papers I had to write for other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! English 114 is very helpful! I was hoping to learn more about actual climate change, but I realize the main focus of the course is on writing and english skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anybody interested in combining improving writing skills with learning about a certain topic. Our discussions on climate change were very insightful and have given me a new perspective on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend. Climate change is an issue literally everyone must deal with, so no matter who you are, it's relevant. I learned a ton and the readings were really interesting. "
