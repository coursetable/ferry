I received many points off of lab reports for not having specific words in the purpose even though there seemed to be no indication as to what specific words I had to use. I also think that often times some of the questions were worded confusingly. Also, the lab manual pages should probably be updated because there were a lot of last-minute corrections applied to them. For instance, a manual for one experiment mentioned a practical final but this course no longer has that requirement. Aside from that, Dr. G is a very passionate instructor and the experiments were engaging and not too challenging. ",

I found that I often learned or better understood material that he explained in an hour than a week of Chemistry 165 lecture material! A significant weakness I found was the inconsistent grading of lab reports by some of the TAs. In particular I always found that I was losing many points in my introduction/purpose and methods sections of lab report for not including information on the results of the experiment. I made me highly upset to see that I was docked often 2-5 marks for not discussing information relevant to the conclusion/results of the experiment (I mentioned this later in the lab as expected near the results section). I have absolutely no idea as to why I would even need to include results in the PURPOSE of an experiment. Often times people who were graded by other TAs did not lose point for NOT having included information about their results in the purpose either. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job introducing students to lab work but not in developing themselves into independent scientists. Students operate more like robots and less creatively in the lab. ",

Expect to stay 'till five every lab day (that way if you get out early it's a gift!). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lab TAs are very patient and kind folks! They answer your questions about the lab procedures that may be confusing, and they're aware that for some of us, this is our first time ever in a chemistry lab setting. And they understand your plight of having to take this course! I also acknowledge that this is like any standard Gen Chem lab course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: My upperclassman friends have told me that gen chem lab with Dr.G is a weed out course, and it's true. But it's very sad, because it weeds out people not because it's what real science/lab work looks like; it weeds out people because of the meticulous part of science, and because Dr. G is so unnecessarily strict and hostile, like he's always around only to catch you make mistakes, rather than help you. Yes, factual data is serious, but the way that Dr.G enforces everything is rough intimidating especially for a first-year in college. He always brings up \"you can do it because you're Yalies\" - that's true, but perhaps we're Yalies because we're open to these new learning opportunities, and trying out Gen Chem lab and being in a lab for the first time and see chemistry in action is why we're here. But Dr.G's way of teaching is too rigid to make us feel like we can ever improve. I spend hours preparing for lab because I'm so afraid of what will happen if I mess up one thing in lab; I can't imagine Dr.G helping me, only that he'll point out my mistakes. It doesn't feel like making mistakes is allowed here given that we need to get good grades on our lab reports and the rubric is so harsh. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, GenChem lab this semester was a very negative experience. There is a lack of communication between Dr. G, the TFs and the students, and the lab quizzes were much more difficult than they previously had been. It is often very unclear what Dr. G and the TFs are expecting from us, and each grader is very different in what they are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that we get to build on the chemistry information we learned. Weaknesses, this course requires a lot of work and I am not sure if 0.5 credits is equivalent to the amount of work we put in. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. G. is a very good instructor and the course is organized to facilitate learning. It could be improved by having a clearer understanding of the expectations of lab reports. Often getting good grades is like a lottery because you accidentally put in information that was relevant. The problem is that there was no teaching that suggested that it was important prior to submitting an assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The labs itself are a lot of busy work that is time consuming where we get the idea while the lab reports take a long time. The grading can also be meticulous. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Dr. G's lectures in the beginning in the class, but I did not find that I learn much from the labs themselves. Much of it seems like busywork that could be improved by implementing shorter, but more thought-provoking, experiments. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this class, you're probably only taking it because it's a requirement of sorts. Dr. G is very finicky with grading, and to be frank, this class really deterred me from taking other STEM classes overall. That's how bad of an impression this class left on me. But, you have to get done what needs to get done. ",
            "\u00a0This course is honestly not great. Dr. G's standards for lab reports are somewhat mystifying, as different people lose different amounts of points for putting the same thing on their lab report. There is no rhyme or reason to this class. Sometimes, everyone gets a 100 on the quiz and then he makes the next so impossibly hard that the average is a 15/25. The only good part is that you drop your lowest lab report/quiz score. The only way to improve this is to make it more about students exploring/actually understanding chemistry rather than conforming to Dr. G's patently absurd lab report requirements that in no way reflect one's engagement with the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The TAs should be more consistent on grading ",

            "\u00a0A strength is that Dr. G really cares about the subject and is quite good at explaining chemistry concepts. The weaknesses are that the lab reports are harshly graded and the experience of being in the lab space is rather horrible. ",
            "\u00a0The course can improve if Dr. G wrote the lab manuals in a more understandable and concise manner. For instance, instead of writing in paragraphs filled with stylistic questions and unnecessary precautions, the lab manuals can number the steps in a sequential manner to make the students more effective in the laboratory. Furthermore, students were not instructed about what to write in the objective section of the lab, yet they were responsible for including very specific phrases or lose points on the report. This asymmetrical information caused frustration and confusion during the year even for students who thoroughly understand the course material. ",
            "\u00a0This class was unnecessarily tedious, with the weekly quizzes and long lab reports being the major weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Teaching excel and word\r\nWeaknesses: Chemistry ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the organization. I think the experiments are really organized and efficient in terms of corresponding to the chemistry we are learning. The lab reports were fine, and it was fun doing the experiments. I think I learned a lot of chemistry. I think the weaknesses are if Dr. G was more approachable. He already made this course a lot better than last year. The course would be better if the experiments were less repetitive (i.e. when we had to pipet a ton of solutions for the whole experiment). I wish there were more practice problems for the concepts we were learning because for students in Chem 167, it was sometimes difficult to review and follow what was going on. I also think significant figures could be less emphasized because there are more important concepts in chemistry. Lastly, I wish accuracy was not graded. Still, I learned a lot, and we had it pretty easy compared to last year since there are no finals. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a nightmare. The class is 4 hours every week, and the lab reports take between 6-8 hours to complete if you're completely focused and doing them carefully. You learn very little from the course. The grading is nit-picky and depending on which TF grades your reports, you can lose 10 extra points. The class is stressful and frustrating, and while Dr. G is a good lecturer, it's simply not enough to make up for the amount of busy work he assigns. This is the only class I've taken at Yale that's simply a waste of time, but if you want to do a serious science major you have to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course was that grading sometimes felt arbitrary because expectations were not always clear, and some experiments were so logistically complex as to be quite stressful for students with little prior lab experience. ",
            "\u00a0Stop with the quizzes as they are much more difficult than an actual exam question and merely add more stress to an otherwise useless lab that is only required. ",
            "\u00a0This course, for what it was, required a lot of work. Completing the experiments was sometimes a difficult task and along those same lines, there is a bit of inconsistency in grading between TFs. The pre-lab quizzes were extremely challenging this semester and did not seem very fair given the information presented on the lab manual and pre-lab lecture. As an introductory lab course, it surely turned me off from doing anything further in the chemistry department. I am not sure what would have made the course better. That being said, I do think that it covered a great amount of topics in chemistry and certainly taught me important basic lab techniques. I think given a less strict environment, the course could have been both extremely informational, but also enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I think some of the labs were repetitive. For example, we did two titration labs and several labs involving spectroscopy which made the class seem somewhat redundant. Also, I always felt underprepared for the lab quizzes because they were on material that wasn't being covered in class, and I felt like the pre lab lectures didn't fully prepare you for the quizzes. Also, I wish that the material taught in my chemistry lecture aligned with the lab. Also, I felt like the grading was somewhat inconsistent. I felt like my grades sometimes depended on the TA that graded my lab. ",

In one of the labs, I was even deducted many points for poor data.

            "\u00a0Strengths were the level of hands-on practice and engagement we had. Weakness was the grading system and how our lab reports were graded. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learning how to work together with others in a high-stress environment. Most of the people in CHEM 136L are competitive premed students, and it was constantly a competition to see who would leave the lab first. It allowed me to become more cutthroat.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: How can the purposes of lab reports be less than 150 words long and still expect people to include all the relevant details? ",
            "\u00a0While I actually thought the labs themselves were quite interesting, and some of the TAs helpful, the strengths end there. The lab is one of the poorest run and taught classes I have ever taken - I did many of the labs in high school and got much more out of those than I did from these. At the beginning of each lab we would have a quiz on the upcoming lab. Though rather than asking thought-provoking questions, the quizzes contained random questions from things tangentially related to the lab or were dull memorization questions such as \"what substances are we using in the lab.\" The lab reports were worse. Not once were we tasked with conducting a thoughtful scientific analysis of the experiment or even asked scientifically interesting questions. Instead, reports consisted of three questions whose answers were copied straight from the manual and a plethora of graphs to make and equations to transcribe. While I understand the necessity of constructing graphs, I don't understand why huge amounts of points are deducted for creating accurate and useful figures that don't align with the arbitrary standards set forth by Dr. G. You essentially are graded on your ability to create graphs and write equations rather than your ability to analyze an experiment. Furthermore, the TAs graded arbitrarily, some taking off seemingly excessive points for questionable formatting errors while others didn't for the same mistake. They'd be better off asking interesting questions and doing away with the tedious busy work. Dr. G's conduct was also questionable, as his default reaction when someone is having trouble was to accuse them of being sloppy and not caring at an excessive volume. I witnessed several incidents where after said tongue-lashing, the equipment turned out to be faulty (after attempting to do the experiment himself, he couldn't achieve the correct result himself). Evidently, no one wanted to ask him for help in order to avoid such situations. To his credit, it is clear Dr. G cares about the lab and chemistry in general, but in its current form, I'm not sure anyone would take the course unless required to. The thing that troubles me most about the class is that all of the concerns I raised have been raised before (on OCE) over many years yet nothing has changed and probably won't. Yale has stated that one of its focuses is to improve its STEM departments and attract more science oriented majors, yet they continue to allow this class to be the first experience many students have with collegiate level science. If the goal was to deter students from pursuing science majors, this class is perfect as is. I'm not sure what the point of course evaluations are if a class that is unavoidable (required for most science majors and pre-med), an introduction to a field (sciences in general), and has been evaluated negatively in the same way year after year fails to change at all following the feedback. It would be a mistake to continue allowing the course to be taught in such a way. If Yale really cares about promoting STEM on campus, they can't continue to allow this to be students' first exposure to it. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of reinforcing the concurrent lecture's material and exposing students to lab techniques. The labs themselves are generally pretty interesting, save a few tedious, boring ones. The TAs work very hard and range from decently to extremely helpful, depending on the TA. \r\n\r\nThe grading of this course is ridiculously and unnecessarily harsh. The lab quizzes are often overly difficult or too long to complete in the 15 minute time frame. The grading of the lab reports is nitpicky, and we never know what we are expected to have until we get our report grades back. The lab reports also felt pointless, since we were just filling in the blanks and trying to figure out what Dr. G wanted from us, not actually analyzing the results (i.e. difficult grading rubric and grading on accuracy).

Dr. G was a good lecturer and explained concepts well, only the quizzes were problematic. TF marking was also very ambiguous and inconsistent. ",

            "\u00a0Not much was learned in terms of chemistry. It is too much attention placed on insignificant details, and not that much placed on the actual chemistry content. I was losing 3-4 points on every lab report on the purpose without ever receiving clear feedback on what should be included. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from the STEM department being terrible, this course was way too difficult to be considered a lab course: the amount of things we had to do in lab were a lot. I had to do nearly 4 completely different experiments every week: twice I had to come back into the lab to continue because I either didn't finish or I had too large a percent error because I was being rushed the entire time. The only strength was being able to talk about the lab reports with your friends so that you didn't feel alone in doing half of the lab report, and realized you formatted your graphs wrongly. One BIG weakness is that this class meets for more time than any other class, but is only 0.5 credits: although the lab reports are not comparable to PSET's in difficulty, the time taken away from my classes for that day of lab should be factored into the credit value. I do no spend 4 hours of painstaking lab work and 2 hours of lab report writing (plus 2 more because you make mistakes) to only get a measly 0.5 credits. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a comprehensive introduction to lab practices and it manages to walk students through a lot of different lab techniques during the semester. Nonetheless, I believe that as a student of CHEM 167 this lab course was completely disjointed from what I was taught in my introductory chemistry lecture course. There was no clear connection between the topics taught in CHEM 167 as opposed to the intimate connection that existed between the topics of CHEM 134L and CHEM 165. This may have made the lab course seem pointless at times, as it did not build upon the concepts that were taught in lecture in order to analyze in an empirical context. Another weakness of the course was for me the way in which the lab reports were graded. And by saying that, I do not purely mean the way in which points were deducted from the lab reports; rather, I focus on the fact that the lab reports were corrected slowly, not allowing for improvement in a student's work. More specifically, the lab reports were returned to us corrected two weeks after we submitted them. Bearing in mind that a lab report was due on a weekly basis, it was many times the case that the mistakes that were made on one report were repeated on the next one, as the students were unable to identify their mistakes and correct them promptly. Furthermore, the many times excessive focus on detail caused frustration in the students and created a tense relation with the lab course that was unnecessary. Another frustrating aspect of the course, were definitely the pre-lab quizzes. I believe that the quizzes had no other aim other than purely testing how good a student was at retaining the information that was taught in the pre-lab lecture for several minutes and reproducing them at a ridiculous speed in the quiz. Especially this semester, the quizzes were extremely packed with problems and it was many times almost impossible for the students to finish them. I felt that my performance in the quizzes was hurt because of this excessive lack of time.  All in all, although the course was a thorough introduction to lab practices, I believe that it is necessary that some of its weaknesses are corrected in order for it to be a more effective in its aim. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a lot of work for being only half a credit. The amount of time and work that goes into it is much more than some other full credit classes.

I felt like the main weakness of the course was just that nobody cared about anything--the course is so big that I was just falling through the cracks. Nobody wants to go to lab or learn--not even the TAs. I just didn't feel like it was a good learning environment. Dr. G is a great teacher and is quite approachable, but he doesn't reach out very warmly to his students. ",

There's almost no way to predict what one will lose points on or to not lose points (or to gain bonus points) because feedback is not consistent and TAs aren't allowed to check reports before they are submitted. There's almost no reason to keep this information from students who just want to improve. I think that's the main complaint most people have--the class itself is structured fine, but the method of point-giving/removing is somewhat ridiculous. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course included making the laboratory available to students to learn essential skills and that the labs helped students learn more about different concepts in chemistry. The course's weakness was primarily the professor. The professor was unwelcoming and intimidating to students, making it difficult to ask questions and enjoy the course material. Furthermore, lab report feedback was sent out late and students were unable to see their previous mistakes on similar labs to move towards an improved lab report grade. ",

The weekly quizzes focused predominantly on rote memorization of facts such as chemical formulas and were often unrelated to the material presented in the preceding lecture. The lab reports, which constituted the majority of the grade for this course, were assessed by starting at a perfect score, and then subtracting points for errors that were designated in a hidden rubric. These weekly lab reports typically took several hours to complete, not because there was any intellectual challenge but simply because they were made unnecessarily tedious. Lab reports often required us to type up in Microsoft Word several pages of calculations so we could show our work when the calculations being done were common knowledge in the class by that point. Moreover, many of the labs had an accuracy grade, which was completely ridiculous - oftentimes the lab equipment would be faulty, but we would be forced to repeat the procedure regardless. In addition, the lab reports were mostly graded by a different teaching fellow each week, and it appeared as though each had their own opinions and level of detail that was required. Because of this, I was unable to receive consistent feedback and attempt any long-term improvement.\r\n\r\nOverall, the course encourages an extremely unhealthy attitude towards avoiding mistakes, which I believe to be completely unrepresentative of what experimental science actually is in real life. The unreasonable demands of this class compelled many of my classmates to commit dishonest acts in misrepresentation/falsification of data, cover up accidents made in the lab, and copy off one another because they were afraid of the harsh consequences of this class.

The pre lab quizzes often do not cover the material relevant to the experiment of the day. They also often do not follow the study guide given in the lab manual, making it very difficult to prepare for them.

In addition, Dr. G and your TF do try to help you during the lab and answer all of your questions to ensure everything goes smoothly. A major weakness of this course in inconsistency. No matter how detailed the rubric may be, there are always inconsistencies in the grading because there are different people grading the same thing, and there can be a lot of room for error. It is a hard problem to solve, but I believe going over what point value is what many people get upset about. The quizzes were also inordinately hard, that if you weren't taking Gen Chem 165, you might not know what is going on. There was one quiz where, if I hadn't reviewed the subject beforehand, I certainly would have failed. I think the quizzes should be tailored to the lecture and/or manual, rather than the subject, because not everyone is taking the lecture concurrently. "

I never felt like people wanted to be fully engaged in the lab or the pre-lab lecture. Nobody is passionate about what they are doing, not even the TAs. (Okay, Dr. G is.) Also, the lab reports took a really long time--some of them probably took me 8 hours. The lab quizzes are difficult. So take this course if you have to, but you definitely won't have fun. ",
