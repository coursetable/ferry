            "\u00a0I think it was marginally helpful for thinking critically about ethics in research. There was little to no room for discussion, as the professor had all the right answers and was trying to fish them out of us. It would have been better if he were honest, and just said: this is how NSF wants you to think about this issue. ",

This course can be improved by actually discussing ethics in a philosophical manner, instead of the instructor shutting down every single answer that does not align with his own opinions. The pacing of the course is also extremely slow; we would be given reading assignments for a particular week and not discuss them until two sessions later. ",

            "\u00a0The course material was very good.\r\n\r\nProfessor Parr was very engaging.\r\n\r\nProfessor Parr claimed that he was going to structure this course as a discussion where everybody would participate. However, when people would make comments, he would usually hear them out, ask some questions, then say that they were wrong and proceed to explain to us the way things really were. I felt that it would have been more appropriate to structure this course as a traditional lecture with less discussion, and not to invite people's opinions only to shoot them down. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed like a lot of the cases by the end were very similar.  I think it could be streamlined and finish quicker.  The Title IX section we had was the exact same as training graduate students had to do in the beginning of the year, so many of us did not benefit from the long training again. ",

It seemed like even though the professor said discussion was encouraged, he was not very willing to entertain other thoughts and ideas. Additionally, the class ended at 6, but we were consistently held until 6:15 which I don't think is very respectful of everyone's time. ",
            "\u00a0John Parr is a jerk. He discourages anyone from answering by being an ass to anyone who answers. Does not facilitate good discussion. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: It brings a lot of resources and cases to the table. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is very one sided. Where it is initially treated as a discussion it quickly seems more lecturing under a guise of discussion. Also, the case studies brought are all in the same veins of misconduct without expanding into cases that do not involve publication and blatant idea stealing. "
