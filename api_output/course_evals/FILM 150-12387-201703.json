            "\u00a0Good intro class. Explains technical aspects of film (sound, lighting, camera movement, etc..) as well as more thematic aspects. The syllabus has a good selection of films that illustrate concepts in lectures very well. ",
            "\u00a0opened my eyes to the ways that films are made and was a great introduction to film studies in general. really got me to think critically about the nature of film/film history and was overall really enjoyable ",
            "\u00a0I found an appreciation for film that I never had before. I had always loved watching movies, but this class really changed the way I will look at movies. I had not realized the amount of study that could go into films. ",
            "\u00a0How to look at films differently ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about film theory, film history, and the way films interact with each other (both in their creation and in the mind of the spectator). This course is a great introduction to the study of film, and teaches you how to watch films with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to analyze film and think about it in terms of larger over arching themes/ movements. Lots of mixing between watching films and reading about film theory. ",
            "\u00a0I gained understanding of the basic concepts of film theory and their application. I now know better how to think about movies and their value. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of film, different theoretical approaches to film, and why I liked the films I did. I also learned how to analyze film and better organize an essay and develop a thesis. ",

I am now familiar with many seminal films and directors, and I can analyze and appreciate films from different eras and genres.  In addition, this course helped me get better at writing research papers. ",

            "\u00a0Overall a very good course. ",
            "\u00a0this class was super interesting and fun but film theory texts can be pretty abstract and abstruse.  the time commitment is also pretty high, but it was all worth it ",
            "\u00a0The overall topics each week were organized in a clear way. However, each lecture could be confusing at times as to what was the objectives to learn that day. ",
            "\u00a0there are simply too many films -- it makes them unmanagable in terms of viewing but most importantly retention. there were many films which didnt really add anything to a student's understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very enthusiastic and teaches the course well\r\nIt could be made less dry with more engagement though ",
            "\u00a0This class is organized well and is a good introduction to the major. The screenings sometimes felt very long, but I don't see how that could be improved, as we had to watch the films. I would have preferred a bit more focus in sections on discussing the films, as opposed to solely discussing the texts. ",
            "\u00a0Really great intro course, one of the best at Yale. Prof MacKay does a great job of making lecture interesting by expanding on the pretty basic concepts of film theory and relating them to the more complex processes going on in film. ",
            "\u00a0I did not like about half of the reading we did for class, because they were so dense and inaccessible, but I understood why they were included. The pacing of lectures was a bit fast and sometimes, it was hard to tell what was important to know and what was extraneous. The screenings were exhausting. ",
            "\u00a0It is very introductory and I think it could go a little deeper. Also the paper length requirements are unnecessarily long. ",
            "\u00a0I think the screenings were great, but it was not fully clear what their relevance to the week's topic was every week. I wish that had been a little more clear, but other than that nothing else stands out on how the course can be improved. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is in the introduction to different types of foreign film. A weakness of this course includes that I did not find my film section beneficial. My TA did not facilitate discussions well, and tended to shut down students' ideas when they began to expand on them. This created a culture in which students were not eager to create discussion. On the other hand, the section that Professor MacKay led was wonderful. In the future I suggest that the professor work more closely with the TAs to add more structure to sections. Another weakness is that the films are somewhat obscure and hard to process at the beginning. It was very challenging to go straight into the course with silent films with no music, and with films like Man With a Movie Camera, though I felt that later in the course I grew to appreciate them much more. I would suggest placing a few more films that are a little easier to process, like Singin' in the Rain and Vertigo, earlier in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the THEORY behind films but had no clue this would be a flics of the class goin from in.. this focus should be emphasized from the start since many including myself were not expecting or especially looking forward to studying film theory in general ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learn a lot about film, lectures are interesting, good movies\r\nWeaknesses: terrible TA, too many movies ",
            "\u00a0The screenings are very long and a large time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- so interesting! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- the grade for the course really centers around the essays, and I wish it centered more around section participation of understanding of film itself than just writing ability. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could be a greater discussion of current state of film as a medium with the rise of the internet and recent technology. There was a lot of discussion about the switch to digital but other than that the information felt a little dated. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was excellent. The lectures were the strongest part of the course. With regards to weaknesses, I would have liked to receive more feedback on my performance. ",
            "\u00a0The sections for this course were very helpful places for discussion about both individual films that intrigued our class and specific concepts that we had questions about. Also, I liked that the lectures were a mix of talking and videos. The guest speakers were a nice addition, as well. However, I do feel that sometimes having three readings per week was a bit intense. Also, some of the film screenings with two feature films were exhausting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - good films chosen, professor was very passionate, I liked how each week had a theme\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - hard to know what information from lectures we needed to know for essays/exams...it seemed like Professor MacKay would throw a lot of information at us during lecture and wouldn't spend a lot of time on each idea he talked about, and so it was hard to take notes and keep track of everything he was saying. I also would have liked to watch more films from the 21st century ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was good at giving a general overview of film theory and there were definitely elements of every class I enjoyed. However I do feel that sometimes the philosophy explored in the class (usually through the readings) were a bit too heady and unrelated to more practical filmmaking. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Very good class that makes you think about film in a new way. The class does a good job explaining how technical aspects of films interact with larger themes. ",
            "\u00a0i would definitely recommend this class! film studies is super interesting and you really do learn how to watch and think critically about films/the film industry ",
            "\u00a0Yes, film is such a large part of society that everyone should be able to critically analyze films. This is a highly enjoyable course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good intro to film ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to anyone who likes movies and wants to be able to watch them with more understanding and insight. Taking a film studies course, and learning how films are made, will definitely change your perspective on the art. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in film at all, yes. Professor MacKay is incredibly knowledgeably and makes lecture engaging. The readings he assigns are very interesting and relate in complex ways to the film we view. Great screening list so prepare for some unforgettable films (The Wind Will Carry Us!). Overall, a fantastic intro course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the film major. But for someone who more just liked film, I would not because it was very theory-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0I would, professor mackay is a fantastic lecturer and it is really fun to be in his class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in film, definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, but with reservations. I think that many students expect this to be a fun look at movies somewhat in a familiar style. I would like other students to understand that many of these movies are more in an experimental vein, which is also very interesting and educational, but possibly different than they were expecting. Also, if students better understood the amount of time required for this class, they might be more willing to put sufficient time in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you would like to watch film's with a more experienced eye. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I LOVE film, so my passion and enjoyment of it would cause me to recommend the course to others. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course because I love film and are interested in becoming a film and media studies major but I would be tentative to recommend this course to a student will a mild interest in film who was not looking to major in film and media studies. I think that there are probably other film classes at Yale that would suit those needs and accomplish those goals with less work and just as interesting/engaging. I thought that though some of the movies we watched in class were fascinating, others I questioned why they were in the syllabus. We often didn't have the time in section to discuss all of the readings and the movies we had watched. I feel like the class may benefit b ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student with a passion for film; however, I would let the student know that the course requires an intense time commitment because of the sections and weekly film screenings. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course if you're interested in film HISTORY. I was hoping we would discuss more of 21st century cinema and Hollywood but we mostly focused on the 20th century. \r\n\r\nI took this course Credit/D so I wasn't too concerned with the workload, but there are a lot of heavy, difficult readings and you have to spend 3ish hours every Tuesday night watching two films. \r\n\r\nProfessor MacKay is clearly very passionate about film, however, it was often difficult for me to clearly understand lectures and to take notes because he often jumps around from topic to topic and isn't the most engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe, I would prefer a film intro class that was more in-depth with the production side of film as opposed to the study/theory side of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who knows they want to pursue film as it is a pre-requisite and does provide a solid foundation in film theory, something which is best to be taught as opposed to learn through filmmaking itself. Having said that, as a foray into film for newcomers I feel as though it would not be engaging. "
