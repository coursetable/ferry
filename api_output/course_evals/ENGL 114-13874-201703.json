            "\u00a0Throughout this course, we read and learned a lot about the self through various readings and images. More importantly, we learned how to write both analytical and personal pieces that helped us synthesize the topics we read about. We focused on create \"good\" paragraphs by seeing together what was necessary and what was not. ",
            "\u00a0Besides the obvious writing and editing skills I expected to gain from this class, I also developed an appreciation and understanding of selfhood.  The class discussions, essays, and readings allowed me to peer deeper into what makes a self and what it means to be a self. ",
            "\u00a0Reading hard texts and understanding the gist of it.\r\nStructure and style of academic writing.\r\nOrganizing my ideas and arguments.\r\nPutting in my input in my essays.\r\nDoing research and using library resources.\r\nWorking abd polishing many drafts to get to a final version. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop many insights that I didn't not recently know. I was able to approach the idea of the self from many different angles. ",
            "\u00a0The big takeaway from the course for me was leaning how to identify and develop a clear problem and claim in writing an essay. I was also able to learn more about the self through the philosophical readings. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I developed many more skills than I would have expected to in a writing class. I learned how to close read scholarly articles, as well as many very useful writing skills. In writing, I learned how to pick an argument for a paper. In my previous papers in high school, I would write opinions about books or just facts about them; however, in this class we learned how to develop a problem and claim with the paper. Lastly, Professor Eklund helped me with my essay structure tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0I developed stronger writing and argumentative skills that allowed me to evaluate different authors' writings as well as my own. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my argumentative analysis of texts by teaching me to look at strengths and weaknesses of others' arguments. From this, I also learned how to compile others' arguments to form my own argument, thereby contributing to past conversations. Outside of the skills I learned, I also learned a lot about the self and its influencing factors. ",
            "\u00a0I developed writing and critical skills. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of academic writing increased dramatically, and I think my ability to write also improved significantly. "

            "\u00a0This course is structured pretty well. Each unit we moved through seemed to flow and connect with the previous one. It is hard to know where you stand in the middle of the semester, but that is only a minor weakness. Overall, this course's strengths outweigh its weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course and I thought it was run perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0Very nice and fun teacher.\r\nCovers the basis of philosophy (though at times a little too philosophical).\r\nEssays well spread out.\r\nWe receive lots of feedback, which is super helpful.\r\nNot boring at all. All the classes are different: sometimes writing, sometimes workshops, sometimes discussions. The variety keeps it interesting!\r\nCould spend more classes on AI and transhumanism. ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths of the course and there is nothing that should be improved. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered many philosophical readings ranging from racial identity to artificial intelligence which were all genuinely interesting. These readings offered material for us to talk about it groups during discussion. My suggestion for the course, however, is to spend less time on the Appiah unit so that there is more time for topics such as AI towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the freedom of writing in this class and how we discussed the readings in class for better understanding. Maybe we could have done a little more learning about writing and grammar as a writing class but we did get some feedback through essay drafts. ",
            "\u00a0Oftentimes, the texts we read had no influence or pertinence to the kind of writing we diid. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the conversations that I was able to have with my classmates about different readings as well as my own paper because this really helped ideas flow. I also really loved that the course focused on different styles of papers for each paper instead of having us crank out the same type of essay every time.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that the course did not allow for a lot of writing time in class. Classtime was mostly allotted to talking about readings or peer editing. One thing that may help is if the professor could edit a student's essay in front of the class every once in a while just so that we could see what type of material he was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe more work on the quality of writing rather than the philosophical aspect of the class, which was nevertheless very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It had too many sections that couldn't all be talked about deeply. ",
            "\u00a0I loved conferencing with my professor and getting feedback from both him and my peers. I also found the readings fascinating and the topics stimulating. I think the students could have been a little more engaged in the class, but I think that was mostly a result of the 9 AM start time. One thing that I wished was that my professor had been a little more harsh. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this course will teach you a lot of about the self and will challenge your thinking beyond just the text that we read. It is great for learning how to structure your paper and even for learning how to fine-tune the small errors. I would recommend meeting with the professor, as he is very willing to help and offers great advice about your paper for revision. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a great introduction to college writing. Gives a very strong foundation for writing in the future. Fun class and small, so you become close to the teacher and the other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would highly recommend this course. It was a good introductory writing course. ",
            "\u00a0Given that the ENGL 114 courses are known for having longer papers, I would recommend this section for people interested in psychology, sociology, and/or philosophy because these topics make writing these papers more enjoyable. This course was a fun way to improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this to another student as it was a very engaging and interesting class in which  I was allowed to personalize my essays while still being able to comfortably be helped with my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to anyone that wants to improve their basic writing and argumentative skills. For anyone who feels they have these skills strongly developed, they should look for other English classes. This is an especially good section for people interested in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0YES I would 100% recommend this course! I absolutely loved the topicit resembled a philosophy course to some extent. Not only that, but the professor is super kind and understanding. As a STEM major, I came into this course thinking that this would be similar to AP English Lit/Language and that I just needed to get this course over with to fulfill my WR credit. However, it gave me much more than that and actually drew me in to engage. I learned a lot of college-level writing skills and a LOT about the self. He also was not kidding when he said we would learn about selfies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course teaches you how to write properly, the subject is very interesting and the professor is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. I think it is very beneficial to improving college essay writing. I also think it is intellectually stimulating. "
