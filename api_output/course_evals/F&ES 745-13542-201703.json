            "\u00a0Specific stylistic tools and writing a compelling story. ",
            "\u00a0This is the only course I took at FES, and possibly the only course offered at FES, that really teaches you how to craft, research, and write an article for newspaper/magazine publication. It's a great skill I feel I've learned. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Strebeigh opened my eyes to so many writing tools, I'm not sure I'll ever read any prose the same!  I have learned to spot and play with the significance, drama, scenes, \"snaps,\" and other key elements of a piece.  Most importantly, I've learned how to tighten my (oft-verbose) writing and incorporate - truly incorporate! - others' feedback on my drafts. :) ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have good tools to take steps towards improving my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I was able to flex my writing muscles. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to articulate many things I subconsciously knew, but hadn't thought about in an intentional way. Going forward I will be a better writer, storyteller, and thinker because of this course! ",
            "\u00a0I dramatically improved my writing skills and understanding of effective nonfiction writing techniques in this course. Through the writing and editing of a long-form journalism piece, as well as the excellent supplementary readings by leading environmental writers, I learned how to more effectively build drama, how to establish my authority as a writer, and how to structure a piece to provide focus and entertainment for the reader throughout. I also gained insights into the importance of communicating about environmental issues in a straightforward and accessible way, as opposed to an academic way, and I deeply value the opportunity to apply that in my future environmental work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write well and understood that good writing is an act of revision. Fred pushed all of us to be better,in our thinking and in our writing - a skill useful beyond the constraints of this class and F&ES. ",
            "\u00a0How to read critically, and write an engaging piece ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to construct an environmental article -- along with how to construct the sections that comprise it. We looked at some of the best environmental writers -- incl. some FES alums -- who've been published in the field. Fred showed us what needs to be included as well as different ways to construct those sections. \r\n\r\nI really learned how to be an effective environmental writer and to deliver hard (scientific) fact without it being overwhelming to the reader. This is a terrific skill to take away. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for understanding how to craft the different parts of an environmental writing piece and for engaging with a number of great environmental writers, and trying to use some of these techniques in our own writing. "

            "\u00a0This class exceeded my already high expectations for it. The professor was phenomenal at facilitating discussion of environmental writing during the class meetings, and made himself accessible to students throughout the semester for one-on-one meetings to address specifics of our writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course exceeded my expectations. I have never had any professor care so much about my writing, and for my intellectual product. ",
            "\u00a0This class aligned very well with my expectations and I felt I learned a lot from it. The only downside was I expected to be able to develop my own piece more, but that was more a result of my story itself being incomplete than the class failing to deliver. "

            "\u00a0Key strengths were the professor and TA's feedback each week on my draft as well as the workshopping set-up for the latter half of the course (which helped me become more specifically familiar with their work and thereby helpful in support its development).  The only weakness was losing half the class at midterm... :( ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include Fred's knowledge and feedback. Can't say there are any major weaknesses or room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is hands-on -- you're learning by doing, and with the support and guidance of a very experienced writer. Fred's feedback was invaluable -- he puts huge time and effort into his critiques, and I learned so much from him. ",
            "\u00a0The overarching strength of this class was the opportunity it provided to become an expert on a topic of deep personal interest, and to write a story about that topic that would allow it to reach a broader audience. I have no suggestions for its improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the time and care Fred and Chris (the TA) put into our writing. I also liked that we finished a considerable portion of our writing during the first half of the semester. This allowed us to focus on revisions and editing during the second half, which is generous and understanding of students and their crazy, finals schedules. \r\n\r\nI also appreciated the opportunities to meet with Fred one on one to discuss our writing. ",
            "\u00a0The professor didn't have much time to meet with students outside the class, which considering that it is a writing course was not great.\r\n\r\nThe professor's feedback on writing was excellent! ",
            "\u00a0The course was brilliantly executed all around. Its strengths were in the format (walking through environmental writing and discovering what makes the pieces powerful, successful) and in the workshops (being able to develop my skills of constructive praise and criticism in addition to being stronger in receiving both). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing professor and great readings, good peer insight and engaging discussions in class\r\n\r\nImprovements: Perhaps more time in class to write/brainstorm on our individual pieces would be good. "

            "\u00a0If given the opportunity to take a course with Fred Strebeigh, you should do it. He is one of the best educators I have experienced in my higher education and this course was invaluable to me. ",

            "\u00a0Take it. Wherever you're at as a writer, I think everyone could benefit from the opportunity to think deeply about a topic of interest (whether it's your research, a trip you took, or an environmental issue you've always wanted to study closely), and create a story about it that allows you to share it with others in an engaging and meaningful way. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to learn the basics of environmental writing, this course is for you. You will get out of it exactly what you put in. The workshopping skills learned in this class will help you with group work at FES and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class - Professor Streibeigh is great, such an encouraging professor who really promotes discussion, values student thoughts and voices, and takes the class through a discovery of some of the great works of environmental writing. Definitely worth taking! "
