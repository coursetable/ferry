            "\u00a0I think in this course I developed a sense of nuance about questions of cultural appropriation that I didn't have before. I definitely thought of cultural appropriation as fairly black and white before, and I hadn't considered things like the danger of essentializing cultures etc. I also really enjoyed writing the papers for this class, which allowed me to apply some of the more theoretical texts that we were reading (which mostly dealt with frameworks for understanding cultural exchange/borrowing/appropriation) to topics I was interested in. ",
            "\u00a0This course facilitated thinking critically about situations that you know are appropriative but are not always 100% sure why you have a problem with them. The things we talked about were not black and white but instead dead in the grey zone which lead to a lot of critical thinking and self realization about where you personally stand in relationship to these issues. It also ruined (in a good and interesting way) a lot of my favorite songs by opening my eyes to behaviors of commercialized music that I was unaware of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss cultural appropriation in a scholarly context, and was able to explore a lot of questions that I hadn't ever considered before. We learned about appropriation in Western classical music, opera, popular music, and other types of music around the world. We also learned about the history of sampling and hip-hop music, and how samples of indigenous people conducted by ethnomusicologists for research have led to irresponsible sampling by popular artists (as well as how we should navigate that/what the solution is moving forward). \r\n\r\nProfessor Moore also blew my mind with some of the comparisons she made between popular songs and the songs they copied! I also really enjoyed the freedom we were given with the final paper, which allowed me to explore a topic that I was deeply interested in without restraint. The fact that this class is also a seminar also allowed for a lot of engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the complex relationships between culture and music. ",
            "\u00a0- Critically question my own personal biases regarding other cultures and stereotypes \r\n- Understand cultural appropriation as a question of respect and exploitation\r\n- Evaluate my own experiences (both artistic and non-artistic) through the cultural appropriation lens offered in this class ",
            "\u00a0Gained skills to process ideas of cultural appropriation through various frameworks instead of solely by intuition and experience "

            "\u00a0I think this course is excellent! Each week we had a manageable amount of very interesting reading on different topics related to cultural appropriation. I think a big strength of this course is the way it balances theory and applicationmost weeks we read papers that took a specific instance of cultural exchange and theorized a framework for understanding it. Or, we read about concrete examples and theorized our own frameworks. Now, I feel like I have a whole new set of language for talking about and understanding cultural borrowing. ",
            "\u00a0I would love to have further explorations of the larger picture of cultural appropriation. Perhaps after every case study we could look at two questions: the impact of the appropriation or exchange at play, and the next steps / what to do now. Each case seemed important, but it is difficult to figure out now what it all means and what to do about it, beyond critical thinking. However, in this class, we develop an incredible ability TO think critically about music, which is great. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings and subsequently discussions were a little repetitive in nature since we were ultimately always grappling with the same overarching questions even when looking at it through different lenses. Even so, Dr. Moore did a really awesome job making class interactive and hands on by doing things like appropriation show and tell and final project presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Professor Moore is extremely respectful and sensitive, given the topic of this class. She handles many different topics deftly.\r\n- Covers a wide range of topics, doesn't just focus on Western pop music but forces us to consider appropriation from many different angles.\r\n- Felt like a community -- got to know people by name!\r\n- Professor Moore gives a lot of clear feedback, I really appreciated that we did final project presentations. She also pushes back on us a lot and challenges us to think differently, rather than reinforcing our existing beliefs. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some of the readings were confusing given that we weren't given a background to their purpose/certain terms used consistently throughout the papers. It would've been helpful if seminar discussions were more guided/focused (some powerpoint slides/increased class material might help in this regard, rather than having it all revolve around discussion), although I appreciate that Professor Moore always let us move in the direction of our interest.\r\n- I wish we had learned more musical terminology at the start of the class to better equip us to discuss the musical elements of the songs we listened to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely well-rounded, offers a wide variety of content and discussion points, provides platform for students to thoughtfully challenge themselves and others ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Cultural relevance, professor's knowledge and summing up of student comments\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the discussions were not cordial and am wondering if discussion could be facilitated in better ways or rules about engagement to be more concrete "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, especially taught by Dr. Moore. As I've said, this course gave me a whole new set of language and understandings around cultural exchange/borrowing/appropriation. This is such a salient topic, and even though the course only deals with musical examples I feel like the principles apply elsewhere. The readings were super enjoyable and we really dug into them in class, which is always satisfying. Also, the readings rarely felt unreasonably longin general, this was a very manageable class. There is structure to the final paperyou submit an abstract and give a presentation on itthat makes sure that you're on top of things. Overall, one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student highly interested in the specific field of ethnomusicology. It is a niche subject, and we explored it thoroughly and well. However, I was expecting to cover a broader scope of knowledge especially regarding ethics and music, and the course material simply did not leave enough time for any of the broader implications or philosophical thought. ",
            "\u00a0100%. Interesting content, awesome professor, great peers, and not a strenuous workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, depending on their interests. If you care about being able to discuss cultural appropriation from a scholarly standpoint, and love learning about music, I'd take this class. It's one of those classes that you take to have fun and think with other people, training the way you think about things moreso than learning concrete hard material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely all music majors should consider this course as it bridges theory with practicality. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely  it is unlike any course I have ever taken. It is engaging for both musical and non-musical students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone for insights into one's own understanding of their bias and navigating how that may have been shaped. It's also interesting to see how others think of cultural appropriation and what they prioritize in their learning. Flexible course to fit your interests and intellectually stimulating. "
