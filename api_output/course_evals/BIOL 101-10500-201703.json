I didn't come from a very STEM-based school, but this course definitely gave me insight into some of the STEM classes offered here at Yale. ",

However, it is overwhelming (especially for freshmen), so biweekly quizzes might be wiser so as not to deter students from wanting to pursue stem majors. It would also be nice if the information we are meant to learn for the discussion sections were posted online (to prevent differences between students with good TAs and students with bad ones). ",
            "\u00a0strengths: well organized, good lecture slides and photographs. generous grading system ( I loved being able to drop one quiz, HW and discussion section grade. Helped ease the learning curve a bit). Enrichment was a great tool as well.\r\n\r\nweaknesses:very difficult for me because I did not have AP bio experience. Difficult to catch up because professor did not take the time to summarize introductory concepts. ",

            "\u00a0This course was good in that there were always opportunities to seek out help, ask questions, multiple ways to learn the material if preferred, etc. Overall the structure of the course was well organized and suitable for learners of all types. \r\n\r\nThe biggest improvement that could be made to the course would be to organize the knowledge topically a little better. Although it was clear from lecture to lecture what would be covered, I think an additionally streamlining of the content and additionally overarching theme would be better. The key concepts were good but I felt like even those were just lists of facts with little tying one to the other. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not as important as much of the information was provided on the slides.\r\nThe grading style of homework was difficult to predict. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers everything that it needs to, although sometimes the quizzes can be a bit confusing. I think the quiz aspect of the course should be reevaluated because it is very formulaic and disregards insights or answers that fall outside of class material. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a really good job of making sure the information is presented at a level everyone can understand. While there was a lot of information, it was not extremely difficult to study  and understand what it all meant. Plus, access to the peer tutors twice a week was extremely beneficial. \r\nAs for weaknesses, the course had very few. The biggest flaws was that sometimes there would be readings due at discussion sections, and for students who had early discussion sections (Wednesdays) they would have to get the readings done before the rest of the class. This was stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes you can fall into the trap that thinking this class seems so easy that you slack in studying for the quizzes. I think sometimes lecture was a little redundant but overall this class was very clear and straight forward. ",
            "\u00a0As a foundational biology course, BIOL 101 certainly builds up one's basics well. This course does not assume any prior knowledge - the content is skilfully arranged so that the concepts presented progress logically and build up on one another. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is designed with the beginner bio. student in mind. In fact, I think the weekly homeworks, quizzes, and discussion sections were a really regular routine that very well acclimated students to managing a college-level workload without overwhelming them. I also think that the lecture format wherein students print out slides and study guides to annotate was really smart in engaging students with the material (and useful for review!) ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the varied amount of individual topics you get to know pretty thoroughly.\r\nThe one weakness I am thoroughly convinced through my experience and my peers' is that their is no introductory biology course. For kids, like myself, the enrichment 1 is helpful in learning the information in a different way, but because my school did not offer AP Biology or an equivalent class, we are learning additional in-depth information with no solid foundation.  Yale's math department recently created a small math class for kids with little to no Calculus experience called Math 110-111 to ease them into Calculus at Yale. I believe it would be beneficial to create a smaller Biology Intro class to prepare underprepared students with a solid foundation in which to then take the Bio sequence. This would ensure a better grasp of the material, better test grades, and a more friendly introduction to science classes at Yale for kids like me.\r\nI also believe the weekly quizzes caused more anxiety than help. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great! I liked all aspects of it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course does a really good job of covering relevant material for an introduction to biology, and I thought the class was really well taught. However, the discussion sections were less great. A lot of the times, the material covered seemed pretty pointless - I would've much rather the discussion sections have been a more open forum style where people can focus on what needs reinforcing. Honestly, for a class that doesn't do journal clubs (except for once and even then it was heavily regimented), the sections seemed pointless. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-organized and clearly outlined, such that I knew what would be covered during each lecture before actually attending the lecture. This was helpful in that it allowed me to acquaint myself with the information before the lecture began. However, I thought the weekly quizzes in this course were somewhat excessive. I ended up spending a significant amount of time every week working on bio alone and I feel it may have taken away from some of my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: lecture is not very engaging and quizzes are too time intensive to complete in the 15 minutes given. ",
            "\u00a0It's a course to which you need to devote a lot of time, but the time will pay off so long as you're working with the peer tutors or in enrichment. A huge weakness is that you can kind of feel lost in the class if you don't really seek out ways to participate; I'm not sure how to improve that, because it is a large lecture. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that it is really trying to be accessible to all students regardless of their biology background. The other intro science classes really should looked at the intro bio sequence as a model for their own courses. I took AP Bio roughly four years ago and it definitely did help but it really is not needed to do well in this class, and they have the enrichment sections as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing would be that I would appreciate it if feedback could be given for all of the psets, some of the psets just had grades but no explanation. Also for some reason on canvas it was really difficult to see the feedback given. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the consistency of teaching that was maintained across discussion sections, and the consistency of grading across TF's. For an introductory course, the level of thought put into logistics was very impressive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: familiarizes students with various experimental techniques and some degree of experimental thinking.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: does not do nearly enough to teach students principles of biochemistry and biophysics. Focuses too much on memorization of specifics from past experiments. Discussion sections do not effectively reinforce material. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was very boring and easy to skip because all the information was included on the slides. ",
            "\u00a0A big weakness is the constant quizzing. Sure, I learn the material every Tuesday night. But, that's why I learn it. In reviewing for the final, I realized I didn't deeply understand much at all. Also, the TF section activities had little to do with the quiz topics so students didn't care. ",
            "\u00a0I think it introduced us to many things, but those things seemed random. I got my motivation to stay focused in class because I had spoken to a friend taking Bio 103 and she told me that t=she felt rather lost in 101 too because there was just so much random information, but because of the syllabus of 103, the content of 101 made a lot of sense. Thus, I think it might be helpful to have a clearer sense of why we learn what we learn in 101.\r\n\r\nI think that the bIo sequence is not as accommodating to students not coming from an AP Bio/American curriculum Bio learning experience. I found quite a bit of redundancy in the material we learnt and which there could be some way for people coming from A-Level Bio or IB Bio to take a bio course and still feel like they are always learning something. However, I understand that this may be difficult as the majority of students are American. ",
            "\u00a0One major issue is that the intro bio sequence is not leveled at all and it is very difficult to test out of, so there were many students struggling to keep up while others were bored and frustrated at having to sit through material they already knew. I think there should either be multiple levels of intro bio (like there are for gen chem) and/or the placement exams should be more reasonable so that students who know most of the material can actually place out of modules. Another issue was that we were told in the beginning of the course that we would be tested mainly on concepts, not factual regurgitation, but that was a bald-faced lie. Also, a huge weakness was that the quizzes and homework questions were extremely poorly written-- they lacked specificity and clarity to the point that I genuinely do not feel they provided an accurate assessment of students' understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is definitely that they care more about you learning the material than the grades. ",
            "\u00a0The powerpoint slides are very helpful and provide a way to take intuitive, efficient notes ",
            "\u00a0The course is a large lecture class, so I understand why it has to be graded on a curve. However, the grading rubric of BIOL 101 often resulted in people losing a significant amount of points on material they demonstrated high knowledge of (as in, they missed a single word and lost many points). Therefore, someone's score in BIOL 101 often didn't do a good job of reflecting their actual knowledge, which I know was frustrating for a lot of students.\r\n\r\nThe peer tutors during this semester (Fall 2017) were really great, so it is definitely worth going to peer tutoring sessions. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well taught and the professor tried hard to answer everyone's questions. I believe that peer tutoring was really helpful. However, sometimes, slowing the pace will help students learn more from the classes. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture notes were too good so I couldn't motivate myself to take notes and didn't pay attention. Too pre-med focused ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in the vast array of information the student received on the topics of biochemistry and biophysics. Nevertheless, one weakness is the pace at which the class moves; much outside time is necessary to truly understand the topics discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was its structure and the tools provided for studying. There were lecture study guides that were super helpful in reviewing the material. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of resources offered beyond the class, which is cool. It feels patronizing though, maybe because of the professor, which is less cool. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Koelle keeps the lectures very interesting despite the complex material. However, it was difficult to keep track of what material would and would not be covered on the quizzes and tests. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, learning goals are very clear, homework sets contribute to learning, expectations are clear and maintained, transparent about grades and course plan; Weaknesses: organization of lectures could be improved--units felt artificially separated/compartmentalized; would have liked greater cohesion that spanned all lectures, for example, topics that will be covered in more depth later should be identified this way when they are first introduced to prevent later confusion; participation also felt very forced, would have preferred that students have more freedom to pursue their own intellectual curiosity within biology; students need more time for quizzes, it seems unnecessarily challenging to ask more questions than can be answered in 15 min; another critiquenot sure how to fix this, but the learning, despite having the goal of being oriented towards divergent thinking and application, requires too much memorization of the \"key concepts\" to the extent that students lose points for not including the exact wording of the \"key concept\" when explaining a quiz response ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quizzes helped me to understand material better and give me real-time feedback on how I was doing in the course. \r\nWeaknesses: We jumped around a lot in terms of course content. Additionally, I felt like the first couple of lessons were too easy while the last couple were a little too fast-paced. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course has strengths in the material that is presented and the ways in which it is reinforced through practice.\r\nThe course could improve on the ways that the class information is given; I think for the most part, it wasn't important to attend lecture because the material taught was already in the notes. I think too some of the ways that the information was given for the class shouldn't have been done so only in class or only in Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0It was good at teaching bio but it overlooked other information more pertinent to what it is like working in a lab or going into medicine. They rarely talked about medical field here. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses are the ambiguity of the test and quiz questions! The fact that you need VERY specific language in order to receive full credit. And the fact that it meets twice a week instead of three times a week for fifty minutes. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths is how all the provided materials were structures. The study guides were very helpful in studying the material since it provided a clear outline. However, a weakness was the structure of the quizzes. Personally I felt that the quizzes didn't really give a proper assessment. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the weekly quizzes. These keep the students on top of the material. A weakness of the course was the close proximity of of homeworks #4 and #5. Otherwise, I thought the course had been chiseled into perfect form. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that a lot of extraneous information was included. I found the class difficult to engage with due to size. ",
            "\u00a0It covers a lot of information in depth at a decent pace. The enrichment sessions and and sections really help the understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the quizzes kept the material fresh on my mind. The course was very well-taught and organized. It can be improved by going more heavily by the book so that we can use the book in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a very succinct and consistent schedule of work that was able to allow students to repeatedly look over and understand the material in a very comprehensive way without it seeming completely overwhelming. I think the only way it could be improved would be through more audience participation. ",
            "\u00a0We need more intro classes at Yale that aren't designed for kids who have already taken the class. There's no reason for someone who has never taken an advanced biology course to be with students who did AP bio. It's simply not fair. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of the course is the type of questions on the quiz. They are not very straightforward and often did not test knowledge of the material. Also, quizzes should either be shortened or more time should be allotted to them. ",
            "\u00a0This class is trying to cover such a huge amount of material so generally that every question is only a guess at what exact wording or key phrases the instructors are looking for. I don't feel that I truly learned anything. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes were bad. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is that the content is great. There were many weaknesses of this course, however. The quizzes were increasingly obscure, and points were docked off for ridiculously specific terms or phrases, even if everything about the answer is correct. Discussion sections were not helpful at all, despite my TA being great. The homework was also graded with extreme scrutiny, leading to frustrating scores on the homework. There is no need to go out of the way to trick kids in intro bio, and this is a critique of the entire intro biology sequence here at Yale. There is absolutely a great benefit in learning experimental techniques and the ability to read and write scientific paper, which is what the sequence greatly focuses on. This is fine. However, extremely frustrating grading and quizzes strongly discourage students from becoming interested in biology, which is a detriment to the three fantastic biology departments we have at Yale.

            "\u00a0Yes. Great class to introduce biology ",
            "\u00a0This course is a critical prerequisite for so many majors and potential career paths. It's not taken as a matter of recommendation, but rather of necessity. That being said, it is a good course with a team of instructors who sincerely try to ensure that students do learn. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend it because it is a good place to begin. Its a necessary course for many majors, especially biology based ones like MCDB and MB&B. Also, its necessary for pre-med as a general requirement for med-school. ",
            "\u00a0While this course is required for all Biology majors, I would also recommend it to others who are looking for an introduction to biology, since the learning curve is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I recommend this course to any student who wants to build a strong foundation in biochemistry and biophysics before pursuing further study.I think the material goes well beyond the level of any high school AP Biology course, and the class is well-designed to introduce new students to college level work. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend if they had taken AP Biology or an equivalent in high school. ",

            "\u00a0Don't take this course if you're trying to get a Sc credit - even if you got a 5 on AP biology, you'll probably have to do a lot of work and there are better credits out there that will most likely interest you more. If you have to take it for your major (like me), make sure you devote enough time to it and make sure you understand each lecture before moving on. ",
            "\u00a0I think Bio101 is a good course to take if you need it, it is not overwhelming if you stay on top of your work. If you do things on time I think that it is a fair course. \r\n\r\nIf you don't need it or just want to take it to fulfill a distributional requirement I think there are a lot of random cool STEM classes Yale offers, but if you need it for your major don't freak out about it. ",
            "\u00a0Well courses in the bio sequence are necessary for some majors so for them I would say they should take them. For other people, if they want an overview of some aspects of biology I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0No, but if they're pre-med they'll need it anyway. Biology and specifically biochemistry is one of my favorite subjects so I found it a real shame that this course was so poorly taught. Not that this was necessarily Koelle's fault. Seems to be a problem of the entire intro bio sequence. So much focus on random specific details in old research papers, not enough biology taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to review basic biological concepts. No if you are looking for a intellectually challenging class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a good course to introduce biology! ",
            "\u00a0I don't think it's a matter of recommendation because most people who take Biology 101 have to take it for their major. But prepare yourself for a lot of frustration about the way the course is structured. I spent hours each week ranting about it with my friends, classmates, and even parents. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in future bio course it's a good foundation to have ",
            "\u00a0Only take this class if you need it as a prerequisite for something else or you are pre-med. It's mostly review of AP biology, so if you've take AP bio, you probably won't have much trouble with grasping or understanding the material. However, the class can be extremely boring for people who have taken AP bio.\r\n\r\nThe grading system of BIOL 101 has issues and doesn't do a good job of reflecting your actual knowledge, but that's balanced out by the fact that homework and discussion section participation make up a significant portion of your grade. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to other students who want to gain a strong understanding of biology and the sciences. It will greatly improve your ability to apply what you learn from a textbook and in a lecture setting to more practical lab situations. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they are particularly interested in majoring in the biosciences and/or being pre-med. This is a course tailored to those who enjoy learning about science, not those who are specifically looking to fulfill the science credit for graduation. However, the course does provide a good overview of biochemistry and biophysics for those interested. ",

An understanding of biological processes and scientific thinking is (at a minimum) crucial to a well-rounded understanding of the world, and this is an excellent class in which to pick up some of that understanding!

            "\u00a0This is one of those courses, where you start out taking it if you need to, and although the questions on homework assignments, quizzes, and test are not entirely able to be answered through rote memorization, and definitely could be challenging, they were a helpful prep to what is to come when going into the field of biology. They really do make you think critically, I admit. I would recommend this to another student if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provided a very thorough and meaningful understanding of biological concepts and the modern innovative techniques that are used to find them. It also provides the structure of how to analyze scenarios like a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely not recommend this course if it isn't explicitly required for a major or program. Just like most intro STEM courses at Yale, it isn't really an intro course. It relies heavily on the assumption you have already learned the material. Most of the kids are pre-med freshmen who just pulled out out of AP Bio and are still wearing their residential college lanyards around their necks. Save yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I think BIOL 101 was a great introduction to biochemistry. The pace was manageable even for someone with no biology experience. ",
            "\u00a0No. You're not taking this for fun. No one is. My question is just why does Yale have to make such a required course sequence so terrible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for the content and because it allows you to take upper level biology courses here at Yale. The experimental techniques and the biochemical and biophysical topics are absolutely worth learning. However, this class is designed to trick students and cause them to lose points. The quizzes are very hard. The homework is fairly straightforward, but many points will be taken off for many things. The TAs disagree with the rubric on quizzes sometimes, but the instructors of the course are adamant that their answer is the \"only\" correct one. Furthermore, the class is very stressful for no reason. They purposely go out of their way to not answer questions clearly on Piazza, to not clearly articulate the expectations for quizzes and the final, to not disclose how the grades work etc. It's a shame that the intro bio sequence here carries such a negative reputation for no other reason than the departments' stubbornness to change it for the better. ",
            "\u00a0If you need to take this class, then it's a fine class to take. I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone who does not need to take intro bio, however. "
