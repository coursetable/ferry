As we get further into the class, I think it would help to dissect problems that have come up in production work as a class so that we can see the thought process.  We did this once (we were talking about the deck in El Huracan, I think), and it was easily the most thought-provoking and engaging day in class all semester. ",

",

This is not a fault of the class just a personal coincidence. Nonetheless I can see myself applying what I learned. "

            "\u00a0I think it would help to do examples in class that are similar to the ones in the book but aren't exactly the ones in the book.  It would certainly take more time to slowly walk through the problem, but it would give us a chance to think through the problem as a group and find places where we or our classmates tend to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nAn updated answer key for the even problems would help immensely.  There were several times where I would get an answer different from the back of the book and spend a significant amount of time trying to figure out what I'd done wrong, only to discover that I hadn't done anything wrong at all, and the book hadn't been updated to the new numbers, or contained a typo.  It would be relatively easy to have someone type up the changes and hand them out at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if the syllabus indicated the resources available to students, e.g. for folks with a learning disability, as the other syllabi do - I know the information is readily available in other locations, but having it on the syllabus is an easier starting point if a student does need to have a conversation with a professor about any accommodations. ",
            "\u00a0I think Ben at times overestimates my/our experience in the field. I have yet to gain the proficiency I think he sometimes relies on in his questioning. "
