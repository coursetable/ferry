            "\u00a0I learned about anthropological perspectives in cities in Asia and their relationships with socialist and post-colonial regimes.  The course was very valuable and focused on the social-political pressures of cities and delved into a range of social groups. With each reading and discussion session I developed a greater understanding of cities in Asia and implications of mobilities/immobilities. "

            "\u00a0The readings for this course are fantastic and Professor Siu is one of the world's premier urban anthropologists, so the seminar is fantastic. My only slight recommendation would be to devote more time to student-led discussion. Professor Siu's lectures are insightful, but on occasion I wish I had learned more from my peers. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Siu's extremely knowledgeable and clearly passionate about the topic, but we barely discussed the majority of the readings since she spends most of the time talking during seminar. If you're into that kind of teaching style, then definitely go for it. If not, then don't take the course. ",
