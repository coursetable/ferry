            "\u00a0I learned theories of urban planning and city development in addition to learning the important life skills of how to participate in a planning project from a variety of different roles. Learning how these processes might play out in the real world was fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0One thing I learned in taking this course was how to obtain a bank loan to buy a multifamily residential building, evict the existing tenants, renovate the units, and either rent out the units at substantially increased rent or sell the building for a profit. Professor Garvin called this process 'repositioning,'\r\nalthough it seemed to me straight out of the textbook on 'gentrification,' a word that did not come up once in the entire semester. Among the many topics we did not discuss was the entirety of Jane Jacob's urban theory, perhaps the most influential urban theorist ever. Garvin did briefly discuss the work of Planner Robert Moses, including the Hudson Parkway and park and highway infrastructure throughout NYC and Long Island, but conveniently left out the more controversial aspects of Moses's projects, including slum clearing and his documented racist tendencies (see the section of his Wikipedia entry titled \"Racism\"). It was disappointing at best and disturbing at worst. "

            "\u00a0in order to understand what is going on in the class you need to reach out to the TA because we never talked about how to do the homework and it often felt like we needed previous experience to be prepared for the games. I often felt like the students were on their own and it did not feel like a positive environment where we could discuss different ideas about a topic; i feel like we often just got roasted in class ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course. Good amount of work but very interesting and on your own hometown which is great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The Games were an effective way to convey the material while also creating engaging fun in the classroom. The Course generally builds well in its movement across different components (starting with broader things like population growth and economic sectors and moving to more specific things like public space and parks)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like some of the assignments required a lot of legwork and understanding that couldn't be acquired inside of the classroom. Like the technological understanding required for Illustrator projects was a little much as was some of the things for the games. Based on different roles, the games required a vastly different amount of work which seemed somewhat unfair. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interacting role-playing games, Prof. Garvin has a tremendous wealth of knowledge\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: repetitive assignments, repetitive lecture material, too much sharing out of homework/not enough concrete teaching. "

            "\u00a0If you're into cities, urban planning, or real estate this course is a must. Professor Garvin is a legend in the field and getting to hear him and engage with him for a whole semester is an incredible opportunity. The course has some deficiencies, but it's well worth it if you're passionate about the topic. SS ",
            "\u00a0If you want to become a city planner, architect, real estate developer, or a member of any part of government, this is an extremely useful course for you. ",

            "\u00a0I think it's a unique learning opportunity, so if you're interested in the material, sure. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. For a class titled 'study of the city,' we covered almost none of the topics I had expected, including urban theory, policy, or history. Instead classes usually consisted of students sharing information on their hometowns--maps, population graphs, economic charts etc.--and Garvin sharing mainly anecdotal evidence from when he had visited these cities (if you're from Detroit and decide to take this class, don't ever mention the people mover). Needless to say, it gets repetitive very fast. If you're hoping to learn about urbanism, I would recommend Elihu Rubin's course American Architecture and Urbanism instead. It expands on the work of famed architecture historian Vincent Scully and offers an overview of architecture and urban planning in a much more engaging lecture format. "
