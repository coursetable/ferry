            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about the intersection between climate change and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Thoughtful, innovative approach to issue of Climate Change. This course made me understand intricacies of climate policy in a new, fascinating way. Every lecture/discussion was different but ran on the same themes, which developed a thorough understanding of the ethics of climate change. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first political philosophy course I have taken at Yale. It taught me to consider the many ethical challenges involved with mitigating climate change. We discussed the economics of climate change, debated individual responsibilities to fight climate action, and talked about the collective action problem. The class did a great job of creating a framework for what should be considered when evaluating how to move forward with the climate debate. ",
            "\u00a0learned a lot about the ethics behind multiple climate change topics.  also learned more about climate and economy, as well as normative ethics and how to write a paper concerning ethics. "

            "\u00a0The best part of the course were the discussions we had. ASG did a great job of facilitating the discussion and letting everyone's voice be heard. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gajevic Sayegh is extremely dynamic. The small class setting allows thoughtful discussions between students. The reflection papers gave us the opportunity to think about these global issues as individuals, and what our positioning/course of action would look like. Overall - a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor G is a great strength...he is very passionate about the subject and is very organized in his presentation of ideas. This class was intellectually stimulating and introduced me to political philosophy. The subject matter is interesting and workload is very manageable. The major downside is that it took place on Friday from 1:30-3:30, which is never an ideal time. The class is more of a lecture/seminar combo, which was fine by me but not be as interesting to people looking strictly for an intensive seminar. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ! Climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our century - as a Yale student, and future global citizen, you ought to take this course and learn about this fascinating topic. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Even on Fridays, this class was stimulating and fun. Great classroom environment and interesting topic for all. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any students interested in learning more about the ethics and philosophy behind climate change action, particularly those interested in a lecture/seminar combination class with average workload and an enthusiastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, this class is not too much work, but very rewarding and prof. Gajevic is great!  you will learn a lot about ethics and be able to talk about climate change in a new light. "
