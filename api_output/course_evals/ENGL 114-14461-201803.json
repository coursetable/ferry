            "\u00a0How to write an academic paper, analyze the effectiveness of arguments, wade through jargon-filled excerpts from philosophy books, etc. The class revolved less around dopamine and more around cognitive theory; it was a nice blend of psychology, philosophy, and neuroscience. There were some great readings about human evolution, psychedelic drugs, and even gambling addictions. ",
            "\u00a0My writing has greatly improved. I think that before this course, I didn't really understand how to make a logical scientific/research paper or argumentative essay, but this course ensures that you leave with an adequate grasp of quality writing. In only four papers, I've learned how to develop solid claims that are logical, contestable, and have a clear motive. I learned how to develop cohesive arguments while backing them up with sufficient evidence.  I also have better understood myself as a writer. I know what kinds of styles do and do not work for me, and my creativity has been put to the test. I've worked with unfamiliar creative formats and experimented with self-expression. This is certainly not your typical English 114 class- it is so much better. ",
            "\u00a0Learning how to research analyze scientific readings, and write about academic topics. ",
            "\u00a0I became a lot better at making arguments through academic writing, and also contributing verbally to academic discussions ",
            "\u00a0I developed better and more precise writing skills, reading skills, and research skills throughout the course. My topic was Dopamine and Its Discontents and We focused an a variety of readings on cognitive theory, brain function, dopamine and the reward system in the brain, and many more. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Relatively diverse subject matter; a great, broad overview of cognitive theory, the shortcomings of \"folk\" psychology, the intersection of societal norms with deeply ingrained patterns of human behavior, etc. Super interesting; very conducive to a small, discussion-based class. Lots of flexibility about essay topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Because it was so broad, it was sometimes hard to discern the common thread connecting all the readings. Sometimes we'd be reading about one topic and writing a paper about a completely different topic. Some of the questions asked about the readings were also relatively obscure and would prompt several moments of awkward silence from the class, although maybe this is just a feature of seminars. ",
            "\u00a0The subject of the course is incredibly intriguing. Nearly all of the readings (though many were long and rather convoluted) had unique subjects and information that I had never before encountered. It was easy to stay interested in the class, and became even more so when we were allowed to write papers on pretty much any topic we were interested in. The freedom of topic was a major strength of the course in how it allowed each person to individually improve their writing in context of the types of writing they were most drawn to. The class also directed us to wonderful writing resources, such as the CTL, that drastically improved my writing skills. \r\n\r\nThe presentation aspect of the class was also very useful, since it allowed for us to apply the argumentative skills we had learned in context of writing. to the context of speaking.  \r\n\r\nI think that there could be more opportunities for discussion, particularly debate-style discussion. Because many of the readings were difficult to understand at first, I found that I benefited from hearing what others thought of the arguments and how they interpreted it. Also, some of the readings were a little too scientifically/philosophically complicated to be understood - not even understood easily, but just understood at all. I felt that when I put a lot of effort into understanding some of the readings, I understood less and less. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes a bit un engaging during discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Training for academic paper writing, engagement with topics of interest, small seminar-style learning ",
            "\u00a0I think this course helps a lot with breaking down the different tasks of writing a paper and applying them through different different paper topics. It helped a lot with dissecting complex readings and then writing about them. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was engaging but still reasonably laid-back. Great introduction to college-level writing. The instructor and peer feedback was very helpful, the readings were thought-provoking, and the environment didn't feel intimidating at all. The subject matter is broad enough to be interesting to a large variety of people. ",
            "\u00a0This course is probably one of the most rewarding classes you'll take. Not only are you set up with a framework of writing resources and important skills to make quality research papers (both of which will come in handy later in college), but you also have a chance to learn about really interdisciplinary topics in ways you'd never thought of before. The class explores science with a humanities-based lens, so it's good for both STEM and non-STEM majors. If you're interested in neuroscience, cognitive science, or even philosophy, this class is perfect. I suspect that its one of the most unique English 114 courses in that there is so much more to learn and think about than writing. Additionally, Stephen is a really interesting (and quite funny!) professor who knows how to adapt his class to the interests of his students. He gives a lot of freedom to be creative and even encourages bizarre formats. Instead of forcing you to fit a certain model of writing, he helps you become a better writer in your own way. You'll also often leave class pondering about the complexities of the mind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. Especially if the student was interested in science but still wanted to learn how to write. ",
            "\u00a0YES! English 114 really improved my writing skills, and it was great to be able to choose an English 114 topic that was interesting to me. It made writing papers a lot more fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I felt this course strengthened the foundation of my writing skills and will be used as I progress in all my future writings. "
