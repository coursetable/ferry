            "\u00a0This course provides an interesting overview of health and aging research and introduces you to many different topics in the field. It is necessary to do the readings since each class is an interactive discussion, usually led by one or two students or a guest speaker. The final proposal was helpful and interesting to go through the process of writing a mock (or real) research proposal on a topic of your choice related to health and aging.\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to take a short 5-10 minute break during the middle of the class to help keep everyone focused. It may be helpful to start the proposal earlier in the semester, and have each proposal section be due as a smaller assignment (have the Intro be due one week, the Background the next, etc), and then have the final proposal due during finals week. ",
            "\u00a0This was both my favourite and most educational course I took this semester. Well-crafted and well-led by Prof Levy. I think the assessment structure worked well and helped foster a sense of camaraderie in the classroom (given everyone had a presentation). Honestly, the one weakness that jumps to mind was the class led by guest speaker Joan Monin- while far from terrible, I'm not sure what I was supposed to get out of it and probably couldn't tell you 99% of what she said. ",
            "\u00a0I like how this class is in a seminar form so that we can discuss the topic of the week more freely than lecture form. ",
            "\u00a0The order of topics was well constructed and added nuance to one another from week to week. The summary of highlights from last week's discussion at the beginning of the next class helped maintain the connection between each class. I wonder what the class would have been like if we had an extra ten minutes at the end since we often end on the most interesting questions without enough time to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers a phenomenal introduction to aging. Readings were equisite, and the small number of students was fantastic and conducive to great discussion. Highly recommend to everyone with an interest in aging. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it is a great course, introducing many aspects on aging and health. It would be better if there is some introduction on skills and techniques. Also I would love to hear more about her perspectives on every topic, not just let the students lead the class, even I really enjoyed this part. "

            "\u00a0Becca is a wonderful professor, always available and willing to help talk through course content or other topics. Her feedback was helpful and critical, especially with the proposal, and helped me rethink and improve ideas. A few times she brought in current events/news articles, and I think it would have been interesting for us to read more current health and aging research. Her courses built upon each other, and incorporating movies and guest speakers was a nice way for us to learn in different environments. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Levy was great! Very kind and understanding and cares a lot about her field; I appreciated her extensive comments on drafts of our paper and willingness to meet w us if we requested such ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I have no advice for Prof Levy to improve her teaching- she was articulate, inquisitive and was available to meet up if need be. Only praise from me. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this seminar very much. Dr. Levy valued everyone's contributions in class and the readings she selected were very informative as well. She also provides good feedback on writing assignments and is very approachable outside of regular class time. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Levy is very supportive and helpful in helping us developing our proposal or presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Becca is - hands down - the most caring professor I have had during my time at YSPH. Her expertise is incredible, and her willingness to help and meet with studentsis so appreciated. Her syllabus is carefully crafted, and her encouragement is unparalleled. ",
            "\u00a0She is the best instructor I met in this semester. Her feedbacks to students are so detailed and helpful. "

            "\u00a0Health & Aging was an interactive, discussion-based course that provided an interesting overview of different issues, research, and policies in the field of aging. Aging and health is the focus, but the research proposal (on a topic of your choice) and teaching a week's session (designing the curriculum and leading that week's class) provide an opportunity to develop valuable teaching skills and practice developing an original research project.

            "\u00a0This is an excellent class if you are interested in aging, working with aging people, or simply curious about aging. ",
            "\u00a0In a setting where there is minimal exposure to people who are not 18-28, a class on health and aging is necessary on a personal, societal, and national/global level. Aging is a phenomenon that happens to everyone, and has a role in everything from demographics to laws and policies. This class provides both the width and depth on aging in the 21st century. "
