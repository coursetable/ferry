            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about the state of research in an area I am unfamiliar with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about the history and theoretical perspectives of emotion and emotion regulation. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course, I finally understand the distinction between different major emotion theories. I also have a much more solid grasp of the history of emotion research and fundamental papers that have contributed to various sub-domains of the field. The course covered a wide range of topics, and it is helpful to have at least some knowledge of many topics related to emotion research. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided an opportunity to think critically about the theoretical debate within the field of emotion theory and its empirical basis. I appreciated the chance to read seminal work and believe that I learned a lot by having to synthesize and then analyze the intellectual and empirical merit of major questions within the field. I also grew in my ability to understand how recent advances in methodology both supports and challenges these differing theoretical frameworks. Additionally, this course encouraged me to learn about and write about open research questions within the field of emotion research. Through the assignments I deepened my knowledge and am excited to continue to build upon this! "

            "\u00a0I liked being able to self-pace, however, given other demands, it may be useful to have one of the essays due mid-semester and the other due at finals period just to help space out the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nChoice of readings was quite good- they were helpful and informative.\r\nGreat breadth of knowledge covered by the readings\r\nEssay topics required critical thinking, enabled an in-depth understanding of emotion theory and chosen sub-topic \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nWould have benefited from in-class discussion of some of these topics, in terms of improving learning and being engaged in the course. \r\nEnded up being just as much work as a normal course without the benefit of learning in-class, asking questions, and building a relationship with a professor \r\nThe self-scheduling nature of the course was helpful at times, but also due to having an incredibly busy schedule, work for this course often was the first thing to be cut from the schedule. This made it so that there was a ton of reading and writing at the very end of the semester, which was stressful and not conducive to best work/ learning. Though I take full responsibility for allowing the work to build up at the end, I think that it is somewhat an expected consequence of not having a protected time slot for class each week--without class time and weekly homework, it is hard to prioritize work that isn't due in the near future. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating essay topics, independent structure, thoughtfully curated reading list\r\nWeaknesses: potentially more engaging materials beyond readings (e.g. videos of talks or books by lead researchers) "

            "\u00a0I would but I might suggest them to think very deeply about when would be best to take the course! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a useful, informative way to complete requirements for clinical graduate students. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. The content of the course was quite good, and having the flexibility was nice (though see weaknesses listed above). However, I think there are major advantages of taking a class in the traditional format in terms of balancing work and increased opportunities for discussion, questions, and feedback, all of which facilitate learning. Also, I think it would make a lot more sense to take this course the summer after first year as opposed to spring semester of first year. Since first year project is such a big priority and takes up so much time, I think taking the course after that is done with would help with time management and avoiding all of the work building up at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course provides a compelling overview of the major areas of debate within emotion theory and surveys important topics in emotion research for any student hoping to build a strong foundation. "
