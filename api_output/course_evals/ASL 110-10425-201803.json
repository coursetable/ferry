            "\u00a0I learned the basic vocabulary of ASL and how to communicate. I also learned about deaf culture. I feel like I gained a good understanding of vocabulary that is actually useful in a day to day context. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a fairly large vocabulary of signs and the basic tenants of grammar to use them effectively. The course also covered a lot of material related to Deaf culture and the linguistic information that ASL can provide. ",
            "\u00a0Self confidence! ASL is a very emotive and expressive language, and sometimes, especially in the beginning it was difficult to go in front of the class and present, using the full emotions expected in ASL. However over time, especially due to Professor Tanner's patience, I became more comfortable and confident in presenting, and I'm sure my classmates can say the same! ",
            "\u00a0I can now have a full conversation in ASL which is pretty cool! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of American Sign Language vocabulary (including units on basic conversation, education, occupations, landscape and households, leisure activities, countries and states, numbers and time, personality, and appearance) as well as some other ASL fundamentals (like the five parameters of sign, non-manual markers, and classifiers) and a bit about Deaf culture.

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing instructor, Jessica Tanner is one of the best professors at Yale.\r\nEngaging material and fun activities, tests that aligned with what was taught in class very well\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Does not follow the syllabus very much so difficult to know what's coming ahead of time ",
            "\u00a0The class is tight-knit, making it much more comfortable to sign to fellow classmates. Also, everyone in the course is passionate about learning and using ASL, further building a positive class community. Professor is constantly challenging us to use what we know and have fun with it. This course is honestly the highlight of my day. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses or room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how interactive the course was throughout the semester. It was great working with partners, and having regular presentations was awesome practice. I love how we can learn from each other and learn additional vocabulary outside of the regular unit. Weaknesses? None. ",
            "\u00a0I wish grades were clearer. We only really got grades for our exams. ",
            "\u00a0In general I thought the course was very well-taught! Professor Tanner makes it really fun and engaging while also teaching a lot of material. I did feel like the course was a lot more challenging in the beginning than closer to the end, so it could be good to move ever-so-slightly slower at first while students are still getting used to fingerspelling, and then a bit faster towards the end when we've figured out how to study the language effectively. Another thing was that it was difficult to check how to sign various things because there are a lot of conflicting resources online, so it would have been helpful to go over which websites were better. ",
            "\u00a0Class time was a joy, everyday I was excited to continue where we had left the previous day. Class activities were fun and great practice, and Professor Tanner made sure that everyone understood new concepts before moving on. We had opportunities outside of class, but I would have liked more opportunities to sign with other students for more conversational practice. "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend. As a first year, this was my most engaging and fun course and a great introduction to language at Yale. Jessica Tanner is a fantastic professor and you are missing out if you don't get the chance to engage with her. She is incredibly knowledgable and patient. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because ASL is a really fun language to learn and Professor Tanner does an amazing job teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Very good course and Professor Tanner is AMAZING! I feel like I learned so much and can actually communicate at a high level. ",
            "\u00a012/10 recommend. Professor Tanner is so engaging, welcoming, and patient. She has an amazing personality that always makes me look forward to coming to class. She is eager to teach everyone and I learned much more than I thought I would in a single semester. She is very understanding and accomodating, and she is a genuine person. The class content is fun and I learned so much! ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in learning a new language! I shopped it on a whim, having already fulfilled my language requirement and just looking for a fun seminar to complement all my large lectures, but I am so glad that I ended up taking it. I looked forward to class every single day-- which is saying something for a course that meets five days a week! I did feel like I was falling behind at the beginning of the semester sometimes, because it was a huge adjustment to have to pay such close attention to the instructor throughout the whole class period, and after going through the alphabet twice we relied entirely on sign and fingerspelling to communicate during class. But once I started practicing more with classmates and I got comfortable with fingerspelling, I was able to catch up, and the rest of the semester was challenging but definitely doable. Professor Tanner is really awesome too-- she works hard to make every class engaging and fun, and she loves to make jokes. She's no-nonsense but very supportive and just wants everyone to have a good time learning ASL. I also loved how our small class bonded over the course of the semester. The workload for the class was not very large-- the biggest task outside of class was just independent studying (and I would recommend teaming up with classmates to review briefly after every class, as it made such a huge difference). After vocab days, a typical assignment might be \"create and practice signing 5 sentences using education vocab,\" and then we would present them in class the next day. We also had 3 unit quizzes testing comprehension of vocab and concepts, and a midterm and final project involving filming ourselves signing a story using vocab (those were actually pretty fun because we got to be creative). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student with the slightest interest in sign language or deaf culture. Besides the joy of learning the language, dipping my toes into the world of the deaf community was more enriching than I ever could have imagined. "
