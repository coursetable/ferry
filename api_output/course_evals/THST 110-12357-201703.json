            "\u00a0Very few. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a genuine survey of theater and drama, and I left it with a good understanding, albeit cursory, of all of theater history up to the 1600's. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of Historiography of theater and performance, deeper ability to analyze texts, understanding of the universal origins of theatre/theater and performance, and more. ",
            "\u00a0THST110 is a fascinating introduction to the origins of theater history, building up to the 18th century, and all the plays/performances/rituals between. This class is also made more interesting by emphasizing the role of 'adaptation' and performance. Since early theater pieces have existed for hundreds to thousands of years, it makes sense that it's time to start adapting pieces to make relevant public points. Because of this, I have a better insight to how theater can be purposefully reworked over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about the nature of adaptation and the relation of historiography in theater history. It's been fascinating tracking the origins of theater in different cultures. The studio performances were the best part--helped solidify our learning and put it into practice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ancient theater. We read many plays from before 1700, and read many essays about theatrical theory. We learned about many interesting cultures along the way, such as ancient Sanskrit and Edo Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0I am coming out of this course with what I assume to be a solid overview of the development of theater globally through time, familiar with key genres and art forms that emerged through time and their relation to each other. I learned valuable skills with regards to analyzing theater both as performance and as literature, and found the scene studies and studio performances helpful in this regard. I have come away with a more expansive definition of theater and the role of theater. ",
            "\u00a0As with THST110, we covered a great range of theatrical history. I was also able to work on adaptations; both in writing about others and developing my own in section. ",
            "\u00a0Theater 110 gave me strong foundational knowledge about the history of theater. The class approached this history comprehensively, and included non-Western theater and theory. This element of the course was particularly important to me, as the focus on purely Western forms of theatermaking can be limited to the works of European white men, and female and POC writers are often excluded from the discussion. Thankfully, this class included those critical perspectives, which gave me powerful insight into identifying the characteristics of drama through a more all-encompassing lens. Not only did I develop a knowledge of the figures who have provided the building blocks of the shows most pervasive to modern understanding of theatricality, but the course allowed me to describe how adaptation can be a method of historiography. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to recognize the role of adaptation as a historiographical tool, as well as an appreciation for the role of history in shaping the theatrical canon. I learned a great deal about the historical contexts of the works we studied and a working knowledge of the theatrical canon. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the history of theatricality as well as the arguments surrounding it. I also found a new understanding of adaptation and how it provides insight into cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about adaptations and different plays. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good overview of ancient theater and performance styles. ",
            "\u00a0A good overall knowledge of the beginning periods of theater history. ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my understanding of ancient theatrical forms and early plays. The course provided a global perspective, looking at theater in indigenous cultures. ",
            "\u00a0My depth of knowledge of theater beyond western culture was greatly expanded and my knowledge of the different forms of theater also grew. My insight into different perspectives of theaters also under went development. I read many play from different time periods and places as well as several treatises on the art of theater. Through synthesizing this knowledge my appreciation of theater as an expressive form of art and cultural commentary came into being. "

            "\u00a0Weakness: Too much in too little time. The studio performances in the sections were unnecessary and we should have only had one of them. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is its continual tying together of theater/performance to adaptation or to general historical context. I feel like I've not only learned a lot about theater history, but also about the history and time periods during which this theater was developing. This class is able to cover the development of performance across multiple places on the globe, without being extremely disorienting. Other strengths include the midterm/final (neither were extremely difficult, but still test your knowledge and application of the material), the sections (which were productive discussions), the use of the midterm paper (which prepares you for the final paper), and the final studio performance projects (which allow you to use adaptation for yourself).\r\n\r\nOne improvement might be for the studio performance, the final paper, and the final to be spaced just a little bit more; having three large things to do at the end of the semester is a lot, so this might relieve a little stress. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Cover a lot of material! Loved the studio performances--solidified what we learned over the semester through practice.\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had gone more in depth into particular cultures. Additionally, a more timeline emphasis between theater emergences in different cultures would have been helpful. It would also be fantastic if there were connections drawn between theater in different cultures. I would love if there was more time spent on our studio performances. ",
            "\u00a0I found myself to be very bored with reading plays that were so old. The language was very difficult to understand, and I did not enjoy the plays themselves. However, it is good to have this foundation moving forward into further study of theater. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't cover any older Eastern European or African drama, which seems like an oversight. Professor Morrison's approach to \"theater history\" was one of the strongest elements of this course, in that she made older theater relevant with modern adaptations. This gave me an appreciation for the significance of learning theater history, and engaged me in the course. The assignments, tests, etc. were all well-timed and at an appropriate workload for an introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0We were able to cover a great deal of content, important for the foundations of theater history. However, because of this we had to move quickly through each period which didn't allow us to delve too deeply into any one period. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in the coursework; it is truly a class in which one gets out what they put in. If you read the assigned plays and essays, you will come away from the class with a solid foundation in classic theater genres. However, at the same time, some of the assigned plays are unrealistic for the time that a student can devote to the homework of a single subject. Additionally, the class would benefit from a more expressly defined set of expectations. For instance, the final paper lacks explicit definition of the parameters by which the professor/TFs will be grading it. The final project is a really good way to get a practical theater element into the class and to learn from your peers, but clear guidance on the first of the two projects especially would result in a more refined final product. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a great deal of historical context and information, but lacked in analysis of the theatrical works we read, even in section discussions. I would have appreciated a greater application of how historical characteristics and trends applied to each specific work, and how the theories of each time period affected the works themselves. While we read some fascinating theoretical works, it would've been nice to discuss them in class and trace their development across history, including their discourse with one another--for instance, how each commented on Aristotle's POETICS in some way. ",
            "\u00a0The studio performance aspect was incredible, and the essays were engaging to write. Sometimes the organization could have been improved in terms of essay prompts and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it became a little monotonous, and some of the lectures were hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0It's an informative course, but a little too broad and survey oriented for my taste! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very insightful and provided interesting discussions of the topics provided, though I felt that the sections were unnecessary, and often consisted of one or two people discussion the plays with the teaching fellow. ",
            "\u00a0The course really gave a balanced and diverse offering of the primary texts that we read. It gave a student the opportunity to appreciate theater in a more intellectual and cultural context. The style of using adaptions as a focus within the classes study also gave good new perspectives. However, I often found the readings more interesting than the lectures and did not feel a lot of interest in participating in the class discussions. It often felt like dry lectures "

            "\u00a0If necessary for the major, and only if. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a genuine Survey of Theater and Drama. Prof. Morrison is fantastic. Take the class-- you'll learn an enormous amount and it's about as much work as you put into it. Don't waste the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0100%, this course is a phenomenal introduction to the history of performance, and dabbles in philosophy, identity and the like. Its a wonderful survey of pre-1900 CE drama. ",
            "\u00a0I extremely recommend this class to anyone, even those not interested in the theater studies major (this is one of the prerequisites to the major). This class gives you a fascinating outlook on the history of performance, and there's multiple ways you can be involved in the scene studies or studio performances besides acting. This class gives you a great grasp on theater from all angles before pursuing more theater, or before heading out into the world (because life is theater!). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if the student was interested in ancient theater and wanted to be a theater major, as it is a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - and particularly with Professor Morrison's emphasis on adaptation and historiography. This course doesn't cover anything in-depth enough to be of interest to non-majors, but for majors it is definitely a solid foundation in various approaches to theater and meanings of theater through time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would because I do think that the class provides a good basis of understanding for the theater studies major as a field of literary analysis, with the caveat that the class' practical element is relatively small. ",
            "\u00a0Its a really engaging course if you like theater. ",
            "\u00a0Good for theater majors or anyone who wants a survey of ancient theater. ",
            "\u00a0If you like survey history courses, it's a solid and interesting theater history course. ",
            "\u00a0I would most likely only recommend this course to a theater major to fulfill the theater requirement, as the information gleaned from this course could have well been done through individual reading, however I did not mind taking this class to fill the requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they truly have passion for theater as an intellectual pursuit on top of its nature as an art form. "
