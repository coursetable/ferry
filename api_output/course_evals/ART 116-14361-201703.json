            "\u00a0I learned about the interaction of color, how colors are not rigid but shift wildly based on their environment. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a brilliant insight into how Color is multiplicitous, that how Color is employed and assembled carries different meanings and creates different contexts for work to be read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about color theory. ",
            "\u00a0First through Joseph Albers' exercises and then through sculpture and video, I learned about the interaction of color in the traditional sense as well as the interaction of light and color and colored light and shadow. ",

            "\u00a0This course was excellent overall. I would have enjoyed a little less structure in the later Albers pieces we created for homework. ",
            "\u00a0GREAT course! Just the right amount of work and engagement. I loved the structure of the course - starting with albers and getting more and more abstract. Anna and Julia were both great. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very exciting and well taught. At times, it felt slightly directionless but was overall an awesome course. ",
            "\u00a0This class has many different strengths: it addresses the study of color from many different  sources (color in nature, light, its relationship to material, etc.) and has very engaging assignments. I can think of no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course's largest strength was professor betbeze, who's the best. ",
            "\u00a0Anna Betbeze created the perfect balance in the curriculum, providing just the right number of readings, classroom assignments, and homework assignments. She was very supportive of all students, no matter what level art experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great if you want to explore an integral aspect of art, even if you have no prior training in art. It has interesting projects throughout the semester, though you'll get tired of cutting tiny pieces of paper by the end of it. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a great low-stress environment for playing with color and light. Readings and projects are interesting and useful. Weaknesses are that few of the pieces from this class could be used in a portfolio and within the classroom there is not a lot of structure to keep people on task. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. Not very much work and tons of fun. You'll learn a lot no matter what your background, and you'll get a nice creative break from your other classes. If you can get in, you MUST take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in art. It changes / broadens the way you think about color and gives you an understanding of the subtlety of its interactions. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to both art majors and non-art majors. It is a low-stress environment to play with the interactions and meanings of colors. The class environment is great and usually in class, we just talk or work on projects. The class briefly explores colors in relation to science, literature, film, and history. Anna is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in taking a different learning approach to color theory. The class will challenge a student's perception of color and will set them with new skills that make them appreciate color as a medium of its own. An overall excellent class that added to my own artistic knowledge. "
