            "\u00a0The critique format is both a strength and a weakness; it's what makes this class so practical and useful but it can also be improved in a few ways.\r\n1. Promoting psychological safety. There should be some ground rules or some norms we set in the beginning of the course to ensure that these very public critiques don't end up being more discouraging than helpful. Part of this is just the way we engage and talk to each other. Another part is setting norms like, \"make space/take space\" to make sure that people who dominate the convo remember to make space for others who typically don't engage. I appreciated that Rodrigo kept track of this himself (i.e., who was participating) so he could do this himself but its helpful if everyone know those are the ground rules.\r\n2. Making sure everyone reads each others critiques. This is difficult to add on to everyone else but its best to have these critiques if we can ALL engage and some weeks it felt like it was just a one on one convo and the rest of us weren't engaged or even listening. I think if we aren't going to have time to discuss the readings some weeks anyway, we could just cut those and instead have everyone at least skim each other's assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think that overall the course is very constructive for understanding and developing theory. I think that the main thing that would have made this course better is more feedback from Rodrigo after the assignments. With that being said, I understand that Rodrigo is under tremendous time pressure this semester and that there are more important things he should focus on. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It seems to be the only course of its kind, so anyone who wants to work on developing theory could benefit from taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, incredibly helpful in getting us to think about how theories are built and critically engaging with our own work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot and I feel like this course is important as a socialization tool into the discipline's way of grasping theory. "
