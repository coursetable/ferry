            "\u00a0This course gave me an overview of various critiques of feminist work as well as of economic or cultural globalization (in addition to dissecting the term \"globalization\"). There were case studies and lots of straight information provided which I now understand as essential to WGSS scholarship. Seeing how process of colonization affect (or conspicuously \"do not affect\") contemporary modes of Western feminism has helped me to develop critical skills in hearing about \"feminism.\" I have also come to understand the depth of context and information required for research in WGSS. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about inequality globally/transnationally/locally but more importantly learned to work on my critical lens for approaching discourse. This class does not give answers so much as provoke discomfort. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various perspectives of the effects of globalization, and the production of knowledge/discourse surrounding globalization theories. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think there should be more queer theory, but I think, overall, the course is good! Also, I would like more practical applications and case studies. I think theory is important, but many people in WGSS want to use their knowledge in a practical manner after Yale, so I think moving towards that approach, while still getting to learn theory would be extremely effective. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and structure of the course were great. I have heard that this course doesn't work for quieter WGSS classes, but our class was very communicative and cooperative. Presenting in teams was helpful. An issue with student-led discussions is that sometimes we would circle around the same territory repeatedly, and an intervention from Pr Dowe would have been helpful. \"Readings\" from more varied media (i.e. art etc) would have been appreciated in a field which claims to uphold the value of \"alternative\" forms of knowledge production/communication. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong. Quicker feedback would have helped keep the class focused. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the readings were well picked and carefully chosen, I learned a lot from each one, the extra readings were also very meaningful. An improvement could be having more introduction to the readings and themes of the course from the instructor, since some readings were more difficult to engage with. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked it professor Dowe led the class more and we had less student facilitation. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a helpful progression for WGSS majors in that all of its theory is grounded in real case studies. It equips you with the skills needed to hear information and think twice, three times, four times, etc. It also gives students a useful critical vocabulary around global feminisms and pulls apart the idea of relative morality/activism/culture. Pr Dowe is very mindful of how much reading he assigns and allows students to pursue their own interests within the course topics. Pr Dowe gives strong and considered feedback on writing, and incorporates writing workshops into his classes. He is also mindful of how to best engage students, e.g. by using meditation at the beginning of classes. He is also very willing to engage outside of class and give feedback on work, and is open to creative paths within academia. ",
            "\u00a0I do not know if this class is open to majors outside WGSS, but this class is incredible (so long as you are willing to have your beliefs challenged) and benefits a lot for the small class size. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who has an interest in the globalization of ideas of gender, and the effects of globalization on gender. I would, however, recommend this to a student who already has some background analyzing dense theory and text, and has taken other WGSS classes before. Having a base understanding of these concepts were crucial. "
