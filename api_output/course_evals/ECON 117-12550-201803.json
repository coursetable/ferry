            "\u00a0If you have previous stats/coding experience, the class is pretty slow for the first three or four weeks. The psets are pretty easy (with the exception of one that is very much based in theory as opposed to programming). The exams were pretty different from the homework, so a lot of people really struggled with it, but the curve makes it so that it's pretty hard to do badly in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think coding in R is hard, the examinations were hard and the lectures were very pointless. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no strengths. It's weaknesses are many. The goal of the class is to teach students both statistics and how to use R and neither of these things are done well. Professor Ryan speeds through statistical without any explanation and then jumps right into R. Then, the exams are all questions that need to be completed by hand without R. I do not understand how students are supposed to learn how to do these calculations by hand when we have only been taught how to do them in R. With regards to R, although Professor Ryan spends a lot of time showing R outputs to the class and analyzing them, he never actually shows students how to code. I had never coded before this class (it's not a prerequisite) and I literally did not even know what coding was. I had to look everything up online to complete the problem sets. Because students learn nothing in lecture, it is completely useless to go. I went to every lecture and I truly feel my time would have been better spent doing anything other than sitting in this lecture. If lecture is bad, section is worse. In theory, the TA's are supposed to run labs in R with the class. The TA's often do not have the materials and forget how to do things, so most of the class is spent trouble shooting instead of actually learning. In addition, none of the statistical material is covered in section. I'm not sure how learning how to code statistical equations in R is supposed to be useful if we do not even know what the statistical valuations we are coding mean. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the content is relevant, TFs were very responsive, problem sets/examples were relevant and helpful, ex: it was cool to evaluate the gender pay gap, race discrimination in the workplace, climate change, etc \r\nWeaknesses- lecture focuses on theory but we were evaluated on applications... lecture should be more applied, this course draws a competitive bunch that often didn't help one another (or collectively chose to cheat on quizzes, for example), course expectations were often unclear/shifting... ex: due dates for problem sets were moved, TFs often weren't informed on these things, it got confusing ",

            "\u00a0Professor Ryan is a great professor, devoted to his students. I felt the material could be dry at times but this may be due to the vast array of notation for slightly differentiated topics. When it comes together, it's pretty nice skillset to acquire. A weakness was the online quiz which encouraged cheating--I felt that penalized students who completed the test honestly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Ryan is a great lecturer, sometimes can get a bit fast but always willing to take a question (although sometimes I wish he wouldn't). He clearly cares about students and wants them to succeed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As a fairly new class, some of the scheduling was a little messed up, causing a Pset to be due before we were taught the content of the pset. This was incredibly frustrating and left me discourage with the class some. I think they need to work on their pset/quiz schedule and make a way to make section more useful, because it's utility decreases as the semester went forward. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The combination of by hand learning and R makes the class very applicable. The in class case studies made the material a lot more digestible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For an introductory course, there was a TON of a material. It was often overwhelming because if I didn't understand something in one lecture then I was lost for the following lectures as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course had well-organized and well-presented lectures. However, I felt as though there was a gap between the class's level of understanding and the expectations of the TFs and professor. While the final exam was very fair, the midterm was insanely difficult compared to the types of problems we had been introduced to in class. Also, in reviews and in section, the TFs would also present information at a level of detail/conceptual difficulty that was often confusing and unnecessary to appreciate the concepts we learned in lecture. That being said, the TFs worked very hard at being available to students during office hours, section, and on Piazza. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TA's try to help a fair amount; psets are worth 30%, and you can do well if you just work hard and get help\r\nWeaknesses: so much material, lectures not that easy to understand without prior knowledge ",
            "\u00a0The only redeeming quality of this course was that the lecture slides were comprehensive. Lecture itself was impossible to follow, and Prof. Ryan has a tendency to explain things in the most counterintuitive way possible. ",
            "\u00a0weaknesses: tests much harder than the material explained and the examples show in class - has to be curved a lot, could be more help understanding R in the beginning\r\n\r\nstrengths: TFs available often during office hours to answer questions, 2 weeks to do each pset was helpful ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was about as well-run as it could have been. Lectures were by-and-large interesting, filled with case studies and funny comments from Professor Ryan that made the material easier to understand and lectures easier to sit through. The tests were reasonable and there were many practice tests and other test materials to help in review. While the psets were difficult, the TA's did a good job of addressing all questions on Piazza and making them as clear as possible. The material was explained clearly, and I think my only improvement would be to spend more time on the more difficult post-midterm material of regressions, instrumental variables, etc. and maybe move through random variables and expectation functions more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0One major flaw of this course is that the PSETs and class materials do not seamlessly integrate well. The lectures did not really prepare you for the PSETs and the PSETs did not really help in preparing you for the exams. It helps in the sense that you recognize the output format, but besides that, it doesn't really help. The notation in the class is very dense and often hard to understand. Many of the concepts I've learned before in a much more intuitive way, but that sort of insight was not provided by this class because it heavily relied on confusing notation. While learning R was something I was excited to do, I was sick of R by the end of the course especially the times when the Ryan would run code on the screen. It was very hard to follow and did not enhance learning in any way.\r\n\r\nAnother major flaw of the course is the restriction of calculators during exams. Very simple calculations that would take a matter of seconds on a standard graphing calculator were drawn out to take at least 5 minutes because of the lack of memory on the non-graphing calculators. It leaves a ton of room for error since you have to transcribe and write down every output the calculator gives you before typing in a new calculation. This ends up making the exams difficult, not due to the material, but due to the time constraint and ample room for erroneously writing the wrong number on your paper. ",
            "\u00a0The data we look at this course is very interesting. However, lectures are very confusing and do not help with the problem sets at all. Material seems to be presented in a way much more difficult than it needs to be. Midterms and finals were also pretty difficult and seemed like it didn't give a fair assessment of what we had learned. There also seemed to be some organizational issues, which is to be expected since it was the first time this course had been taught. By and large though, people were generally confused and frustrated in doing the work for this class. ",
            "\u00a0strength: great overview of econometrics, and nice combination of real world cases/working with data and straight theory\r\nweakness: disorganized, theory was poorly taught, and sloppily explained ",
            "\u00a0tests are too hard ",
            "\u00a0Pretty low morale, as past evaluations have pointed out. The lecture slides are enough to study from, but it gets tedious. Emphasis on R is a mistake, as I learned more about coding than econometrics; it should be the other way around, teaching econometrics using R as a tool, not a means. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- well organized to facilitated student learning \r\n- used current events to help put the importance of the course material in perspective\r\n- professor Ryan facilitated learning -- he was very passionate \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- there was not too much practice material to prepare for the exams (though this was likely due to the fact that course was new)\r\n- the PSETS were primarily based in R,  whereas the exams did not have much a focus on that (though I liked this aspect, other students that are more data oriented may have not) ",
            "\u00a0More R can be introduced and less time going over simple concepts. ",

I feel as though the online Quizzes could be improved to better resemble problem sets or exam questions. Also, is it bad that we don't learn Stata? I know that Stata is an industry standard. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths -  lecture is great! The professor teachers very well and class presentations are comprehensive such that you can learn the basics of the material even if you don't go to lecture. Going to lecture really helps to understand all that's going on though so you should probably go.\r\n- We get two weeks to complete each p-set and a online quiz (on-sitting but no time limit) quiz on the weeks when a p-set isn't due. The p-set's are very doable. They consist of a coding portion in R and a written/computational part - the TA's were a great help in doing the homework and understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: organized, useful material\r\nWeaknesses: could be taught in a more intuitive way, would appreciate much more practice with problems and R ",
            "\u00a0It can be improved by posting old midterm or final answers earlier. Students have other tests and lives so you can't just provide practice the night before the exam, please this should be obvious. It can be improved by giving students NOT GRADED practice- quizzes and sets aren't gonna help because they're graded so students must focus on the grade. It is two courses in one- R and stats. The professor teaches with notation/words as if you already know econometrics/stats so it's difficult to learn in lectures. The TAs are very helpful though. There was not much practice at the beginning either and no textbook. The TAs are the only resource to learn which stinks. Or the internet. Lectures were worthless. Once I stopped attending, I started learning more by using the time to google topics instead. ironic. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the breadth of material covered, the teaching fellows, and the variety in the data sets. In terms of weaknesses, I think that often grading for problem sets was unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Having average difficulty psets once every two weeks was a nice pace and made the workload pretty chill, so that's a plus. The psets and examples in class also often touched on interesting topics (racism, climate change, female labor force, etc.) so that was a nice way to keep things relevant! The lectures were good and concepts were not too difficult to understand if you put in the time to review them. The only thing is that the exams were pretty different from the practice materials (either in style of question or because 117 covers less than its predecessor version [131] and a lot of 131 material was used as practice materials), which threw us off a bit and was a little annoying. ",

            "\u00a0Nice to learn R, but they deport explain it enough in class for the level of difficulty of the psets. You're on your own with R. ",
            "\u00a0TERRIBLE - DO NOT RECOMMEND. It is confusing and horribly taught and so time consuming. And the people who have taken Stat before or know R have such an unfair disadvantage all semester long. The TAs are nice though! ",

The plus side of this is that the course was fast paced and covered a lot of great material. The downside was that, for someone like me, it was incredibly challenging. \r\nI feel like the course had a good trajectory from start to end, everything we learned following logically from a gap in the previous thing we learned. This is something  I only recognize in hindsight, but nevertheless well done. \r\nI feel like the R side of the class was pretty inadequately taught. There was never any real guidance besides \"here's a function, use it\". The course is advertised as no coding experience required, which I think is a blatant fiction. Having a basic understanding of coding syntax is essential, and it was incredibly challenging to grasp right off the bat. \r\nFurthermore, the grading on psets seems a little weird. It looks like only specific questions on every pset are actually graded, with large portions of it being ignored. Not only does this lead to an inadequate reflection of my knowledge, but it also means I don't get feedback on the whole pset, so I don't know if I did it right or not. \r\nOverall, I think the course needs improving, but as it's a new course that's understandable. I think, given a few years, this could grow to be one of the best courses at Yale, purely based on its content and course arc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that plenty of real econometric papers and datasets are used, though the exams are suddenly a lot harder than usual assignments. ",
            "\u00a0There was little room to practice and learn. It would be helpful if lecture was more engaging and there were more practice problems throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The design of the course is great in practice. It assumes no prior knowledge of any statistics or coding. But realistically, expectations were extremely unclear. The problem sets were due every other week in R, and often times were not directly related to the theory we learned. We zoomed past the theory; that was fine, given that you really needed only the \"what\"  the end formula, the definition in problem sets, but often on tests we were tested deeply on the theoretical stuff. This would have been fine if expectations were clear, and if there was ample and relevant practice/past tests, but in the both in the midterm and the final that was not the case. The strength of the class was definitely the data sets we used. A ton of high-profile and big-name data sets were used in problem sets, and if you're at all interested in the conclusions of some of the major, major economic studies of our time and how people got there (Raj Chetty on inequality, for example), some of the problem sets will actually be a treat. ",
            "\u00a0Since this was the first time that this course was ever run, it is understood that it would have some flaws. Although I believe that the course in its entirety was well structured, most of the topics that were featured failed to be fully explained and developed. For example we spent only two lectures on a concept as basic as hypothesis testing. I felt that sometimes the professor did not fully realize the workload that he assigned as. Even tough most of the problem sets were pretty easy and helped us to apply the concepts that we learned very well, a few of them (mainly referring to problem set 5) were extremely hard for no particular reason. This had as a result for some students to just directly copy the answers from the Teaching Assistants, and then the rest of the students just to copy off their answers from these few, since literally no one was able to figure out the particular exercises. I felt like problem sets like these caused us more stress and hardship instead of helping us learn anything new. Despite the above, the TAs were all stellar and very helpful although I would have preferred to see more native English speakers, because some times I had difficulty understanding what they were saying. Finally, I really appreciated the generous curves of the final and midterms. ",

Furthermore, it goes as far as explaining the fundamentals of model building and fitting for data analysis, with the hopes of not only understanding what's going on but imparting the tools for further data exploration. The weaknesses are that R is not taught very thoroughly, and is rather a teach-yourself sort of thing. The TAs do a good job of walking through it, but it requires going to a lot of office hours. Having prior coding experience is definitely a plus. ",

The lectures have many examples from recent economic researches that emphasize the theoretical concepts being in covered in an introductory course. The course also has a lot of available help from TFs and was taught at a slower pace than normal. I think the course could be improved by having better psets that are more relevant to the tests. The course syllabus could also follow a textbook to make it easier for students to have independent studying. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, but only because econometrics is required for economics major. ",
            "\u00a0It is good for basic coding skills but they do not teach you how to code. They drop you in the deep end and you either learn or drop. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to students studying Economics and even to those studying other social sciences, as the methods of understanding and working with data is excellently taught in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - econometrics/data analysis is very applicable and Professor Ryan is an effective instructor! ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend it if you need it for the major. It was difficult and not too interesting. I also recommend either learning R or taking an intro Stats class beforehand, because it is difficult to keep up with the class with no background in either. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend the course to all students interested in development economics, data analysis, evidence-based decision making. "
