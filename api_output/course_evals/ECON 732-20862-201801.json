He lectured a development theory on every Tuesday and its empirical approach on every Thursday, which is good.  \r\nWeakness is we did not have much time to understand classes since the theories were advanced theories to some extent. Sometimes we did not follow the theories due to time constraint. Materials were not uploaded on canvas so that we could not catch up his classes. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how the course introduced us to various models around development economics and also took us through empirical papers using some parts of those models. I feel that there was too much to learn in one class while we were doing the models because we weren't really walked through the model very thoroughly. ",
