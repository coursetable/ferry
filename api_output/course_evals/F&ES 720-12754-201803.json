I've taken other statistics programming courses in the past, and while I enjoyed how flexible and hands-off this course was (in terms of teaching ourselves the program using SWIRL lessons),  I sometimes wish that Simon had lectured a bit more (which he did towards the end of the semester, which was appreciated).

This was in pleasant contrast to prior programming courses I'd taken where students with little background were often thrown into the deep end right at the start. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nI thought the labs were very simple. A slightly more challenging problem set every week would have been welcome. ",

            "\u00a0SWIRL lessons were fun - and I enjoyed the encouraging notes and feedback.  The ability to learn from and correct our homework assignments was also incredibly helpful and appreciated  :). I do wish that the course had a bit more lecturing / instruction from Simon - perhaps he could take us through an exercise after running through the lecture's notes (I would have been fine with doing SWIRLS outside of class if it had meant more time and instruction). Similarly, I learned a lot doing the homework assignments / labs, but often felt like I wasn't equipped with all of the information needed to complete them from just the lesson notes and SWIRL notes alone, which made completing the assignments sometimes challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized. The structure of lecture then practice worked really well! ",
            "\u00a0The SWIRLs, labs, and Friday bootcamps were very helpful to learn the material at your own pace, with instant feedback, and with real hands-on practice. Compared to other coding courses where we sit and listen to a lecture on how to code, a big strength of this course was the ability to learn by doing R labs and SWIRLs instead of only listening to a lecture. The data project was also a good learning experience, and I appreciated how it was flexible and could be tailored to best support our research outside of the course.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the disconnect between the SWIRLs and the course website. I found the information in the SWIRLs more helpful than the website sometimes, and it was difficult to go back and find the lessons from the SWIRLs when they were not on the website. ",
            "\u00a0There was plenty of support and time to work on assignments in class, however it was a little disorganized in the beginning ",
            "\u00a0The labs are a great strength. I also liked working through it in class with Batman (Simon) and Robin (Andrew) around to help. It was nice they stayed till 3 every day - I often did as well!\r\nMaybe make the lecture part a bit more engaging? Like I often wanted to write some of the code up there in an effort to follow along but sometimes we moved to fast and I just glazed over about it. \r\n\r\nAlso Friday bootcamp was amazing. The coffee and treats were a plus. You guys did a great job fielding our questions and coaching (or dragging) us to success. ",

            "\u00a0I definitely have more confidence using R, but I wish lectures consisted of more \"how to\" programming instead of traditional lectures. Class time was not maximize, but the SWIRLS were very comprehensive in teaching R skillsets. Some of the SWIRLS contained content that was rarely discussed in class and that could be frustrating at times. ",

Take this if you have no background and want to build one, or even if you have some limited background and need a refresher. If, like me, you are interested in learning R but lack the time or motivation to do it independently, this course is the ticket.\r\n\r\nThe labs are easy. Finishing them will get you the grade, but if you want to establish a deeper level of comfort with using R, don't be afraid to seek out additional problems from the internet or textbooks. \r\n\r\nDefinitely refresh your statistics before you start. The course assumes knowledge of statistics, and while you can still get through reasonably well without a solid statistical foundation, you can get A LOT MORE out of the course by brushing up on stats beforehand.

            "\u00a0This course is a decent amount of work outside of class (weekly labs and SWIRLs, and the final data project), but the basic R skills you learn are helpful and it is very helpful to go to the weekly Friday bootcamps. ",
