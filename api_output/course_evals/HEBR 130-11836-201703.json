            "\u00a0Shiri is amazing! Shes an awesome teacher who really cares about her students, academixally and personally. The classroom dynamic was great, and I really liked going to the events (guest speakers, movie screenings, Hebrew table) we went to outside of class. I thought the class used technology well and emphasized all different facets of the language in class and in homework. I think a weakness was that the class moved at a lightning pace, and we only met twice a week. Every lesson was crammed with new information. I also think the social business project could have been shortened. It felt like we were just bothering a random business in Israel when we emailed them with questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were lot of support, good textbook and workbook integration, good feedback, and a good class atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOne thing I missed was a good old fashioned vocab list. I also thought that the quizzes and tests could have been better, since I often felt that we had a short amount of time to \"learn\" a bunch of new material for a quiz over the weekend. This made it unproductive to actually learn all the material, since some of it was usually review anyway, so there wasn't an incentive to learn the words gradually over the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nOne small thing that might really help would be to break up the assignments on canvas, instead of having all 7 parts of the homework for one week be combined into one \"assignment\".\r\n\r\nI would also nix the social business project. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the conversation that we had in class as well as the yomanim that we wrote, which were rewarding and fun to write. I also thought the quizzes and tests were very fair and preparing for them helped me improve a lot. I thought each tense and form was taught clearly and successfully.  \r\n\r\nA weakness was the social business project, which was very time consuming but didn't help me improve my conversation skills or learn new useful words. Also I thought a lot of class time was used poorly because we mostly just went over the homework and talked about the new homework. ",
            "\u00a0This course could really use vocabulary sheets and grammar tables. The information we leaned felt too disorganized, and putting it all together at the end of the semester felt like a big task. I also think that the final project took time that would have been better spent if we had done a project all in Hebrew. For one thing, social business seems like a topic that did not have the most important vocab for us to learn. I think if we had picked a topic about Israeli history and had a vocab sheet for it and done the whole thing in a Hebrew, it would have been more fun, structured and beneficial. I also think class time should have been all in Hebrew. "

            "\u00a0Yes! The Hebrew department is wonderful and accessible.  I loved my experience. ",
            "\u00a0Hebrew is a fun and challenging language. The department is close knit and fosters community in an incredible way, and I made many friends and had a good time. If a student is even considering Hebrew or has an interest in the language, I recommend this class highly. "
