            "\u00a0This course does well to teach students how to approach secondary historical sources with a critical eye. I learned how to break down a historical argument, which in turn helped me to develop my own. Professor Rutkow also does a great job of providing students with the resources and personal know-how on how to approach historical research, in which the history of tourism is a fun and wide-open arena to begin. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of tourism with respect to America from the 19th century to present, as well as about some sociological and anthropological theory behind tourism.  I also learned a lot about reading and writing in history. ",
            "\u00a0Skills in critical reading of history, writing, and presenting on works of history; knowledge of a niche historical subject "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0While I learned a lot throughout, the course is very end-of-term heavy in terms of the production of original work. Of course, you are encouraged to begin your final paper (worth the majority of your grade) from the get-go, but I have yet to meet a student who actually does this. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in that Professor Rutkow was a great discussion leader, and the course was a nice balance of both historical information and reading/writing in history.  The only minor weaknesses were that the course might benefit from some restructuring (with the theory of tourism covered gradually throughout the course or early on, rather than at the end), and sometimes I felt like discussion stalled because we could get a little bit hung up on trying to provide an answer to a question that Professor Rutkow wanted instead of letting the discussion flow organically. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! The material Prof Rutkow provides is fun to read and classroom discussion was entertaining and thought-provoking. Despite having little \"homework,\" I frequently ended each week feeling I'd learned something valuable with which to carry over into my other endeavors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend it.  It's a pretty niche topic, so you definitely have to be at least somewhat interested in it to start with, but you'll be surprised about how much you can learn about broader human history and behavior from learning about tourism.  Professor Rutkow is great, and I'd definitely take another course with him. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. As an MCDB major at Yale, I feel as though it is really easy to get bogged down by lecture classes that have hundreds of students. Classes like cell biology and organic chemistry are interesting, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of people arent engaged during class, instead choosing to go on their phones or talk. If you are someone looking to find a course that is both interesting and engaging, a history seminar like this one is the move. This seminar had about 9 people in it, and at first, it was a bit intimidating to be in a class that small. However, over the course of the semester, I found the class size to be an extremely rewarding aspect. Each student had an opportunity to talk about their opinions on the sources for that week, receive feedback from the professor, and learn how to engage in a productive discussion. With each successive week, I felt that people in the class became increasingly more comfortable discussing the material, even if they were not completely confident in their conclusions. As far as workload, there were about 150 pages of readings spread out over 3-7 sources per week. Topics ranged from tourism in the west and the rise of the national park system to ecotourism in Costa Rica. Additionally, each student selected one week during which they would read an additional short book and present it to the class. Essentially, that student helped to lead the discussion for the week and give the class context for the other readings. With respect to written work, there was a short 2-3 page primary source analysis, ungraded annotated bibliography, and 4500-5500 final paper. "
