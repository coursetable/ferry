            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of both recent and classic scholarship in  women's history, gender history,  and Asian American history especially as they intersect with each other ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, very engaging reading and good discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage my time well and how to develop a more in depth research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I gained a deeper understanding of Asian American history from the women and gender perspective. The weekly timelines encouraged me to view and analyze texts within their historical context, and Mary Lui really taught us how to evaluate and critique historians' arguments. ",
            "\u00a0As this was my first junior history seminar, I not only learned much about Asian American History from the perspective of Asian American women, but also learned the many tools to history research, and how to produce scholarship in history--from analyzing and evaluating the historiography of the subject at hand, wondering what silences or gaps in narratives might mean, and how scholarship often builds one one top of another. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge about a whole side of asian american history that is normally overlooked in many history courses\r\n\r\ninsight into what historical research entails and the usefulness of different kinds of histories and truths. \r\n\r\nInsight into the similarities of academia across many fields and developing critical analytical skills that will be helpful in any research context.

            "\u00a0Prof. Lui curated an excellent reading list, marshaled class discussion effectively, and scaffolded our final projects in a way which made the task accessible to both history and non-history majors alike. The class atmosphere was very collegial and sessions were typically very productive. A classic history departmental seminar which gives students a compelling introduction to the craft of the historian. Definitely one of the most well-organized classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is a great introduction for those who have never taken a class on Gender studies or Asian American history and wish to delve deeply into those topics. I think the most important aspect of seminars is how productive class discussions are and I believe that Professor Lui was especially skilled in ensuring that every meeting would be intellectually stimulating and provide us with skills to analyze and write papers. I enjoyed how she would comment and give feedback on students' comments to the readings in a very non-lecture way. She would pick out the most substantive aspects of a student's comment and help the rest of the class digest the information without interrupting the flow of the discussion. The only thing I would suggest for the class is perhaps having more readings that focus on theories behind historiography and learning how to apply such theoretical thinking to our papers. ",
            "\u00a0I am, in general, INCREDIBLY happy with this course, and would re-enroll in a heartbeat if I could. I thus want to focus here on areas that might offer room for improvement, in the interest of maximizing the efficacy of my comments. But this choice shouldn't be read as a negative appraisal of the course as a whole! It was wonderful, truly.\r\n\r\nSome areas that might warrant another look, though:\r\n1. Given the course's putative focus on \"gender history,\" it might prove fruitful to add to the reading list some work on the history of Asian American masculinity, a topic some would argue is necessary to contextualizing Asian American women's history. Obviously the focus of the course should stay on women's narratives, but this semester it did sometimes feel as if we were talking around an elephant in the room.\r\n2. Similarly, a consideration of non-heterosexual, non-cisgender Asian American women's history might provide further nuance to the course's narrative. I understand that the historiography on these groups is especially limited, but adding a reading or two when possible could go a long way. \r\n3. Restructuring the session with the Sterling librarians might make it more helpful for future generations of students. I understand the need to support students entering the class from a diverse range of backgrounds, but as it was this year, it felt like a fairly remedial overview, considering many members of our class, as junior/senior history/WGSS/American Studies/ER&M majors, had probably worked in the archives before. Perhaps the librarian's presentation could be condensed into a worksheet students could review on their own timeor even simply the URL to the site he made for our course, which was greatand the sense could be used doing some direct source analysis? That might prove more helpful for the students who haven't worked in the archives before. I think, for a generation used to Google searches (haha), finding the sources is somewhat more intuitive than understanding how to analyze them.\r\n4. This is a small one, but providing, during the beginning of the course, some examples of research topics that past students have taken on could be helpful to current students struggling to identify and home in on a problem. (This would be especially helpful for students who have not previously conducted independent research in the manner of a history junior seminar.) ",
            "\u00a0The readings were great (if long), and our discussions were easy to follow, well-guided, and interesting. Prof. Lui is also incredible, as was our TF, Melissa. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lui chose texts that really reflected the diversity of Asia America. She did a good job of choosing some texts that were more academic and scholarly, and others that were engrossing and emotional (such as The Latehomecomer). Another strength: The TA, Melissa, also provided clear feedback for every response you did, so you were always able to improve upon your writing throughout the semester. \r\nWeaknesses: Can't really think of any! ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths to this course. Professor Lui and Melissa were a great professor and TF duo, and I loved the way they led seminar, especially Melissa's bit on analyzing primary sources at the end of each class. I loved how engaging seminar discussions were on the reading, and how our seminar essentially became a family by the end of the course. The variety of readings was great, and I loved that we covered a wide range of narratives from different backgrounds and of different types, from more scholarly writings, to film, to a novel/memoir at the very end. I also loved how we were walked through our research papers throughout the semester, though some more guidance towards the end would have been appreciated (in terms the actual structuring of the research paper, and how to approach writing it). Furthermore, this may be too idealistic given the time constraints of one semester, but more representation from other Asian ethnicities, especially South Asia, would have been great. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were fruitful in the topics discussed from our readings: I learned a few important things from my peers in discussions. I think the course also does a good job of covering both a breadth and depth of material, due to its rather heavy reading load. I do wish sometime that we'd be able to read less each week in order to fully discuss the readings in seminar -- sometimes I felt like we inevitably left out some interesting topics because there was so much to cover. \r\n\r\nI think the course was facilitated well for student learning in that there were ample opportunities to seek out help on our final projects, however, I still feel that this is not a great first research seminar course in that we often didn't receive instructions on the logistics of finding materials. A short tutorial on searching for material and a reminder of other resources to use in our research (like librarians or other recommended resources) would have been helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in learning more about the craft of gender/women's history and/or Asian American history ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Lui is amazing and you will learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this seminar! It's a great opportunity to delve into an understudied field of history with an incredible & insightful professor. Professor Lui led fascinating discussions and helped us think critically about how identity and mobility are shaped by both race and gender. We also engaged with issues of transnationalism, colonialism, and the difficulties of recovering voices that have traditionally been ignored in the historical literature. One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course, taught by an absolute gem of Yale's faculty. It might be helpful to have taken Professor Lui's lecture courseor to have some other exposure to the broad themes of Asian American historybeforehand, but by no means is that necessary. Take it if you get in! The opportunity to work on a final project of your own choosing with an incredibly supportive professor (and also, during our semester, an incredibly supportive TA) is not to be missed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Most of us never learn about Asian American history at all, let along Asian American Women's history, and it is so important! Prof. Lui also facilitates really great discussions and is also open for office hours, which is really helpful to improve writing and get feedback on research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great professor who provides thoughtful feedback every week, and a more marginalized topic that deals with the intersection of gender history and ethnic history. The readings are also so worthwhile and amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's well thought out, well taught, and on such an interesting subject--a subject that is hard to come by at Yale given its lack of courses in Asian American Studies. Professor Lui is simply amazing, and if you've taken her lecture on Asian American History, then you already know how great she is! This seminar was great, it was engaging, and simply great. While the reading and courseload might be greater than that of a regular course, it definitely is worth it. We go through the narratives of many different Asian American women, from different backgrounds, and from different types of history. We analyzed oral histories, secondary sources, film, memoirs, etc., and not only learned about these overlooked narratives, but also studied how effective they are, and what might be lacking. More than anything, this seminar truly gives you the tools to create your own work of scholarship, and this class gears towards your own research paper at the end of the course. It's definitely a rewarding class, taught by an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course I have ever take during my time here at Yale. The readings were incredibly stimulating and thought-provoking while also being interesting. The class discussions were well guided by Professor Lui and she allowed everyone to add their thoughts without judgement. Take it if she offers it again! Please! "
