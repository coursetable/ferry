            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about how to think about different writing. Skills were, I suppose, learning how to motivate myself. Coming up with your own topics is tough, but it's good to have to figure out what you *really* want to write about. ",
            "\u00a0I got to do creative writing every week, it was a lot of fun to see my writing improve. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable with my writing ",
            "\u00a0This was a class about being a human person, and recognizing humanity in others, and it did an excellent job of that. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced writing about the people I know and interact with every day. It was an incredible class particularly because it kept me writing every week, which was really good for me. ",
            "\u00a0how to see and write about people, how to pay attention to detail, how to read and interpret literary works ",
            "\u00a0How to write poetry in a thoughtful and interesting way, and how to open up about personal topics. ",
            "\u00a0most of my learning derived from reading others' writing, either the examples provided or the other students in the class\r\nBarkin gives emotional feedback, what he felt reading the essay etc., not so much constructive criticism, but you can meet with him during office hours where he'll probably talk more specifically about your writing \r\nall in all it just gives you a chance to write something every week and improve that way -- he doesn't tend to give you a specific angle or direction so you shape your own writing entirely "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0As a seminar-style class, it relies almost entirely on class participation, which can be a strength. However, it is also a weakness because the success of the class is dependent on the class actually participating. I struggled to know when to speak because I didn't want to sound like I was taking all the conversation, but there were so many awkward pauses that I felt often that I needed to say something, just so that there wouldn't be silence. This is not Professor Barkin's fault; the class just didn't seem to care -- even though Professor Barkin certainly tried to get us excited! ",
            "\u00a0The pieces of writing chosen for this course packet were awesome. The professor gave great feedback on our writing, but it was unfortunately, almost always illegible. Good motivation for going to office hours, though. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the readings, but class discussions could have been better guided. The readings need to have more of a common purpose, if that makes sense. Sometimes it wasn't clear why we were reading what we were reading, but he did eventually start sending us questions to think about as we read to guide us. I really enjoyed doing the assignments! The prompts were fun and allowed for a lot of flexibility. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing I would suggest would be an amended course packet. I think it would be helpful to have the course readings broken up by week, rather than alphabetically, and I think there was too much Hardy. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were great, and Professor Barkin was awesome. I got so much great feedback and thought so many great things, and got to hear so many other great thoughts. It was an excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated a more English 120-style workshop approach to the writing component--as in, have one or two people assigned to share their piece for each class, to allow for more focused discussion and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all the poetry we read, and the weekly writing assignments are exciting. I also loved how he will look at your writing any time you want help  not just during grading periods, and will give you comments both critical and constructive. I also loved his grading system, which helped me write assignments not for the grade, but because I was moved to write them. ",
            "\u00a0prompts were really creative and provocative, readings were interesting, barkin is a gem ",
            "\u00a0It was strong because it was a welcoming environment for people to be extremely vulnerable and feel accepted. The only weakness was perhaps not feeling as engaged at times, but I also loved the tangents our class went on ",
            "\u00a0The class needs more structure. It was way too loose to the point that it felt very obvious that no one had done the reading and no one was contributing to the discussion which lead to Prof Barkin just talking to us for the full two hours. The discussion questions that were added in to the reading were a helpful step towards creating more structure but still the class felt very unsure of itself. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: relaxed pace, felt like you didn't need to hang onto every single word he was saying // learn a lot from other's writing in a noncompetitive environment, less of an intense seminar than a gathering of people who just wanted to talk about writing\r\nweaknesses: if you want rigorous feedback, criticism, and layers upon layers of reediting to perfection, this is not the class for you. Barkin is a delightful person but doesn't tend to push your writing in any particular direction. Improvement is self driven. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Professor Barkin isn't demanding at all, and if you don't want to work, you don't have to. But if you don't want to take this class, then don't take this class, and don't waste everyone's time. Please. If you take this class, be prepared to care - to decide to care. Professor Barkin won't make you, but you'll get nothing out the class if you don't try. I loved the class; I just wish there had been different people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is good for people who do not have a lot of background in creative writing. It is definitely a low-pressure environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There is a weekly writing assignment, but it's a very low-key vibe and there isn't too much pressure to create the most perfect work. I enjoyed the class a lot. Prof Barkin is such a character. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have the opportunity, take this class. Professor Barkin is the kind of person who you just should meet, and hear, and listen to. And the assignments are great, and the readings are great, and the workload is light. But mostly take it for Barkin. ",
            "\u00a0I would, Barkin is a genius and a prophet all in one. Dont be put off because he is sometimes kind of strange, just listen. ",
            "\u00a0yes, for barkin's expertise. he's an incredible writer and gives amazing feedback--line-by-line feedback. do it for the creative writing prompts that make you think and the literature you read ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of the best, most relaxed, fun, yet still academically stimulating courses Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0would recommend to anyone who's looking for an excuse to write and wants to be in the company of like minded people\r\nit's definitely a change of pace compared to other Yale classes and a lot of class is spent story telling or listening to Barkin recite verses from memory (or talk about loneliness) \r\ndepends on the type of class you're looking for -- this focuses more on appreciative reading and writing in your own time "
