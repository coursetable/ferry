            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about how to work in an interdisciplinary team comprised of people from different backgrounds and interests and the sort of work it takes to pull off a large scale public humanities project from conception to execution. Through the first weeks of readings I also learnt about the foundations of oral history, a lot about New Haven itself and its evolution over time, and about documentary film. "

            "\u00a0I loved that the course was cross-listed so undergrads and graduate students could work together. That doesn't happen enough. I wish there was a framework to continue working together after the course ended--Deep Roots would be a really fun project to continue. ",
            "\u00a0The group project is actually so super great. It means that a real community is created by the class. As its a mixed grad/undergrad class it also gives you a rare opportunity to work closely with students with a varying level of education background than you. I'm an undergrad and found it super useful to work with PhD students, masters students in Business, Theater, American Studies, History...I think if anything this course could be improved by receiving more feedback on the first assignment and weekly reviews. However, as soon as we started thinking about the group project this class really got going and was such a pleasure to be a part of. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Intro to Public Humanities offers students the rare opportunity to explore New Haven, with the knowledgable Dean B as a guide. The field trips were especially instructive. A must-take class. ",
            "\u00a0I would completely recommend this course to another student. Keep in mind that the final is a huge group project so skills of collaboration are KEY. However because it is a varied and large group it means each student can bring their various skills to the table to create a project that works really well, and each person gets a chance to take charge of different tasks. This class will only really work if students are willing to have a can-do attitude, but because you get to conceptualize your own project people get really excited about it and usually working on the final project for this class becomes a pursuit of pleasure! The first few weeks can sometimes feel like they have a lot of heavy reading, but key concepts are highlighted, and this class is definitely worth it for the final project experience. "
