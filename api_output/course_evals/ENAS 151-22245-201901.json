She posted detailed lecture notes, explained exactly how we should study for tests, and always made herself available to help when needed. \r\nSometimes the content itself was not interesting, but Prof. Bennett always made an effort to find an interesting or applicable way to introduce it and teach it. She was a super active teacher and would sometimes bring in props to help introduce a topic. \r\nNot very many weaknesses of the course! This was the most engaging and well-taught math class I have ever taken. ",

Specifically, the efforts done by the professor to put lecture notes and resources online, give exams back in a timely manner, and everything else made the course great. its weaknesses only lie in the repetitiveness of the course material and often boring nature of lecture, but this weakness is likely unavoidable in a class for this subject. ",

I would have liked clearer grading on psets (minor issues) ",

You just have to understand it and utilize it in the right place. Moreover you have a cheat sheet on every exam (all of the are non- cumulative). ",

Multivariable Calculus can be hard to conceptualize, but Prof. Bennett found the most creative ways to explain the concepts, often using physical props. Although the psets were challenging, Prof. Bennett, TAs, and CBPTs were always willing to give guidance. The tests were challenging, but Prof. Bennett explains exactly how to study for them to best succeed. Overall, this was a fantastic class! ",

If you are debating between Math 120 and this class, I would recommend this one unless you really like proofs. The classes cover the same material but this one focuses more on applications. And, Professor Bennett was really great and explained complicated concepts very well. The homeworks were long but were never too complicated, and the exams were fair. ",

If this is the same instructor and format, then the following will be true:\r\nYour lowest two PSets will be dropped\r\nThe exams you do better on will count 5% more (40% total) then those you do worse on (30% total)\r\nYou are allowed a 8.5x11 cheat sheet to exams\r\n\r\nTake this if there is any debate in what course to take!

This course actually gave us problems that are going to be applicable to later classes or our future careers so it didn't feel like a waste of time at all. My only advice is to know going into the course that it gets substantially harder as the course goes on. ",
