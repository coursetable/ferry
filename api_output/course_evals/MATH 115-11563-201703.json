            "\u00a0I had taken Calculus AB and BC in high school but wanted to reinforce my understanding, particularly that of more complex BC concepts, and therefore took Math 115.  Therefore, I had gone into Math 115 with a general understanding of most concepts.  I felt that the course explored these concepts and honed skills more intensely and deeply.  I learned why certain formulas held true, and I gained a thorough understanding of how the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applied to everything else in the course.  I was encouraged to use my intuition at the start of every problem and to check my answers at the end of every problem.  By being tested each time without the use of a calculator, I feel that I became more confident in my mathematical skills, as I did not need to rely on a calculator. ",

Honestly, if there was anything I took away, it was respect for people who are really good at math. Because I struggled through this class, and there are sooooo many higher levels of math. ",

That being said I was forced to expand my understanding of calculus topics and the way in which these types of problems are solved. I also had not taken a hard math class in a year and so it got my mind thinking again about problem solving and the ways in which you can approach a problem that you are not 100% certain about. ",

            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is that Professor Auel is truly one of the most lovable human beings I have ever encountered and made taking Calc 2 bearable. The biggest weakness of Math 115 is the \"flipped\" format. The online videos are often useless and it was difficult for me to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0I found the flipped classroom model to be flawed. The videos were of poor quality to the extent that my professor often needed to spend time explaining material during the lectures, which under a proper flipped classroom would have given more opportunities for students to complete practice problems. I felt that students would be better served in lecture if examples were given prior to or at the start of lecture so that students could go through them before engaging in class discussion / explanation of solutions by the professor. I felt the avoidance of calculators was nonsensical and not reflective of our current environment, where calculators can solve many of the problems we computed with ease. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped-classroom style isn't nearly as effective as a traditional classroom style ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in the prep-problems for every class. Working out those prep-problems provides a necessary introduction to the material and is often very helpful. Additionally, I feel that the flipped classroom approach is excellent for math classes because being introduced to the concepts at home is essential to comfortably applying them in class the next day. \r\n\r\nThere are numerous weaknesses of this course. First and foremost, the grading of the exams is largely illogical. Often times, answers to questions that match solution keys exactly are not given full credit. Even more common is that massive amounts of points will be taken off for minor mistakes while few points will be taken off for concept errors. This results in students who have a poor grasp of the material receiving higher scores on individual exams despite showing inaccurate work. \r\n\r\nOne particular example of this illogical grading that infuriated several students was an exam question that required students to calculate parametric arc length to find distance travelled. Although parametric arc length required finding both derivatives and the limits of integration, partial credit was not given for doing so if the wrong formula for parametric arc length was used. The grading committee responded that even if the grading was unfair, it was \"unfair for everyone,\" therefore those who submitted a regrade requested were not given points back. This principle is of course ridiculous, for the grading committee could have simply prompted all students with this egregious grading mistake to submit for a regrade. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- weekly homework and 2 midterms - allows students that don't perform very well on their first exam to catch up\r\n- textbook very helpful\r\n- quizzes online \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- videos online could be more concise \r\n- videos were often not helpful to answer the quiz ",
            "\u00a0Test taking ",
            "\u00a0I felt the flipped classroom wasn't too effective. The videos ended up feeling like a burden, especially they didn't really help with our understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0No limited amount of As, A-s which means everyone is trying to help each other out usually. Pre-class Canvas study questions were good, but the videos got kinda repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the Canvas questions we had to complete before each class were not helpful. They were a nice introduction to the upcoming lesson, but the questions we had to complete did not help me understand the topic very much. The videos were helpful, but the questions were not as much. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom, most of the time, works poorly. The videos vary too much; sometimes they directly address the material, other times it's a tenuous link at best. It essentially forces the burden of learning the material on the student; if you have a good professor, you learn in class. If not, it's self-studying out of the textbook and other outside sources. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the flipped classroom is not very effective. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness of this course is the flipped classroom model. It is completely counter-effective in helping students learn this difficult material. The videos are short and often not engaging, and because you watch them at home, it's hard to formulate the questions without the classroom environment. Further, Jim (who is the professor who makes the videos) is not the professor who will be in your classroom, and the different means of explaining things can become overly convoluted. The class time is typical lecture style, as advertised, but it often become an inhospitable environment to even ask questions. In the end, you end up teaching the vast majority of the material to yourself in the days before the exams. Seemed to me to be a huge waste of effective in-class teachers. ",
            "\u00a0The online videos help with explaining the ideas behind the topics, but do not help in demonstrating how to actually solve the problems, which is what is needed to know for the midterms and final.  This said, flipped classroom does not help because the steps to solving said problems are never officially taught.  One could read the textbook, but textbooks do not make the best professors. ",
            "\u00a0There are many opportunities for help within this course, including peer tutoring, residential college tutoring, and office hours. Teachers and tutors make sure students understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of tutors and structure. The videos with Jim were hit or miss, some were great, some left me confused. The Review Sessions for exams were also hit or miss. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom aspect of this course is horrible.  I attended nearly every exam review session offered and spoke to many of my peers who were in various sections of this course, and it seems like each instructor interpreted the concept of the \"flipped classroom\" a bit differently.  Some instructors used class time to go through many examples; some reviewed prep problems; some retaught what was taught in the videos; and some did a combination of these.  I think this should be standardized across the course.  Also, I think that the flipped classroom videos themselves should be refined.  Many times, I would go into class thoroughly confused by the prep problems or prep videos (which oftentimes did not match each other), and then my professor would proceed to tell our class that we did not need to worry about what was taught on the video last night, as it was irrelevant to material we needed to know for exams or problem sets.  Though some of these \"extraneous\" concepts were interesting, it was frustrating to spend class time / homework time on them when we could have been digging deeper into practicing other concepts.  The flipped classroom videos should be clear and consistent with exam material and book material.  Also, having a teaching fellow assigned to each section, and perhaps a discussion section for each section, would be incredibly helpful.  I would have gone every week to clarify concepts.\r\n\r\nI did feel that the problem sets were generally fair and aligned with what was taught in the book.  There were many resources available to help me if I got stuck on part of the problem set.  Communication from my instructor and the head of the course was very good, which I definitely appreciated, especially as exams approached. ",
            "\u00a0In this course the peer tutors, problem sets, and online work were very helpful but there was a great variance among the professors. That meant that some review sessions/office hours were less worth attending than others. ",
            "\u00a0The videos did not coincide with the lecture Half the time ",
            "\u00a0I was not a fan of the flipped classroom. I feel I would have benefited by not having the videos before class. Our professor would always explain the concepts much better in person in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think profesor Auel was a real strength. He's a great teacher and guy. The weakness was the videos. The videos were not very helpful, and kind of a waste of time. The khan academy equivlanet's of the videos were much more informative, and often shorter ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom is really not the ideal way to teach Math 115. You have these great instructors who are not being utilized and people feel less incentivized to actually show up in class because we are not learning anything new in class. Further, students don't watch the videos or stop watching the videos part way through the year which definitely doesn't help in getting students to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0i disliked the flipped classroom style of teaching. My TA offered fantastic examples during class though that helped reinforce the principles. ",
            "\u00a0Flipped classroom was unfortunately a weakness for the class, mainly because it wasn't really customized. Every math professor has a different way of approaching concepts and solving problems. There was a rift between the videos and the classes. The strength was having Professor Auel as our guide who tried to fix this rift as much as possible. ",
            "\u00a0I did not think that the flipped course was the best way for this class to be taught. For me the videos were rather confusing and did not actually teach you how to solve the problems and then when we got to class it was expected that I know how to solve the problems. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you like math and are willing to devote time to this class. However, you should know that most students taking the class have already taken Calc BC in high school and the course will be taught to them instead of students with no background beyond AB. If you don't need this class as a prerequisite, I would take other classes as your QR instead of this one. ",

            "\u00a0As far as I know, there are no alternatives for fulfilling a Calculus II requirement, so I recommend this course only to students who require this class for a major.\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the section's professors are excellent (especially Asher), the grading of the exams does not reward students who know the material, and many students left the class feeling that they would have received more partial credit answering questions incorrectly than they otherwise did. Otherwise, the problem sets are fair and manageable. ",

            "\u00a0You're taking it for a pre-req so get it done. If you've taken BC and done well, you'll be fine if you put in the little bit of effort to study and keep up, you'll nab an A-/A. If you haven't taken BC, it'll be tough; have a good study group. ",

            "\u00a0I know this is a must for many students, as it is often a pre-requisite for Math 120 and other math courses, so for that reason, I guess. If you don't have to take it, don't. It's confusing and overwhelming, even after taking BC Calc and absolutely loving math until this course. If anything, this course dissuaded me from sticking to my initial Math major plans. There has to be a better way to teach these intro level math courses in a way that does not suck all interest in math out of students. ",
            "\u00a0If you have not taken AP Calc BC,  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.  I wish I had listened to that advice when I had signed up.  The content is very fast paced and the course is flipped classroom, so unless you are already comfortable with the material, or are prepared to work extremely hard in teaching yourself a lot of calculus in one semester, this is going to be very difficult.\r\nOn the other hand, the course expands upon ideas introduced in Calc I, and introduces new ideas that are interesting to analyze and learn about. ",
            "\u00a0This is a requirement for econ and for many other classes. You might as well take it if you have to. If you are doing this for a QR credit, there are more interesting courses in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0No. It was terrible. The flipped classroom idea is atrocious and doesn't promote learning at all. ",
            "\u00a0In many ways, I feel that this course is a necessary evil.  Most STEM students need to take single-variable calculus in order to fulfill requirements, including myself.  I had a background in AP Calculus AB and BC, but wanted to take this course anyway to reinforce complicated BC concepts.  The course material certainly is not impossible, problem sets are reasonable and fair, and ample resources are available to students, but the flipped classroom is very confusing and makes the course miserable.  The outdated videos oftentimes do not teach you the concepts well enough to be prepared for class, problem sets, or exams.  Instructors interpret the notion of the flipped classroom differently.  Oftentimes my instructor used class time to expand on just one or two examples, without really covering a broader scope of the material, even if we did not understand what the prep video attempted to teach.  This was endlessly frustrating to me and made it much more difficult to understand the material and be prepared for exams.  There is just so much that a textbook can teach you, and as this course seems to expand on what is contained within the textbook, it is really important to have a good teacher who can show you the material.  I do not feel that this course fosters that learning environment.  Success in the course is possible, but the course is very difficult to navigate because of its flipped classroom nature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I believe it is a good class for understanding the material that needs to be learned. However, I still believe the classroom should be unflipped. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if youre back prepared to teach yourself a lot of the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to continue math then yes. Also if you took AP Calc BC but unsure how you felt about some parts, it's a great course to refresh yourself and move a little beyond in your math level. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to everyone who loves calculus. There really isn't much to explain. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone that has background in the class material because it was difficult for me to learn the material on my own and I felt that many of the people in the class already had exposure to the material when I did not. "
