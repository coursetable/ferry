            "\u00a0Aside from learning about one of the most interesting figures in literature, you really learn how to close read and synthesize poetry with secondary reading. ",
            "\u00a0Background history regarding Chinese medieval poetry, in-depth understanding of the life and struggles of the Chinese poet Du Fu, how to analytically approach poetry (specifically Chinese poetry), the turn of events which lead to the fall of the Tang dynasty, why Du Fu is considered one of the greatest poets in China to this day. ",
            "\u00a0awesome course -- material was well organized and secondary reading was always insightful or interesting ",
            "\u00a0Skill in the analysis and understanding of literature, the ability to read and comprehend difficult theoretical texts, how to write academic essays, understanding of Chinese poetry of the Tang dynasty, comparative literature and literary theory.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, this was a course that asked students to ponder how one should live amidst chaos, dislocation, and the collapse of the state, and how one can hold fast to ethical values in the face of tremendous hardship. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt a lot about medieval Chinese history, and the intellectual and poetic traditions that arose from ",
            "\u00a0I gained in the course extraordinary close reading of ancient chinese literature, and engaged with ethical questions in the chinese tradition and ethical questions in literature in general. The design of the course is extremely compelling  the combination of theory with the life of one non-western poet. The poems and texts work together so well, each unit posing a more profound and complex question on Du Fu's life and the literary traditions he resemble. ",
            "\u00a0Deep insights into how to read traditional Chinese poetry, Tang dynasty cultural history, and comparative poetics. I came away from this course with a vastly expanded \"toolkit\" for approaching poetic biography, something I hadn't expected at all. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bender gives an excellent introduction to approaching Chinese literature for those with no background without boring those who have extensive knowledge in the subject. I learned a ton about the context of Du Fu's poetry, which made me a much better reader. I cannot overstate how much I appreciated all of our secondary readings: without an intro to literary theory course at Yale, I often feel lost; this type of seminar is the answer. I learned so much about how to approach literature, narrative, poetry, and ethics through looking at Du Fu through these readings. They also enriched my readings of Du Fu's writing. "

            "\u00a0This course was amazing except for the time constraint. I understand that it's very difficult/impossible, but adding another half hour would really enrich our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only weakness of the course was how large it was. It's just harder to have good conversations with over 20 people, but I think Professor Bender did a good job of trying to navigate that. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength was the high-level discussions which took place in seminar each week. Writing our thoughts and preparing notes on Canvas before each class definitely contributed to this phenomenon - my only critique is that Professor Bender spoke a bit too much during class for my taste. He would often respond in between students, but I think it would have been better for the quality of discussion if he spoke after three or four students had shared their thoughts. This should not be confused with when he was clarifying footnotes or offering background information (often at the start of class); during these moments, his expertise was greatly appreciated. I was surprised by the fact that even with almost twenty students in the class, there would be lulls of silence where people didn't want to contribute... I'll be honest, I didn't always do the readings which is why I didn't speak up, but if I took school more seriously, I definitely would have!! ",
            "\u00a0N/A -- excellently run course! ",
            "\u00a0I liked that our reading of Du Fu's poetry was complemented with supplementary readings on his life and the broader historical developments during his time -- these secondary readings helped me better contextualize and place the poems we were reading. It sometimes felt that we didn't spend enough time on the poems themselves though, and that we didn't spend enough time at the beginning of the course tackling how to work through Du Fu's poems, which arise from a different literary tradition than what most of us were used to. ",
            "\u00a0all the components are extremely well designed: the biography of du fu, the poems, and the theories. There's not one thing in the setup i would change. \r\nHowever, given the complexity of the materials we are covering, it might be productive to emphasize aspects that we want to be emphasizing more on (\r\n Du Fu and the Chinese tradition). The secondary readings are extremely stimulating and useful, but it can sometimes take up a bit more time in class discussions and on canvas posts than needed for. ",
            "\u00a0This class presents a ton of opportunities for writing, voicing ideas, and receiving great feedback.\r\n\r\nThe course is probably as \"spread out\" as it can be (the comparative part) without becoming diffuse. That is: it's great as-is, but could possibly get stretched too thin if students focus more on the \"peripheral\" material. ",
            "\u00a0The secondary readings are fantastic, and Bender teaches them very well. Also, his translations of Du Fu's poetry are both beautiful and rich for discussion. "

            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal class. My personal level of engagement with the class was not very high for a lot of reasons, but totally in spite of this, I learned so much and read so many interesting poems and pieces of academic thought that I had not been exposed to before. I would certainly recommend this class to anyone, and would recommend that you put more effort into it than I did, because you will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone. Even if you don't have an interest in Du Fu or even Chinese poetry, it's worth taking this course just to experience a new way of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. I think it's important to take a class in a non-Western tradition during your Yale education if you can, and this is a really great one. Professor Bender is brilliant and incredibly eloquent in class. Du Fu is a great poet to read and the combination of poetry and secondary readings often from very different areas was thought-provoking. The workload (both in reading and papers) is totally manageable, probably on the lower end of humanities seminars. ",
            "\u00a0This was, in my opinion, the best course I've taken at Yale. The amount of intellectual stimulation I received throughout the semester... the way I was able to expand my worldview and empathize with a society and character from another era was simply transformative. Professor Bender was adamant about spending at least half the class on the poetry and I think this dedication to the text really helped us tease out so many of the details we would have otherwise not been able to grasp. Ultimately, courses are taught by professors, and it was truly Professor Bender's love of Du Fu which made the course so enjoyable. On the last day of class, he said he was \"the luckiest professor in the country because nowhere else would he have been able to talk about his favorite poet once a week with some of the brightest young minds.\" The truth is we are lucky to have professors like Mr. Bender. Earlier I mentioned the professor should try to speak less in class, but I honestly think he couldn't help but respond haha. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, Yale is not just a research institution, but an educational one founded on learning and critical thinking through discussion. Simply put, it's professors like Mr. Bender that Yale, Yale. ",
            "\u00a0yes!!!!!!!! good professor and great material ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended. Don't be fooled by the apparently niche topic  this is a course that explores not just Tang dynasty poetry, but some of the most interesting philosophical problems in both the Western and Chinese traditions. This is the rare course that pushes students not just to develop their skills, but to think about how to live. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I felt that it gave me great exposure to a different poetic tradition. The course also covered significant breadth in drawing together various fields such as ethics, literary theory and history. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course more. But you should be aware of how challenging the material really is, especially when it comes to the intricate complexities of the chinese tradition. It takes a lot (and i mean A LOT) of staring at incomprehensible characters, grit and intuition ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class, even for people with little to no prior exposure to the department. The readings are very interesting, the workload is manageable, and the payoff, particularly in the last few classes, is immense for working through Du Fu's life progressively. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think almost anybody interested in poetry or certain approaches to philosophy would find it deeply engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is an excellent course for anyone interested in literature, philosophy, and especially literary theory. Professor Bender is an enthusiastic, kind, and excellent teacher. I feel so lucky to have taken this course because I learned a lot about an incredible poet and because I got to read foundational literary theory, both of which will help me enjoy learning more in the future. I know I will value this class as I read for school and pleasure in the future. The feedback on papers was excellent and shows how invested Professor Bender is in helping us learn; I was very impressed by the care he put into responding to my ideas. "
