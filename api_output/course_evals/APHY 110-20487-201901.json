            "\u00a0The course offers an intriguing overview of many of the technologies that define our world today: Why do florescent light flicker when they turn on? How is information encrypted? What is the current state and future of solar power? ",

            "\u00a0In this class I learned about a lot of the technology that I use everyday and the properties of physics that go into making those things work. I developed my logic skills and learned how to think about topics theoretically. ",

            "\u00a0As a non-stem major, I managed to learn a lot of physics, but I also learned how to take a lecture science class. I learned how to prepare for tests and fit weekly problem sets into my study schedule, which was a personal change of pace. ",

            "\u00a0IT IS AN AMAZING CLASS. TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly psets are a great aspect of the course because they require weekly engagement with the material and were often quite interesting.  The only improvement to this class would be more office hours with a TF, which has nothing to do the course material. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is incredibly well-built for non-stem students looking to be deeply engaged in basic material. In that sense, the wealth of resources provided (lecture slides, problem sets, practice exam problems, office hours, book page numbers, etc) helped to guide me through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the setup of the class with learning physics concepts first and then their various applications. However, the lecture notes weren't posted online so a lot of the time I was focused on writing everything down and not spending as much time listening and understanding the concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great SC/QR credit, with interesting material, a wonderful professor, and a very reasonable amount of work. In many ways, this course embodies what distributional requirements are meant to fulfill -- a chance to explore a subject far from one's own focus without a ton of pressure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any humanities student. It was the only physics course I took that made me feel like I had developed an intuitive sense of the science. I fee much better prepared to talk about the science behind certain questions and technological applications that are important to humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The Technological World is the ideal SC/QR credit for humanities majors. It is fast-paced and full of content so you won't feel like you're wasting your time like you would with a gut (this is NOT a gut). Additionally, the grounding of the class in actual technology makes the low-level physics easy to understand. Professor Miller is an engaging lecturer who tries to make class interesting and accessible. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are a CS student how is looking for a science student like me, this is a perfect class. You can use your reasoning skill well enough to this class. If you are a non STEM major, this course is also good for you because there is no heavy math involved. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I thought this course was incredibly engaging, well-taught, and perfectly proportioned. The knowledge and skills that I gained in this class I will never forget. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was really fascinating to learn about the physics behind a lot of things we use in day to day life that to me seemed to work like magic. Now, I'm able to reason about the different concepts behind a certain technology. ",
