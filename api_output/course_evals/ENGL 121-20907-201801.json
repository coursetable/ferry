            "\u00a0I learned so much about new ways to think about history and how to be a historian. Not only did I learn about what writing with the mindset and style of a historian is like, but I also had the opportunity to think through and analyze the insight of a variety of historians and their perspectives on history. ",
            "\u00a0Mainly, I've learned create clearer, more persuasive written works. I've also learned some of the powerful, shifting nature present in creating (read: literally writing) history.\r\n\r\nI've learned some of the nitty-gritty about writing good text -- like to avoid hanging \"this\"-es, making sure the reader doesn't lose my argument, and to always think about what mood I instill in my reader. Whether comics, obituaries, intra-university reports, or Beinkecke Plaza, I've found the readings assigned by Professor Johnston-Gordon to be engaging and interesting. They're ideal examples of the levels and styles of writing that she hopes us to achieve.\r\n\r\nI've also learned a bit more about myself as a writer -- namely, that it takes me serious amounts of time to hit upon a thesis that I find compelling AND original, and that I have a tendency to under-write my outlines. Furthermore, I've discovered that I should always start writing my essay at least a week and a half ahead of the due date. Putting words to paper helps me to discover weaknesses in my argument, and where I might stand to find more evidence. I've also found that I tend to over-introduce my papers -- both in each paper's introduction, and when beginning each section. Clarifying this tendency to over-introduce has helped me strengthen my argument in many papers.\r\n\r\nPaper feedback has been the most rigorous I've yet received.\r\n\r\nFor all the reasons great and small above, I feel that my abilities as a writer and historian have greatly improved.

            "\u00a0The strengths are certainly the readings we were assigned for class as well as the conversations we were able to have--I appreciated the small environment of the class as it allowed for both individualized attention and a good class environment. However, I do kind of wish that more of the discussion had been focused on conversations with each other. At times (not because of the professor but because of the class dynamic) it felt like a lot of the conversation was aimed at Professor Johnston Gordon rather than discussing with on another. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in developing stronger writers -- especially around the area of history.\r\n\r\nWriting About History does not have any weaknesses that are obvious to me in this moment. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. As a humanities student, I certainly got a lot out of learning about the variety of opinions regarding history and historian analysis from many different historians. However, I also think that more STEM-oriented students would also get a lot out of this class as it was incredibly interesting, accessible, and taught so much about the nature of history writing as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend Writing About History to another student, especially if it is again taught by Professor Johnston-Gordon.\r\n\r\nNot just history majors, but anyone hoping to write stronger, more effective, and more engaging prose would benefit from this course. "
