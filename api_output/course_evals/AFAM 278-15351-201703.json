            "\u00a0Critical assessment of black urban life ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest takeaways concerned basic sociological method: some of the best analyses are produced from synthesizing primary source accounts and demographic data.  The course really provided thought-provoking insights on black American family structure as a result of a historical evolution spanning the entire 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This course equipped me with general understandings of African Americans' narrative in America, and I learned the currently held ideas of why Black people have higher rates of joblessness and single-parent households in comparison to white people. I also learned about Professor Jaynes' contrasting perspective through reading his manuscript. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it provides a different view on the black community. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend.  Professor Jaynes ran the course in an engaging and richly conversational style, which helped really make the semester a memorable one. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is specifically interested in African Americans' position in American society today and understanding the roots of this position. It is a very specific topic, so I would only recommend to someone who has interest in the question the course intends to answer. "
