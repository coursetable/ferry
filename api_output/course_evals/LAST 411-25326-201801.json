            "\u00a0Negativity in the most critical, paradigm shifting sense-- I learned to think in a new way about translation, the law, language, art and film, and of the very act of reading and interpretation. Walter Benjamin taught by Paul and Willy is to witness and engage in a live discussion about the stakes and import of a text or film. From this discussion, new ideas and insights arise in one of the most satisfying and reflective academic moments of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the thought of Walter Benjamin both as a person sui generis and in relation to Chile. On a broader level, I learned what critical theory is and its relation to traditional modes of philosophical inquiry. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you to think critically. It teaches you to think about how ways to think about history affect our view of institutions and violence. The critical image as it relates specifically to the 1980s in Chile became a way to shatter traditional frameworks and open space for new ways of experiencing. The course teaches you how to think in this way. ",
            "\u00a0How to develop a cumulative argument; attending to the text both in a microscopic and macroscopic way that is both conducive with each other and cogent in its results; the ability to not lose balance as one reasons through arguments; crossing barriers of multilingualism. ",
            "\u00a0More than perhaps any course I've taken so far at Yale, this class challenged me to think in new ways about literature, art, and even the unconscious assumptions with which I approach the world. Whenever I had studied works of critical theory in other contexts, they had been supplements to a \"central\" work (usually a novel or set of poems), and never as texts that could stand on their own merits  the opportunity to do a \"deep dive\" into, say, The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility pushed me to think in radically unsettling ways about how I experience, not just pieces of art in museums, but even the physical space of buildings. And the opportunity to write critical essays (with more freedom to explore and take risks than I've experienced in almost any other class) gave me an extremely demanding exercise in learning how to write about this material rigorously. Over all, it was an incredible and boundary-pushing course. "

            "\u00a0I say without exaggeration that this class astounded me every week. From the first few classes on Benjamin's \"Critique of Violence,\" which caused me to see the law in a completely different light, to the final classes on history and Proust, I felt that this class was the epitome of what a college course should be. Instead of assigning hundreds of pages of reading, the class gave only an essay or two per week. This format allowed for very in-depth analysis of these essays, which in the case of a writer like Benjamin paid off enormously. I got more out of spending three weeks on \"Critique of Violence\" than I have out of spending one week reading \"The Phenomenology of Spirit\" or some other dense work.\r\n\r\nFrom my vantage point, there are no weaknesses that I can identity. I would, however, suggest that in the next iteration of this class, we spend more time discussing flying baps. A brief mention of them in relation to the \"Language as Such\"  essay did not do them justice. ",
            "\u00a0A brilliant course. Seminar was fantastic and the reading list was incredible. Lecture was always interesting and discussion enlightening. The only complaint I have is that we could have moved slightly quicker. I liked that we took our time with texts but sometimes I felt we spent too much time on some texts. ",
            "\u00a0Very informative, very spectacle-like, definitely was concerned with relevant, pertinent issues, but could have used a bit more class participation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: an intensive and mind-bending exploration of one of the 20th century's most important thinkers, a deep dive into Chilean political/theoretical history, and a group of teachers  Profs. North and Thayer, and Vanessa Gubbins  who truly cared about the undergraduates in the class, making time to meet with them and encouraging them in their individual intellectual projects. I couldn't have asked for a better learning environment for the kind of intellectual mind-warp that this class turned out to be. \r\n\r\nThe (one) weakness: I do wish that there had been a liiittle more organization in how the syllabus was structured and when assignment details were posted  sometimes there was confusion re: how much of a particular text we had to read, or when the due dates for papers were, and I sometimes wished I had had more time to plan out my writing schedule. But other than that, I really have no complaints; this was an exciting and excellent class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Although this class in its current format will not be offered again, I would absolutely recommend it to another student. Professors North and Thayer were a fantastic duo, and the level of discussions that they created was unparalleled. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I doubt professor Thayer will come back but if he does you should absolutely take a course with him. As for Professor North, definitely take any course he teaches,  this one included. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly, not only for Marxist theorists, not only for Benjamin scholars, not only for German philosophy enthusiasts, but a great introduction to the aesthetics of scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You have to be ready to struggle with the material, though. Even if you've been taking humanities seminars throughout your entire time at Yale (which I have), this class will still throw you for a loop you'll find yourself questioning some of the fundamental assumptions by which you've learned to engage with your field, and you won't be able to approach any of your other classes in quite the same way again. (Which, of course, is what makes it all the more worthwhile.) "
