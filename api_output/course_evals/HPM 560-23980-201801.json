The professor tried to accommodate the students with prior knowledge in health economics by holding optional seminars on Wednesdays, but they were led by the TAs and just weren't the same as Professor Cooper's lectures.

            "\u00a0I liked this course a lot. It was a great overview of the healthcare industry and economic factors impacting it. I wish it had moved more quickly (although I know some of my peers felt it moved too quickly). It felt like we were repeating things we had already learned toward the end of the semester. I also know the professor wanted to invite discussion, but it is very hard to do that in a large class. I would recommend sticking to lecture style and simply cold-calling to keep students engaged. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths of  the course is that it encourages students to think outside of methodological or scientific side of public health and consider the public policy of implementing change in the health care system today. I also really value the memo writing skills though I wish we could have more experience in perfecting the skill as it is very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great as-is. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course this year was somewhat different from years past due to the large class size. This meant not only that there were fewer opportunities to ask questions, but also that we had fewer policy memos assigned. I think Prof. Cooper did a good job of encouraging us to ask questions and interrupt his lecture- that being said, only some students in the class are apt to do just that. \r\n\r\nI think in terms of policy memos, I didn't get as much feedback as I would have liked. Getting a 95 and one small comment slapped on a paper, even if it's good quality, can be a bit frustrating. If the class remains as large next year, I hope YSPH is able to provide more teaching fellows to the class so that we could complete more policy memos. I think adding 2 additional memos (while keeping one ungraded) would make the class more worthwhile, since that is the transferable skill that students gain from the class.  \r\n\r\nI also think the class could have been more challenging. This is tricky because people come in with different levels of knowledge of the US healthcare system, but I found myself only having to do minimal work to do well in the course. I think this problem was mitigated by including the optional section (which unfortunately didn't work for me schedule-wise)- maybe including something like that from the beginning would work well next time the class is taught. If the time is advertised at the beginning of the semester, interested students could plan their schedules accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was fantastic- even though our class contained more students than past years it was still extremely interactive and the content itself was readily applicable to the real world and outside course material. ",
            "\u00a0Good. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who had never taken a health policy course before, I loved it. The slides were thorough, articles were interesting, and the case studies were great. This class did exactly what it set out to do: utilize economic principles to help shape health policy. Despite not taking an economics course in years and a policy class at all, I never felt lost or out of place in this course. Often times, the 1 hour 50 minute time slot felt like just 1 hour since the class was so heavily engaged in discussion. The memos were challenging and forced us to think critically while helping strengthen our writing skills as they pertain to policy. ",
            "\u00a0good course on health policy ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should revert back to the former style with more frequent policy memos. The structure this year did not benefit policy students as much, and some non-HPM students who did not take Jason's course in the fall were sometimes behind. ",
            "\u00a0it's hard for students without related background, and the key points for every class are not so clear. ",
            "\u00a0If you hadn't taken Jason's course (HPM510), you were already light-years behind the rest of the class. This is more... econ-minded approach to current trends in health care, but without the background knowledge of how health care works, it would've have been really difficult to keep up. Just because so much of what was talked about would have gone over your head. As a non-HPM person who had taken HPM510, I at least knew what Medicare vs. Medicaid was, but some of my peers were clueless. And in class, there was no accommodation of that knowledge gap. Which makes no sense, because this is an alternative core course??? ",
            "\u00a0As my first policy course ever, I learned a ton. Learning the basic concepts in a contextual manner (us healthcare) was also valuable. Fun and engaging lectures. ",

            "\u00a0good information - definitely need to know ",
            "\u00a0it helps me a lot understanding the US health policy and economic system. Overall it is a good class and worth taking it.  But it is very difficult for international students with no backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0It is really difficult for international students who know little about healthcare system in the US  and basic economic knowledge. Some review sessions were really helpful. I tried very hard to understand the content of the lecture but I was still below the average. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic, and exams were very fair. The course could be improved by a few more assignments, as they seemed very spread out. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, would have loved it was more interactive but class size likely prohibited that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1. The class provided a good introduction to health care economics. Having not yet taken microeconomics, I felt comfortable taking this course. \r\n2. I was happy with the breadth of information covered. I am glad we studied everything from markets, to drug pricing, to insurance economics.\r\n3. The memo prompts were interesting and I feel like I walked away learning a lot of new material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n1. The class could have been taught at a higher level and include more microeconomics. In order for the class to be taught at a higher level, it should not be a core curriculum class. Professor Schwartz's class first semester is more appropriate as a core class.\r\n2.  The class size limited us to writing only 2 memos. I would have preferred to have more assignments to help me build my writing portfolio. \r\n3. I found the \"optional\" review sessions with TFs a frustrating format. If the information was important or of interest to the course, it should have been incorporated into normal class hours.  If there was not enough time to incorporate these topics into normal class hours, then the class should be restructured to a twice-per-week class, or there should be a weekly scheduled review session that is indicated on the class schedule online when registering for classes. Having 5+ unanticipated review sessions over the course of the semester conflicted with my outside-of-class schedule. \r\n4. The slides for the class were not consistently uploaded to Canvas before class time. Slides should be uploaded a few days before class so students can review them or print them out for note-taking (especially because Professor Cooper discourages laptops in class).\r\n5. The lecture on Health Care Economics (loading costs, risk aversion, certainty curve) was not well taught. The slides were extremely confusing and the lecture did not help. Many of the slides had errors on them.\r\n6. In general, the slides should be more carefully made. There were many typos which made studying difficult. In addition, many of the statistics should be updated with more recent numbers.\r\n7. Finally, students should not be responsible for purchasing the \"memos\" used for class assignments. The school should fund this cost. The method of \"emailing the professor if paying for the memo is a problem\" is not a good system. ",
            "\u00a0This course includes many useful economic concepts and theories, which makes this course very worth taking. However, there are several times that I feel hard to catch up with the lecturer's pace, it's just a little bit too fast. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are engaging; Memo assignments are challenging but rewarding; TF sessions were very informative and helpful.\r\nWeaknesses: The course was 'econ-lite' (though Professor Cooper and the TFs knew this and arranged the sessions in response); there could have been more work. ",
            "\u00a0The course really started out strongly and I was/ am very impressed by Dr. Cooper's knowledge of the field and truly frontline research on the subject matter. Not having taken an economics course in the past, I learned a great deal of information and became certainly more knowledgable on the current literature - and thus able to use that knowledge to inform decisions/opinions of policy responses. I wish there was more discussion in the class - which I understand is limited by the class size. I also wish we could have written more memos; I took the class for this particular skill and really wanted to write more. I feel that, in some ways, the students who were really interested in the topic got the short end of the stick because of the large class size. I do not think this course should be open as an introductory to health policy course. ",
            "\u00a0I like the form of discussion and TFs are really helpful ",
            "\u00a0I definitely think this will be one of the most useful courses I take in the MPH program. The ability to write a policy memo is a great skill that I have already had to use in internship interviews. I feel like I have been able to use the material learned in this class to enhance discussions in other classes/ in extracurricular settings. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well designed, and topics are fully developed. Students are encouraged to actively participate in class. Memos are good for applying what we have learned from class into real-life scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0It was relatively econ heavy, but concepts were explained well and students were given plenty of opportunity to receive extra help. The policy briefs were good assignments but the grades differed somewhat among TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was held back by not having micro-economics as a pre-requisite. As a result, students who had taken micro and health systems in the previous semester were held back. I did not feel that this course furthered my understanding of economics. There could have been a better incorporation of micro-economics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a tour de force of topics relevant to health policy from an economist's lens. \r\nWeaknesses: not enough time spent on the nuts and bolts of health economics (which given the nature of the course makes sense). Some of the information could have been updated to be more relevant. A paper on the affordable care exchanges  from 2011 seemed dated. More papers like the one covering the CT individual mandate bill would be great. ",
            "\u00a0the course was awesome, and garnered a lot of great discussion and made me think a lot outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of key issues in health policy and economics.  A smaller or more advanced level course would have permitted more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure why this course is a requirement for HPM, as it seems to be just a combination of Jason's course + Micro. ",
            "\u00a0Good ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic, eye-opening, and informative lecture course. Prof. Coopers lectures were extremely well prepared, entertaining, and fascinating. The course also provides excellent training in policy communication through policy brief assignments (having a few more of these throughout the semester might make this course even better). The course also gives a glimpse into how research turns into health policy, something that other health management courses do not emphasize. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Appreciated the broad range of topics. Weaknesses: He often didn't talk in plain language/define himself because a lot of students come from a variety of backgrounds. Sometimes it felt like people were trying to prove how much they knew rather than it being an environment for learning. Small group work might be helpful in allowing people to engage more. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! It is not quantitative, but rather allows you to get some experience writing policy memos. People come into the class with different levels of background knowledge on healthcare in the US, but the TFs and Zack get everyone up to speed. Not too much work, just weekly reading most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course at all YSPH students, not just those who are in HPM/HCM. I think it provides essential information all public health professionals should understand when navigating the U.S health system and economic/political spheres. ",
            "\u00a0Good. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to students in any department. As a non-policy student, I firmly believe that understanding health policy is crucial for success in any area of public health. This class has a perfect blend of class discussion, memos, and readings to give you a good understanding of the issues surrounding US health policy. I think the most important aspect of this course is its emphasis on considering both sides of an issue in depth, regardless of your stance on the issue. Especially in today's political climate, knowing and fundamentally understanding the opposing view is the best bet to push your own ideas and proposals. The memos and discussions certainly help with that, and I have been able to apply this sort of thinking outside the classroom while working on other projects. ",
            "\u00a0a good course but also not a easy course ",
            "\u00a0It's hard for students without related knowledge and background. ",
            "\u00a0Take HPM510. Unless you're going into health economics, this isn't necessary for gaining an appreciation and awareness (and frustration) at the complexity of health care. ",
            "\u00a0Course is as advertised. Might be a bit challenging for someone with little to no policy/Econ background. Would recommend though to anyone in a healthcare-related field, as a tool to provide perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great overview of health economics and how it applies to public health and health care ",
            "\u00a0recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Overall it is a good class and worth taking it.  The topics are interesting but very difficult for international students with no backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Really useful ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured very well and covered many important topics. This was a pleasant Econ. experience after a not-so-pleasant last semester. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive of health Econ. May be a little difficult for those who never took an Econ course or havent taken one in a while. Exams were very fair! ",
            "\u00a0Will recommend. Although it's workload is not small, but I really learnt the things that I need. Besides, although our Professor seems not care so much about international students' feedback, I still think his knowledge level and course design is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0This course explores various health policy issues through an economic lens. For students with previous economic experience and/or with previous health policy experience this course will be engaging though perhaps a tad easy; for students without such experiences, this course would likely be quite a bit harder. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for students with an interest in health/ health care economics and students will certainly learn a great deal of information. However, if you have taken Jason Schwartz' intro to policy course, there is some repetition involved and therefore I do not think this course should be offered as a way to fulfill the core policy requirement. There is some practicing of skills in writing memos, but ultimately not as much as I hoped for. I would recommend it but also recommend going to the additional sessions with the TFs if you are particularly interested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0It is a course that worth taking. You would learn a lot about American healthcare system. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I think it is essential for all MPH students. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course. It is good for students from all kinds of backgrounds, and it has office hours helping the student summarize and learn knowledge from other fields. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! To learn more about econ and healthcare in a very engaging class ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must take for someone looking to work in health policy or consulting who has a weak background in economics. It will challenge your firmly held beliefs and teach you how to more effectively argue your stance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that the topics are great. would have loved to have it be a little more advanced and was hoping it would dive deeper into microecon, but overall great course. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of issues in health policy and economics.  I recommend taking this only if you have an interest in these topics. ",
            "\u00a0Helpful to take ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent lecture-based course, that has some essential lessons to teach to future economists, policymakers, doctors, scientists, and public health practitioners. I absolutely recommend this class for anyone who is considering a career in anything related to health. ",
            "\u00a0A class on healthcare economics. Overall I would recommend it because you will learn a lot and will be able to engage and critically think about healthcare issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, understanding the economics of health insurance, access to health care, etc is imperative for students of public health "
