            "\u00a0This was the first political science seminar that I took at Yale and it taught me a lot about speaking in front of a group and how to read effectively so that I was always prepared for class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding of the criminal justice system and its current challenges as well as the less present but major challenge of wrongful convictions. ",
            "\u00a0I read really all of the current literature on wrongful convictions as it pertains to the United States and abroad. We engaged in higher-level discussion of judicial responsibility and democracy. We did not shy away from the scientific aspects of wrongful convictions, either (DNA). I truly left this class feeling like I know all that there is to know with respect to Wrongful Convictions ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many things about the criminal justice system and the role that wrongful convictions play. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the in depth systems of the criminal justice system. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me all about the United Statwa criminal justice system and the factors that lead to wrongful convictions. ",
            "\u00a0Wrongful Convictions, their causes, the criminal justice system, reform procedures for Wrongful convictions ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course allows you to learn about the intricacies of wrongful convictions: why they happen, how they happen, what steps can be taken to reduce them. The course material and readings are not the type of information that is very discussed, so it's great that this class exists. The discussions were always very insightful and made me think -- even after the seminars ended every Friday, I'd be thinking about a question or a trend we found hours after. It was probably my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about wrongful convictions and how they occur. ",
            "\u00a0This class fundamentally changed the way I view and approach the American legal system. Fascinating material and engaging format. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Sometimes it felt a little too much like a lecture, but the topics we learned about were all super interesting and the readings were well thought-out. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was excellent and well put together by Professor Parndigamage. It was clear that she deeply cares about this issue and put a lot of thought into the syllabus. The weekly presentations I thought really added a lot to the course. I think the paper presentations were okay and the feedback was somewhat helpful, but I do fell like that those two classes could have been better used discussing some of the prominent themes from the semester rather than be devoted to the presentations. It never really seemed like there was a conclusion to the class (perhaps that speaks to the ongoing challenge of wrongful convictions!). Perhaps shorter, more concise overviews of the research questions and key findings could be quickly presented during one of those two classes, and the other could be used as a big picture class. But overall, I don't think there is much that needs improvement. The course worked really well, and especially loved the addition of guest speakers and the documentaries. ",
            "\u00a0The reading load is incredibly manageable, especially for a seminar. It is all accessible and easy to understand. Discussion was pretty fluid with leaders each class. I learned a lot. I wish feedback were a little more comprehensive and consistent. Grading, at times, appeared slightly arbitrary. I did take a lot away from this class though. ",
            "\u00a0No improvements, great course! ",
            "\u00a0The subject material was incredible interesting. The only recommendation I could make (sorry to future students) would actually be maybe 1 or 2 more reading responses to develop deeper engagement with the readings before class. ",
            "\u00a0I think class discussion needs to be structured more in the direction of debate. Sometimes it felt like we got solution oriented too early in discussion and with out enough background information. ",
            "\u00a0The class was set up in a way that was straight forward, and Dean P. made her expectations clear from the start! The material was really well organized and manageable, and I appreciate how smooth the class went the entire semester. I also thought that the syllabus was really helpful in guiding students towards their final paper, and I genuinely got to know several of the other students in the class. A great experience! ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. The readings were so interesting and Dean P did a great job making it an enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Dean P, the readings and the class discussions \r\nWeaknesses: Friday 9am ",
            "\u00a0The section was always lively and it was clear that people were really engaging with the readings. The small size of the class and the gravity of the topics discussed made it almost inevitable that the discussions went so well. Every class would be about a different topic e.g. DNA testing for one seminar, and Prosecutorial Misconduct for another seminar. \r\n\r\nFor the class you have one long research paper, two reading responses and one presentation. The work is not bad, especially considering how you have freedom to write about what you want to write about; so, it is easy to be engaged with the work you are doing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this course was interesting and designed to be accessible to undergraduates. The guest speakers were exceptional and contributed to overall comprehension of the material and interest in the course.\r\nWeaknesses: This class was taught in a social-jusitce-war manner. Many of the students' comments were along the lines of \"Oh poor America, how awful everything is,\" which were usually augmented by the professor. I have no experience in this subject beyond the class, but it seems unlikely that simply lamenting the state of America is the best way to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0So engaging, LOVED the guest speakers, and great material. Only downside was the early morning start. "

            "\u00a0Yes, the class is very organized and the topics are all super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- Dean P is a fantastic professor and it is abundantly clear that she really, really cares about the topic of wrongful convictions. I learned so much from this course, and it has to rank as one of the best- if not the best- classes I have taken at Yale. The syllabus was well organized, and the weekly discussion leaders really worked to make the class engaging and the conversations lively. The guest speakers that Dean P brought in, including a man wrongfully convicted and imprisoned for a crime in New Haven he did not commit, really added depth to the conversations over the course. Dean P is super invested in the class and in each of the students and gave significant feedback on assignments throughout the term. I leave the course with a much deeper understanding of wrongful convictions and a drive to do something to fix the problem. I cannot recommend this course highly enough!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are at all interested in this topic, you should take the class. I am happy that I did. I feel like a more informed citizen as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Professor Parndigamage is very engaging and leads a productive and interesting conversation. The material itself is really interesting and the guest speakers added so much! ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT. Dean P is amazing and the course material is information every citizen should know and analyze. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very important material to understand politics in the United States. We need more courses on this type of material! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! While there is certainly a lot of law topics, it is represented in a way that any student could engage, participate, and learn, and the material is fascinating! Dean P. is wonderful: she is stricter than many political science professors I've had in the past, but she gives you a lot of feedback that will help as the seminar goes on. A truly wonderful experience and definitely recommended for anyone hwo wants to take a deeper look into the criminal justice system! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it if you can get in because it is super interesting and my favorite class I've taken at Yale. All around amazing. ",
            "\u00a0You must take this class! You will understand so much about the criminal justice system, Wrongful Convictions and how you can impact the system positively. You'll learn something new everyte you engage with this class ",
            "\u00a0I'd highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in the criminal justice system or law or just people in general. The class itself was something that I looked forward to -- even despite it being a Friday 9:25am seminar. All of the factors combined  Dean P, the course readings, and the other engaged students in the class made it so worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! every person should take this course regardless of career goals ",
            "\u00a0Things to consider: This is NOT a law class.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the class features amazing guest speakers, namely a exonerated man, a law professor, and a local prosecutor. There are two wonderful films screened with the course, which aid in comprehension. Dean P. is very kind and does a nice job presenting the material. \r\n\r\nThe grading is neither extremely hard nor easy. On a 1-10 scale of difficulty, with 10 being hard, the class would be a 7. \r\n\r\nRecommendation: Take it ",
            "\u00a0Fully recommend this class. Wish everyone at Yale could take it. So important and interesting. "
