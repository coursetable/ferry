",

I think something that would be nice is if the instructors sent us their questions at the end of the week, and then we could send them back after like two weeks. It would be nice to have that ongoing feedback instead of a final, but that's just me personally. ",
            "\u00a0The subject variety was good because of the team-taught structure. I think there could have been more feedback throughout the course, and practice answering questions that would be similar to the test. For me, there was a disconnect between what we learned in the lecture portion, the paper discussion portion, and the exam question for many of the topics. ",
