            "\u00a0I think this improved my ability to read primary sources. It also completely transformed the way that I view Russia's relationship with Asia and Russian foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0The progression of the relationship between Russia and Asia prior to the Russian Revolution. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about cultures I had never heard of in central asia as well as about the interactions between Russia and Asia in the pre-Soviet era ",
            "\u00a0The biggest thing I learned was doing research from a limited array of sources from a region that has not be intensely studied. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned many facts about pre-soviet Russian interaction with the Steppe. However, more importantly, I learned about the narratives that connect this information and how this Russian story connects with the world around it. We read many primary sources and developed analytical skills surrounding them. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of the Russian state's interactions with the nomadic people of Eastern and Central Asia from the time of Kievan Rus' to the Russo-Japanese War. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the development of the Russian state and nation, Russia's interactions with peoples on its eastern and southern frontiers, and how Russians have defined \"Russian-ness\" throughout history.  I also developed my skills as an analytical reader, writer, and discussion leader. "

            "\u00a0You learn so much in this course. One of the strengths is simply how much more you know about the topic than when you started it. I think it could be improved by strengthening some of the seminar discussions, but much of this depends on student participation. ",
            "\u00a0This class would be a much better lecture than a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Wish the professor had stayed on topic more. His digressions were sometimes interesting but also at times pretty disconnected from the what we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course covered critical events throughout the Eurasian Steppes history, giving me a much better grasp of the region ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-run and very-well taught overall. The course material was interesting, and the amount of reading each week was always manageable. Professor Bushkovitch also did a great job with facilitating student engagement and participation during the seminars, while also delivering in-depth overviews and interesting insights himself. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the material itself, I'd recommend adding some contextual reading material about the reforms of Peter the Great and the changes they brought to Russian society, as this felt somewhat glossed over, and may have provided a more detailed frame for analyzing later interactions with the peoples of the steppe. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its incredible professor, engaging readings, and interesting assignments.  I would have liked a bit more guidance regarding the final paper. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent course. I am SO happy that I took it. I have to admit, the first three weeks have fairly dense reading (mainly because the topic is almost entirely unfamiliar). However, if you can make it through those weeks, the rest of the class is incredible. Professor Buskovitch is unbelievable. His knowledge and grasp of this subject never ceased to amaze me. DEFINITELY TAKE THIS. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. Although interesting material, the course is not presented very well. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're really interested in the topic and come in with some solid background knowledge. The professor assumes a fairly high level of knowledge about Russian history coming in ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Bushkovitch is the most expert on this region and there is an incredible amount of knowledge to be gained from him. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who seriously enjoys history. The course is focused on the narratives of Russia and the East that comprise a rich dialogue between people. The course will make you a better historical thinker and give you a better understanding of the Russian experience. In addition, the readings are the best I have seen. You will never be assigned more reading than is necessary to understand and the reading itself is often a mix of a solid background text and a primary flavor text that gives you better insight. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! I personally find the topic to be incredibly interesting. Bushkovitch is honestly great, if a little intimidating at first. He's so incredibly knowledgeable about everything Russia that he could also keep the discussion going and take it into a really interesting mini-lecture about the oddness of the Mongolian communist revolution or something equally strange like that, and he's also really funny. The workload was actually pretty light for a seminar, and the amount of reading was really reasonable. I'm thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I'm sure that anyone else would as well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if they are interested in the subject material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely.  Anyone interested in understanding Russia before 1900 needs to take this course. "
