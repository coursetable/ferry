            "\u00a0I learned quite a lot about basic film theory, the transition of film to literature, and lot about Italian culture and history that was covered in the content of the literature/film that we discussed. ",

            "\u00a0I think the format of the class, screenings + discussions + papers, was ideal and really fit the seminar mold. Prof. Marcus is definitely a highlight of the course, balancing sharing her vast knowledge of these works with us while allowing us to steer the discussion as well. If anything could be improved, it would perhaps be to move the time up slightly since getting out of class at 5:20 -- or sometimes a little later when discussion got heated -- could run into conflict with other events or meetings. ",
            "\u00a0We probably watched one Pasolini film too many. ",
            "\u00a0Attention to primary materials was exciting and support articles were top notch. As the class was taught in English by the chair of the Italian department a critical analysis of translations used for reading primary materials was possible. This was fascinating and exciting. Readings were done in both Italian and English with both languages always available to read along and the instructor was seamlessly able to incorporate this practice without adding confusion or taxing the students without the Italian language. A background in Classical literature was infused in the instruction which made deep and layered engagement with the works possible. \r\n\r\nClass would run over a little at times but only a little ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses!\r\nProfessor Marcus never fails to lead engaging discussions. They were always so interesting and I loved having a two hour chunk to discuss the films with a great group of students. "

            "\u00a0Professor Marcus is so passionate about this subject matter and dedicated to student learning. It is a joy to be in this seminar with her. ",
            "\u00a0You should absolutely take this course or any class with Prof. Marcus! She is wonderful and will really make your liberal arts curriculum at Yale feel real. The class is structured to screenings on Mondays, seminar on Wednesdays about the screening, with a book a week that corresponds with the film. The other assignments are a short 5-page paper on a topic regarding one of the films we've watched together and the final is a 10-12 page paper on a topic of your choice, though a case study of literature to film transition is recommended. The movies can be a little weird at the beginning, but the discussions are really very interesting, and were made accessible both to people who've taken a lot of film courses before and people like me who've never taken any. The readings are also very doable and many toward the end of the semester were really really good--the ones at the beginning are also good, but my personal preference was for the more modern books. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Professor Marcus is an amazing professor that cares deeply for her students and the class offers a great opportunity to indulge in comparative studies of a text vs its visual, film form. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Clear understanding of assignments! Fascinating! Exciting instruction and discussions in the class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Marcus always led spirited discussions that allowed everyone in the course to participate, and I thoroughly enjoyed the screenings, readings, and every single class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Professor Marcus/students in the class always had so much to say and many of the films/readings are excellent. "
