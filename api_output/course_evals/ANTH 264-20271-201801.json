            "\u00a0I learned more about Aztec history and culture. I thought I had an understanding of the people, but lectures about gods, rituals, and daily life showed me there is still much to learn. "

            "\u00a0It was a bit disorganized - maybe if the weeks had clearer themes I would've learned better and been more engaged. \r\nCovered a lot of ground and was truly fascinating. Chinchilla is clearly a specialist and is good at explaining concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Some very very interesting material if you enjoy history and mythology, but the presentation of the material was sometimes a little dry. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would've been better if taught as a seminar than a lecture, just because a lot of the lectures involved reading primary source documents in class, which would've been better as assigned readings to be discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material was very interesting, but I don't think it was presented as well as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was that the course was very interactive due to the weekly field trips that we had. I really appreciated using the resources that Yale has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0I found the material interesting, but lectures were hard to follow. The overarching themes were outlined in the readings, but at the end of lecture I never had a sense of the bigger picture or how any one topic fit in with everything else. I did appreciate the trips we took to museums and libraries around campus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is pretty small so I felt comfortable asking questions and delving deeper into a topic. Although it was a pretty small class, I wish there were more interactive activities that took place in the classroom, although class field trips were very interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: Reading workloads were somewhat hard to manage, weekly quizzes could have prepared us for discussion and been study guides for exams. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Oswaldo and Nick are great. It is a really niche class and it uses yale's resources to the best of its ability. There was even a field trip to the MET in which we got to present about objects at the museum. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Oswaldo is a terrific professor and its a very interesting topic, even if youre not interested in archaeology. The class also takes engaging field trips ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a class provides a space to learn about a people that do not usually get classes taught about them in places like Yale. It is a good immersion into early Mexican culture. ",
