            "\u00a0Besides learning so much about Cuban history and culture, I love that this class also gave me a new perspective on Latin America and international relations, and government... and the list goes on. The trip was such a unique thing to have as part of a class and it was integral to our learning and I cannot say how grateful I am that we had that experience. ",
            "\u00a0If  you can get into this class, TAKE IT. The trip is nice and sells itself, but what people do not write about is the amazing structure of this course. Funes and Laguna provide wide ranging materials on most topics one might be interested in about Cuba. I never felt overwhelmed by the material, and to top it off if you really like certain topic they have extra material to help you learn and grow. Sure, its a good deal of work but you get so much out of it if you put the work in. Laguna is a master of language and culture; Funes, history and agriculture. They are a dynamic duo that must not be missed. If this course does not go to Cuba anymore it will be a huge loss, but even if it does not go, take it. The Caribbean is a region understudied at Yale and in general and everyone should engage with it if possible. Yale has so many resources to learn from rare, primary sources and this class ensures you learn how to use them well. ",
            "\u00a0This class went through the entire history of Cubaimportant to me specifically because of my Cuban descent. What I'm most proud of learning, however, is applying critical theory and humanities to my own experience: my background, my stories, and my past. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class. You will, obviously, learn a lot about Cuba and develop a more complex perspective about the country. You will also participate in an AMAZING two week trip to Cuba, which will be fun and interesting. But most importantly, I think that learning is best done through communities, and Professors Laguna, Professor Funes, and Maile do a great job of building that space. Before you come to Yale, everyone tells you that you will learn more from your friends than the classroom; ER&M 293 gives you the best of both. I didn't think I would make any new friends in my senior spring, but this class gave me that space and I am academically all the better for it. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the few classes that gives you the opportunity, through the trip, to test the theory you learn in class. It's often easy to forget that some of things we read about in our classes have real application on the ground, and this class teaches you that in an amazing, indispensable way. ",
            "\u00a0I received greater insight about Cuba and it history in culture in the context of the US and the entire world. We received a thorough overview about the history of cuba from Columbus to the 1990s, stopping along the way to recognize and reference different important aspects of Cuban culture such as literature, music, dance, comedy, and so forth. ",
            "\u00a0You can read about a place and study it for months. You can dissect the literature of critics and look at the political history. You can analyze the theories behind economics and try to wrap your head around conceptions of race that you cant seem to map onto anything you know,  but this can only get you so far. Books open doors to new places, but traveling,  experiencing what a place is like and being immersed in its history and culture at every turn, does so much more.  This is something that we experienced first hand with our trip to Cuba. \r\nThe time that we had leading up to the trip we were getting dates and names, facts and theories in order to help us construct a more accurate two dimensional image of Cuba. However, they say that if we lived in a two dimensional universe, we could never accurately comprehend what a three dimensional universe would be like, and I think that the same goes for studying a place without ever seeing and experiencing it. Once we were in Cuba I quickly realized that all the reading in the world could not completely capture the beauty and complexity of the place, both in this recent moment and in its past. In real life, things  are not as clear cut as they seem to be in peer reviewed papers and history textbooks. These  things prepared me to think critically and to  have background on what I was seeing and experiencing, but the readings and lectures in class could never replace the experience of actually being in Cuba. \r\nThrought the course, but especially while in Cuba, it was interesting to see what stories were told and how they were told depending on who had control of the narrative. Understanding how global trade, embargoes and food shortages affect everyday life was something else that we learned about in class but did not fully grasp until what it was like until experiencing it ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an overview of Cuba: politics, history, health, culture, literature, religion, race, etc. You will be able to hold your ground in a cocktail and academic discussion alike relating to Cuba. If you get to go to Cuba, you will bond with Yalies in a non-Yale context (always a good thing) and make amazing friends! My only regret was not getting to know the class better outside of class before the trip. "

            "\u00a0Amazing course. I was lucky enough to have Laguna, Funes, Maile, and all the other scholars we heard from while in Cuba to learn from and stepping outside of the classroom to experience Cuba for myself was just incredible. ",
            "\u00a0If  you can get into this class, TAKE IT. The trip is nice and sells itself, but what people do not write about is the amazing structure of this course.

            "\u00a0This is an extraordinary course. It's able to focus on both the historical and cultural aspects of Cuba. It breaks down stereotypes on all ends of the political spectrum, and everyone leaves the class with a more complex, nuanced view of the Cuban situation. ",
            "\u00a0The class felt a little disjointed between the Funes and Laguna sections, but for the most part I was glad to have the opportunity to tackle Cuban history and culture from two professors who I deeply admire and who, after we all went to Cuba together, I really got close to. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the trip to Cuba. The weakness: there is no time! Also I feel as if the trip, although amazing, could be better if we went to more places in the 2 weeks we were there (I.e less time in Havana) or shortening to 1 week and spending a few days in Miami, because understanding the Cuban American diaspora is also really important for the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is amazing!! Obviously, the trip to Cuba is huge strength and provides an opportunity that we were privileged to have. The trip not only augmented our understanding of the material and capacities, but I would consider a huge strength to be the bonds that I formed with my classmates as well as the professors and with resources at Yale. I love my classmates, and the strengths of professor Laguna as a cultural studies expert and Professor Funes as an environmental historian were both well utilized. I also became much more familiar with resources at the MacMillan center as well as Sterling with Jana. I feel the course could be improved by adding a slight language requirement on the course (maybe L3+) as this would allow for students to read a wider expanse of materials from the Cuban viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0Our time in Cuba helped to create a clearer,  more in depth picture of what we learned in a classroom setting.  The two complemented each other, because the people and experiences on the ground teach you just as much, if not more than economic and political theory could. In class we only had from 2:30 to 3:45, two days a week to cover over 200 years of Cuban History...In the words of Professor Funes there isn't enough time. There never seems to be enough time or space to squeeze Cuba into our small classroom, and so I am so glad that we have had the opportunity and privilege to open the door and step into a new world of understanding through scholarship and experience. I loved that our professors spit the calss time we had evenly. My one cirtique that I have, is that for most of the historical background we relied on one text book for the \"facts\". There were some suppliments but it was clear before getting to Cuba but especially after getting there that the text book is written in a specific lense. It may be good to diversify this historical narrative a little more though it would not be the endo of the world if you continued to only use Gott as long as other suppliments continue to be used and the discussion is opened in class that this is ONE historical account and though relativly detailed not completly comprehensive (and also what he chooses to focus on is influenced by his Western Lense). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Laguna and Funes are opposite sides of the same coin and will become your favorite co-parents. Their personal and academic backgrounds alike make it so that they come at the material in different ways, and their dynamic is very balanced. Funes is excitable zaddy, the yesman who will encourage you to go off and explore. Laguna is grounded papi, the voice of reason who will keep you (and everyone else) on track. The course fulfills its purpose\r\nWeaknesses: there is so much information crammed to make a through overview such that very little time is left for student seminar discussion, which is a real shame. It ended up feeling like more of a lecture. The reading responses are not so bad as they are questions, not reviews - just get them done on time. "

            "\u00a0YES. YES. YES. I cannot say enough good things about this course. Not only is the subject matter fascinating, but the class is engaging, and honestly a once in a lifetime experience with the trip. This class really challenged my views on Cuba, Latin America, and just opened my eyes to a broader perspective I never would have considered before this class and the trip. Would 100% recommend. This class is so worth it. ",

            "\u00a0Everyone student at Yale should try to take this course. The instructors, TF, other students, reading material, discussion, and trip to Cuba were all absolutely incredible. This is a life changing, once in a lifetime course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely absolutely take this course. Go to Cuba. Make friends with Laguna and Funes. Get close with your class. Learn about Cuba and about yourself!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a million times over. You will not have better, more supportive, or more intellectually engaging professors at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was one of the most enriching academic experiences I've had at Yale. There are few courses where you get to travel to the places that you study about. Please, please take this course if it is offered again. It is a gem! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! It will change your life. Being able to apply theory on the ground is a rare opportunity. Plus, Prof. Funes and Prof. Laguna are simply amazing. I was lucky to have a great set of classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! I've made some of my best friends at Yale, got paid to travel to another country, and feel that I've grown as a student. ",
            "\u00a0I would most certianly recomend this calss to another student and I genuinly hope that yale keeps the program going for years to come. This calss was one of the most amazing experiences of my life. It has helped me to learn so much and is by far one of the best courses I have ever taken. It is one of the greatest highlights not only of my yale experience but my educational experience. I am so glad that we have had the opportunity and privilege to open the door and step into a new world of understanding through scholarship and experience. From this experience I learned just as much, if not more outside of the classroom and during our free time to explore during the trip as I did in the calssroom. Not to take this course or to stop offering it would be one of the greatest mistakes that could be made. If I could take this class again every year I would do it in a heart beat. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, travelling to Cuba provides an invaluable hands-on approach to seeing everything we've learned about and more in context. While one cannot hope to completely understand a country in two weeks, it provides a taste that opens up many opportunities for students to think critically. This is very helpful for their praxis or future research in Cuba, which becomes increasingly important given US-Cuban relations. There are a lot of interesting dynamics worth exploring and I implore Yale that all efforts be made to keep the Spring Break portion of the class intact for future generations of curious Yale students wanting to step away from the bubble.
