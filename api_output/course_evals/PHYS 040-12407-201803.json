            "\u00a0I learned a lot about our current theories of the universe and models of expansion. I learned a lot about dark energy, dark matter, and supernovae, and from our guest lectures, about AI, particle physics, and gravitational lensing. Skills I developed included how to read scientific papers, how to write scientific papers, and how there can be differing ideas for explaining the same set of data. Professor Urry gave us interesting anecdotes about her experiences in science, and in doing so, gave us invaluable knowledge about what doing science in the modern world is like. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about astrophysics, the contents of the universe, and the universe works. It was incredibly interesting and I learned many things I never thought I would. I also learned quite a bit about how science and research is conducted. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about black holes, dark energy and matter, basic cosmology, and interesting experiments done to further our understanding of the universe. I also learned a lot about science in general and how it actually plays out in the world of academia. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course with little knowledge about the universe, and left having learned a little bit about everything. We talked about inflation, galaxy formation, black holes, and much more. We also learned about the scientific process and research. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immesurable amount about how science works. From the technicalities of graduate students to the proposal and funding process, Professor Urry explained this wide-ranging topic through her own fascinating personal experiences. Professor Urry taught us how to engage with complex scientific ideas and texts and develop an understanding of ideas which I previously thought only STEM majors could understand. The scientific content of the course was also wonderful. Professor Urry did a wonderful job of selecting relevant cutting-edge ideas to focus on and was masterful in her explanations of them. I was so amazed by some of the things I learned in this class that I definitely want to take more classes that explore those topics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed presentation skills regarding giving scientific talks and poster presentations, knowledge about the workings of science and how to read scientific papers, and insights and understanding about how our universe behaves. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how scientific research is conducted and what researchers study in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics. I learned a lot about different astronomical concepts that made physics seem really interesting including relativity and black holes. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about scientific research and a lot about different topics about in astrophysics ",
            "\u00a0I learned a much greater knowledge of the universe itself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a general overview of a lot of relevant and interesting topics regarding cosmology, astronomy, and astrophysics. ",
            "\u00a0I understand more clearly the applications of general relativity, and methods used by cosmologists to explore the universe. I also gained insights into what it means to be a good scientist  beyond just scientific knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about astrophysics and specifically dark matter because that's what I did for my research project. I also learned a lot about what being a scientist means and entails. Most of the class revolved around asking good questions and generating good discussion about topics in astrophysics which was really cool. "

            "\u00a0This course gave qualitative descriptions of very lofty and complicated concepts, helping us create a strong picture of what the universe looks like and how our understanding of it has changed over time. I wish this class was a little bit more quantitative so that the qualitative descriptions made more sense. At the same time, I wish Professor Urry gave us more guidance in how to read a scientific paper, since most of us have had very little experience with it. The language is terse and often abbreviated, and the figures given are meaningless without an understanding of what each figure represents. That being said, the course was a very strong introduction to cosmology, giving us an overview of the main concepts in it and where future research will take it. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course I took freshmen year! Although, the concepts may be hard to grasp, the class itself is every engaging. At times, readings were hard because it was from scientific papers. However, the discussion that took place was every enriching. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size was ideal and made learning very intimate. The course had essentially no weaknesses and was very engaging. It was my favorite course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Students have a lot of freedom in what topics they would like to discuss.\r\nWeaknesses: Every student has a different level of physics knowledge, so come concepts were brushed over making the basic understanding of the greater idea a little shaky. Also, directions on projects were not clear all the time. Students found themselves confused before a deadline because they weren't really sure what was going on. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very discussion based and we had many opportunities to ask questions. At times the information can get a little boring, but the small, engaged class made up for that. ",
            "\u00a0By bringing in experts in each topic area, we had someone to whom we could ask almost any question. Professor Urrys ability to condense profoundly advanced scientific topics into sentences that first-years could understand was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that we developed a comprehensive understanding of the workings of our universe through captivating articles and guest speakers. This course could be improved by having assignments that require more critical thinking, analysis, or independent research. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been better if we had spent a little more time on each topic to make sure we understood them a little better. It also would have been helpful to have clearer guidelines for the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course is overall really strong and wouldn't change anything ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It really focused on what we wanted to learn. The readings could have been less challenging. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is definitely having a small enough size so that all of students could give presentations on individual topics that we delved deeper into. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is incredible and she is highly involved with the students. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed when other professors visited to explain certain specialized areas of cosmology and answer our questions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include its low workload but very stimulating discussions in class. Another strength is the small class size because it's a seminar so everyone gets to know the professor pretty well. There is also a research project where you research any topic in astrophysics and I learned a lot from my own research. I can't really think of anything to improve the course. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is accessible to both STEM majors and non-STEM majors, being very qualitative but still going very deep conceptually into supernovae, power spectra, dark energy, dark matter, et cetera. For anyone interested in the universe at large, this is a perfect class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It was incredibly interesting and very fun to go to class. Additionally, the material covered was something I would never have learned anywhere else. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing freshman seminar! It is a great overview into a very important topic that I think many people shy away from. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was by far my favorite class this semester. I would especially recommend this class for non-STEM majors who are interested in learning about cool scientific topics. This course constantly teaches you things that will amaze and surprise you but does not require any prior knowledge of science and math. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student since it was my favorite course this term. Not only was it incredibly interesting, but it was highly educational as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly if it is taught by Professor Urry. It is super interesting and while the workload is not very heavy, you still learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was well engaging with just enough workload ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course made me think in ways I did not know possible. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are remotely interested in astronomy even as a hobby, you will likely really enjoy this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, anyone interested in the description of this course will find that the course fulfills all the expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who would like to learn about cosmology and would like to know more about what it means to be a good scientist ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure! If you are at all interested in astrophysics or how the universe works/came to be, this is the class for you, regardless of what you want to major in. You will learn a lot about the universe and the discussion in this class are very interesting. Professor Urry also brought in a couple speakers who specialize in certain astrophysics topics that she doesn't know too much in so we get a very good overview of astrophysics. "
