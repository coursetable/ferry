            "\u00a0I think that the tests are often poorly written and it could be improved by having the practice tests follow the same format as the actual tests so that way the format doesn't throw us off and we can focus on grammar and vocabulary and the like. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly well-taught and geared towards intensive learning. While concepts are difficult to teach, I feel Julia is quite good at explaining most of them. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very engaging and informative and I cannot thing of anything negative about the class. ",
            "\u00a0I like how the class was so small, so we had ample opportunity to ask questions. This made learning a lot easier. I think the course could be improved by giving the students a bit more conversational practice during class time. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it. The Slavic department here is great, and you really learn a lot from this class. All of the knowledge builds on past knowledge, so you are alqays reviewing old material. "
