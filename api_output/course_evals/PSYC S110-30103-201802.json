            "\u00a0I have taken more than 25 credits at Yale, and this is probably the class where I was given the most realistic expectation of the class. On the first day of Class, Professor Strickland said he wanted to give us the skill set needed to critique any psychology paper.That is exactly what we got. All those studies on human behavior in the NYT that no one understood by psychology majors? I understand that now, thanks to this course, and I got exactly what I was promised out of it. I wish I could say the same about all my Yale Classes. This class makes me wish I had majored in Psychology instead of political science. ",

            "\u00a0The most basic concepts of psychology is perfectly taught on the course. Psychology, as an experimental science, is introduuced. The course provide the scientific side and the emotional side of this subject. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a broad and topical overview of the science of psychology. In taking this course, I learned about landmark psychological studies, the newly discovered \"replicability crisis\", how to persuade, the historical relationship and debate between rationalism and empiricism, computationalism and modularity as they apply to the human brain, the object concept and early human development, linguistic basis in genetic predisposition, experimental ethics, and the monism vs. dualism debate, among many other topics. I feel that I come away from this course with a better understanding of a psychologist's approach to questions and theories, and how to design a viable psychological study. ",

            "\u00a0I hope there would be more class discussion which evolves all students. But I really like the group project and how students are engaged in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The slides that the professor sent contained many interesting knowledges but not all of them were given lectures, so maybe restructuring the slides would help students to learn more. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to learn more about exactly how the human mind worked regarding persuasion, but in the course's defense, that was the last lecture. Being able to effectively critique any psychological study is a lot more valuable than what most Yale students get lout of an intro psych course. Anyway, most courses I have had at Yale don't even make it to the last week's of lecture.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the TA, Kristen, was always happy to answer questions. That's definitely not something I can say about most TAs at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0the professor is nice and the content is intriguing, but he sometimes speak too fast\r\nthe TA is very nice ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-The instructor explains the lesson and goes over in a manner that is easy to understand\r\n-The instructor always asks to see him if you have any questions regarding the Chapter that you may need\r\nclarification.\r\n\r\nThe course is good as it is. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-taught, but I wasn't a huge fan of the curriculum structure. The main focus of the course was experimental design and interpretation. That's important stuff, of course, but I feel like it should have been confined to the first week. I would have liked to have learned more actual psychological theories that I could apply to my own life. ",
            "\u00a0The course can give students a better understanding of the basic priciples of psychology through the use of specific examples. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is the sheer amount of information we were able to cover in the allotted time frame. I greatly enjoyed learning about a topic about which I had very little prior knowledge. The weekly readings and writing responses were also incredible interesting and engaging  a great way to learn relevant class information as practiced in real-world situations. A major weakness of this course was the lack of feedback we received from either the professor or the TA. The comments on our reading responses were minimal, and we did not receive feedback from weeks 2-5 until the 6th week. Despite this, both the professor and TA did an excellent job of answering our questions in class, and provided guidance to students who were in need of additional help. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts would be understanding every concept and weakness: finding confounds and analyzing deeply each experiment. It can be imprived with practice and critical thinking ",

            "\u00a0Strength: listened very carefully and paid full attention\r\n\r\nWeakness: could be more engaged ",
            "\u00a0This course was very insightful and I found the classes really engaging and interesting. The homework tasks were also very interesting and manageable. \r\nAlthough it was good to have a range of information from different sections of psychology, there did seem to be a lot of information to retain in a short space of time. It may also have been helpful to get feedback from weekly assignments in order to know where/how to improve. ",
            "\u00a0At first the knowledge was not well examined but after a while it became clear. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was that we based our reading responses around articles picked out by the professor as opposed to textbook readings which ensured that our responses were extremely relevant to the material in class.  The weakness was that reading responses could have been better spaced out as before the final we had two due in one day. ",
            "\u00a0weaknesses:\r\nalmost no feedback for the assignments, which makes us impossible to improve ourselves.\r\nProfessor didn't do a very good job at controlling the teaching pace, which left him behind the schedule and had to hurry in the last few classes. even so he did not finish the slides as supposed.\r\nthe guest lecture was awkward. we didn't understand much what he was talking about, the guest's english was not good, and there was no one to explain.\r\nProfessor missed too much of the classes. (we had 3*5=15 in total, professor skipped the one for July 4th, did not show up for the midterm and final exam, had a guest lecture and had the TA did a class. basically his attendance was merely 66.7%, 10 out of 15 classes) ",
            "\u00a0The homework should be given more time ",
            "\u00a0Communication between TA and professor. The structure of the course and teaching style were not conducive to actually learning and becoming knowledgable of the content. Teaching left much to be desired. Professor did a decent job teaching students to critically read a research articles, as to be critical of different arguments for different psychological schools of thought. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very academic \r\nWeakness: hard to understand. Easier sample experiments and a more intriguing way to put it will be better "

But for students who have had basic psychology learning experience and who do not have the intention to study developmental psychology, I may not recommend this course. Because the focus of this course is not basic knowledge of developmental psychology. ",

The exams were also fair and the assigned course material prepared students well for class discussion, responses, and the final project. I enjoyed the class, I just wish the professor was more invested in his teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Not at all. At first I thought it would be really interesting, and I love psychology, actually I am planning to have a major in clinical psychology, but this class was very very basic, they didnt talk much about psychology, it was all about philosophy and the topics were seen very overall and not really detailes which made it less interesting. I think the course has the potential to be good, but I dont think the professor explained it well nor he made the class interesting for us. I had very high expectations for this course and they were not met ",

            "\u00a0Not really. For its not so interesting ",
            "\u00a0It's a little hard to understand all the things in the course so I recommend students who already had some knowledge in psychology to take this course. "
