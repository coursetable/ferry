            "\u00a0The groups should be better-sorted by ability; allowing groups to choose members is strongly disadvantages freshmen and those new to the course. If you end up with a bad group for the semester, you're not going to have a fun time.\r\n\r\nHowever, coaching was always highly informative and largely eye-opening. Quality of instruction was excellent and masterclasses were good. Perhaps a small restructuring of seminar time would be useful, as I felt it would be good to spend longer with each group (perhaps 2-3 groups every week instead of 4-5 every two weeks?). ",
            "\u00a0Don't have many complaints, it's wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed both of my coaches. I think it might be good for them to create a more cohesive plan for our coachings - sometimes the things they told us were contradictory. ",
            "\u00a0Course is great. Sometimes it's tough when some group members don't put in as much effort as you might want, but you push through. Sometimes, the coaches focus pretty much solely on their own instrument, which makes it a bit boring for those who don't play the instrument. That goes for comments that are really instrument-specific. ",
            "\u00a0The studio class setup of the course is great, because students can work on performances skills, and use the other students' feedback to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it! Great format of group coachings/studio class, no complaints ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured with multiple weekly rehearsals with the chamber group, weekly coaching and biweekly master classes. The ability to work individually with groups and then have frequent performance opportunities makes for a great learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: (1) The coaches are fabulous. (2) Studio classes and coachings are helpful and spaced out well. (3) The audition process creates a great peer group. WEAKNESSES: (1) There were too many groups this semester, which resulted in overly long concerts and studio classes. (2) Groups are are almost always assigned works from the standard repertoire. While I do understand the importance of knowing canonical works, I also don't think it's necessary for a musician to know all of the standard repertoire before ever venturing out of it. There's a lot of really incredible literature written after 1950 and/or outside Europe, and I think those works are important for a holistic study of chamber music performance. "
