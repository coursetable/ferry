            "\u00a0The course was heavier on theory than I expected... I thought this class would focus more on skill-building since there are companion intro music classes to this one that focus solely on theory (MUSI 210/211). ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was good. However, at times, assignments felt too difficult for the level of the course and required much outside time and help. If more of the assigned creative/out-of-the-box questions that had less directly to do with the course were delegated to be extra credit, homeworks would have been more manageable. "
