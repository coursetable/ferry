I also familiarized myself better with Data Analysis techniques that I had seen before but had never implemented before such as PCA, k-means, gradient descent etc. I definitely learned how to implement practical data science methods, though given my math background I probably could have taught myself these methods without taking the course.

While the lectures do not delve into much detail, you learn python and its related packages to build different statistical models.

            "\u00a0This course introduced me to a number of complicated learning methods and taught me how to learn new coding tools.  However, a major weakness was un-connected nature of our course.  There were a number of tools I learned but did not understand how to apply to the real world or why I would select it.  Additionally, the lack of a textbook was a major weakness. I loved what I learned but I'm not sure how to apply it to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are really clear, easy to understand and go at a nice pace. The course assignment schedule was a bit disorganized and unclear. The grading policy was also a bit unclear. The assignments themselves were clear and also fun. They were challenging but doable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it covers a lot of interesting material. The weaknesses are that it seems like the topics are not tied together well. Furthermore, I would have liked to have covered less topics but in more depth. The days when Sahand presented real world examples were fascinating lectures but at times it seemed as if he and the class were lost in theoretical details. I left the class feeling like I didn't learn a lot because we just brushed over so many advanced topics.\r\n\r\nSome assigned readings may have helped to understand the significance of the class and its topics as well as help understand the material more. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures weren't very engaging, but problem sets were interesting to think about and complete. I enjoyed the guided process of having an ipython notebook with text that guides you along in completing the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I definitely learned some stuff from this class, mostly from working on the psets. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures weren't the easiest to follow. No lecture notes were posted online and there was no textbook so it was hard to find places to read over the material. Office hours were often last minute cancelled or rescheduled. Psets often took a very long time to be graded.\r\n\r\nDon't know whether this is a strength or a weakness, but there are no tests. Your entire grade is made up of 5 psets at 20% each. Something to be aware of. ",

            "\u00a0This class was very disorganized. We were only assigned 6 of the 7 planned homeworks, presumably because we did not stay on course with the lecture schedule. This made it difficult to plan the rest of the semester because the dates for the assignments were not set. In addition, I found that I learned best by implementing the methods learned in the homeworks, so I would have liked an extra chance to practice a topic. "

            "\u00a0Sure. Python is a good skill to have in data science and the machine learning concepts we cover (PCA, neural networks, etc..) are important. However, lectures are pretty unclear so it is sometimes hard to learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0No i do not, this is one of the worst classes i have taken at Yale. As an S&DS major there are plenty of other classes to get an elective out of. This class is poorly taught which is a shame because the material in this class is super awesome, useful, and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is a super cool course that will teach very valuable skills.  However, unless you have a coding and math background, this course will be very very very difficult.  Also, I would recommend buying a related textbook on Amazon to help out. ",
            "\u00a0This course was certainly well taught, but I came in with too advanced a background to get much out of the class. I ended up skipping 75% of the lectures and finding the problem sets quite easy. Therefore if you are senior or junior who has done a bunch of math, computer science and statistics this class will be too easy (but sometimes it is nice to have an easier class :) ). If you are a first year or sophomore, or if you are an upperclassman without much exposure to data science, math or statistics this class would be a better fit for you. ",

Instead, I left the course feeling like I didn't learn a lot because we didn't go into a lot of depth on any topic. Sahand is an incredibly smart professor who is good at lecturing but his lessons are very dense and are hard to internalize immediately. Since there are not additional materials or assigned reading, you are left on your own to figure out a lot of topics. With that being said, you do learn how to code in python and get a general idea of some advanced statistical techniques while doing the p sets, but most of the learning comes from your own work. ",
            "\u00a0A good way to get an introduction to using Python for data analysis and statistical modeling. Also provides good exposure to some common machine learning methods and concepts, all with a very manageable workload and little stress (since there aren't any tests or exams). ",
            "\u00a0Eh maybe. I'm actually glad I took it as I think I learned from it. However, it was not the most interesting course ever and not very well organized. ",

            "\u00a0DO NOT RECOMMEND WITH SAHAND. Sahand puts together terrible \"lecture\" notes, which are basically either half-baked Python scripts that he corrects on the fly and never has time to post ahead of time, OR him writing math on the board in a way that seems almost intentionally disorganized, which he erases and corrects every three minutes. Don't take notes with a pen. And make sure your notebook paper has ample margins, because as he modifies his board scrawl, which he will, and using whatever board room he has, you will need to add things in random margins and use arrows, etc. 2/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty relaxed course with a rigid structure, introduces some interesting topics and teaches you some important Python skills for data science ",
            "\u00a0The course could use some more structuring and better planning in terms of what material is covered each week, but it is still interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course was tough, but extremely interesting.  I highly recommend if you are interested in data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0i took it cr/d which i would recommend because even though the class is only psets and no exams, no final, the material to me was pretty tough. never coded in python before and found the psets really hard to figure/do on my own. had to utilize google a lot ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student as I feel that I didn't get too much out of it other than learning python. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class with Sahand. The class was very disorganized and you have to learn many of the topics on your own to implement in the homeworks. On the plus side, you get valuable experience using Python, there are no exams, and the homeworks are very manageable and usually quite interesting. "
