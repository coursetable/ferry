            "\u00a0By taking this course I developed many insights into eastern views on philosophical issues and debates that I have studied many times before (fate vs. free will, mind vs. body). I also realized that eastern religions take a very different approach at resolving these debates. Most significantly, I learned more about my own religion (hinduism) through reading the Gita and other works. ",
            "\u00a0I leanred the basics of Indian philosophy and then origins behind them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Indian Philosophy ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major philosophical ideas, ways of thinking, and argumentation in a few key areas of Indian philosophy.  Indian philosophy was extraordinarily developed, and this class was a great way to dip your feet into the diversity of thought beyond the West. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good introduction to topics in philosophy across Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu thought in ancient and medieval India. Much of the material was new to me and affected the way that I conceived of specific philosophical issues and of philosophy overall. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the various Indian doctrinal schools, from Jainism to Buddhism, and got the chance to read both primary and secondary sources on these topics. I learned to read religious texts and verse through a philosophical lens. "

            "\u00a0It was a great course and could be improved with a slightly greater use of technology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Uskokov's passion and knowledge about the subject, the interesting course material and lectures, most things about this course were a strength! Areas of improvement: It was often challenging having a quiz and essay in the same weekend (although this only happened for quiz 1 and essay 1) but it was better when we had until the next morning rather than midnight and when the deadlines were more spaced out. I really enjoyed learning the application of the philosophy we learned in terms of religion (e.g., certain discussions were important because they were rooted in understanding which philosophical tradition had the right conception of God) and I wish these applications were emphasized more. I also would have liked to learn about philosophy relating to Sikhism, or discuss more about the Gita, Mahabarata, and Ramayana. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes already had a study guide that indicated which readings and where in the readings certain points could be found.  This feature of the class was a strength not because it made the class easier but because it helped me organize the ideas in readings and engage with them.  The readings themselves could be difficult to follow sometimes, and it was hard at times to know which specific ideas to focus on.  The quizzes along with their study guides did a great job of putting the philosophical ideas into context.  The essay prompts also encouraged me to get invested in the class and develop my own ideas. \r\nThis course can be improved by having more seminar-style discussion.  Towards the end of the semester classes were directed more and more by students' questions and discussion, but it would be nice to incorporate discussion and questions throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings for the course were particularly well chosen and had a good balance of primary and secondary sources. The lectures were a bit disorganized at the beginning but really became very organized and as the class went on. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it was hard to follow the Sanskrit terms Professor Uskokov used. I found it helpful when he put topics in greater context, e.g. sometimes connecting it to parallels in Western philosophy, and it would help to do that more (provide more structure to fit the various pieces of material we learn together). "

            "\u00a0Yes. This was an interesting and informative course that really gave a good base for philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this or any course taught by Professor Uskokov. He is incredibly knowledgable about the subject and teaches it in a very approachable and interesting way. I normally hate philosophy and also have done poorly on it in past courses, but Professor Uskokov makes it easy to do well in this course if you try because he provides so many means of getting help and succeeding. For example, the three take home quizzes have page numbers to tell you where the answers are, and he also helps a lot with the three short essays if you are confused or need more ideas. Overall a great course, especially if you're interested in South Asian religions or non-western philosophy. Again, I really thought I disliked philosophy, but I sincerely enjoyed this course! It's very welcoming for non-philosophy people and even though I sometimes left class feeling like I only had a surface level understanding of what we learned, I realized I actually understood so much more than I thought! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning about philosophy between the western canon.  Yale has only  a few non-Western philosophy classes, so this class definitely provides a missing piece of a well-rounded philosophical education. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! A great class full of many hot topics. ",
            "\u00a0Gutty course but can be dull if you're not too much into the class. I didn't have to put much effort into the papers and I still got solid grades for them. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class to gain important perspective on rigorous philosophical thought in cultures and societies that aren't the West. You will really see just how great and expansive and profound the Indian philosophical tradition is. It isn't too much work, and Professor Uskokov is very friendly and helpful, and is very willing to shape the course around student interests and needs. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It definitely expanded my understanding of philosophy and is well worth the time because Eastern philosophy approaches questions very differently from Western "
