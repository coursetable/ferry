            "\u00a0I gained SO much taking Basic Drawing an understanding of how to \"see\", an overhaul of my previous understanding of how to create meaningful art, a general curiosity about the world around me, and, of course, invaluable, fundamental drawing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Opened up a new form of thinking about the world and how to describe it ",
            "\u00a0I definitely feel like I improved as an artist by taking this course. I improved with figure drawing, faces, shading, and proportion. ",

            "\u00a0I think it is a strong course for practicing technique. I would like to see at least one or two large scale projects rather than exclusively exercises. Maybe more drawing where we could invest long amounts of time. A lot of the in class work was very fast. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the very skilled professor and teaching assistant that were able to provide clear and detailed instructions to promote learning. ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have benefitted from doing more \"long\" drawings in class. Sometimes it felt like I was rushing from short drawing to short drawing without having the chance to invest myself fully in each one, and missing things I could have learned with more time spent on each one. That being said, Mark's instruction was incredible and hugely beneficial to me and I loved the set-up and progression of each class, and the semester as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro course, especially liked that our class was a good mix of skill levels so we could learn from each other ",

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student since I had the opportunity to learn something that I would have never seen before. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic and refreshing, and if you take it with Mark, you will definitely come away having learned plenty. Cant speak for the other sections, but Marks was a great mix of fun/humor and taking drawing seriously as the art form that it is. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you like art and drawing. Even a person that doesn't have much experience with art but is interested would benefit from this course. Everyone improves by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to other students because I feel it can help open our insights. "
