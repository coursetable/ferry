Because of the incredible breadth of the course, I know that things I learned in this biology class will come up in every other biology class I take for the rest of my life. The first few weeks of this class were terrible for me, but around week 8 things finally clicked and I started understanding the underlying mechanisms and principles of cellular processes instead of the tiny details. This was the coolest feeling ever, and now I have a newfound understanding of how to digest large quantities of information. This class gave me so much appreciation for biology and for learning, even though from week to week it sometimes felt miserable. No other STEM class has given me such great insight into learning and appreciation of evolution. The biggest thing this class gave me was a love for biology, and an immense feeling of wonder about how much is out there that is yet to be discovered. ",

Megan King, Shirin Bahmanyar, David Breslow, and Thomas Pollard are actually amazing biologists. The approach to learning was exactly how biology should be taught, weekly quizzes were engaging and not too burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very stressful with weekly quizzes. However, I can not think of a better way to cover as much material as we did. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the weekly quiz format works really well because even though you put in a fair amount of time studying each week, it really pays off because you stay on top of the material and understand things really well. Major props to the peer tutors for helping me understand the material.\r\nTheres so much material covered during lecture that it can be overwhelming and unclear what to know (because its impossible to study/learn/know everything). It could be helpful to have starred slides that are just for extra knowledge/not going to be tested or something. ",
            "\u00a0the lectures could be more engaging, maybe have more time for students to answer questions or draw things on the board. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers an immense amount of material, and I think could be improved by splitting it into two semesters. THIS COURSE WOULD BE PERFECT AS A YEAR LONG INTRODUCTORY SEQUENCE. The introductory biology sequence did not prepare me for any of the other biology courses I have taken, but this course is incredible with the amount of information covered. I highly recommend that the introductory biology sequence be removed, this be used instead, and HUMAN BIOLOGY COURSES BE ADDED!! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that weekly quizzes force you to stay on top of the material and the lecture packets are well organized and very helpful. Weaknesses are that there is so much material you cannot possibly learn it all and studying for each quiz and the final can be pretty overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Starting with strengths: MCDB 205 is super-well organized to facilitate learning a lot of material in not that much time. Really appreciated the condensed notes uploaded to canvas for each lecture, as well as the lectures themselves, given effectively by several really smart scientists teaching us about their areas of experience. The weekly quizzes were also effective -- much easier to process such a wide array of material one week at a time rather than in bulk. In terms of weaknesses, though, I felt like the level of engagement was very low -- sections were a good start for actually talking about the material, but just going over the material didn't seem like a worthwhile use of time. Every upper-level science class at Yale should be reading and discussing primary literature in section!!!! There is literally no excuse not to do this -- it's by far the most engaging way of learning the material, and the whole point of doing science is to apply it to real-world situations. Biology is empirical, not just theoretical -- demonstrate this by choosing relevant primary literature and discussing either in lecture or in section. See MCDB 200 for an example of a class that did this right -- I actually looked forward to going to section every week. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes are pretty challenging and requires a lot of studying each week (60% of grade). ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that it really facilitates learning. Through the lecture guides, review questions, objectives, and discussion, you are really equipped with the tools you need to succeed. There are no weaknesses in my opinion! Only that the mic should have been a little louder because it was hard to hear sometimes during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the quiz structure of the course. It set a good pace and made you want to really understand the material. With the amount of information, it helped to have a focus for each week that you would understand and study well. There was no way to remember it all by the end of the course, but you had a decent understanding of all the different processes at play and learned a lot about how to think about these processes to minimize the amount you had to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the lectures had so much material that I could not take notes quickly enough and it was hard to pay attention because I was overwhelmed. However, I absolutely loved the course! The lectures were incredibly interesting, and the format of the weekly quizzes helped me to consistently review material and read the chapters. The discussion sections were helpful, although I often studied on Fridays/during the weekends, so it was hard to come prepared to section even though I invested a lot of time in the course. I really wish we were told the average for each weekly quiz so it was easier to tell how we were doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This a challenging course, but it is very well organized and very fair in its assesments. ",
            "\u00a0It was great! I liked that we had a mix of professors teaching based on their areas of expertise!! ",
            "\u00a0I think the material taught is incredibly useful especially if you are in a biology related major. The quizzes are also a great part of the course because they help you stay on track, and although they cover only a week's material  the material often relies on previous concepts learned so it is a good way of reviewing and applying knowledge. By the time the final came around, I felt more than prepared for it. Professor Pollard is great, but sometimes it is really hard to hear him so I would recommend sitting really close up front. Professor David was probably my least favorite, he went over the material really fast and used language that was extremely unnecessary  to explain simple concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Gives a very good base for all of biology. Systematic and organized w/ a good amount of resources (discussion section, study guides, review sessions). The professors are all very knowledgable.\r\nWeaknesses: It is a TON of information. The final can feel especially daunting. Sometimes, the course material felt too much like a long list (types of receptors, types of pumps) than meaningful information. It would be more helpful to perhaps intersperse this information within the context of larger pathways. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely organized, so many resources provided (packets, slides, textbook), quizzes to keep you on track with studying\r\nWeaknesses: some of the professors were not clear lecturers, grades were not recorded on canvas so there wasnt much transparency ",
            "\u00a0This course packed a lot of material -- sometimes too much -- in at a lightning-fast pace. The weekly quizzes could be helpful in getting me to keep up with the new information, but they also became overwhelming when other classes' workloads picked up. I don't recommend taking cell bio with a heavy course schedule. This class should be your hardest class, by far, if you want to do well in it. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the material for this class is very interesting, but it was really just thrown at us at lightening speeds. I wish more time was spent on each topic, for I felt like I just memorized the material each week then had to dump it out for next week's material. I wish this course was spread over two semesters, just so we could have more time to really understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Everything comes together at the end of the course!\r\nWeaknesses: The quizzes were so exhausting and time-consuming, it felt like I had a midterm once a week. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course was organized in such as way that the knowledge you learn later on builds on the knowledge you learn in the beginning. This gives the course a sense of continuity. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There are too many details in this course. Doing well in the course is more about knowing what to study than actually studying. I spent a long time understanding the details of certain processes because it bothers me to just have a surface-level understanding. Unfortunately, I do not think this was the right way to approach the class and my grades suffered. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the weekly quizzes personally, and the powerpoint lectures don't bother me, although I know some people didn't like them. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Loved the quiz structure, wish there was more guidance on the final though!\r\nSome lectures were too dense, Lots of self-teaching involved ",
            "\u00a0This course is highly organized. The textbook corresponds directly to the material in notes and tests. After each quiz, a handout with the answers is passed out. Professors always hand out note sheets or have them available online. I do wish the lectures had more content since they were mostly pictures. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a crazy amount of material to learn. But, it is organized so well for you to learn all of it. The weekly quizzes are actually helpful once you get used to them. The course is run really well. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the depth and the quizzes make sure you are keeping up with material but we cover too much in too little time/ the prof is not loud enough ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information but the class provided discussion sections, review sessions, and peer tutors to process it.  Additionally, the weekly quizzes and their quick grading forced you to study the information soon after learning it.  This greatly improved the amount learned. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes ended up being more like exams which made studying hard, but it forced me to learn things as I went along which was very helpful come the final. It is a lot of material, but I do not know how you could get around that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1. Textbook is very well aligned with the course. Only problem is that some weeks there just arent enough hours to read all the chapters, so the study guides that Professor Pollard prints out are an excellent tool.\r\n2. The review sessions on Monday nights were helpful and I felt a sense of unity with the rest of the class.\r\n3. Tom Pollard is an extraordinary professor, and I would take any class he teaches regardless of subject because hes just that good.\r\n4. Weekly quizzes are both a strength and a weakness. I think its the best system for a class like this that covers this much material (a midterm would be dreadful), but it does make your semester extremely exhausting. \r\n5. Section is well structured by going over the review questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Introducing new teachers at the beginning of the semester makes students stop coming to lecture, and makes the class feel slightly all-over-the place. \r\n2. Sometimes the professors really zipped through the slides, which made it really hard to keep up. I would suggest that going over slightly less material might enhance the quality of instruction.\r\n3. Some quiz questions were much more difficult than others ",
            "\u00a0It is very fast paced, and there is a lot of information. The weekly quizzes ensure that you have to keep up with the material every week, however it can be difficult to bring everything together for the final. I also really enjoyed having different professors teach different parts of the course, since I could meet more faculty members, and learn about their interests. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong at the start, but gradually became less engaging. By the end, nobody was taking notes. The initial focus on experiments and concepts was great, but it eventually became lost in details. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this course was well constructed to learn a vast amount of information. The weekly quizzes made sure that I was keeping up with the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0A significant strength of this course are the faculty and teaching fellows for the course. They were approachable and accessible for the entirety of the course, and were always extremely well prepared for lecture and section. The quizzes were well written and unambiguous, and the lecture slides were easy to review. The textbook was also a major strength of the course; it provided excellent reference for the material. ",
            "\u00a0It seems to be perfectly well-taught, but the material is irredeemably boring. I'm not sure there's any real way to improve that. ",
            "\u00a0strength: you learn so much\r\n\r\nweak: you dont know your grade ever and you have to teach yourself the textbook ",
            "\u00a0WAY too much material and information crammed into one course. It eventually became way too overwhelming that it causes you to lose interest in the class and the material. Would have been better if they chose more important concepts and themes to focus on instead of packing so much information and detail into EVERY aspect of cell bio possible. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course is extremely strong. I am a fan of the teaching format and the weekly quizzes, and the final exam was a great test of how to apply the knowledge we amassed over the course of the semester to more comprehensive problems. The weakest portion of this course was the disconnect between some of the professors, and, personally, I was not a fan of Professor Bahmanyar's teaching style. I think this course will continue to improve over time, and I do not really have any additional recommendations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - comprehensive, well-organized, information clearly presented, regular quizzes with appropriate focus on understanding of concepts and processes rather than memorization\r\nWeaknesses/improvements - large amount of information can be complex and difficult to follow at times "

You will go over things like different types of pumps, receptors, transcription and translation, the extracellular matrix, the GTPase cycle + also more interesting pathways like how vision works, how the neuromuscular junction works, etc. All the professors are experts in their field, especially Pollard, who wrote the textbook. It is quite a bit of memorization though and some lectures can feel dull because they are just extensive lists (i.e. types of receptors, types of channels). The quizzes are all very fair, but you have to make sure to keep up. The class is very organized. Not a wildly exciting class, but a really solid one. ",
            "\u00a0This is an essential class to take if youre majoring in biology. It seems like a lot of work because of the weekly quizzes, but its not really that much more than any other biology class  it only seems like a lot because you have to constantly study throughout the semester instead of just cram before an exam. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class for a good foundation in all important aspects of cell biology, but if you're going to take it, do so knowing that it's going to be tough and overwhelming and will consume your mental stability during finals period! I can't stress enough the importance of getting started early studying for the final, but even I couldn't follow through with that because of other papers and final exams. So plan your schedule wisely, knowing that cell bio is going to take you ages to review for. The final exam is comprehensive. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Great class if you put in the work ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student due to the remarkable amount of biological knowledge you acquire in a short time frame. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommended this course. After the introductory bio sequence, I really didnt think I liked biology anymore. But this course made my realize I still really enjoy biology and find it interesting. This course showed me I still really liked biology. Yes it is a lot of work, but if you put in the time, this course is extremely worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course that can be taken for MCAT preparation. I am MBB and still got a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah if you are a mcdb only though ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if they are ready for the workload. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you have any interest in biology whatsoever, this is ground zero for how every other branch of biology works. All interested should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yea. I didnt end up going to a single lecture, but cramming before the exam really made me wish I did because I fell in love with the material. This class is a lot of fun, and if you put in effort, it will be easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you are learning from one of the biggest experts in the field-- what an honor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes, but this course is not for the faint-hearted. No one lecture is impossible to understand, but all the information all at once is quite overwhelming. This course requires that you learn all the information presented and then apply it to a novel question in the quizzes that are not just regurgitation but test application of knowledge. Dont take too many other strenuous classes if you choose to take this class, because it is mentally and emotionally exhausting to take a quiz every week. Its a good system for the amount of information presented, but its a lot. 9 am class T/Th, Section on Wednesday or Thursday, and the Peer Tutors hold a review session on Monday nights before the quizzes from 7-9 that I would highly recommend. Clear your Monday schedule so that you have enough time to review for the quiz (I studied for 10 hours every Monday). I would highly recommend taking 1-2 hours to review the starred discussion questions before section, because it will make it much much easier to participate. Youll be so happy you took this course at the end of the semester, but not always when youre taking it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student majoring in a biology-related field, as I believe that the course material is fundamental in understanding higher level material. ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging, but fell off towards the end. The quizzes and final were fair, and I liked it a lot, but I think that I stopped learning in the last 3 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although it is a lot of information and there are weekly quizzes, there is a lot of help from the professors, TAs, and Peer Tutors. Weekly quizzes mean that Monday nights are always allotted to studying for the quizzes, but it made sure that we were keeping up with the lecture content. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! If you are an MCDB/MBB/pre-med student, this class is a must! You will definitely be pushed in ways you might not expect, but you will learn so so much along the way. Prepare to work hard; keeping up with the material is a must!!! ",
            "\u00a0No--this is only a good option if you're sure you love cell bio. If you don't, then it's painfully boring and this can make it difficult to pay attention in class, which can hurt your grade. Only embark on a class with this much memorization if you actually care about what you're memorizing. ",
            "\u00a0it depends. looking back i shouldnt have taken it but im glad that i opted in. i learned quite a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are REALLY good at memorization. ",
            "\u00a0I would DEFINITELY recommend this course to another student, especially if this student is interested in developing a comprehensive toolbox of information to use in their future research or medical-school oriented endeavors. Cell biology has been the best course that I have taken in the MCDB department, and I absolutely loved the professors (especially Dr. Tom Pollard). I feel like I learned an enormous amount of information in this course and am actually retaining a large portion of it because of how effective the professors and TFs were at instructing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. It is a lot of work, but you will get so much out of it. Every week, there is a 15-minute quiz on Tuesday starting at 8:55am in OML. Each quiz requires that you master the material from the past two lectures. Each lecture takes a while to understand and master, requiring that you study extensively for each quiz. In that sense, the class is quite time consuming. However, looking back on it, I learned so much in this class. The sheer amount of knowledge and understanding of how experimental research in biology works I gained over the course of a single semester is astonishing. Even though it was a lot of work, I am glad that I took this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in biology. Very well-taught and will give you a good appreciation of current understanding of cellular processes, including from an experimental-evidence perspective. "
