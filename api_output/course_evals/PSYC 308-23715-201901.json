            "\u00a0Learned a lot about inequality and thought me really hard to think about these real life inequalities in a different context. It was definitely very eye opening for me! ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting to discuss and learn about the forms of inequality that exist in the world and the psychological mechanisms that enable them to persist. ",
            "\u00a0It was very interesting to learn about social inequality in the U.S. I feel like everyone know it exists but to read papers and see examples and hear the professor actually talk about is so fascinating. ",

            "\u00a0Learned a lot about social psychological mechanisms that allow for inequalities to occur and be perpetuated ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about inequality that is present in today's society, and some of the underlying psychology behind why the inequality exists. ",
            "\u00a0the psychological mechanisms behind persistent inequality in our society-- how and why it is maintained and how we can challenge it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how inequality and inequity are systemically embedded into our society, often through our own perceptions and actions, not just those created by laws and institutions. Also how to investigate different types of interventions, both novel and already existing, in their effectiveness to solving issues relating to inequality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the psychology of intergroup relations, about the psychological factors that result in and maintain inequality, and ways that inequality might be reduced through psychological interventions. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths is that the assignments very doable but also very insightful and the teacher is great! Weaknesses are that this material tends to be extremely repetitive, making lecture a bit dull at points ",
            "\u00a0Don't need as long of reviews of the previous course's material. Sometimes that got repetitive and felt unnecessary to review in such depth. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is set up very well. All the assignments were shorts and to the point. It didn't feel like you had to add stuff just for content but instead had to squeeze it all into a page or two. Everything we did for this class went along with the themes and was very current and relevant which was awesome. The work we did made sense. The only think I might improve is either shorten class time or cover move material. The first 20 minutes or so we would review exactly what was gone over the last class. I feel like there could have been a little less review or less reteaching of things from the last class. ",
            "\u00a0It could be quite repetitive at times - perhaps diversifying the curriculum and adding more content would make it more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course but could be slightly repetitive at times. ",
            "\u00a0at some point it dawns upon you the irony of taking a class on social inequality at an institution like yale.. and whether other students are realizing their own complicity \r\nProf Richeson definitely tries to be funny and engaging, but the lectures often feel repetitive. Maybe that can't be helped, though. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is really interesting, and the lecturer is very engaging. However, I would like more discussion between class members during the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very well taught, comfortable environment to have a discussion about the topics, important content to learn\r\nweakness: can be repetitive going over the last lecture every time (might be worth while having shorter class than a section to discuss the reading assignments) ",
            "\u00a0Professor Richeson is a huge strength. She really cares about this work and it comes clear through her teaching. All of the assignments were fair and evenly distributed throughout the course of the semester, so it never felt like too much work. Maybe making the midterm before spring break would be helpful, but otherwise the class is all strengths and the material is all interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a good balance of theory and case studies of real-world inequality, provided an overview of methods used to study the psychology of inequality, and the real world analysis project was a very effective way of applying the theories we were studying to forms of inequality in real life.\r\nHowever, I did think we could have covered more material (e.g. more case studies of different types of inequality and their interventions) instead of reviewing previous material in class repeatedly. I also thought that the midterm exam was not a very useful way of testing our knowledge gained in the class (in comparison with the final project or short assignments). Finally, the 'leminar' format of the class might have prevented the kind of class participation that could make this class even more interesting. I think that teaching the same material in a smaller seminar might be a better idea. ",
            "\u00a0far too much repetition and review. not enough empirical information / evidence. didnt feel like it was really getting to a climax or apex. kinda just constantly talked about issues many of us have already grappled with. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and did a great job of taking a very interdisciplinary topic and examining it through a psychology lense. However, I found that while we covered a lot of information relating to social inequality in terms of race, socioeconomic status, and gender, we did not specifically discuss other realms of inequality. I feel it would have been beneficial to talk about how the psychological processes of inequality related to other less immediately visible groups, as it was difficult to conceptualize how many of the processes and research we talked about would operate in these \"invisible\" conditions.

            "\u00a0Yes! Great professor and really interesting material. I also did like the assignments because they were pretty open and allowed me to explore something I liked. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Fun class, amazing professor, super interesting material to examine. Definitely a good to take. Would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very informational but also exciting. Professor Richeson is very engaging and personable. She is great to be around and really boosts your mood. The content is also very current and important making for a great class. The work we did also was very doable and important, not just fluff like you get with lots of other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think it gave an amazing lens through which to engage with the world. It has changed the way I see hierarchies and structures of oppression. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is really interested in societal inequality but I would have them bear in mind that the class could be slow at points. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think all yale students would benefit from learning about inequality and how they might be justifying or perpetuating it :) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. The information is extremely necessary for everyone to learn and be aware of in America's society today. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student-- learning about social inequality, why it exists, and how we can dismantle it is so important in our present day. The class was also so very engaging and fun to attend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a class that shines a light on so many issues while also equipping us with the psychology and tools necessary to change them. I didn't leave this class feeling like I could change the entire world, but I left feeling like I knew how to work to dismantle systems of inequality and check my own perceptions and stereotypes. ",
            "\u00a0I truly think this should be a required course. Especially for students at elite universities like Yale. We all need to rethink our privilege, but at the same time understand and be aware of the struggles of the disadvantaged/lower status individuals and what is truly giving them that status. Even if you think you know what this class will teach you, I promise you there will be at least one thing that will just blow you away by becoming aware of a part of the unfairness in society that we often uphold or ignore. This class is SO RELEVANT AND SO NECESSARY. The assignments were also kind of fun and Professor Richeson is great! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student, psych major or not. You'll learn to integrate psychological theory with your personal experiences of inequality, and the assignments for this class are incredibly rewarding to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah kinda, its really interesting information and conversation but not really an academic challenge. Moves really slowly and has a shit ton of repetition. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I think that the material it covers gives a very different perspective on an issue that we are constantly grappling with on a campus-wide scale, as it relates to the Yale community, and as it extends into the broader world. "
