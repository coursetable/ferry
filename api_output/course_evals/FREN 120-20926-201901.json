I think the teacher could have done better in encouraging participation as opposed to just waiting for people to speak. I think because it is a new language many people are embarrassed to speak so it would be more beneficial to foster a comfortable and safe environment. ",

            "\u00a0One strength of this course is its rigour. Unfortunately I did not find much of the content relevant to my interests. In addition the content was so much that it was difficult digest appropriately "
