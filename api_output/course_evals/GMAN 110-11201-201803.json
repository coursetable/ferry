            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount of German my first semester! In this introductory language course, you learn more than just the basics of the language. Compared to my other friends in L1 classes other than German, I feel like I had learned so much more and could have more diverse conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Basic German; how to learn from a textbook; covered a lot of grammar & vocabulary!; learn about german culture ",
            "\u00a0I got a good overview of basic German grammar and learned how to form simple sentences in the present and past tenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned introductory German. I became better at learning a new language as well. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of the German language through a fun curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0I gained basic language skills in German. I learned daily conversation, directions, daily activities, hobbies, interests, chores around the house, etc. ",
            "\u00a0German language ",
            "\u00a0update my German skills "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The textbook was very helpful in explaining grammar and providing sufficient practice when it came to studying for the tests every two weeks. It was also nice to not have a midterm, and have a final group video project instead of a final exam. Weaknesses: The course moved very quickly at times for concepts that are essential to fluently speak the German language. If you aren't used to fast-paced learning, this may not be the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  class corresponds with textbook, a lot of practice reading/speaking/listening, a full immersive classroom which is very good at forcing you to practice using your German, topics are tests are provided beforehand, textbook is great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  need to be on top of homework (there are many weekly assignments due), you are expected to go over the grammar by yourself beforehand and not much time is spent learning it in the classroom, textbook is mad expensive ",
            "\u00a0The strengths I think are that students actually learn German. In a short period of time, a great deal of German tenses and vocabulary is covered. ",
            "\u00a0German 110 can be intense if you do not study  learning vocabulary outside of class is extremely important, not just for tests but for the ability to speak German at a basic level. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the textbook and the standardized curriculum. The daily interactive class was good. The activeness of the German department when it comes to weekly events and faculty support is awesome. Weaknesses include the lack of progress in speaking compared to writing. The final project was also a weakness because it really did not improve many students German skills or understanding of German language/culture. Even though it was an easy and fun project, I think there could have been a more interesting and intellectually engaging final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the listening sections used pedestrian interviews that most of the class had a difficult time understanding -- I feel that for a beginner's language class clips with actors made for students would be more helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes! You learn so much German in only one semester, because we were only allowed to speak German in the classroom from day one! However, you will only like this course if you get a good instructor. I highly recommend taking the course with Theresa, as she is extremely high energy and will keep you engaged and excited about the material! The many weekly homework assignments will keep you busy, but it is nothing overwhelming because it's a lot of busy work -- however, this busy work was still beneficial to my learning of the German language! ",
            "\u00a0I love German!! I haven't spoken a lick of it before taking this class, and now I feel confident in very basic sentences and vocabularies.  The GMAN Department is wonderful as well, and I'm excited to stay in this language.  There is enough work to make you actually learn the language, but not too much that you feel swamped and start to hate the language.  There are tests every other week (and you get the topics to the tests beforehand), and no midterm or final.  There are weekly assignments (2 online textbook homeworks as well as 1 online photo exchange with caption), as well as other mini projects within the class.  It's a lot of fun, German is super cool, highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course. It started out slow enough that I could understand the language and what was going on in class, but then the class picked up the pace of learning so we covered a substantial amount of material in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was a great introductory course in German. I feel like I have grasped introductory aspects of the German language in just a few months. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  German is a fascinating language with an extraordinary culture backing it. German 110 provides an excellent fundamental structure for learning more advanced German. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. German is not too difficult to learn and the language and culture is incredibly fascinating. You can easily make an A by just doing your work, participating some, and studying a few hours for the tests. You still come out feeling that youve learned a lot and are able to communicate and read in German. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you are interested in German as a novice this course is great. "
