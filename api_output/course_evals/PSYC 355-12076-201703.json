            "\u00a0I really think this class did an incredible job at giving me the opportunity to practice my helping and listening skills. The field placement and triad meetings were very conducive to my learning because I felt like I could truly apply the knowledge from class to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I developed so many skills in this class! The focus was around learning how to be a good helper in a helping relationship, which can apply beyond a formal therapist-client relationship and can be used in all interactions. We practiced several different types of therapy in small group meetings each week from CBT to family therapy and had placements where we were challenged by having to interact with populations that most of us never had before. ",
            "\u00a0How to be a good helper and to broaden and strengthen your counseling skills. Also a great class to get exposure to a world that you might not have been familiar with: people dealing with severe mental illnesses. The placement part of this course was absolutely the part through which I learned the most and I will be forever grateful for my experiences and the insight that I gained from it. ",
            "\u00a0This class was absolutely wonderful, and I gained so much valuable knowledge about mental illness, the US mental health system, stigma, and about myself. Self-reflection and self-insight are at the forefront of this course, so if you are interested in taking a class that requires you to think deeply about mental illness in the US and your own assumptions and beliefs, take this one! ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about the helping relationship, different forms of therapy, and the experiences of the seriously mentally ill. The placement and triads were a great component of this seminar, and that's where I really learned the most about helping skills. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class, and I learned about helping skills and how to use them! I think this class will really help me in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the mental health system in the US ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new insight into the state of mental health are in today's society through both academic readings and personal exposures. In addition to this enhanced understanding of the larger structure, I also gained a host of new skills and experiences that will help me to be a better helper figure in the community. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the complexity of the problem of mental illness in our country, and the ways in which helping skills can be used to lead people to insight and action. I also gained self-awareness through the triad component of the course, which involved meeting with 2 other students weekly to practice listening and reflecting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive knowledge of mental healthcare in the United States--from the clinical skills used in a variety of therapeutic techniques to the large scale, society-wide issues facing the mental healthcare system. I learned the basic skills of being a successful helper and practiced those skills regularly with my peers from the class and with the patients at my community placement. I gained insight into my strengths and shortcomings as a helper and into the steps that ought to be taken to increase access to mental healthcare. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first course I have encountered at Yale that actually provided a thorough and practical knowledge of the components of psychotherapy and counseling skills. I learned a lot about myself as someone who is considering a career in counseling/clinical psychology, and was able to cement the skills I learned through application and practice. I also learned a lot about the critiques of the biomedical model of mental illness, which I had never really considered before this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. We were able to learn different therapy techniques during lecture and then actually put them into practice during our triad meetings. It was helpful to talk about the different methods that clinicians use to diagnose and treat various disorders. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I loved what I learned from the lectures and the readings in this course.  The placement was also nice but I felt like I didn't get to have as much of a choice as other students did.  I would have preferred if the classroom was set up like a seminar (desks around a table or a circle) rather than a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite aspects about the class were the field placements and the triad meetings. I felt that I was able to become a lot more self-aware regarding my own listening abilities through this part of the class. I would say that one way that the class could be improved is to somehow incorporate more discussion in the seminar because the classes often just felt like lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Lockhart is amazing, the TA was amazing, my placement was life-changing and the triad group was a great experience as well. The class is well organized and the professor is very fair in grading. It does require a high level of commitment and many hours a week outside of the actual 2 hour seminar (similar to lab hours). The lectures were generally super interesting and there were a few classes that had different activities or speakers which were incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The placement and triad parts were strong and I learned a lot. The classroom meeting became less seminar-y and more lectur-y throughout the semester and it made me feel less engaged. Otherwise, great course would just try to have more discussion and activity during the actual class meeting time. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I loved this course. The triad and placement experiences were excellent, and lectures were interesting. The best parts of class though were when we did interactive activities or had discussions, so perhaps this could be run more like a seminar, with less lecturing, more discussing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the involvement outside of class--the field placement, triad experience, and readings are wonderful. Class was too much of a lecture and repeated information that we had already done in the reading, which felt like a waste of time. Also, there were 20 people in the class, so it was weird that it did not feel like a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the triad and placement were really strong aspects of the class, because we got to apply and practice the helping skills that we learned in the seminar class time component. Also, the hearing voices activity was really great for emulating what the experience may be like for people with hallucinations. For weaknesses, I thought that the seminar could be more interactive and discussion based, because some days it was mostly a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was structured very well. I enjoyed most of the topics that we talked about. The negative was the amount of time that the class required. The field placement and triad meetings on top of the seminar and readings/writings ended up taking a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: triads (!!) and placement sites - very hands-on and different from courses that are heavily theoretical. Thought questions and weekly responses were a good way to summarize our learning as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: as a senior seminar, I was hoping to go more in-depth in certain categories. I felt a lot of sections were repetition from early psychology courses (e.g. stigma, deinstitutionalisation) which I understand are important, but it felt like a repeat. I think the class would have done well if it was more of a seminar setting rather than lecture, for there was a lot to be discussed in the readings that I think would work well for discussion. I also was a little disappointed when Professor Lockhart and the TA would act out very unrealistic skits that were a little too basic and scripted, rather than actually do impromptu mini sessions are something more genuine. The course itself was fascinating and I think I learned a lot from the triad experience and the placement site, but the class sessions were a little superficial in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome Professor! ",
            "\u00a0The largest strength of this course is the fieldwork placement. These placements were eye-opening and incredible experiences to have as undergraduates. The structure of the class further enhances these experiences by giving us a framework to begin to understand our interactions. The triad experience was also a strength, as it gave us an opportunity to practice certain helping skills in a supportive environment. The course could have been improved with increased conversation during the seminar meetings. I loved hearing about all of the placements in the last class, and I would have loved to have had more time to discuss our experiences together in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in its structural organization--class, the triad, and the field placement support each other to create a comprehensive experience. One weakness is the lectures in class: sometimes, they went on too long, and time could have been better spent on discussion of the issues at hand. The exercises during class time were excellent and educational, and should be continued. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very unique class, and I think its main strengths lie in the non-traditional format and multifaceted nature of the class. Having opportunities to apply my knowledge outside the class, both in my triad and my placement, made certain that I really internalized the material. One way it might be improved is by a slightly more streamlined or open-ended final paper. There were so many interesting questions on the prompt, and I would have rather had the opportunity to answer a few of them thoughtfully and thoroughly, as opposed to answering each in no more than a few sentences, as in many ways, I felt I was unable to do the material justice in that final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I think the two main strengths of the course lie in the practical application component, both through the field placement and the weekly triad experience. Both of these allowed me to get out of my comfort zone, build and practice important helping skills, grow as a listener, and even gain insight myself. I cant think of many weaknesses of the course, though it might be improved by splitting up the final presentations so that at the midterm of the semester, we present a brief overview of our field placement and provide some positive and negative examples so far, and then the final presentations can focus on what helping skills we have learned, what signs of health we saw, etc. This was the first course I have encountered at Yale that actually provided a thorough and practical knowledge of the components of psychotherapy and counseling skills. I learned a lot about myself as someone who is considering a career in counseling/clinical psychology, and was able to cement the skills I learned through application and practice. I also learned a lot about the critiques of the biomedical model of mental illness, which I had never really considered before this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is organized very well. Even though we only met for lecture once a week, by having a field placement and triad meeting every week as well, it was easy to remain engaged with the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class to other students, particularly those interested in perhaps pursuing clinical work, psychiatry, or work with populations with mental illnesses. It was a very practical way to take knowledge from class and utilize that knowledge among friends and family members. ",
            "\u00a0YES! I think everyone at Yale should take this class. The skills and knowledge I acquired in this class are things I will keep with me forever and bring into all relationships in the future both professional and personal. I am walking away from this class with a reshaped understanding of mental illness, people with mental illnesses and the current treatment of these people in the US. If you can get in and are ready to commit to put in the time and effort, you will not regret it!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you can take this course, do it. The community placement is life-changing and you learn so much about stigmatization, how people with severe mental illness are treated (both in terms of stigma and in terms of trying to get better), and also you learn a lot about yourself. 10/10 would recommend. Just be wary that some of the teaching that Prof Lockhart lectures feels a bit antiquated (Freud, anti-medication, etc) but there is meaning behind it, just go in with an open mind. ",
            "\u00a0110% would recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this class if you can get in. I learned so much about the experience of people with severe mental illness. Even if you're not interested in pursuing a career in mental healthcare, you'll learn skills about how to counsel and talk to people in a helping way, which are valuable in not just your career, but in life. Workload was a ok, not difficult per se, but somewhat time-consuming. Every week, there was a one-hour placement at a volunteer position in the community, with a one page writeup, one-hour triad meeting group where you and two other students practice counseling each other, with a one page write up, and one page (single spaced) reading response. And then at the end, there was a final 5-min presentation and a final paper (12-15 pages). But i definitely think this was all worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you think that it is relevant to you/your future and that it will help you, and only if you are willing to spend a LOT of time on the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This is an incredible opportunity to explore psychology from a practical clinical perspective. The fieldwork placements are absolutely incredible, and the triad experiences allow for a unique skill-focused learning opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in mental health and are willing to engage deeply with your classmates and the people at your field placement in the community. You will grow not only as a student, but as a person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the material, definitely apply to this class! Professor Lockhart is a thoughtful, highly engaged instructor, and she cares a lot about broadening her students' perspectives and making sure her students engage meaningfully with the material. You will learn practical helping skills and basic therapeutic techniques, but you will also learn about the larger-scale social issues in the mental healthcare sector and have the opportunity to engage hands-on with a community program. My placement (at the YNHH Children's Inpatient Psychiatric Unit) happened to be a more substantial time commitment than most other placements, but it is still worth noting that there is a solid amount of weekly work for this class, even in a less time-consuming placement (meetings in a small group from the class (and a corresponding journal entry), a weekly community mental health placement (and a corresponding journal entry), and weekly reading responses), so it would help to plan your schedule accordingly. It was a super interesting class, and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in mental healthcare! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Regardless of whether you are considering going into clinical psychology or not, the skills you develop in this class really do help you grow as a listener and a helper, which everyone can benefit from. The readings were all fascinating (especially the books assigned for the final paper), and the class activities, field placement, and triad experiences all wove in perfectly with each topic we discussed. This is a really unique opportunity to learn and practice important skills and gain insight about yourself and others if you can get in, take it!! ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Just make sure you can handle the weekly reading, and triad, and placement. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in pursuing clinical psychology, this class is a wonderful opportunity to actually experience the helping professions first-hand. It is a lot of work and requires a pretty heavy time commitment outside of class, but if you are invested in a career such as psychiatry or social work, I can not recommend this class enough. "
