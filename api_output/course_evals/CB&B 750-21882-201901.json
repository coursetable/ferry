            "\u00a0This course offered a good introduction to databases, machine learning methods, and NLP within the context of biomedical informatics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various types of databases in existence and how they differ in their organization methods. I also learned about natural language processing (NLP) fundamentals from guest lecturer Andrew Taylor and practical applications some existing NLP tools. The course included a guest lecture by  Dr. Samah Fodeh who taught the basics of machine learning. Lastly, the course included a section on ontologies. ",

            "\u00a0It's tricky to organize a course like this where students have a variety of backgrounds. Homework assignments that are simple to a programmer are essentially impossible for a non-programmer. For the final-project, it was challenging to divide work evenly, especially when auditors naturally can't be expected to do much.\r\n\r\nI thought the introduction to databases was well-taught, although I found the lectures on the VA's date warehouses very dull. The NLP lectures eventually felt repetitive--it might be better to pick one NLP tool and teach more in-depth, rather than the survey of similar tools, since students probably won't end up using all of them in the future. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the set of hands-on exercises that followed each section where we were able to apply the lecture topics in a classroom setting. This allowed for questions to be answered immediately and for collaborative work. ",
            "\u00a0I think structuring the course into 3 main objectives (dbs, nlp, ml) was effective, however not all of the objectives were met with equal enthusiasm, and the flow between the objectives was absent.\r\nIt seemed like after learning about databases, it was never mentioned let alone applied again in the course. \r\nOne main reason for me not using what was learned in the databases section was because of the Neo4j choice in databases. It is a neat, novel choice but honestly doesn't fit into a large number of tasks and is hard to utilize well for beginners and in ml in general.\r\nI think mentioning it is a good idea as it is a cool technology, but mongoDB seems like the far more adaptive, learn-able, and overall superior choice in noSQL databases.\r\nMaybe having a central project that runs the length of the course and utilizes everything we learn would be really cool. The data presented to us in the beginning, the PATIENTS data, would be cool to store in a database instance, use that same data to do some basic NLP and then try some ML methods on it. Keeping a consistent thread can show how all of these technologies can work together and what kind of questions can be answered with one technology vs another.\r\nOverall, the course was very good though.
