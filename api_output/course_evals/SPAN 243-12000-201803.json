            "\u00a0I learned how to have an effective grasp on the general and specific grammar rules of the Spanish language through this course. In addition, all areas of the language were improved through class participation, note-taking, mini-debates, conversation partners from Ecuador, essays, grammar worksheets (of varying types like fill-in-the-blank and extended response), movies, hearing Profesora Asensio speak and exams.  I learned how to be more confident in my speaking, writing and listening abilities in Spanish and additionally more about the Spanish language and cultures worldwide. ",
            "\u00a0Taking the course allowed me to build on the fundamentals of Spanish grammar (ser/estar, preterite vs imperfect, subjunctive, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This course assisted me in my understanding of grammar conventions in the Spanish language. Tangentially, it helped my reading comprehension, writing, and speaking. ",
            "\u00a0My writing and speaking skills increased by taking this course. I gained a greater knowledge of Spanish grammar and English grammar, as well as experience translating. I can also communicate more effectively because there are ideas I now have a better understanding of how to communicate that I had never thought about. This class improved my Spanish fluency overall. ",
            "\u00a0We studied much of the grammar that is covered in Spanish levels 3 and 4 in addition to several other topics. We practiced using several tenses and working in detail with the subjunctive. We also studied other topics including but not limited to Por vs Para, Demonstrative Adjectives, Andar, etc. ",
            "\u00a0It helped me learn the intricacies of the language. It helped improve my vocabulary as well. "

            "\u00a0I really do not believe that there were any weaknesses in the course, as it was extremely well organized to fit as much as a student could do and handle along with other classes.  Strengths were definitely Profesora Asensio's effective teaching style and willingness to help students understand what they do not.  In addition, a strength was definitely the high level of organization that the class had, considering that each day followed what the syllabus stated would occur.  Homework and exams are well outlined by day in the syllabus as well, giving some students the chance to get ahead on work if they would prefer to do so. Lastly, a strength would also be the textbook utilized, as it clearly lists the rules for every topic covered, which is nice for students that like to take notes off of the writing or to quickly obtain the information. ",
            "\u00a0Primary strength of the course was definitely the focus on grammar nuances while the biggest weakness was not improving on the oral component compared to other courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course aims to improve writing, speaking, and listening skills, as well as teach Spanish grammar. It does this by including many writing, reading, and speaking exercises. The skype calls with students in Quito were great exercises in conversation. A diagnostic test is taken just after classes begin so that the professor can gauge students' knowledge of Spanish grammar and decide what should be taught more in depth. I really appreciated this test because the professor met with each student to discuss their test answers, which immediately signaled to me that the professor would take into account our ability to grasp new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are reviewing several forms of grammar repeatedly through written homework, online homework, class activities, and exams. We got a lot of practice with each topic before moving on and we were asked to use different grammar forms on occasional writings. The weaknesses of this class are implementing new grammar into speaking. There is less of an emphasis on speaking in the class other than answering questions during class or the Spanish-speaking partner activity. Improving as a speaker with the language and with this new grammar is important. In order to accomplish this, more activities need to be spoken, even if it's just conversations with classmates. Any opportunity to speak more will benefit students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the small class size and work that reinforced class material. The downside is that there was a lot of work daily. It did help to solidify concepts though. "

            "\u00a0Definitely!! I absolutely loved this course and especially the style of teaching that Profesora Asensio had.  I felt extremely engaged and all of my questions were well answered as soon as I asked them.  Overall, this has been my favorite Spanish course that I have taken so far in my life as a student, and I feel as though I have grown very much in my Spanish abilities since the beginning of the semester. Very clear feedback was given on assignments as well, allowing the students to make note of the mistakes being made. Lastly, this course was not very stressful, but consisted of an environment that was very welcoming and accepting. ",
            "\u00a0The class is primarily made up of students who placed into L5 Spanish by scoring a 5 on the AP test; if you're one of these kids, the course should be relatively similar to what you would expect from a high school Spanish course. Personally, I was a few years removed from taking Spanish in high school so I struggled a little bit, but otherwise you should be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want an L5 Spanish class that assists you in reading, writing, and grammar, this is sufficient. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to students that want to improve any aspect of their fluency in Spanish. The textbook for this class includes translations, so it is easier to grasp the grammatical concepts. The written exercises are of varying length and interesting topics. The conversation partners allow students to practice their speaking and listening skills as well. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in working on your grammar and writing, then I would recommend this course. It covers a lot of the grammar that is covered in levels 3 and 4 so it may be slightly repetitive to take this course if you felt confident about these topics already. If not, it would be a great opportunity to review this material with a focus only on getting the grammar correct. There is less emphasis on practicing speaking in this course which may be another factor on whether this course will be right for you. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if you want to improve your Spanish skills by looking into grammar if you aren't very great at it. "
