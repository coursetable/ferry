            "\u00a0This class provided a detailed understanding of political theories for social movement organization, primarily over the course of the 20th and 21st century, and why certain strategies have been effective. A practical aspect of this class that I really enjoyed, was that we connected abstract theory with many different historical examples of social movements from around the world, and took the time to identify different types of injustice, specific methods actors and structures who are involved in this injustice, and how they can be succinctly challenged. ",
            "\u00a0- Learned more about social movement theories and applied them to real life ",
            "\u00a0I think that you learn a lot about political theory in this class. The second half more so emphasizes case studies and practical applications. It hasn't really added anything major to my knowledge on the subject, but it has definitely added more nuance. ",

Learning more about the New Haven community in particular was useful, and I also liked actually taking an in-depth look at movements such as the U.S. Civil Rights movement, which is often discussed only superficially. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how people create and sustain nonviolent protest. I learned how previous nonviolent protests have been made and the strengths and weaknesses of these protests. I was also able to compare protests around the world to find parallels between the movements. I learned the political process model, the framing process, reasons why people collectively mobilize, tactics in nonviolent protest and history surrounding the beginning of nonviolent protest research. ",

Much of the class revolved around studying theory and framework, then seeing how applicable it is to contemporary and movements of the pass. Overall, the course furthermore does well in helping form concise and argumentative expositories and analysis. "

            "\u00a0Interesting subject matter, very repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Great topic, especially for writing papers. Teaching fellows were great. Professor was also good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n- The stuff we're learning about, the history that we're studying, is SUPER cool. Amazing stories of David beating Goliath.\r\n- Reading responses were a good way to make sure we were keeping up with the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The guest lectures at the end a) gave a lot of different, disparate information that didn't seem tied together from one lecture to the next and b) focused more on civil rights issues than the PROTESTS and MOVEMENTS centered around them. Seemed a little bit outside the purview of the course.\r\n- Sometimes lectures were not so much giving us new information as reformulating things we already knew, I guess.\r\n- To be honest - a little too much focus on allowing for discussion and giving students room to speak. It's a lecture, and most of the time when things were left up to the students we would talk about the material for about one minute before running out of things to say and turning to our personal lives. Seemed like the time could have been better spent. ",
            "\u00a0Far too many readings, but interesting content ",
            "\u00a0The class isnt too difficult, and is fairly interesting but can get boring at times. I expected it to be a class that studied specific movements, but a lot of the focus was on the theoretical study of movements which seemed very self explanatory to me at times. An issue I had with the course was the required reading- because the first or second weeks reading was from one of the books we had to buy, I went to the bookstore and bought all of them. They ran out of used or rentable books, so I had to buy them brand new which came up to around $60 for everything. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching staff is extremely helpful and assistant, and the course was well-structured to help the understanding of revolutions with depth and breadth.\r\n\r\nDespite that, some contents seem a bit rushed and not very well-covered. Professor Wood can consider changing the areas (types) of mobilizations and how much each is covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and the information that we learned was very interesting. Some of the weaknesses are that the readings were long and sometimes repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class is very organized thanks to the TFs. We also covered a lot of interesting material, and the guest lecturers also provided some cool insight. \r\nWeaknesses: Too many readings! It came to the point where everything felt saturated and I couldn't absorb anything more. The Gupta and Englers readings overlapped in their concepts so we shouldn't need to read both! It just muddled my understanding because I couldn't relate concepts to either book. \r\nImprovements: Instead of looking at a broad array of social movements, we could specify on 3-4 social movements. Due to the large number of case studies we had to look at, oftentimes through 1 reading without any in-class discussion, my knowledge on each was surface-level and I would have rather done a deep dive into a fewer number of movements. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of readings that could be repetitive at times. Could have engaged with and facilitated discussion among students better by doing more small group activities. However, I enjoyed the guest speakers and the professors involvement of her own research in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was very interesting. It definitely provides a more systematic way to view political science. I enjoyed the way sociology was merged with political science. I really enjoyed several of the guest lecturers in the second half of the course as well as the case studies. \r\n\r\nHowever, the teaching style (and the initial withholding of power point slides) limited the course's potential. Also the grading expectations were not properly communicated before the first grades with distributed. I talked to many other students who felt the assignments were too ambiguous for the grading to be so specific and strict. Additionally, the professor kept changing the syllabus; it felt like we were given a new syllabus almost every other week which is not great for organization. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great overall but if the work for the course was split up more throughout the semester it would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Often times the readings for this course were not feasible and, aside from the course books, it was also hard to see how many of the supplemental readings related to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures weren't very engaging and there weren't many opportunities for discussion for those on the non-writing track. The reflection and paper prompts were very open-ended, which was sometimes nice in exploring concepts of my choosing, but other times it made expectations unclear. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the guest lectures and case studies that allowed us to understand the applications to what we were reading. I didn't like that as non-writing students we only engaged with the texts for midterms. I wish we could have integrated them more and made them more applicable. ",
            "\u00a0One of the largest weaknesses of the class was the exams. I thought that in a class which is so application based that the tests would be a place to demonstrate applied knowledge, not regurgitate the names of articles or laws. I know that at least one TA was fighting against the questions that were solely based on memorization without application, a warning that should have been heeded. Having more application based tests would also eliminate the need to have in class review sessions to review the minutia. \r\nAdditionally, I think that the reading can be a little unevenly distributed week to week, which I would like to see change, but it's a minor aspect of the class.\r\nThe biggest strength in the class was bringing in experts for lectures after we had a foundation in some theory. I found the guest lecturers quite interesting and the most engaging part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: wide range of topics, interesting\r\nweaknesses: guest lecturers could have been more contextualized and concise. some offered too much information that we weren't sure would be tested ",
            "\u00a0The course was great, I genuinely loved it. It had a little bit of everything; from theoretical models to real movements that succeeded or failed which made the content very intriguing. I wish I could've learned more about Latinx movements in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class could have a better structure. The assignments lacked a rubric. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength was grounding the theory of the class in specific examples of social movements, and utilizing the vast knowledge of visiting professors and teaching fellows to supplement learning. The main improvement I can think of is explicitly referencing the most important highlights from the assigned readings throughout the lectures, rather than focusing on them primarily in discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness is the few examples given and vagueness of some assignments when there seemed to be a very specific style desired. \r\n\r\nA strength was the opportunity for in class discussion and the passion, knowledge, and first hand experience of the TAs and Professor Wood. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting ! You probably self-selected into the course because you care about ameliorating social issues. This will teach you about that, and some days are going to be extremely interesting (especially when there are guest lectures towards the second half!). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: You may fall asleep through some lectures. Maybe it's the extra 15 minutes, or maybe its the very very soft voice of the instructor, but there is a non-negligible probability you'll fall asleep at least once. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the TFs were SO helpful and the course material was interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: the reading was very excessive and the tests focused too much on minutae from the readings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Wood is an expert in her field and she is so knowledgeable! \r\n\r\nWeakness: But, at the same time I often feel that I lacked the background knowledge to understand what she was explaining. I often understood the political theories but I didnt understand how she was applying them. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the guest lecturers, but I believed that their material could have been more integrated with the course themes. What would have been useful is a specific theme or question that all of the lecturers aim to address that would have synthesized their material into the broader course as a whole. Other strengths of the class was its structure and the coursework, especially for the writing track. However, I did feel like some of the technical and theoretical material were a bit dry at times, since the class was best at putting theory into practice and allowing us to see how tactics played out in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course much less practically useful than I'd hoped. It felt overly academic and esoteric: I learned about new ways to talk about ideas I mostly already knew, and few new things to apply to work as an activist or community organizer. The organization of the course and the choice of specific movements felt somewhat random, and it seemed at times as though the things we discussed were chosen because the professor had a connection to them, not because they were specifically useful for the course. This was compounded by the structure of the course: while I thought that the response papers were useful for furthering my thinking, and the TFs were a good resource to help with them, the tests didn't make sense at all in the context of the course. They asked us to regurgitate information rather than really working with it in a meaningful way, and so I felt like a lot of my time spent on the course was unfortunately used to memorize very specific information, rather than learning applicable lessons. I also thought that the readings could have been chosen better. They were often really long, which I wouldn't have minded much except I didn't really feel that they taught me many valuable things; rather, they seemed to discuss intuitive ideas but in a very academic way. However, some of the non-textbook readings were really interesting, and I liked the choice of guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher and the presentations were easy to understand. The TFs were also very helpful with strengthening understanding concepts and bringing to light specialized subjects about nonviolent protest and organizing. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course was the Professor and the Teaching Fellows, all of which were passionate about the field of study. There was open room for lengthy conversation regarding a wide variety of movements and their impact. \r\nWeakness of a course is probably the repetitiveness that can occur in some weeks regarding lecture and the readings.

The course is a great introductory course to get you thinking about collective action and provides some good case studies for you to learn and apply these theories to. However, this would not serve as a good intermediate level course since it does not go beyond that. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not sure if I would recommend it. I've heard that over classes provide knowledge on framing structures and political organizing but are overall more effective. I think I was disappointed by the course-- the description on course search sounded better than the course ended up being. Though I definitely learned things and found the material engaging, I don't know if I should have used up one of my Yale credits on this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course was great and Professor Wood and the TAs were always very helpful, approachable, and supportive. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course I learned that you have to study political science the way you would any other science. So as a humanities person who is interested in understanding the bigger picture, and the way systems are connected, this class focused far to much on specifics that seemed irrelevant in the long run. If you are just looking for a way to earn your social science credits then this is a decent class for you as it attracts a variety of motivated and politically active individuals but it would not be a course that I would advertise or strongly recommend to anyone. ",

            "\u00a0I would if they were interested in becoming an activist. If not it seems to mostly give you the vocabulary for stuff that seems intuitive, although I would if the rest of the course was styled more like the final few guest lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's not super difficult and it's pretty interesting. If you're looking for a nice political science or sociology class and you're not familiar with the fields then I'd recommend this one. If you're familiar with them, then you could probably do without taking this (unless you're taking it to fulfill a credit). ",

I think that the people interested in this sort of material want to actually find ways to apply it to their work, and while this course does do that in a limited sense, it really teaches you how to talk about activism more than how to practice it. Additionally, I think that its structure really rewarded you for memorization rather than meaningful interaction with the material. ",
