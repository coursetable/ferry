However, theres a bit of an opaque grading policy, so it can be hard to know how youre doing overall. ",

They helped me to keep the information fresh which is vital when learning a language. I also think learning the dialogues was also very helpful. I do not know any weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Yes certainly. great language course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This course is excellent because of the amazing teachers but be aware that you have to study daily and there are short(5 minute) quizzes and homework EVERYDAY. However, this helps to improve your Chinese immensely. "
