            "\u00a0This course is a chapter by chapter progression through Being and Time, a difficult text made viscerally engaging with Hagglund's lectures. Truly, its a phenomenology of the \"right here\" \"right now\" in the first half, and then a rather earth-shaking philosophical proposal in the second. ",
            "\u00a0Heidegger's Being and Time, which takes some time to get but is pretty crazy once it starts to click. Being able to read the book while going through Professor Hgglund's de re interpretation of it is a very cool experience, and going through it chapter by chapter really helps you understand what's going on at each step of the process. You also learn that Professor Hgglund really likes Lebron James, making jokes about his relationship life (what is it actually????? I never found out), and using phrases like \"inseparable but distinguishable.\" You'll view concepts like death, temporality, and your own being and the being of entities around you in a new way. You can also quote Heidegger around your friends and sound really cool. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Heidegger's text, Being and Time, and the phenomenological arguments brought forward in the book. This course provided reasonable context as to why this book was so groundbreaking and certainly laid a good foundation for discussing various ideas that are applicable to all facets of life. As for skills, this course provided good practice in posing questions in an intelligent manner that led to constructive dialogue and learning, as well as enhancing logic and precision of language. Moreover, gained insight into the structure of time, death, care, and was able to reflect on how I live my own life. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course really went in depth in an interpretation of Heideggers Being and Time. As a difficult text, the course taught me how to read carefully and critically. The lectures and sections gave powerful insights and tools to understand Heideggers philosophy. I also found that struggling with Heideggers Interpretation on the meaning of being as increadibly challenging, not just intellectually but also personallythe ideas require one to struggle with how we take ourselves to engage with our projects in the world. My developed thinking and reading skills, along with Heideggers ideas expanded me immensely. ",
            "\u00a0This class, by nature of the topic and its well erudition, advances an extensive understanding of the self. Heidegger's foray into Being and Professor Hagglund's very helpful clarifications provides an intimate purview into the structures of sense, of how the things we take as valuable appear as valuable, of how being ourselves means to stand by what we hold ourselves to - it is semester long development of the basic but profound message: that you are what you do. This class provides an insight into the responsibility of every moment, of its indebtedness to an open future and past, and the sheer difficulty of even the every day. Hagglund's class and Heidegger's text open, for the first time, a true dialogue to meaningful living, instead of seeking to settle it. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered the opportunity to read Being and Time in a way which offered uncommon insight into the structure and meaning of the work. ",
            "\u00a0I started this class having never read any Heidegger before. This class provided me both with the very necessary foundation for starting to engage with Heidegger, and a deeper knowledge of 'Being and Time'. In summary, I could say that I learnt 'Being and Time' this semester. As the class title suggests, that is what was we were supposed to be learning, but as Professor Hgglund promised in the first lecture of the semester, the class was about life and living just as much as it was about Heidegger. The two are different sides of the same coin after all - inseparable but distinguishable. \r\n\r\nMany of the same ideas and themes showed up throughout the lectures and sections - inseparable, but distinguishable being one of them, so much so that I find myself thinking about Heidegger and about this class in every day. Writing this evaluation, choosing classes for next semester, making plans and figuring out projects. I feel like I see Heidegger everywhere now. I cannot stop thinking about 'Being and Time'. So beyond being about what the title suggests, this class has made me think more about my own life, the choices I make and why what I do matters. There is nothing more valuable a class can offer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Heidegger and how to understand the original text of Being and Time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthened analytical and heuristic skills; strong phenomenological understanding. ",
            "\u00a0A close reading of Heidegger's Being and Time. I got better at reading philosophical texts and gained a greater understanding of existentialism. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a firm understanding of Heidegger's Being and Time and how his ideas have shifted intellectual thought. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent and thorough examination of Heidegger's magnum opus. Hagglund takes you through the book chronologically while also taking care to situate larger themes and concepts in the context of the book as a whole. An excellent introductory to intermediate course on Heidegger's existential phenomenology. ",
            "\u00a0It would take much too long to answer this question properly. Altogether, my worldview has been changed. I've developed a much deeper, richer, and more nuanced understanding of the meaning of being and the underlying structures that render intelligible our everyday existence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read really difficult books, and think about things in a super reductive, complicated way. The papers reinforced my ability to analyze and pick apart logical arguments. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class lectures are inimitable and crucial to be able to follow the course's reading of Being and Time-- Hagglund is after re-translating the work himself and working on a another book with his reading of temporality and time. Certainly, this was the strength of the course. Because it is so totalizing, there is no room for other perspectives or readings of the text that are not to him just misguided or wrong, so that work is incumbent on the students. I do believe there is long way to go in understanding B&T before raising these critiques, however. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hgglund is an engaging lecturer, the topics are fascinating, and writing the papers really helped solidify my understanding of the text. It was a systematic breakdown of the book, chapter by chapter. I also liked the schemas that Professor Hgglund made and continued to refer to throughout the book; they helped me picture out what was going on.\r\nWeaknesses: This is going to look like a lot, but this is me nagging: perhaps this is better suited for a course on Heidegger in general and not a course called \"Being and Time,\" but I would have liked to see how this book affected Heidegger's personal life decisions, specifically his Nazi-ism. I've heard that he uses some of the philosophy in this book to justify some of his decisions, and although I can guess at which parts, I would have liked to hear more about that. Also, and I don't usually say this, but longer sections might have been better for a course like this, because sections were when we really dove into the text. Lecture sometimes felt a little repetitive. Also, we watched Manchester by the Sea, which was a cool movie, but didn't refer to it that much later on. And the Krapp video was...interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Hagglund is extremely knowledgable in this subject, and very passionate about spreading his knowledge to his students. His commitment was quite evident. The course focuses on one book, so you can really dive into the knowledge that this book holds, and really get familiar with it. The coursework (three short papers for undergraduates) was smart and made the intellectually challenging nature of Heidegger more manageable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  There was more focus on trying to make Heidegger's theories work, rather than allowing space for critique. It might be beneficial for the professor to point out where Heidegger's points might not work, and various ways others have tried to deal with those issues.\r\nThis course would also do well to provide further context such as whom Heidegger was responding to, and how philosophers responded to such a groundbreaking text. It would just provide helpful framing. \r\nFinally, some points in the text were over-emphasised at the expense of others; for instance, Prof. Hagglund spent a majority of time reworking and answering questions about his diagram of dynamic action, but whose diagram might or might not adequately capture Heidegger's actual conception of this. \r\n\r\nAlso note: it might be useful for both TAs to have similar ways of running section and grading assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hgglund was kncreadibly passionate and dedicated, coming into classes with full lectures prepared but also indulgent of our many questions. His interpretation was a powerful tool in helping me read the text for my self, and I actually enjoyed that he did not make his lectures text based in explanation because that allowed me to then go and struggle with it myself in a rewarding way. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - Hagglund's incredible intimacy with the text and his ability to diagram with clarity that understanding. However, this tends to preclude other possible interpretations of the text, and if Hagglund is as confident as he is of his, it would help his students attain that confidence if he could explain, even if only briskly due to time to constraints, alternative points of interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers incredible detail and ample opportunity to do the required reading, as well as providing the opportunity to ask both general and specific questions. The only deficit of the course is that I found myself desiring more time to delve further into the questions raised over the course of the reading and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I can fault this class. I drank the Heidegger Kool-Aid to the lees. The lectures were very helpful in grappling with the text. I found it helpful to attend lecture before doing the reading for the week as I found that having some understanding of the terms and concepts allowed me to look for the right things when I was reading. The lectures repeated the same information at times, and I think this was necessary. 'Being and Time' is complicated, and I would say near impossible to read alone. The repetition in lectures and section allowed me to feel like I had a very good handle on the fundamental ideas, and the very Heidegger-specific vocabulary. \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, the only thing I would have like from this class is for there to be a greater emphasis on the secondary literature. The reading for each week was dense, but not incredibly time consuming, and I think that having secondary literature included on the syllabus, as more than recommended reading would have forced me to engage with it more. Saying this, we were given a list of secondary literature that we could read on our own time, which is something I plan to read now that the class is over. I would have liked to read it during the class, but unless reading is assigned on a syllabus, it is often difficult to engage with. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures, while interesting, were often digressive and poorly structured. Oftentimes ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course I have taken at Yale. Prof. Hagglund brings within grasp an extremely difficult (and equally significant) text. Every lecture is engaging, the TF's are smart and dedicated, and the short essay assignments are straightforward (and graded fairly). ",
            "\u00a0Martin Hagglund is a fantastic lecturer, and section was very helpful for understanding the themes of the book. The course was a chapter by chapter reading of Being and Time, which made sense, and the paper topics were all very well thought out and helpful for solidifying my understanding of the reading. A weakness, which the instructors were aware of, was that the lectures didn't always match up with where we were in the text; that became less of an issue as the semester progressed. Sometimes lecture could be a bit repetitive, but that wasn't necessarily a weakness all of the time, since some of the concepts required several lectures to really become clear. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hagglund's lectures were such a pleasure to watch. I came into class everyday not expecting which direction it would lead and leaving happily surprised. ",
            "\u00a0Although they were usually great, some of the lectures were way too disorganized to understand, especially because of the number of student questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were repetitive, and often seemed to have little to do with the reading. ",
            "\u00a0This was a superb course in nearly all respects. Professor Hagglund's lectures were invariably fantastic, section was well-organized and helpful, the assignments were well structured, the material was incredibly interesting, the class altogether straightforward and deeply challenging and engaging without imposing unnecessary busywork. I feel truly lucky to have taken this course. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion would be for Professor Hagglund to limit time for questions during lectures. The material is challenging and fascinating, so at times we would spend a large portion of lecture addressing student questions. I think we may have been better off in many cases getting through all of what Professor Hagglund had prepared for a given lecture (which was always impressive and enlightening) and using remaining time for questions. I occasionally felt that the brilliant stuff that Professor Hagglund had ready for us on a given day was eclipsed by a slew of questions. That being said, Professor Hagglund is among the best question-answerers I have ever encountered, and generally does so in a way that is fluid and interrelated with his prepared remarks. Nonetheless, a balance should be found and adhered to. ",
            "\u00a0By far Professor Hagglund is the best thing about this course. I would never had been able to grasp any part of the book without his energetic and helpful lectures and diagrams. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely-- it is marvelous to see a philosopher at work on another philosopher's flagship work on a subject so intrinsically relevant to one's experiences and \"Being in the world.\" There are hints of an ethics increasingly removed from the text itself smuggled in towards the end, but the course is brilliant overall. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in learning about the fundamental structures underlying your existence! Three five-page papers (kinda like DS), all completely reconstructions, and then show up to sections (which you will want to anyway). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for sure. It will help you rethink your life, and help to build your logical skills. It is a very challenging course on a challenging book, but Prof. Hagglund makes the book easier to understand, and not only that, but actually enjoyable. Prof. Hagglund is seriously devoted to being a good teacher, and will make himself amenable if you put in the hard work and ask questions in class or go to his office hours. Do be warned, however, that this class is not a literal reading of the book, but Prof. Hagglund's interpretation of Heidegger such that his ideas continue to make sense and hold. Finally this course is taught to both undergraduates and graduates (with differing expectations of both), which one should be aware of. Overall, take this if you're interested in unpacking existentiell vs. existential, ontic vs ontological, time, death, care, and authenticity. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend. It was increadibly rewarding to struggle with Heideggers Being and Time for a full semester and feelthrough Hagglunds wonderful lectures, text-based papers, and interesting sections with TA Sydneythat my thinking was developing and that my conception of who I was as a Being with my kind of being expanding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely; No thinker except for Sartre, Camus, Rilke and Nietzsche has been as influential to the individual and his task in the modern world as Heidegger. Hagglund does an excellent case of explaining his somewhat recondite expression of that message. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in the material of this course, definitely take it. Lectures are always highly engaging, in addition to being ridiculously well formulated. You will find yourself looking at many things through the lens of the course, and engaging with the text (and with professor Hgglunds lectures) in very unexpected ways. ",
            "\u00a0This is undoubtedly one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Yes, \"best\" may be a matter of personal preference, but I would recommend this class to anyone - whether they have done a lot of philosophy or not. The material is challenging, but Professor Hgglund and the teaching assistants deliver the book, and its major ideas in bites that make engaging with it manageable. \r\n\r\nHaving taken a few other philosophy classes before this one, I was unsure about it to begin with. My major frustration was that the philosophy surveys I had done before were interesting, and yet I felt disengaged from them. The questions being asked didn't often feel like they had any implications for me and my own life. It is enjoyable the think about Plato's Forms, and whether ice partakes in the form of Cold, but coming to any conclusion on this subject had no implication on how I saw the ice coming from the drink machines in the dinning halls. \r\n\r\nHeidegger, on the other hand, has changed everything - not because he provides any answers or conclusions, but for the opposite reason in fact. He provides only the questions - one's that have far reaching implications whether you are a philosophy or environmental studies major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the best course I have taken at Yale. Prof. Hagglund brings within grasp an extremely difficult (and equally significant) text. Every lecture is engaging, the TF's are smart and dedicated, and the short essay assignments are straightforward (and graded fairly). ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful course. I would recommend it to any student. Martin Hagglund's enthusiasm for the material is contagious; it's clear that his goal is to make Heidegger's philosophy relevant to daily life, and he does a great job of doing that. One of the best courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Promising but flawed. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Heidegger's ideas are outstanding and Professor Hagglund makes them straightforward and easy to understand. I would never be able to read the text on my own, but now having read it have a completely new perspective on what it means to exist. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone interested in thinking about the way humans work would like this course. Psychologist, philosopher, or (like me), historian, Heidegger and Hagglund have something to say to us all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is an absolute must for anyone interested in philosophy or intellectual history. The material is dense and tricky but extremely rewarding. By far the most exciting and important class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent introduction to Being and Time. Very well structured. A must for anyone interested in rigorous continental philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Be warned: was advertised as a seminar, was in fact a lecture with a discussion section.\r\n\r\nA few things to expect:\r\n1) a thorough delve into Prof. Hgglund's latest analysis of Being and Time\r\n2) engaging lectures that go beyond the chapters being read; lectures don't always align or help with the reading. \r\n\r\nNote: if you want to read the book, you must be self-driven-- lectures don't demand any engagement with the text. \r\n\r\n\r\n3) no study of Heidegger's methodology in the context of other philosophy (metaphysics, phenomenology, hermeneutics, etc.)\r\n4) no study of historical context or influence ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, so long as it is not their first course in philosophy. \"Being and Time\" presents challenging material, but Professor Hagglund will give you the knowledge and tools to engage with and understand this work. This is a fantastic course taught by a truly special professor, and it is not overly demanding of your time. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to ever read this book (which, while very interesting, I'm still not sure what it means or why it's important), you should definitely do so in this course. "
