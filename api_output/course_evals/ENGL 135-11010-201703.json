            "\u00a0This course really fed my love of poetry, and made me feel confident enough to begin putting my writing out there into the world. It was really important to my development as a writer, and helped me realize how interested I am in pursuing poetry. Love this course! ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 135 was my first college-level poetry class. I loved carving out space in my week to read and write. I was exposed to so many new contemporary poets and learned about different techniques like erasure, ekphrasis, prose poetry, etc. \r\nI also learned about workshopping-- how to give helpful feedback and how to incorporate others' feedback into the revision process. ",
            "\u00a0Developed many insights about how to read and write poetry deliberately and take my poetry to the next level ",
            "\u00a0Simply put, I learned how to read and write poetry. I have never fully understood the basics of poetic forms before this class; we also had a focus on editing, which helped me build a strong poetry portfolio for any future endeavors in the area. ",
            "\u00a0Improved ability at reading and writing poetry, at understanding literary devices within poems (sound, meter, etc.) and in prose (you read theory as well as poems). ",
            "\u00a0I gained SO much from this course.  I went from writing rambly diary-entry \"poems\" to a portfolio of work I was genuinely proud of.  In so many ways this class gave me the skills to write what I had always tried to but could not achieve with the technical means I needed just beyond my grasp. I drastically improved in my use of enjambment, structure, language, description, mood, tone, progression and so much more.  I genuinely feel I can write good poetry now, and this class has set me up for hopefully much more learning and writing.  Additionally, the readings were great and I now feel like I know so much more about modern poetry in general and about important poets and techniques, and different experimentation and progression of poetry styles. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much more nuanced perspective on poetry of various forms (and how poetry has interacted with its tradition)! I became more skilled at taking inspiration from writers and writing alongside writers and my classmates, who provided me with important lessons in every class meeting. I became better at critiquing my classmates, so that instead of giving a broad piece of advice, I instead tried to find a particular word that could be changed. I also changed in my style of giving comments to poems, from a specific recommendation to a more open and speculative hope for the poet. I have come to consider myself a poet through this class!!! "

            "\u00a0Fantastic class! Not too intensive, little enough work to really focus on and develop your poetry, which you will be motivated to do because Emily Skillings is *amazing*. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I think it was structured really well, with both a reading and workshop component. We had the opportunity to read published work, each other's work, and produce our own. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent balance of reading, analyzing, writing, workshopping, and revising. I wouldn't alter any of those proportions! I only wish we had more time :) ",
            "\u00a0I had a lot of fun writing poetry and I really loved this course, but I think it's a little bit too gutty. The readings are great, but you could have gotten by just fine without doing any of them, and the whole course just felt too easy and it was therefore easy to not take it seriously. It's a shame because this course made me realize how great poetry and writing poetry can be and I wish it were a little more rigorous. The workshops were also fun, but not extremely helpful, since we're all beginners and I felt like Emily's advice was the most helpful despite the huge blocks of time we devoted to workshopping. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved Emily Skillings and the fact that she made the class such a safe space to explore poetry! She gave the best constructive feedback on poems and picked great poems as examples of each type of poetry we talked about. The fact that she cared about us made the class one I looked forward to every time. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic.  The structure of the semester and individual classes was so great.  Responding to specific prompts, having my poems edited and analyzed by my wonderful professor and classmates, and reading and studying a vast array of writers and styles substantially helped me develop my own voice as a writer.  Workshopping was so great, the prompts were really challenging, interesting, and helpful, and the readings and our discussion of them was fabulous.  I loved everyone in the class and was so impressed by them.  As an upperclassmen-non english major, this class has been one of my favorites at yale and definitely the most personally meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0This course, like no other, has helped me become more comfortable with writing. Emilys generative writing prompts have been instrumental to my poetry writing. Even though the course has already ended, I look back on the writing prompts and the texts weve read for the course! I loved visiting the art gallery to draw inspiration for our ekphrasis style poems, as well as learning about poems that operate within the style of \"ekphrasis\" (like the neo-benshi). I loved going to a poetry reading and writing about it for an assignment as well as giving a presentation on my semester-long poetry partners selected poems!!! I really love the course as it is right now and wish I could keep taking it! "

            "\u00a0Yes! Great way to explore poetry and improve your own. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend. Poetry really opens up your ways of thinking about yourself if you take it seriously and if you have a good professor, and Prof Skillings is amazing, so. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. Whether or not you want to pursue writing, this course is incredibly encouraging and will support you in developing your voice . ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! It is an excellent, relaxed way to discover and cultivate your poetic voice. ",
            "\u00a0This course is so much fun and poetry is great. It's not super rigorous or difficult to get a good grade in, so it might be good if that's what you're looking for but not if you want a really heavy English/writing experience. If you're just wanting to explore poetry and feel free to write, this is a really great opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would 200% recommend this course to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this couse to another student. If it were possible, I would like to take this course again. Professor Skillings plays a big part in that: she's an engaged, brilliant professor who gives wonderful insight into your poetry, and a very helpful, supportive editor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you think you have any interest in poetry, its a must-take to really begin to understand how poems work on an artistic and mechanical level. Even if youre unsure about your interest level, the format of workshop builds a unique kind of community found few other places in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  However much poetry you've written before this class will teach you so much and provide a great academic setting for thorough analysis of others' writing and improvement of yours.  You will enjoy and be helped by the readings.  Workshopping is so helpful and its amazing to also see the process of incredibly creative peers.  I was blown away by how smart, creative, talented, and helpful everyone in the class was and it totally made the experience.  I really could not recommend it enough to anyone considering it, whether you think you're an incredible writer or have basically no experience. ",
            "\u00a0Take poetry with Emily Skillings!!! She is such a generous teacher and you learn so much through reading different styles of poems for each class meeting and then writing poems inspired by the poems and what youve talked about in class. The writing prompts themselves are so awesome!!! They are designed to help you write freely, with plenty of space open to innovate. You get to have personalized writing prompts, a poetry partners within the workshop, group outings. If you have an idea about making poetry, you are given all the tools and resources to help you with it. Because of an idea brought up in class about projecting poetry on the walls of Beinecke, we got to do a live poetry session and write on the walls of Beinecke as a class! "
