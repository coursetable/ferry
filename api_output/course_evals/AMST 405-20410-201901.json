            "\u00a0The best part of the class is you can apply the strategies you learn to your own writing and see it improved because of that. The weakness is that the grad school students either haven't done the reading or choose not to speak, since participation is not part of the grade, and so that means sometimes a few undergrads carry the class, along with Professor Stepto, who has a propensity to speak for a while. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus in this class was very well considered. I liked that the books were organized by theme rather than just chronologically, and I liked that Professor Stepto came in with a plan of the major themes of each book. Sometimes I felt like class discussions were not great, since people did not necessarily participate in the discussions unless explicitly asked by the professor. "
