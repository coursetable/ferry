            "\u00a0I learned how to trust my own voice in translation, and how to take in the criticism of those in workshop and best use it to the advantage of my work. I also learned how to really listen to a piece to hear what it's saying (or what it's not, and what it needs to be saying). This class was essential to my time at Yale and was a wonderful capstone. It made me a better reader and writer. ",
            "\u00a0The course stimulated me to think about translation as a process and the intermedial possibilities within the field. I discovered new ways to listen to verbal textures and to write about the vocality of language, among other things. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned something every minute of this class - it's workshop-based, so you really get into the weeds sometimes, but they're the fun-est weeds. I learned how to be a better, more attentive translator; to look at that work in the context of what others have written in and about translation; and I've learned so much about Chinese, Arabic, Czech, Yiddish, and more.  The collaborative spirit of the course teaches you a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to translate! The course was my second in translation. Previously, I learned how to translate. Here, I learned the criteria the field uses for translation, and how I can fine tune my work according to these standards. The course was especially helpful in the instructor's expertise on not only the process of translating, but translation as a career. His familiarity with field leaders and his sharing his own work process and projects helped me envision a future in the field. "

            "\u00a0I loved the workshops but it might be nice to have a short five-minute break built in, just to have a stretch before going on with the rest of the class. Otherwise getting to devote that much time to workshopping was amazing and something I have not had access to in any other class. Having those long discussions about people's work was crucial and I'm grateful that I got to be a part of it. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses  only strengths! I greatly appreciated that our respective translation projects were self-directed and that we could frequently check in with Prof. Cole and the class as our work progressed. Every individual brought in a distinct perspective and energy to the table, which became extremely useful during our workshop sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is in its intensive nature. The instructor emailed me before I was even officially enrolled to get a better understanding of my interest and goals, so I hit the ground running within the first week. His dedication and the dedication of my fellow students set the pace for a very productive semester. I was able to progress quickly because I could get help from him, my TA, or my peers as soon as I needed it.\r\n\r\nI do wish the course were somewhat more formal logistically--because of the intensiveness, a lot of procedural challenges came up, like when we would be meeting, who'd sign up for which workshop, ect. Sometimes the help we received felt uneven because the structure for beginning this dialogue was fly-by-the-seat-of-our-pants style. On one hand, this lets students relax in an otherwise work-intensive class if their schedule demanded. On the other, I wonder if students less used to creating their own structure might be disadvantaged by less formal organization. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, if the student is really interested in and committed to literary translation. You will learn so much about your own voice and the voices of others, and at the end you will have work that you can be really proud of. Also, you will get to read some amazing stuff that you would have never known about before. All in all it's a demanding, but extremely rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is the best kind of training a rising translator can get. Be aware that this course requires real work and responsibility, but the class is so dynamic that you will never find yourself complaining (or even viewing the work as such)! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take any class you can with Peter Cole. He is hands down the best and most caring professor I've ever had. He gives brilliant feedback and is incredibly dedicated to his students. Class discussions were always lively and interesting, and you'd be amazed at how much you can learn just from the comments in workshop. ",
            "\u00a010/10 would recommend. If you want to translate, and if you care about form and feeling as well as sense, you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in and serious about translation. The course would be extremely helpful for the student with those interests. As an advanced course, however, someone with a mild or passive interest might find themselves in deeper water than they're prepared to handle. "
