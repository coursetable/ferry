            "\u00a0I continued an independent project in the lab of Dr. Anjelica Gonzalez for the second year in a row and it's a great chance to hone my laboratory skills and work on my own project toward the senior thesis/presentation for the major. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new bench research skills and developed my scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about independent research. ",
            "\u00a0My work was very independent, and I largely taught myself everything I needed to know as I went. This independence pushed me to learn countless new things and I definitely grew as a result. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about being in lab, running experiments, testing tissues, analyzing and presenting data as well as updating and investigating my hypotheses. "

            "\u00a0Poor communication about deadlines and expectations. DUS never responds when he receives email updates. Perhaps make things due as assignments on Canvas, so students clearly see their stuff is submitted. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is very flexible, allowing us to focus on our research rather than assignments for the credit. Perhaps it could be improved by sending occasional reminder emails the few times there are assignments to be turned in. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the opportunity to join a lab at Yale and take part in innovative research. ",
            "\u00a0Great to do your own research! "

            "\u00a0This is a great way to get started on senior research to have substantive material to present in the second semester. You get out as much as you put in. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a senior and are on the fence about taking this research for credit, you absolutely should. The requirements of the credit are chill and you get a jump start on building a relationship with a PI and lab that will be pivotal in making your senior project worthwhile. And you get a letter grade out of it which is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend doing a full year project to anyone in BME. It provided the chance to get more involved in a project and actually get results. One semester is hard to get a lot done, so a full year provides the chance to get a feel for things and then really get into a project by the end of the year. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think it's good to get credit for your senior project, and it's kind of necessary to have two semesters to do your senior project. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're gonna be in the lab anyway "
