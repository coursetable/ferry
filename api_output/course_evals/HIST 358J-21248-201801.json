            "\u00a0A deep understanding of Mexican history, a truly fascinating topic. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an incredible look at the ebbs and flows of Mexican history, from a cultural and political perspective. I have come to better understand the role of the Mexican Revolution in Mexico's history and cultural identity, and I have come to grips with the sheer power of Mexican nationalism to drive the course of events. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite seminars that I've taken at Yaleit's structured to learn about the broad swaths of Mexican history, with stops at specific points that help you zoom into the context of what you're learning. Seminar guests also contributed greatly to the class dynamic, and helped expand my understanding of Mexican history as contemporary. ",
            "\u00a0Social, political, and cultural history of Mexico ",
            "\u00a0Mexico since Independence gave a stellar overview of Mexican history from independence to present. The focus is largely on the twentieth century, but the course moves at a good pace and does not get bogged down in any particular period. Mexico is a fascinating case study for any history major as a \"democratic\" nation that experienced 70+ years of one party in power, only to peacefully transition away from this \"perfect dictatorship\" in 2000. Mexico is also extremely topical today and a knowledge of its history greatly aids understanding present issues of border security and trade with the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the complexity of Mexican politics and history . The reading was interesting and I enjoyed the use of lots of journalistic accounts in the second half of the course ",
            "\u00a0I gained extensive knowledge of Mexico from its founding to today. We focused on the revolutionary period most extensively, and gained insight into how social, political, and economic factors transformed the country. ",
            "\u00a0Both a wonderfully in-depth survey of modern Mexican history as well as a fantastic way in which to hone one's writing and analytical skills, this course emphasizes the importance of both cultural understanding as well as intense intellectual analysis when considering Mexico's long century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Mexican history! And I developed an ability to read news and media stories on Mexico with a more discerning and critical eye. It was super super helpful for understanding Mexico's upcoming presidential elections. "

            "\u00a0This course does a great job of bringing out the nuance and heterogeneity in Mexican history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: truly outstanding professor, excellent readings, and balanced assignments. Fascinating guest speakers towards the end of the course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: conversations could sometimes be a little circular and flat, perhaps because students were a little shy or (gasp) did not do all the readings properly? I also felt like students spent too much time on their laptops and as result were not always deeply engaged in the discussion at every seminar meetings. I wish Prof. Joseph would ban laptops honestly, they are so disruptive.  \r\n\r\nI also wish that the course focused a bit more on evaluating secondary sources against each other, rather than simply taking them at face value. I don't think there was a single time over the course of the semester that someone clearly disagreed with a historical argument we read, which I find puzzling.  Nonetheless, this is a minor gripe about a course that was overall truly excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Course was interesting, but sometimes felt rushed to get through presentations ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent in covering many different topics without losing depth. The readings were varied and fascinating, and the seminar discussions urged us to tackle the most sophisticated questions. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing discussion, Professor has a wealth of knowledge, and the material is engaging. Only weakness is that there is a lot of reading, but it is well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the selection of readings was overall very good. I especially appreciated the variety of primary source documents in the Mexico Reader that gave great color to the secondary reading. One change I would make to the readings would be to pare down the number of NYT articles assigned towards the end of the course. I also thought the Alamo film was somewhat hokey and could be dropped or replaced. Prof. Joseph did a great job leading discussions, and I thought the student presentations were pretty well integrated into the seminar format. I really appreciated how invested Prof. Joseph was in our research projects, but I wished there were a few more resources made available to the class for where to seek out primary source material for our final papers. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a strength of the course was how Professor Joseph integrated both political and cultural analysis into his syllabus. We studied Mexico from a range of perspectives which I think speaks to the depth of his knowledge. I didn't see any weaknesses in the course, I would take it again as is. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating class discussion, intriguing essay prompts, an incredibly engaged professor: this course has it all. My only comment would be that it is a gargantuan task to attempt to condense down so many years of Mexican history into one seminar. Professor Joseph pulls it off, but questions definitely still linger about some periods in the 20th and 21st centuries. This is to be expected, as lifetimes could be devoted to the study of Mexican history, yet I do wonder if a lecture course or even an added seminar focusing on specific periods in Mexican history could be useful. That being said, this class absolutely nails what it sets out to do. The workload is fair: plenty of reading, but assigned discussants each week and guest lecturers facilitate discussion well. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were usually pretty good, but often incredibly redundant. We had about 300-400 pages of reading a week, but I felt I could have gained the same information with only 100-200, and I usually had no idea which readings to prioritize. \r\n\r\nI loved how much guidance we got with our papers and how welcome Professor Joseph made me feel to come to office hours. \r\n\r\nThe class was engaged and I gained a lot from the comments of my peers, but we could have benefitted from a discussion in the beginning of the class about how to have a good discussion! Too often it felt like folks were saying things just to say them, not because it built on the points of anyone else. "

            "\u00a0Definitely - Prof. Joseph is one of the best teachers and thinkers at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, hands down would recommend, if only to experience the intelligence, warmth and knowledge of Prof. Joseph. An absolute master in his field and a stand-out educator. Yale is lucky to have him. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course if you want to learn about Mexican history from one of the premier historians on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Highly highly recommend any course with Professor Joseph: his insights, pedagogy, and approach to teaching made this class an excellent one. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible course, a must take. Professor Joseph has a wealth of knowledge and leads engaging discussions. Workload is manageable and material is interesting. Professor Joseph is amazing!! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend Mexico since Independence. I was somewhat trepidatious going in, worrying that the two-hour seminar might be boring, but my worries were quickly assuaged and my expectations for the class were well exceeded. Prof. Joseph is extraordinarily kind and a great seminar leader with lots of experience and his knowledge of the subject is seemingly limitless. The end of the course, when we engaged with a number of guest speakers, was especially fun. Great junior seminar with a high but manageable workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think its a great introduction to the history of an extremely important and complex country ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you get in, take this class! Professor Joseph is incredibly knowledgeable about Mexico, and the syllabus is a reflection of that. Be prepared to do pretty extensive readings each week--but if you put in the time, you are sure to get a lot out. ",
            "\u00a0This is a must-take class. Anything taught by Professor Joseph should immediately appear at the top of your shopping list. Mexico since Independence is an incredibly stimulating exploration of Mexican culture, politics, economy, international relations, and more. A crucial history to learn for anyone with an interest in foreign policy, yet I would recommend to every Yale student as one of the seminal courses in Mexican history, rather than Mexican history in relation to the United States. The analytical skills you hone, as well as the intense appreciation for Mexican culture you gain, cannot be rivaled in any other Yale class. Definitely take if you can get in. ",
