            "\u00a0Introductory argumentative essay writing skills including formulating a claim and supporting it with effective evidence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the relationship between religion and secularity in society and religion's role in many different topics. We read MLK's Letter From a Birmingham Jail and discussed extremism in the context of Jesus and other religious figures. We analyzed the theologian Charles Taylor's definition of religion and how that informed a documentary about ex-Hasidim called One of Us. We read about the role of evangelicals in the modern climate change debate, Jesus's sexuality, a few personal narratives related to religion, and many other readings (I described the most memorable). Since this was a writing seminar, the course content was paired with improving our writing skills and argument construction. We often analyzed the rhetorical elements of the readings that we read and sought to apply them to our own writing. For each of the 4 essays that we wrote in the class, we read previous student examples and discussed their merits and how they could be improved. I have no doubt that this class has made me a better writer and a better thinker. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write an academic paper "

            "\u00a0Great seminar style discussion and feedback but inconsistent grading across sections and professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course has very interesting content and opportunities throughout to improve research and writing skills. I found the attention to constructing an academic argument to be particularly informative. We often had opportunities to peer review each other's work, which was both interesting and helpful. The class was almost too small (5 of us) but it allowed me to get to know my classmates and the professor very well and encouraged me to participate in discussion and ask any questions that I had. ",
            "\u00a0The professor can be more open to different ideas "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this section of the class or the professor but I would recommend the course in general. ",
            "\u00a0Having taken English 114, I believe it should be required for Freshman. This class improved my writing a lot, but perhaps more importantly it made me like English class in a way that I never did in high school. In high school English was always my least favorite subject: the pace was slow and many students (including myself) tended to not be very engaged in discussion. I always looked forward to this class because I knew the other students were as invested as I was and I knew the discussion would be lively and interesting. Religion is a great topic to discuss a small class setting, when one may feel comfortable enough to discuss somewhat personal beliefs. Do not be discouraged if you are not religious: there were certainly a few atheists in my class. Professor Baynes-Ross is great: she offered helpful feedback on papers and kept us engaged during class. "
