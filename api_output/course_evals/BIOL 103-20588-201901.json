            "\u00a0Professor Zhong is the weakness of this course, and I believe that he should not continue teaching this course. Julie park was a shining light in this dark, dark course. ",
            "\u00a0Good topics.\r\nSometimes the lectures were confusing. Did not take long to get into the groove however. ",
            "\u00a0The obvious weakness is Professor Zhong. He seems like a really nice dude, but his lectures are just so disorganized. He doesn't explain things super well, asks confusing questions and is disappointed when nobody answers them because we have literally no idea what he meant. The topics aren't organized in any sort of linear way that makes sense -- we learned about gastrulation after nervous system development for some odd reason. It could be improved by having clear lectures with obvious themes, and presenting the information in a more categorical way, with better explanations for complicated concepts. Except that's never going to happen, because this is the intro bio sequence. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not the best :( ",
            "\u00a0Development needs to be taught in chronological order\r\n\r\nThe quizzes need to be on material that was actually covered in class (not an extensive quiz on Punnett squares after a lecture that barely touched on it or a question about a graphic that was up for two seconds) and the questions need to be worded better \r\n\r\nThe overarching concepts need to be organized more clearly. The 'key concepts' at the end of the lecture were really just sentences from elsewhere on the slides, restated. They need to be overarching ideas that bring the lecture together.\r\n\r\nStop throwing complicated graphics up if we don't need to know them. They just confuse us more. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses are truly all this course has, unfortunately. Professor Zhong's slides are disorganized and he's unclear about what material we need to know and what we don't (and trust me, there's a lot of material on the slides that he tells us doesn't matter). Half of the quizzes were fine, the other half had irrelevant material or minute details that, contrary to his other statements on how the course was about big concepts and he wouldn't be testing us on that material, were ridiculous. The only strength was Professor Park, who definitely should be teaching this course. Her lecture was clear, strong, and the entire lecture hall clapped for her afterward because it was light years above the lectures we usually received. ",
            "\u00a0the lectures were really disorganized and hard to follow. the quiz grades would not reflect how much you actually prepared for them, as they were very much all guessing. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of this course are glaring, and I am sure that Julie Park and whoever looks at these student evaluations is well aware of these weaknesses. This is very troubling to me as a Yale student, as it shows that the University has not taken action in improving this joke of a course, despite knowing that it has such glaring flaws. This implies that the university does not value the students' learning experience to a high degree whatsoever. Professor Zhong's lectures could not have been more convoluted and imprecise if he tried. The quizzes are clearly designed to lay traps that it is known that students will fall in, rather than testing the students' ability and mastery of the material presented. One question even went so far as to ask, \"given the data, is this trait dominate OR recessive?\" The word \"or\", without any other presented option, clearly implies that the answer must be either dominant or recessive. However, the answer was neither. This is an academically dishonest question, and has no place on any quiz worth the paper it's printed on. When a student asked about the nature of the question on Piazza, no reply was given.  This is clearly problematic. If YALE UNIVERSITY, where students parents are paying over $70,000 per year for their kids to attend, cannot provide a better professor for INTRODUCTORY biology, then I am sorely surprised. Keep the pre-med weed out course in gen chem lab where you're not supposed to learn material, not in the most essential, fundamental portion of any biology major's course work, the introduction to what they will study the rest of their lives. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Julie Park was the biggest strength of this class. She was incredible and very informative. I think the normal lecture slides were pretty lacking with descriptions of things and it was very easy to get lost with all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include the Peer Tutors and Enrichment. Weaknesses include lecture presentations and section discussions. Improvements include shorter cohesive lectures, content review in section discussions and psets that cover class content. ",

            "\u00a0I found lectures very hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this course is the supportive group of TA's and peer tutors who work to actually teach us the material that was poorly presented in lecture. By far the greatest weakness of this course was the incomprehensible lecture slides and the unreasonable expectation that students will understand the material from shoddily-drawn figures in slides with little to no supporting text. Lectures do not help in comprehension because Professor Zhong zooms through all the slides with little explanation of what they mean. All the learning I did was from the peer tutors and through Piazza. This class needs serious reconstruction and a new professor because the material is not taught in a neat chronological manner. ",
            "\u00a0The courses powerpoints could be made better by providing more information, so when returning to study it is more clear what it was trying to say. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- excellent TA's/ peer tutors. Information was often interesting\r\nWeaknesses- was at times extremely confusing to follow. Tests/ quizzes were worded strangely and tough, not due to the actual content of the course, but due to unclear questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths is that there was a good Bio sequence coordinator and an excellence teaching assistant.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that the lecturer was hard to understand, spoke very fast, and was inefficient in answering students' questions. ",
            "\u00a0The information presented during the lecture in this course was too sporadic and a lot of the info we ended up talking about in class was said to \"not be on exams\" or \"not matter in the big picture of things\" after it was talked about, so it was very confusing. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an extremely interesting topic and it is unfortunate that it was taught at the level that it was.  Professor Zhong did not answer questions clearly, kept students at an unfair advantage going into quizzes, and did not test the class on information learned in this course.  The only saving grace of this class was Professor Park and her enrichment sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the material is interesting; however, the class is extremely poorly taught and made unnecessarily difficult. The workload is significant and, for the most part, not engaging. The class is extremely difficult to sit through. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that Julie Park and the peer tutors helped a lot with the material. The weakness is how they had to help with the material because Professor Zhong did not teach it well. ",
            "\u00a0Writing a research proposal felt a little out of the scope of the class. For the most part, I didn't know what I was doing and only felt like I did after I received a grade with feedback ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were not very organized, but enrichment was extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be substantially better organized, and the professor could be far more clear with his teaching and what he expects student to know. ",

            "\u00a0The course desperately needs a better professor. The best thing about this course is the peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0Enrichment and peer tutor hours were taught very well. Lectures contained engaging material. However, there were many weaknesses: discussion section and the project. I think section time would be used more appropriately if it were used to review material from class. The papers that we read were great reads, but they did not seem to contribute to the understanding of what was learned in class. The weekly homework was a joke and was even more useless than section -- homework should build upon what was learned in class. The homework should also have more guidance so people don't fall in a rabbit hole of not getting enough information -- although there may be 100s of papers about your TF, probably none of them will relate your TF to your expression. It also seems like a ridiculous amount of time to do three assignments each week. Time should be done studying. Why can't section just be Enrichment? Quizzes were also too difficult, and some were more difficult than others. What's the point in dropping a quiz if everyone just has to drop quiz 2? Questions on the quizzes were meant to trick and only drove down the quality of answers and concrete ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths included the amount of help offered through peer tutoring or enrichment. However, the lectures were occasionally hard to follow, and the timed quizzes were sometimes difficult due to time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is interesting, but the development portion is poorly organized. We would move back and forth between different stages of development without having an idea of what the general sequence of development was. In other words, it would be helpful to have a mental outline/guideline of development and to fill in that space instead of introducing concepts sporadically. \r\nAnother strength of the course is the course organizer, Julie Park, who does a very good job of teaching material clearly and concisely. Professor Zhong could work on more clearly relaying information and giving a bit more time to understanding students' inquiries. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of the course is its organization. Lectures do not coincide well with the readings and the quizzes do not go along with either the lectures or the readings. ",
            "\u00a0All weakness, the instructor is poor, the homework is pointless. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were unorganized and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0It was hard to know what information was necessary unless you read the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The course rapidly advances one's ability to understand someone talking in primary literature, and how to read scientific papers; additionally, the peer tutors for this course are phenomenal.  With that being said, the teaching is slightly convoluted and the lectures end up being more complicated then necessary with students confused about the point of the lecture.  For an introductory biology class, there is a sharp learning curve. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor for this course was terrible. He didn't answer questions that were asked in class well, and often presented information in confusing ways. He asked questions in ambiguous ways on quizzes (which even the TAs admitted) and then would repeatedly tell the class \"I'm a fair professor,\" which, if true, wouldn't need to be explicitly stated so much. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the class was very challenging intellectually \r\nweaknesses: material was very disorganized and it difficult to see the big picture throughout the lecture. lecture slides did not flow from one to the next and some felt very out of place and out of nowhere; the professor was very difficult to understand at times (Especially when he lowers his voice at the end of sentences). the weekly quizzes tended to emphasize material that was only briefly glossed over in class, so I felt unprepared for these quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I dont know ",
            "\u00a0The professor did not communicate concepts well in class. When he received feedback, he practically told the class to just get used to how he teaches rather than adapting his methods to provide proper instruction. \r\n\r\nJulie Park is great though. She should probably teach an actual class because her one lecture in class made sense. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and lecture slides were terrible. Information was presented in an illogical manner and didn't allow students to understand fundamental concepts before asking in depth questions. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the peer tutors and tutoring/review sessions. Athe course could be improved by having more straightforward quiz questions that quiz the lecture material directly. ",
            "\u00a0Julie! Park! Should! Teach! This! Course! Also, the homework assignment for this module doesn't reinforce the material at all, and is not valuable at all for anyone not intending on going into research. The quizzes require too much complex thought to be taken in 15 minutes. The time should either be extended or the quizzes should be made easier. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course includes the discussion sections, as these were more intimate and allowed for the understanding of various advanced topics with decreased assistance towards the end of the semester-- over time I grew more accustomed to the material. The readings were also better than BIOL102 in covering only necessary material. Professor Zhong was also incredibly kind and energetic. However, almost everything else is a weakness: the quizzes were at times filled with questions that other professors did not answer correctly, the lecture slides are hard to follow and students often lost track of what was going on, and it was very difficult to piece together what we needed to know due to a slew of incredibly specific examples that just confused everybody. The best lecture by far was taught by Julie Park, not Professor Zhong. It could be improved only if the lecture slides are streamlined on student feedback to focus on examples we understand or elaborate on what we are expected to get and what we are not. ",
            "\u00a0There needs to be a more organized road map and what we need to know and more practice questions. ",
            "\u00a0The learning is not easily accessible. Because the lectures were so confusing and the slides weren't clear, it was completely up to the students to gather the knowledge required to even have a chance at doing well. Some initiative is obviously a good thing, but in my opinion there wasn't enough learning going on in the actual class itself. Peer tutoring was a major resource for this course - I can't stress enough how important it was. ",
            "\u00a0Very unorganized, poor teaching style. Never really learned in class and always went to peer tutor who gave us the week's real lecture. Never understood what was happening in class or what we were expected to learn. Not a comfortable environment to participate in either. ",
            "\u00a0The research proposal assignment was good for developing the ability to read scientific papers. However, I feel that the course was almost entirely focused on primary research, which was difficult as a student in an introductory biology course with little prior biology knowledge. I feel that more time could be spent outlining concepts and then using research to support as opposed to presenting difficult scientific literature and then outlining concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an abomination.  The entire year, quizzes are based on concepts, asking us to design experiments and extrapolate from what we learned in class (which wasn't much).  Then, we reach the final, and it is completely filled with random recall of facts.  The slides did not contain information other than vague concepts, and there was no structure to learning in this class.  We never received any direction as to what we needed to know and what we didn't for quizzes and tests. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated homework that was based more on the information we learned in class so we could practice and see what we didn't understand. Instead, we spent too much time on writing research proposals. The discussion sections were helpful, though, since the readings weren't exactly straightforward and our TAs guided us through them well. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Zhong is a living embodiment of how Yale fails to actually address underlying issues with its undergraduate professors. And I thought anonymous student course evaluations were specifically designed for the intent of acting on those evaluations. I believed that it could not get worse than BIOL 102, with Valerie Horsley, but boy was I in for a surprise. I was awestruck by Prof Zhong's ridiculous lectures. He tries to go over an enormous amount of content in what is half the sufficient amount of time. The quizzes and final were all riddled with grammatical errors that made answering the questions  annoyingly difficult. There were no positives, except for the research proposal assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course was organized in a really weird way. The writing of the research proposal was very stressful. ",
            "\u00a0the material was interesting, but often hard to follow. it was difficult to tell how much detail from the slides we were responsible for, and it was difficult to acquire a temporal view of development because the lectures were  not organized according to any obvious schema. ",
            "\u00a0This was my least favorite class by far I have taken at Yale. Not only did I feel shamed in class when I asked a question, but felt I was not getting the support I needed to succeed. Julie Park is the only strength of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: questions undervalued in class by professor, homeworks assignments were too long, quizzes didnt really match how we learned material in class and didnt really test what weve learned ",
            "\u00a0I felt that a lot of supplemental reading had to be done in addition to reading the textbook and lecture slides. It would be nice if more information was tested from the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately this particular course in the Biology sequence is one of the worst classes I have ever taken and is a major deterrent for people interested in taking an intro Bio course. The reason for this falls squarely on Professor Zhong. Up until this class, the biology sequence had presented an amazing overview of biology that was versatile enough to interest anyone taking it whether it be pre meds or music majors. This class however was nearly impossible to follow for even the most apt and well informed biology students. It was nearly impossible to follow along in lecture, understand the main points of lecture, or even learn from the lecture slides if trying to study on your own. Additionally I was told by Mr. Zhong that the book is 50% incorrect and if I wanted to do good in class I needed to learn and understand from the lecture itself. This was inherently impossible with the way Mr. Zhong teaches. This is not to say that Mr. Zhong was not trying his best to make us understand, he most certainly was. But there remained an impermeable barrier between Mr. Zhong and his students and it is very obvious that his skills do not lie in teaching. For these reasons he should not be teaching here at Yale as there are many teachers who are just as qualified and would foster the type of learning that Yale prides itself in. ",
            "\u00a0It was well organized. Very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0While the weekly quizzes are good to keep the students engaged throughout the course, I know that a lot of students, including myself had a very difficult time effectively studying for them because especially in the beginning of the semester there was no way to tell what Professor Zhong was looking for in an answer. ",
            "\u00a0The way that questions were worded on the quizzes and tests were sometimes very ambiguous and hard to understand. Also, it was extremely hard to tell what we were being tested on and what not from the lectures. The professor never made those things clear, and the only way I could find out was by going to enrichment sessions with Julie Park. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- research proposal was extremely interesting and engaging\r\nweaknesses- course quizzes were far too difficult/tested material that had not yet been covered in lectures ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course was the instruction. The lectures were nearly impossible to understand and the lecture slides were not designed in a way that was easy to follow. Many of the concepts seemed to be explained backwards, and often clarity could only be reached by learning all of the information from the textbook. For the topics not covered in the textbook, we were often at a loss because we could not understand the concepts.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness of this course was the format of the quizzes. We had 15 minute quizzes at the beginning of every Wednesday lecture. We had the same schedule of quizzes in BIOL 101, but the difference in 103 was that the questions required high levels of complex thought in a short period of time. Students should either have more time for the quizzes, or the quizzes should be shorter with less content that requires time to reason though and formulate coherent responses.\r\n\r\nI would say the strength of this course was the material covered. Though hard to understand due to the teaching, the actual content we learned was very interesting and relevant to many fields. I absolutely love biology, and I think it was just that love that got me through the class.\r\n\r\nI think more focus should have also been put on reviewing the concepts covered in class during section. Maybe half of section could be going over scientific papers, which is fun and a very helpful skill, but I would have appreciated some time to go over confusing concepts that were glossed over in lecture.\r\n\r\nEnrichment slides should also be available to all students taking the class. While it makes sense that there are limited spots in the actual session due to class size, the slides used during enrichment should be published for all students to use. Only giving access to certain students creates a disparity that is unnecessary and disadvantages students who either could not get a seat in enrichment or who are confused during regular lecture and could greatly benefit from some extra help for a given concept. We are all here to learn, and it does not make sense to deprive students of materials they could use to better learn and understand the concepts. Publishing the slides would benefit students who are actively seeking to better their understanding of the material covered in class, which is the whole point of taking classes and going to school. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the peer tutors and the weakness was the lecture presentation. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is understanding and interesting, but the quizzes and assignments are highly demanding. Often understanding the content will not get you as far as you would hope. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the peer tutors, particularly Nasser. Weaknesses were the lectures themselves, apart from Julie Park's lecture on stem cells. That was the only time I felt like that the lectures were coherent and well thought out. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides and lectures were very confusing at times, but the course content was pretty straight forward. Professor Zhong did not stress about the details like names of proteins which made learning the concepts easier. Also, the reading assignments in the textbook were fairly short which made them an easy resource to concepts that may have been unclear in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zhong's lecture style is very unorganized and difficult to follow. It is often hard in this class to understand what exactly needs to be known. If this issue was addressed, I believe that this course could be much more straightforward. "

            "\u00a0Due to the horrible lectures, convoluted quiz/test questions and lack of correlation from section to exams, I would have to say NO. Do not take this class with this professor. ",
            "\u00a0Just get through it, you don't have a choice. Lecture is confusing and unhelpful, but you should probably go because Professor Zhong says things that aren't on the slides. Rely on Julie Park (a true queen) and the peer tutors (literal gods) for help, and work with your classmates to understand the more difficult stuff. Some of the stuff isn't in the textbook but comes directly from Zhong's research or graduate lectures, which makes resources somewhat limited. ",
            "\u00a0Imagine you take a course where class is held once a week for two hours at night. The following morning you are tasked with taking a quiz on the material you have just learned. Every week you learn the content from 8 to 10pm, leaving you with roughly 12 hours to sleep and cram for the test. You don't sleep much each night, as you are forced to invest time into studying the concepts you just learned. On the day of the quiz you arrive at class, sleep deprived but confident that you know the content. When the tests are handed out, you look down at the paper and realize that none of the content taught the night prior is on the test. You panic and resort to prior knowledge and largely guess your way through every question.  You almost wish you hadn't studied because at least your brain wouldn't hurt when you read each question. Weeks later, you receive your grade from the quiz and its abysmal, but there is little you can do to change this outcome. You are bound to repeating this cycle weekly, praying that the next quiz will go differently, even though deep down you know nothing will change. \r\n\r\nThis is what you will experience in BIOL 103. The teaching and lecture organization is horribly unorganized and unclear. The only way to truly learn the content for each quiz is the night prior at peer tutor hours, and even then, there is no way of ensuring that the test won't have unfair questions or a petty grading scheme. In all honesty, this class has largely ruined the intro BIO sequence for me and many of my peers. This is not a class that a school like Yale should be offering. Many times it felt like this was not a class at all. ",

This class feels as if it is designed with the express purpose of making its students come out hating the material and ready to give up on pursuing science, and it is frankly shameful that Yale stands by without doing anything about the issue, especially since these concerns have all been raised by previous students of this class.

            "\u00a0Remember that old question Why Yale? Well this class represents every reason why not. I am not paying Yales tuition to be lectured at about nonsense. My only advice for this class is not to take it. You might think, Ill just get the introductory biology sequence over with But no, that is what I said, and I highly highly regret it. While Dr. Zhong might be a nice person, he has not acknowledged any of the criticism from previous years nor will he acknowledge it for this year. I love biology, and all this class did was take away something I enjoy and put unnecessary stress and sadness into it. For instance, for a lecture titled Hormones and Homeostasis we had a quiz completely about advanced punnet squares. The average was a 17/25. One time, there was a quiz question asking if the SNP chart was recessive or dominant, the answer was neither. No one got that right. The only people who do well on quizzes are people who already know the material from highschool, but this is suppose to be an introductory course! On our test, we were quizzed about pedigree charts when we never were taught what they meant in class. Dr. Zhong does not know how to answer a students question. Usually he listens to you for the first give or take 5 words, and then formulates an answer in his head that is entirely unrelated to your question, and interrupts you. The lectures were completely unorganized. You would think it would be logical to explain development in chronicle order, but he doesnt. He deliberately puts huge confusing things on a slide that you will not understand, only stress about. The only reason why I have survived is because of peer tutors, which I spent 4 hours a week with and Julie Park. She is amazing. ",

There are moments of fun or witty quotes to look forward to, but you can also pretty much guarantee you will visit peer tutoring sessions to understand the material, and even then it isn't guaranteed the tutor will understand the class.
