            "\u00a0Close reading and interpretation of the western canon pertaining to philosophy. I learned the methods that one is to write a philosophy paper and contributed to discussion of the works in class. ",
            "\u00a0How to understand philosophy and relate it to my every day life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to analyze a philosophical text and how to evaluate a text in a philosophy essay. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies Philosophy taught me to read quickly and effectively, write clearly and concisely, and converse with my peers about the books at hand and the answer to the central DS question: \"What makes us human?\" DS Philosophy's content spans from Plato and Aristotle through ancient Roman philosophy to Christian and Jewish philosophers such as Aquinas and Maimonides. Philosophy is one of the most applicable branches of DS; it really teaches how to question and discuss our life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make a philosophical argument and how to think about moral (and many other) questions in a critical way. ",
            "\u00a0In my first exposure to philosophy, I learned how to evaluate a philosophical argument, logically proceed through a claim, and write a powerful and concise philosophical paper. Professor Russell was excellent in aiding my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my writing skills, critical thinking skills, understood how to read and talk about philosophers ",
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy definitely made me a more critical and analytical reader. I became much more proficient at tracing the paths of different arguments as well as analysing them. I also came to appreciate the merits and applications of philosophy, a subject often considered useless or purely theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0My main takeaway from philosophy was communication with clarity - in my writing, speaking, and even thinking. I loved how the syllabus was designed to give us an insight on the different beliefs and perspectives of various thinkers on different subjects that are so relevant to the good life - the idea of God, the soul, the object of human life, the value of reason and knowledge, etc. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not very good at philosophy - I just don't think I'm good at thinking philosophically. Nevertheless, the wide range of texts we read meant that I was able to compare authors and see how their concepts differentiated. I just don't think I learned how to ask relevant and critical questions to the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The sheer workload of papers, reading, and discussion forces one to do things that they otherwise don't do. However, I never got the sense of exactly what exactly makes a 'good' paper or a valid reading. Discussions were engaging yet were not extremely satisfying-- we often would not get to finish what we set out to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the class actually. ",
            "\u00a0Directed Studies is a fantastic program that teaches us how to read, write, and converse with others. I would recommend it to every Yale student. It is very expansive in terms of content; however, it sacrifices depth. While we cover the basic principles of various philosophers, we hardly have two 75-minute seminars a week to discuss hundreds of pages of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Plato readings were absolutely great, Aristotle was tough but I still got a lot out of him, the Stoics and Skeptics were not too difficult and I found them pretty interesting overall, the post-Thanksgiving philosophers were either too confusing or just not interesting/engaging except for Augustine. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Russell is very engaging and encouraging. She welcomes any and all contributions and greatly helped me understand our readings.\r\n\r\nThe reading load is quite intense, so at times it is difficult to read as closely as one would like for a philosophy course. Having to skim some of the arguments makes it difficult to gain a true understanding of the text, but Professor Russell is very helpful with this as she would walk us through arguments logically and easily. ",
            "\u00a0Pace of the course is very fast but we have the opportunity to cover a lot of material ",
            "\u00a0DS is a very well-organized program in general, and Philosophy was no exception. The reading can be complex and time-consuming, but its the nature of the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you would like an introduction to classical philosophy. A very good launching point to discover your philosophical interests. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- if one loves everything about what DS offers and is willing to commit to the readings and sacrifice other classes and opportunities for the western canon. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, professor Russell is amazing and is really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Russell is fantastic, and I wish she was staying on at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend DS to every incoming Yalie. The way the texts synthesize throughout the semester is incredible; it really has taught me what it means to be human, as cheesy as it sounds. DS' coursework, although extremely demanding, has been vital to my university education, and I feel very well prepared for my next three years at Yale. Take Directed Studies if you are reading this! ",
            "\u00a0Yes  I think this course is a great introduction into Philosophy for someone who's never taken this kind of course before. I think we went pretty deep considering it an intro course, and it was definitely tough but I got a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, mainly because of Professor Russell. She made this my favorite class this semester. She is a truly incredible professor. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor Russell is amazing and if you are taking DS you want to have her! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I thought I would like philosophy the least of the DS classes, but it actually ended up being one of my favorites! The ideas presented in the texts and the ways the authors borrow from and contradict one another is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! DS Philosophy started off being my least favourite subject because of my lack of confidence in the subject matter and how terrible I was at thinking in a logical manner, but it turned out to be one of the biggest intellectual takeaways I've had this semester and I'm very excited for the next.
