            "\u00a0I learned how to read and present scientific papers relating to geology. ",

            "\u00a0This was a basic introduction to Earth Science. The course focused on being able to understand and share scientific papers about Earth Science through the presentations of Earth Science research papers. ",
            "\u00a0A general understanding of the various components of the earth system and methods of its study ",
            "\u00a0A lot of introductory Earth science. It was a good survey course. ",

            "\u00a0This course has no assessments making it very difficult to be motivated to actually learn any of the material.  Coming to class without doing any work was very easy and you were never responsible for any information. ",
            "\u00a0covers a lot of material is an easy fashion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The presentations are a great way to learn how to critically read and understand scientific papers, and be able to share them with others.\r\nWeaknesses: The course has pretty much the same format every class, with discussion questions from the reading of the books followed by some presentations of scientific papers. This format can get somewhat repetitive and depending on the topic being covered that class, the discussion and paper presentations can be less interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Seminar style with papers instead of lectures and exams facilitated greater retention of material ",
            "\u00a0This course follows very closely to the assigned text books. While this can be nice, the structure of the course was such that we read the textbook and answered a set of questions provided by the professor. This led to the class feeling a lot of wasted time. We would read the textbook in search for answers to the assigned questions, and then come to class to regurgitate our answers. I would have appreciated the class more if we came to class to discuss the textbook readings in the context of current events related to earth systems. This would allow for more open discussion between students, while still weeding out any misunderstandings. ",
            "\u00a0The workload isn't overwhelming, but the topics are interesting. It's a good exposure to real world academic articles. Seminars could be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course made the resources available to students to gain a fairly detailed understanding of basic geology, but had very few mechanisms in place to ensure that they made use of these resources. No exams are given, and the participation grade is the only reflection of how much effort students put into reading assignments. "

            "\u00a0Great introductory geology course. I really liked the seminar format and the presentations on actual scientific literature. 9AM trek to Rosenkranz wasn't fun some days and the reading can be kind of a lot. Also the final essay is really long but Professor Park does a good job at making sure you're on track ",
            "\u00a0yes, as weekly workload is relatively low during the term ",
            "\u00a0It was a good introduction to Earth Science and I learned a lot of interesting things that will be useful to know in the future. However, it wasn't always the most engaging and most interesting. It was very low workload, with one midterm paper, one term paper, presentations throughout the semester, and participation. There was no feedback throughout the semester, aside from the midterm paper, which makes it really hard to know if you're doing well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the papers allowed students to explore other aspects of the course that interested them ",
            "\u00a0If interested in Earth science, yes. It's a good survey course. "
