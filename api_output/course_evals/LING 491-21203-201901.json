            "\u00a0I think this course met for too long, for too often. It felt like I was scrambling to have some sort of submittable piece of a document for each meeting of the class, but actually doing a research project (or at least, the kind I was doing) doesn't produce work in a steady stream like that. So I ended up spending time each week trying to figure out something to submit for the weekly submission, rather than actually working on my thesis. \r\n\r\nAgain, that only pertains to the weekly meeting of the class. The real strength of the Linguistics senior essay is how amazing the advisors are. I essentially had an in-depth class in the topic of my research each week. ",
