            "\u00a0I learned so many more Chinese characters (essentially I went from knowing 0 to several hundred characters over the course of L1 and L2), developed a stronger sense of Chinese grammar, and became much more fluent at speaking Chinese. I also have a deeper understanding of Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Chinese characters and grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write Chinese, as well as learned the proper grammar and diction of written Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my understanding of the Chinese language. ",
            "\u00a0I went in not knowing how to write any characters, but I came out of this course able to write essays and letters in Chinese characters. I also learned the basic grammar structures necessary to hold a conversation, and improved my pronunciation of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0How to read, write, and speak Mandarin ",
            "\u00a0I took Chinese 122 last term. This term, I continued developing the skills from Chinese 122 -- reading, writing, and speaking Mandarin Chinese. For example, some of what I learned in this course included utilizing more complex grammar structures in speech and developing a bigger vocabulary base. "

            "\u00a0Chan Lao Shi is one of the most kind, understanding, and engaging professors ever and she really made the class so enjoyable. I also really liked the small class size, which allows you to practice speaking a lot and you get to know all the students. The way the class is run will make your Chinese improve a lot. A highlight was our class trip to MOCA in New York - I learned a lot about my heritage from that experience! Because there are daily quizzes, this is a class you have to put a lot of time into, but it is definitely manageable and the class is run very well. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the knowledge learned while the weaknesses are the speed of memorization of the characters. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! All of the materials and homework and lectures were very useful in helping me practice. I never felt that it'd be useless to go to class or to do the homework because I knew it was all very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely strong, and I learned more Chinese in a year than I believed possible. I liked how the class was structured: we all had a chance to talk multiple times in every class, the daily quizzes and homework helped us learn the characters, the recordings helped me practice my pronunciation, and the TA sessions helped me practice my conversational Chinese. The professor was extremely helpful in teaching and reinforcing grammar structures and tones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Culturally relevant material, engaging professor, fun out-of-class activities\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of memorization with little use (some words youll only use within the lesson and never again), homework/oral exams/presentations feel like busy work towards the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Nearly everything about this course was a strength. First, the instructor is wonderful and designed lesson plans that helped me greatly grasp the Chinese language. Second, the class was in a seminar setting, which creates a wonderful classroom dynamic; I got to know my classmates and instructor very well, and loved going to class because class time was educational yet engaging and fun being that I was around people whose presence I really enjoyed. Finally, this term, our class did an educational fieldtrip to Museum of Chinese Americans in Chinatown, NYC, and this trip was one of the highlights of this academic year -- it was eye-opening to learn about Chinese-American history for a day, which supplemented our regular study of Mandarin Chinese.

            "\u00a0Yes definitely! This was one of my favorite classes! This class is really great if you have some background in Chinese but you never formally learned how to speak, read, or write it. Most people come into this class knowing very little Chinese beyond what was learned in L1. Your Chinese will improve a lot. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Chinese, I'd for sure recommend as it definitely does that. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Chinese, this class will help you do it. The professor was also amazing and truly wants to help you learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course not only developed my love for my heritage but exposed me to great habits when learning a new language. The professor is very kind and helpful and this class was super useful! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has spoken basic Chinese at home, but who has not formally learned it in a classroom setting before. This is an intensive class but will help build a strong foundation for your Chinese speaking and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Compared to CHNS 112, this class was about the same. Youre already used to the format, so in some ways, its easier. I really preferred the structure of 122 because the professor took in our suggestions from 112. Overall, the class is still a lot of work, but even with a full schedule, it was managable for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Taking Mandarin Chinese was one of the best decisions I made at Yale. Even though Mandarin Chinese is an intensive language to learn, the course is well-organized, well-taught, and fun. I would recommend it to another student without hesitation. "
