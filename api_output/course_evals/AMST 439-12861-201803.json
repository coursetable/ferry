            "\u00a0In this course I learned how scholars have traced various \"things\" or \"fruits\" of empire. ",
            "\u00a0This class focused on the power relationships established under imperialism, colonization, and the expansion of capitalist markets. How hierarchies built on race, class, gender, sexuality were enforced by imperial states in order to control the land, resources, and peoples it looked to extract for financial gain. The class allows students to develop a strong critical thinking framework for the world we live in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to assess global networks of power. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interdisciplinary class that considered imperialism, commodities, race, gender, nationality and many other things. It spanned across centuries and across the globe. This class was useful in learning about specific forms of imperialism and specific commodities, but was also good for writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me the opportunity to learn about systems of oppression within and amongst the nations of the world.  By examining the material products of colonization and tracing their roots, I learned not only about ongoing colonial projects but also about the deep implications that these projects have for both the mental psyche and the physical bodies of marginalized people. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to merge primary and secondary sources in analyzing the historical positionings of empires and colonies. ",
            "\u00a0this course offered great knowledge of the development of imperialism through plantation economies and raw resource extraction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically. How to have fruitful discussions in seminar. how to read academic texts critically. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of colonized nations and their relationship with their imperial colonizer, their local people and the products of that history. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great course for people looking to better understand imperialism, colonialism and empire. When we think about empire, I think many people generally tend to think of it in terms of stolen rare artifacts, land, and highly valued commodities, depicted through the old adage \"god, gold and glory.\" While these are all important parts of the story, one of the most commonly overlooked aspects of imperialism and colonialism is the centrality of food production in the conquest of land, exploitation of indigenous people, captured slaves, and indentured laborers, and the development of international capitalism. Through studying the evolution of fruits as colonial products students get a much deeper understanding of the workings of colonialism and imperialism, including how these histories shape our everyday lives and the world around us. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger understanding of the historical operations of European and U.S. empire, particularly concerning their practices of extraction and related commodity chains. I was also introduced to a number of scholars who work on global empire from a range of disciplinary perspectives, exposure that I found very helpful for my own interdisciplinary work. "

            "\u00a0I disliked the weekly responses and the readings got to be a little repetitive. However, the issues discussed are hugely relevant//interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the concept of this course - I thought it was creative, unique, and very compelling! I think it could be improved by including sources other than the main canonical texts we read. I would have been interested to read essays on how other scholars have responded to Mintz, Ross, Rappaport, etc. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of freedom in this course to explore the aspects of this large history of imperialism that we were most interested in analyzing, and final projects ranged from contemporary art pieces to investigative pieces on 18th century colonial hierarchy and plantation labor. \r\n\r\nIf anything in this class could be changed, I think adding a diversity of different readings would be beneficial, to supplement the long-form history books that were the primary readings we reflected on. ",
            "\u00a0The classroom discussion was definitely a strength was was Prof Okihiro's and Angie's guidance. They were both very kind and always willing to help students get the most out of the course. That being said, I think that the course was overall lacking in clear structure as we only really had one assignment at the very end. In addition, the volume and type of reading for each class was unwieldy and monotonous at times, making it very easy to disengage. In the future it would be great if types of readings and mediums could be varied. ",
            "\u00a0This was Professor Okihiro's first year teaching the course so the focus of the class, especially in terms of the readings, seemed a bit scattered. However, I'm sure this will improve if the class were taught again in the future and Professor Okihiro was really dedicated to improvement. Overall, many of the readings were really interesting and both Professor Okihiro and Angie were able to stimulate great discussions every week. ",
            "\u00a0This class was quite well organized and covered incredibly interesting and wide-ranging topics. Professor Okihiro was truly wonderful, and was a very attentive section leader and a great lecturer. Angie, the TA was also very helpful and thoughtful.\r\n\r\nThe readings were a little bit repetitive, and as discussed in class, it would have been great to read more fiction/ personal stories/ films in order to understand this complicated topic. Although, of course, there are difficulties with this as well. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was Professor Okihiros depth of knowledge and just overall enthusiasm to hear what students have to say and contribute. He values our opinions and thoughts in the same way he would value a colleague - it feels great to have that as the environment in a classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me the incredible opportunity to commit time to researching a topic of great personal significance; the structure of this course allowed me the flexibility to determine a research project relating to course themes and this structure was one that I thoroughly enjoyed.  The weaknesses of this course were the lack of organization and the lack direction about which several students vocalized concern.  Every class seemed to be structured or planned while the class was running, and our tasks often felt elementary. Dr. Okihiro would lecture, and then the TF would seem to attempt to draw a lesson out of what he had just said and create tasks for us to complete in whatever amount of time was left.  The syllabus consistently did not reflect the tasks assigned to us and it was unclear at several points throughout the semester which assignments were mandatory and which were optional, and further which assignments were due on a particular class date.  It was also unclear how we were being assessed. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing reading selections, and Okihiro's lectures were incredible, but I thought some class discussions could have used more structure. ",
            "\u00a0the course could have a greater variety of readings, such as contemporary articles. \r\nThe final presentations were effective in creating an environment of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths all round. One point of improvement would just be that Professor Okihiro should feel free to speak more, he loved to hear from us but we also love to hear from him! ",
            "\u00a0The course does very well from the point of view of getting people to create a deeper understanding of colonialism, imperialism and empire together. I thought it was a great community, and that people were really interested in learning more about empire and doing so collectively. I thought that the opportunity to discuss Professor Okihiro's book with him was really special, and the community created in the class facilitated lively discussions\r\n\r\nHowever, I think it is indicative that almost every class Angie Diaz had to ask the class how its analysis related back to the product we were studying that week, with questions like \"how does this relate to the pineapple.\" Despite her and Garry Okihiro's best efforts however, we often ended up not utilizing the material as much as we could have. This isn't to say that the discussions about more abstract themes and connections are bad, simply that I think they would have been more rich and insightful if we could have more carefully grounded those discussions in our discussions of colonial crops, especially towards the end of the semester as we had more and more examples to work from. I say this fully aware that I was often one of the people dealing in this kind of abstraction. Because of this, I think people had trouble relating the discussions from week to week together. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly reading responses served as an effective way to synthesize ideas prior to seminar. I appreciated that students interests and concerns were also given an extensive platform during seminar discussions, which were largely student-led. \r\n\r\nOn the flipside, I felt that Professor Okihiros occasional interjections greatly benefited my comprehension of the readings. Given that I was relatively new to the course's subject matter, I often felt that it would have been helpful to have more context for many of the syllabuss readings (ex. concerning the disciplinary conversations into which each scholar was writing), perhaps provided at the beginning of each seminar meeting. I would have also loved to engage with more primary-source readings. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes ! Okihiro is a lovely/wonderful instructor. As with all seminars though, the experience is only as worthwhile as you help to make it. At times, the discussion dragged because students didn't really engage with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0YES! You only get so many chances to take a seminar with Gary Okihiro... do it! ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provided me the space to pursue a final project that put personal stories of migration within a history of imperialism. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. The classroom discussion was definitely a strength was was Prof Okihiro's and Angie's guidance. They were both very kind and always willing to help students get the most out of the course. That being said, I think that the course was overall lacking in clear structure as we only really had one assignment at the very end. In addition, the volume and type of reading for each class was unwieldy and monotonous at times, making it very easy to disengage. In the future it would be great if types of readings and mediums could be varied. Late in the semester, Prof Okihiro and Angie took a survey of peoples impressions about the course, so I think things may change in future iterations. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's a relatively low-stress senior seminar and Professor Okihiro is such an incredibly wise and kind man who really cares about his students. You will learn so much from him, and the way he runs discussions allows you to learn a lot from your classmates and their areas of expertise as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Fruits of Empire. Professor Okihiro is a thoughtful, sincere and open professor and made each class a unique experience. Also, he was just incredibly kind, and really cares about his work, and the work of his students. The content is super interesting, lying at the intersection of ER&M, environmental studies, history and WGSS. There is a great deal of interdisciplinary learning and thinking involved in this class. There is a lot of freedom for the final projectsome students did art projects, others did more economics-focused papers, and others wrote about art and culture. Overall, this class is a very open and engaging space. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class - Professor Okihiro and the course work are equally amazing and important! ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to other students simply because it lacked direction and organization.  The topics were very interesting and Dr. Okihiro is an incredible professor, but the course structure itself was a bit frustrating because rules and assignments seemed incredibly fluid and everchanging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an amazing exploration of the discursive and material constructions of empire.  The students in this class all contributed to eye-opening discussions and the professor really cared about every student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone should take a class with Gary Okihiro! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Okihiro is a god if I can say that here, and I can because it's anonymous! He is super smart and kind and genuinely interested in our opinions and growth as people. I learned so much from my peers too because the class environment was comfortable and we all spoke a lot. Please take this class if you want to learn to think critically about how our world is divided between the temperates and the tropics, and how commodities have played a crucial role in these constructions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take this class if you get in. Professor okhiro was great, so passionate about his work, so laid back and interested in taking to the students. I will never forget on the first day of class when he came in after his mother had passed away, and talked about her influence on his work in looking at the history of plantation labor in Hawaii. He is such a genuine professor! \r\n\r\nI came in with a stem background but came out with many ideas about how to apply the knowledge about empires and colonization to my own work. ",
            "\u00a0I would likely recommend this course to another student. I appreciated the largely historical materialist approach to the operations of global empire, and felt that the course offered a unique angle on European and U.S. empire that would have been difficult to obtain otherwise. "
