            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the amazing language of Shakespearian works! As someone who had never read Shakespeare beforehand, I found the classes very engaging and beginner friendly. I learned how to really dig into a text and take the most out of it as possible! ",
            "\u00a0A newfound appreciation for Shakespeare's work. ",
            "\u00a0I read a ton of Shakespeare I hadn't read before! ",
            "\u00a0Nice to get a survey of some of Shakespeare's most well-known works, combined with some of his least. I would say that I appreciate the context Shakespeare was writing in a lot more, as well as having a few details from each play (that I wouldn't otherwise have noticed) expanded upon by prof Kastan. I appreciate that the essays allowed us to expand on this as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read Shakespeare. I had always struggled with it, convinced it was something I would never be able to do, but with this course, I learned how to and am very grateful. That being said, a large part of learning Shakespeare is recognizing that words probably have multiple meanings when he uses them and so I learned how to decipher these different meanings and evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some new ways to think about texts and to think about close reading, in addition to learning a ton about particular Shakespeare plays. ",
            "\u00a0Deep analysis it was great ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a variety of Shakespeare's different historical and tragedy plays and different readings and interpretations of his work. I also learned a lot about the complexity of language in Shakespeare's writing and how different interpretations of language can wildly change the reading of his texts. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better close-reader and more attentive to language. I also learned a lot about Shakespeare's material stage and how that can feature in literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major interesting themes/perplexing questions of most of Shakespeare's tragedies, and learned about social and political implications of the plays when they were published. I gained the ability to think hard about the language/individual word choice rather than just plot. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered three main ways to think about Shakespeare's plays: on the level of the language, on the level of how passages work with one another in the context of the play, and on the level of the broad themes and questions that govern histories and tragedies. (Professor Kastan favors the language level, and those are insights I developed most deeply over the course - thinking about how a single word or phrase has shades of meaning and affects a whole passage, character, or play). I learned a lot about how Shakespeare used source material, and how these plays would have been read and understood in the sociopolitical world of Elizabethan England (and to a lesser extent, over time). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the instability and variations of Shakespeare's texts, to the level of the word. I also strengthened my skills of close reading, analyzing the effect of form, meter, rhyme, and diction. ",
            "\u00a0This class completely transformed the way I look at Shakespeare. In every single lecture, Professor Kastan proved again and again that the action of the play happens at the level of the word: the sounds, puns, dual meanings, ambiguous syntax, and so on, and how these details contribute to our understanding of the characters and themes. (Even if he writes the lectures the night before and tosses his notes right after class, they are still amazing, and you won't want to miss a single one.) I LOVED the famous manic glossing assignment, which is basically where you write as much as you possibly can about six lines from one of the plays. If you like Shakespeare, take this class; if you like close reading, or if you want to learn how to close read, take this class; if you want to listen to one of the most brilliant scholars in the field, take this class. If you get a chance, you might want to grab a cup of coffee with Professor Kastan, who will tell you why he likes teaching at Yale more than Dartmouth and Columbia. (Because he's lowkey taught at all three) ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop as a reader, in terms of thematic or grammatical readings of texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read with an attention to detail and language and to draw my understanding of \"higher bull****,\" as Professor Kastan put it, from concrete textual evidence. I learned so much about Shakespearean England, the theater, and the nature of history and tragedy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to think about Shakespeare's histories and tragedies in a historical context, how to think about the plays in the framework of genre, and how to analyze Shakespeare at the level of the word. "

            "\u00a0I thought this was a strong course overall! not much to improve! ",
            "\u00a0Lecture can get a bit repetitive, especially if there are multiple lectures on the same play; on the other hand, it is difficult (nearly impossible) to read more than a play a week with a full Yale course-load on top of this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty chill and even though it's two lectures and a section, it wasn't that much work. The paper topics were awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed branching out from the basic essay prompts you get given in other English classes. ",
            "\u00a0It went a little too fast for me. While I appreciate the breadth and context that reading so many plays provides, I wish we could have spent at least a couple of weeks on some of them, not to mention that it was difficult to keep up with reading the plays at some points (especially the double play weeks at the beginning and end of the semester). ",
            "\u00a0Everything was outstanding. The professor, the TFs, the review session, the paper feedback. There was nothing I think could be improved upon, other than the two weeks we had to read double plays which were challenging, but also it is understandable that we would need to. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kastan's lectures were fantastic, especially once I became familiar with his lecture style.  I loved watching him open up the plays to reveal new insights not only about Shakespeare but about humanity and culture.  The plays were really fun to read and it was enjoyable to discuss them in section.  If I had one criticism about the course it would be that I wish we received the paper assignments slightly earlier, though Professor Kastan was always very flexible about extending deadlines if we got the assignment later. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was structured extremely well and reasonably. The lectures were both entertaining and informative, my section was engaging and provocative, and the paper assignments were creative and fun to work on. ",
            "\u00a0More foreknowledge about the assignments would have been helpful. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus was fabulous, giving enough resources to students who wanted to dive deeper into scholarship without requiring everyone to do mountains of secondary reading. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were excellent. Each one was creative and had clear learning goals. ",
            "\u00a0Next time, it would be great if we had more time to complete our assignments and more transparency about what the assignments actually were going to be. I didn't like how the syllabus said there was going to be a final project, but there was actually a (rather lengthy) final exam. This would have been helpful to know because sometimes it's hard to plan classes so that final exam period works out the way you want it in terms of exams on certain days and the workload you will be dealing with then. Also, changing a project to an exam over half way into the course may impact students' flights home. \r\n\r\nIt was an interesting class with interesting and thought-provoking assignments, but I found myself stressing about deadlines and logistics when I should have been thinking about and enjoying the plays. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging and helped reveal themes and smaller nuances that one might not consider on first reading the plays. I found it most interesting to learn what Professor Kastan found most interesting about each play - which characters he would choose to focus on, what big questions he considers most central to the plays, and what features of the language he finds most notable. The reading guides he posts on Canvas are also helpful and well thought out. The assignments in the course, essentially three papers, paralleled the three levels on which we were asked to think, and were genuinely helpful in generating thought about the plays we chose to consider. Unlike many other English classes, the paper assignments had very structured prompts and clear expectations, which made the daunting material more accessible. The primary weakness of the course was discussion section. It seemed that the TAs didn't have much guidance regarding what to talk about, and my section was often left in silence until someone would spontaneously find a new topic to discuss. My section's discussions didn't do much to bring up any aspects of the text that we hadn't already covered in lecture. It might have been a lot more helpful to do group work, have some structured activities planned, or conduct review in the style of the review session before the final exam - thinking about the play on three levels as a class and testing our understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Some weeks, we were assigned 2 plays to read  I think this is too much, and devoting only one lecture to each of those plays meant that a lot of material went uncovered. ",
            "\u00a0I would have loved to learn how to research in this class. Rather than a final, I would have rather done an extended research assignment where we put in conversation primary and secondary sources, learn more about England, see how history and theater interact. I find these more rewarding than exams, and they also allow each student to focus on a play or historical issue they are most interested in. (For instance, I could see a paper about Richard III, the character vs. the historically documented king.) ",
            "\u00a0This course assumed that we had more time to do readings than we did (like assigning two plays in a single week). Lectures often summarized the introductions to the readings rather than really original stuff, but section was always helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are outstanding and the essay assignments made me a better reader and were really quite fun. Contrary to popular class opinion, I actually would have loved to see a few screenings over the course of the semester. I really enjoyed seeing the Tobacco Factory's performance of Othello and would've enjoyed the opportunity to see film or theatrical versions of a couple more plays. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and how the lectures were structured. I think that the section could have been more structured and aligned with what was discussed in lecture. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It made the Shakespeare histories and tragedies more accessible and a good environment to talk about the works! ",
            "\u00a0Yes: Professor Kastan is a fun lecturer, the histories can get a bit dry but the tragedies are great, and the assignments are interesting (though sometimes tedious). A good course in which to study Shakespeare at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Shakespeare is awesome, and you'll never have the chance to write such experimental papers ever again at any other Yale class. DO it do it do it. Yes, there's a final. So what. It's Shakespeare! It's exciting! If you don't like Shakespeare though... well, then I don't know what's wrong with you. ",
            "\u00a0Probably. Professor Kastan gave very engaging lectures, and Maria was great as a TA-- meeting with her outside of class was definitely a highlight of the course, and her feedback on essays was always insightful and detailed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I  absolutely would. I loved this course immensely. Learning about Shakespeare taught me about history of Europe and of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  The more I learn about Shakespeare, the more I feel that he has become so overrated that he is now underrated -- it's easy to valorize his writing and consider him a pillar of English literature or dismiss him as another canonical figure without reflecting all that deeply on how he rose to the status he now has.  This lecture is a fantastic opportunity to remember, or learn for the first time, just what is so wonderful or fascinating or worthwhile about Shakespeare through the lens of some stunningly moving texts that will sharpen your ability to close-read and think deeply about language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it! Great analysis and a wonderful credit/d ",
            "\u00a0absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in Shakespeare's writing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you'll become a much better reader by listening to Kastan's lectures, doing the sometimes-zany assignments, and, of course, reading the plays. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student IF they are willing to deal with changing deadlines and types of assignments, and confusing instructions to assignments. Don't get me wrong, Professor Kastan has interesting ideas and the lectures were often exciting and meaningful, but I wish I could have enjoyed the material without worrying about the logistics so much. The plays were great, though, and I don't think I regret taking the class. It was for sure thought-provoking. \r\n\r\nAlso, Professor Kastan brought pizza to the final which was very nice and appreciated! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you're already really into Shakespeare, Professor Kastan never fails to bring up nuances you wouldn't have otherwise thought of. If you aren't, or aren't an English major at all, it's a great \"crash course\" in histories and tragedies. The histories, admittedly, can be dry and difficult to get through, but the lectures are usually streamlined and focused to help you extract meaning from them. The reading load is not immense (one play per week) and Prof Kastan is an engaging, passionate, and extremely knowledgeable lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed reading the histories for the first time, and revisiting some of the tragedies I had read in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Probably would not recommend this course-- I took it because I wanted to take an English course and figured this would be a good one to try. But I really disliked the readings, especially because of how the professor taught them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is a great chance to study Shakespeare with a professor who lives and breathes it and makes the texts feel relevant and alive. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It provides such a solid body of knowledge about Shakespeare and made me think differently about language and how it's used. I looked forward to lecture and felt I walked away from class having learned something very valuable. "
