            "\u00a0I learned how to approach practical, real-life problems (ex. international crises, US elections) using basic models/games. While some of the work was mechanical, most of the time I had to think about rational decision-making and how to apply it to certain scenarios. It is definitely a good course to connect mathematics with social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into how models work and how we can take complex systems or interactions and simplify them down into games. I improved my skills in manipulating numbers and probabilities and using maths to help solve political models. This course helped me to see how different people and political actors act in different situations. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory Game Theory knowledge and practical applications on real world politics and current events. ",
            "\u00a0Game Theory can be interesting. that is all. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The material was interesting and the examples were applicable/realistic to situations I might encounter in everyday life; you definitely learn a lot by the end of the course; the lectures themselves were very engaging and attending was enjoyable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The optional section for this course did not add anything; most of the time we did not get through more than one problem and the explanations were not helpful; there was a large lack of clarity about exams, which account for 70% of the grade; the difficulty of the midterm and final were not comparable at all and there were few practice materials, so it was a lot of just hoping for the best ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved by being a seminar. There were few people in the class and we could have benefitted from more time talking through each game and having more face to face time with the professor. The strength of this course was definitely Professor Salas, his lectures were always engaging and he kept us focussed and on task. ",
            "\u00a0I found the lectures to be fairly engaging. Professor Salas was a great lecturer who came to the subject with a lot of passion. The course itself was interesting, although I would have preferred more concrete applications to the real world in the problem sets. Section could also have been improved, because it often felt like a repeat of the lecture. A more engaging, hands-on section would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Christian Salas is great and goes over all the material you need, so no textbook is necessary\r\nWeakness: The TA was an unfair grader. The PSets were NOT an introductory level, even developed math skills were needed at times. The TA never helped either. ",
            "\u00a0The class went very fast without much review and the TA was not very helpful ",
            "\u00a0The TF system for this course made everything more difficult. It felt like there was a large disconnect between the lectures, sections, psets, and exams. If Christian had been grading, I think he would have had a better idea of what people were understanding. Section did not help at all. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as long as the exam aspect is fixed. The course material is immensely helpful for somebody interested in political science/economics, but often times students are left guessing what topics will be tested. There were not any practice exams whatsoever and the sample questions posted required calculus and calculation that is simply not possible during testing. Other than that, if you are willing to take the course Credit/D/Fail just for the material, it is certainly worth it from a learning perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It can be a bit dry at the beginning, but it gives you a great introduction to Game Theory and helps you think about life and decision-making in new and effective ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to students who want a good introduction to the study of game theory. The level of maths required is not too high so this course is accessible and allows you to look at real political situations while also gaining quantitative reasoning skills. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Nope. Although it is a political science credit and a QR, it is not an easy QR. Maybe if a good TA was assigned to the course I would take it. Also there is no section to address the TA so Im just going to do it right here. His name is Johannes. I do not know his last name. But he was an awful TA who did not provide clear feedback and graded us harshly and unfairly. He only accepted answers constructed in an exact format, and broadly took off points when small mistakes were made. He also failed to engage with students, and was on his laptop doing his CS work during the entirety of the class. Truly the worst TA  I have ever had. Yale needs to make sure these TAs are actually capable of doing their job. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly worst class Ive taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0With Professor Salas, I thought this course was great, though no walk in the park. It's well suited to people with a strong math background who want to learn game theory for political science / law school reasons. The material doesn't actually require advanced mathematical concepts, but a knack for high school-level math will help with the problem sets and exams. It's not a class I would have guessed would be in the political science department; this seemed like a real game theory course to me, something that might be offered in the Econ department. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend another course with Christian, but this course needs some organizational changes. "
