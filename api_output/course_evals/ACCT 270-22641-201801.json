            "\u00a0Good intro to accounting, very little on valuation ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a hard class, but I thoroughly learned the ins and outs of accounting. ",
            "\u00a0Accounting practices and some investment info ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to accurately document a companies assets, liabilities, and equities while creating balance sheets, financial statements, and cash flow statements. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the 3 financial statements and how they complemented each other and how they were linked. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about financial statement, the present value of money, and excel tricks. ",
            "\u00a0I went from having no idea what accounting was to being able to effectively assess companies from a variety of different financial statements. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly lots of technical literacy in understanding and being able to navigate the three financial statements and understand their interactions. Lots and lots of practice required to gain real mastery, but felt like this course gave me more than sufficient fundamentals to start that practicable process. ",
            "\u00a0Great course for learning basic accounting concepts (balance sheets, debits/credits, cash flow statement, etc.), plus a little bit of valuation at the beginning of the termmostly looking at one set of financial statements and creating the subsequent balance sheet given a number of transactions over a period, will be asked once to look at a set of financial statements and derive the transactions that took place. ",
            "\u00a0Learned basics of accounting, how to read/create financial statements, and interpret them to better understand a company. ",
            "\u00a0Developed good accounting intuition. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction into the fundamentals of accounting. It taught me how to construct the three main accounting statements (balance sheets, cash flow statements, and income statements), as well as how to interpret each in the context of a dynamic business. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing introductory accounting course and honestly everyone at Yale should take it! "

            "\u00a0No weaknesses, great powerpoint slides. ",
            "\u00a0I really dislike the practice of forcing students to struggle through something before you teach it. Teach it first, then practice, instead of making students guess their way through something only to find out they were totally wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: not a lot of pressure to get a high grade, manageable and interesting course material, fun assignments\r\nWeaknesses: the class meets at 8:45! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good lecturer who is responsive to email, good course structure  \r\nWeaknesses: lectures could drag/wander, early meeting time (everyone was so sleepy), TAs hardly existed. Material is inherently kind of dry. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe give the 2nd problem set a little earlier. RIck is right that you understand from more practice. ",
            "\u00a0I think that sometimes the class goes a little too fast and sometimes a little too slow. I wish we had spent more time going over balance sheets than the present value stuff we learned earlier which I felt like we spent too much time on. This is a very minute detail, because, overall, I think this is the most practical class that I have taken at Yale, and I am so glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Strength certainly the accessibility of the course. Expectations and grading systems made clear; slides always on Canvas the day before the relevant lecture; problem sets uploaded with sufficient time to do them. Major weakness would be Professor Antle's time allocation in lecture to topics less than pertinent to the material at hand, i.e. tendency to go on tangents. However, most of these extended examples/explanations came from a true hope to communicate the info as best as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Professor structures the course well so that the first half is relatively high-paced in terms of amount of information being thrown at you but the second half is mostly review and practice, which worked really well. Not many weaknesses, except maybe there could have been more problem sets (only two) as those were pretty thorough and helpful in putting everything together, whereas homework quizzes worked on different tools separately. ",
            "\u00a0Loved how it covered something that was actually useful for someone going into finance, but felt that we spent too much time on the first half of the class and not enough on the last half. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor ",
            "\u00a0Perfectly organized to facilitate student learning. "

            "\u00a0It's fine--minimum of B+ if you do all the work and a good class to petition for econ credit ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend for anyone considering a career in corporate development or financial services. Relevant to everything on the job. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this if you're super interested in doing this type of work. Otherwise, you could get the base-level understanding that I wanted just on your own without having to worry about all the work, how to classify tricky transactions, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are remotely interesting in finance. I'm going into theater, so I came in thinking this course would be a waste of my time. However, the course does teach you valuable information for anyone who will be dealing with money in the future (aka... all of us!) ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're going into finance - knowing the 3 financial statements and how they work together is necessary. Prof Antle is a good lecturer, though he drags/wanders, and 8:45 am in SOM is rough. Having to do work due every class (so work is due 2x a week) is annoying but necessary to learn accounting. No midterm which is nice. Weird final exam policy (can only get an A if you take the in class final, otherwise you get a B+). If the B+ bothers you, consider Cr/D ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think there is a lot of very applicable skills taught in this course more than some theoretical information in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this to anyone considering finance as a career, but also really to anyone. I think that this class helps set up a better understanding of money and how it relates to companies which everyone could benefit from. ",
            "\u00a0To any student wanting a rudimentary understanding of financial accounting, this course is certainly the one for you. Accessible and relatively painless way to gain this kind of knowledge. Professor Antle is smart and thoughtful; simply just wants his students to learn as much and as best as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, basic accounting knowledge is useful and Professor Antle is great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this course and will actually be able to apply what I learned in my internship. If you are at all interested in anything business this is something I think is really important to become familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is great for developing an understanding for what accounting is. Little background knowledge is needed to do well (though it helps). ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction into the basic principles of accounting. I would recommend it for anyone thinking about entering the business world, as it teaches you how to construct and interpret the three fundamental accounting statements. Professor Antle is also an engaging lecturer and makes the material interesting and comprehensible. Very practical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- great professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Its a great way to learn accounting and Prof. Antle knows hoe to slow down so that everyone understands where he's going. "
