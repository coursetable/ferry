            "\u00a0Understanding of french language and some french history post 20th century ",

        [
            "\u00a0The course content emphasized some seemingly obscure grammar rules and vocabulary, and not necessarily conversation and practicing everyday communication. A lot of the films and books chosen to watch/read were pretty outdated and not quite interesting nor enlightening. Would have appreciated more emphasis on speaking skills (i.e. in everyday conversation) and not necessarily on grammar and retaining impertinent details on characters and scenes from outdated media. Appreciated the push to make us read a novel at the end of the semester but did not appreciate the regurgitation-style research projects and discussion that came along with the themes of the book. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very much in the course packet. I wish we were provided with answers within the packet so we could discuss other things in class. It is also a lot of listening per day, and the audio programs aren't always helpful -- some of the verbal stuff is a bit repetitive. Beyond these minor things, it's a very good class that provides a good step forward in learning French. ",
            "\u00a0The course was graded too harshly to encourage learning. I studied not to learn french but to have any chance at succeeding in the exams. Also, the exams were not written by my teacher, creating an inherent asymmetry in the quality of test preparation between sections. There were too many exams. The constant examinations made it a largely unenjoyable class. The final unit, un sac de bille, was by far the best for both learning and for enjoyment (largely because there wasn't the same monotonous flow of grammar and vocabulary and examination. "

            "\u00a0While I felt I learned quite a lot of French in my previous semesters here at Yale, I did not learn nearly the same amount this semester. Would have liked to learn some more grammar rules in addition to those learned in FREN 130 (instead of repeating them again) and have done more practicing with conversation, communication, and pronunciation. Course packet and film assignments often took much more time than was necessary and did not feel like it was relevant to learning the material at hand. Audio tape assignments were particularly annoying and tedious, and are probably at least 10 years old. Take this course to fulfill the language requirement, but not necessarily to learn more about the language. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to, hope for the teacher who is writing the exams to succeed. I wish there were more casual french classes one could take before they exceeded 150 ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to anyone trying to learn French. "
