            "\u00a0I learned a lot about American wars and religious history, particularly during the colonial period. I did not feel that I grew much as a writer or researcher in this course. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of United States history, and a lot of the language around politics, war, and religion that is still present today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the influence religion has (and has not) had on American cultural development. Talking about religion through the lens of war is pretty different than any other way of learning about US history that I've ever done. ",
            "\u00a0Now have a working knowledge of most of America's big wars. Am familiar with just war theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about religions role in America through history. ",
            "\u00a0Religion, War, and the Meaning of America taught me to examine military conflict through the lens of religion -- but it pushed me to consider \"religion\" more broadly than I probably would have in the past. Specifically, I think I developed a significant grasp on the concept of \"civil religion\" and American patriotism as a form of spiritual practice. I also got more practice writing a 20+ page paper! ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about American history and society through this class's weekly readings and discussions. I thought the central concept that war is a necessity to the creation and development of American identity over time was fascinating to think, talk, and write about. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely broadened my view of American history and has made me want to widen my range of study. Stout is unbelievably engaging. ",
            "\u00a0You track the entire history of US was and the influence of religion/patriotism in those violent conflicts. You get a much deeper appreciation for the role of the country's religion and civil religion in American exceptionalism and war. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course strengths are the provocative readings and Professor Stout's insight. I think it could be improved in a number of areas, from preventing/ prohibiting class presentations from becoming reading summaries (as opposed to analysis and critique) to providing clear expectations and guidance about the written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0It is a really interesting look at wars throughout US history, and Prof. Stout not only knows a lot about the subject, he also is interesting to listen/talk to, which makes the class much more enjoyable than it might be with another professor. The only weakness is that if you aren't as well-versed in US military history, it can be a bit confusing at times, just to keep the details of what happened straight. Prof. Stout goes over it in class, but it's definitely helpful to have some background knowledge! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Stout is interesting and knowledgeable but lets students ramble sometimes ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - really great readings\r\nWeaknesses - The class presentations where each student just summarizes the readings could have been so much better if we asked questions and tried to answer them together. If you did the readings, it was pretty much useless, except for Professor Stout's commentary. If that took half an hour each seminar - imagine how much more we could have gone into the history more deeply! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are Professor Stout he is such a sweetheart. You can meet with him whenever you need and he's really helpful in brainstorming answers. Weaknesses are the 20 page paper is honestly pretty rough. ",
            "\u00a0The assigned readings were generally strong, and I appreciated that my classmates came from a variety of diverse academic backgrounds (mostly history, religious studies, and american studies). I also loved the two shorter paper assignments (especially how open-ended they were)!\r\n\r\nHowever, I did find the individual reading reports that began each class to be a weakness of RW&A. They often took up more than half of the once-a-week seminar, and they definitely allowed students to be less engaged in the later discussion (putting the pressure on students to just be exceptionally prepared once a semester).\r\n\r\nI probably would have preferred to dedicate this time to allowing Professor Stout to lecture briefly on the history of each war we studied. It was difficult to talk about war & religion when the facts of each week's war were kind of uncertain. I think if Professor Stout kicked off each class with a short lecture, it might get everyone on the same page. (I also think 18 people was a bit too large and might recommend narrowing it to 14 next year?) ",
            "\u00a0One weakness developed throughout the semester, and that was the inclination of the student who was presenting on the week's reading to summarize the reading in excessive detail. Class discussions sometimes suffered from over-bearing presentations, but for the most part, the seminars ran efficiently and, Professor Stout facilitated interesting conversations. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes on a new armed conflict in U.S. History each week and distills how religious institutions interacted with the war effort. Each week, the readings and the discussions Professor Stout led were deeply enriching. It was by far one of the best seminars I have ever had. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions were always interesting and the subjects were all distinct but closely tied together. It was easy to trace the seminar's main themes throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0This seminar is certainly among the better history seminars available at Yale. That said, it is not the best for several reasons. By design, you only spend one week on each war/ period of American history, which severely limits the historical depth and contextual awareness you can develop (an important outcome, in my view, of history seminars). Professor Stout is wonderful and has a lot of wisdom to share, but he is less engaged with students directly than other seminar professors I've had. Lastly, and most importantly, you should know that this class really tows the line between philosophy and history--it truly embody a cross-listing between RLST and HIST. Keep that in mind if, like me, you prefer to discuss history moreso than historical theories, since much of the course will be devoted to Just War Theory, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great, interesting, and important lens through which one can look at US history. The amount of reading varies from week to week, and sometimes can be a lot, but it's always interesting and worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to learn more about American religion, especially if you are from a place where most people are not Protestant - you'll learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. Professor Stout is an excellent facilitator of material during seminar, and he is a pleasure to talk to during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if only to befriend Stout. He's a really funny dude. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you're looking for a course that kind of blends religious studies with history! Professor Stout is very knowledgeable and does a good job of covering a lot of history in only one semester. The workload is surprisingly heavy but manageable, and the readings are consistently interesting (especially the further along into the course you get).\r\n\r\nI would warn that the class leans more toward religious studies / philosophy than history, so if you're looking for a military history course, this probably isn't the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! It gave me a fascinating introduction to American religious history. Themes throughout the course are repetitive in a very helpful way, and I finished with a very strong understanding of the main themes. ",
            "\u00a0Take anything Professor Stout teaches. This course will change how you view the U.S. and its reliance on war. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to students who are interested in religion and violent conflict. Students should be ready to dig deep into the relationship between the two, and critique certain elements of the American identity. "
