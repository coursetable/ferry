You have to put in a ton of work, but you feel like it pays off. You probably should go to office hours/the tutors regularly. They're super helpful and necessary unless you're a genius. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course may be the lecture setting, in which it feels difficult to ask questions, but besides that, this course is designed to help students succeed, which I very much appreciate.  The professor is very devoted to helping her students. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is also its weakness. The homework can be ridiculous. I found myself going to study hall and just getting the answers from people who got hints from the professor. Really hurt my critical thinking skills in that aspect. To be fair there are some questions you just CANT solve without knowing what math-wizard trick she means for you to use, necessitating the study hall/collaboration. Just try to resist the temptation to get the answers and make yourself grind through it by yourself as much as possible. It will hurt but it'll be worth it. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Steinacker. I've never seen a professor put so much time and effort into her students. She comes to class with her lectures clear and well-organized, but more than that, she spends countless hours during the week making herself available for questions. \r\n\r\nI think a few things that could be improved are the way new materials are introduced. If I hadn't had high school physics, I would find the new topics extremely difficult to follow, because we often jump straight into more difficult pieces of it. I also think the psets can be unnecessarily difficult at times, offering algebraic tricks without really gaining new knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Steinacker is great and does a wonderful job teaching the material. She wants you to do well and will personally try to make sure you do. ",
            "\u00a0There were so many opportunities to get help, really great because of that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor is for sure the biggest strength of the course. Adriane Steinacker is the BEST professor that I have ever had, or will ever have, at this university. Her lectures are so clear and concise. She makes a point to hand write every lecture on the board, so you can easily follow along and so she can explain everything herself. THEN, she posts very in-depth lecture notes for each class so you can go back and review each class. She holds offie hours like literally every day, and is VERY accessible for all students to meet at any time. Any time there is a problem in grading or anything like that, she is very quick to respond and fix the problem. She grades the course very fairly and makes it open and fair for everyone.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets, while helpful, are both long and incredibly difficult, taking up to 14 hours each week. I'm glad this was my only course with psets this semester, because these are easily 2 courses work of problems each week. There are a lot of resources for you to get help on them, though. ",
            "\u00a0The workload is very high but the professor has so many office hours and the TAs have so many study halls that it is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, so many opportunities for help are available with this course that I can't in good conscience complain. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Achieve a good understanding of Mechanics, very good instructor, plenty of opportunities to seek help outside of class, material that will be on the MCAT\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PSETs are a little hard some weeks ",
            "\u00a0Psets are SO much work!!! I spent around 8 hours during 5 or 6 problems on average and so people spent much much more!\r\n\r\nLectures are not helpful at all - Steinacker may be the nicest person in the world during office hours, but it doesn't change the fact that she is a horrible lecturer. She tries to derive things only to confuse people even more. At least she sometimes tells good jokes and shows cool physics clips. People who are good at physics and those who are not good are equally confuzzled by what she is saying. Also, since there is a participation grade, you are forced to go to class even though, at least for me, it was kind of a waste of time...\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would say it is difficult to do well in this class if you've never taken physics before. The material is presented poorly, the psets are too difficult to help you master basic content, and the exams are HARD. I've taken physics extensively before in high school, and I probably did well. HOWEVER, stuff was just so unnecessarily complicated and I spent a LOT of time. For me, the exams were kind of fun (like it's a fun puzzle to figure out what the questions are asking!!) but most people probably don't think that way because the averages for the 2 midterms were like 70 ish. Some of the final questions were also kind of brutal honestly - if I hadn't seen them before, I would have no clue what they were getting at.\r\n\r\nThat being said, apparently Steinacker is a saint who will help you a lot in office hours. I never went...so I wouldn't know, but knowing that there is support from the professor is great, of course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is well-taught and the review sessions were particularly useful for the exams. I believe the notes on canvas were clear and easily accessible. However, I believe that the psets are way to long and challenging sometimes. However, I was impressed with the exam corrections which help boost our grade but on the other hand I don't think the grade after the exam corrections are a true reflection of our understanding and level of engagement with the material studied. I don't know what can be done about this because on one hand it is useful but on the other hand, it gives a false sense of accomplishment. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that there are many places to get help if you are struggling with the material and that the course has a relatively slow pace, so falling behind shouldn't be too much of an issue.  The weakness is that the p-sets are sometimes a degree of difficulty beyond what is covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture style is a little difficult to understand ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that Professor Steinacker is the most amazing professor I have ever had at Yale. Even though the exams and psets are extremely difficult, the amount of support that Adrianne Steinacker provides is amazing. Nothing could be improved upon more besides getting a better set of TAs to grade more uniformly on the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0This course requires a lot of work and time. You must be willing to go to office hours and really learn the material. You have to constantly stay on top of material, but it is all worth it. This course makes the learning validating and satisfying. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is an incredible instructor and really goes out of her way, both in lecture and outside of lecture, to encourage learning. However, the content itself is difficult, as are the homework sets, which can be overwhelming. That being said, the course itself is well taught. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like feedback on homework and tests was really inconsistent and sometimes untimely. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is surely Professor Steinacker who is a coherent professor who understands student's issues in physics well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It gets the job done, and Professor Steinacker sets up a very strong support system for those who care to use it. She's also very nice and willing to explain things. \r\nWeaknesses: The course at some points becomes essentially manipulations of algebra; I would've liked to see more conceptual physics. Also, my TA was extremely unresponsive to both emails and comments on canvas. ",
            "\u00a0Very challenging no criticisms ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were long but doable because Adriane and her teaching fellows were so incredible. There were office hours every weekday and study hall every night. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the challenge of the PSets helped with my understanding of the material, although the size of the class made it somewhat difficult to gain a significant amount from actual lecture time.  Peer tutor hours were especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is explanatory and everything connects very nicely.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TA's aren't always equal in grading, but as long as you talk to the professor about it, it will get corrected. ",
            "\u00a0By far the largest strength of this class is the professor. Her lectures are wonderful and her tests are comprehensive, even if they are difficult. The problem sets are also tricky and can take quite a bit of time, but are good preparation for exams. A weakness of the course would have to be the difficulty of the problems as compared to the underlying concepts; however, I also view this as a strength. ",
            "\u00a0The class notes, study halls, and peer tutors were strengths of this course. The p-sets took a lot of time and were not always connected to lectures. The teaching fellows were not very present except to help in study hall. Having optional or mandatory discussion sections similar to the intro chemistry sequences could be helpful in developing student connections to a specific TA who could aid in better understanding of the material outside of strictly homework help. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well taught and structured. All of the class notes (which are incredibly thorough and well developed) are posted to the class canvas section, which very much facilitates catching up on material if one misses something during lecture or is unable to attend class. The grading policy of the course is very clearly delineated at the beginning of the semester and Professor Steinacker emphasizes learning physics for the opportunity of learning rather than for fulfilling a prerequisite. While this class is probably required for anyone taking it, it could probably not be better than with Professor Steinacker. Her compassion and interest in the topics genuinely makes class as enjoyable as it could be, and she is incredibly fair and willing to help students. The fact that there are so many office hours and resources makes the difficult material easier to handle. ",
            "\u00a0This class is just so much work. It is frustrating in a way because if you are a normal person like me, you probably can't really do any of the PSET on your own. This means you have to spend your LIFE in office hours and study hall. I didn't ask for that. I am only taking this class because I'm premed. I'm not going to be a physicist and I think it's a ridiculous amount of work for someone who knows that. I understand that I need to learn physics, but I spent literally all of my free time in office hours and study hall. Every free moment when I wasn't in class I was there. It's frustrating that the PSETs are simply un-doable alone. Too time consuming. \r\n\r\nThat said, Professor Steinacker is so lovely. She's a lovely person, so sweet, SO committed to her students, more than any other intro STEM professor I've had. Even though she has like 300 students she knows everyone's name! I really do appreciate that. She is a great professor too and teaches the material very well. I love her class notes online. They help so much. ",
            "\u00a0I think many people like this course because of the instructor. It is  a lecture course, and the professor holds office hours everyday; further review can be done at study hall. However, this class is definitely very difficult for students that have either never taken physics, or have trouble thinking about physics in the way in requires (two categories in which I fall into). Don't get me wrong, I learned a lot, but I put so much effort into this class and it was still very difficult to keep up.\r\n\r\nThis class NEEDS a discussion section, like chemistry. I know it is a big course and perhaps there are a lack of TAs, but this class seriously needs one for people like me. Course material is covered very quickly and the questions on the psets are very difficult. Please, please, please form a discussion section for this class. That way, I don't have to wait for the instructor's attention at office hours (which is literally always crowded). In all honestly, while the peer tutors are helpful, it is evident that they are not taught how to teach, and sometimes, them helping just got me more confused because they either had to backtrack their explanations or just read off the answer key. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the professor. She lets the students to concentrate on the learning itself. ",
            "\u00a0Course material is covered very quickly, so an outline of the exact topics with corresponding textbook chapters would be a helpful reference upon which to look back during midterms/finals. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Steinacker is amusing and very enthusiastic, and she cares about her students. Her exam review sessions are helpful, and her exams are mostly fair. The frequent study halls are great because students can work on problem sets collaboratively and receive guidance from peer tutors and teaching fellows.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes it's hard to focus during a long lecture with many students, and the collected classwork is rushed. The material often relies on mathematical skills and intuition that many students are still developing, so those students were confused at times. The textbook isn't very good, Prof. Steinacker's lecture notes are lengthy, and at first it wasn't clear what resources were available on Canvas. The problem sets are very time-consuming, they weren't graded timely, and only some of the questions counted.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by addressing the weaknesses outlined above, such as by dividing the class into smaller sections, by changing the textbook, and by giving credit for all of the assigned homework problems. ",
            "\u00a0This course moved quickly but was structured very well structured. The lectures were very clear and the weekly problem sets helped solidify and expand my understanding of the topics covered in class. I think this course was great and there isn't much room for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course could benefit from sticking to a textbook a little more closely. For exams, you have to study from the pset and lectures, which are extremely detailed that you can sometimes lose sight of the larger ideas in physics.\r\n I enjoy and respect that Steinacker challenges us to think more critically. However, oftentimes the material is unnecessarily challenging. \r\nThe peer tutoring program was amazing for this course. I got so much help from them and the course needs to continue this program. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course if the enthusiasm and kindness of the professor. The main weakness is the manner in which the material is taught. Lectures are largely focused on proofs of equations rather than examining a broad array of situations we could use the equations in. ",
            "\u00a0The workload in the class is difficult, but if you stick through and do it you will end up learning a great deal about physics. ",
            "\u00a0This physics class made physics seem possible for me. The greatest strength are the psets. They allow you to create relationship with Professor Steinacker ad your peers. If you take them seriously, you are forced to engage with the material and really learn key ideas. Class time is not that intereasting, because it is still physics. However, Steinacker makes the best of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly well taught with clear expectations that match the material covered. It also allows for an extensive interaction with peers over PSets, which I found to be very valuable. The PSets are long, but they are approachable thanks to Dr. Steinacker. ",
            "\u00a0Two strengths of this course are the weekly problem sets that keep you on top of the material and Prof. Steinacker's ability to clearly communicate concepts during lecture with enthusiasm and attention to any confusion among students. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good introductory course. The strengths were almost always related to Professor Steinacker's skill as an educator. That being said, the class was stressful, moreso than most introductory courses. The psets were long and difficult, but did help you master the material. Professor Steinacker also gave us seemingly endless opportunities to get help. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Steinacker is very enthusiastic about the subject, which made it easier to engage myself with the lectures. She has always been very clear when explaining concepts and walking through problems.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of the problem sets made this course quite stressful at times. Extensive amounts of creativity and endurance were required for the problem sets. But this was expected since the beginning, and the problem sets are what made this course intellectually challenging and rewarding. Office hours were very helpful as well, but perhaps a few more hints could be added to the most difficult problems to reduce stress. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was Professor Steinacker. She is by far the best professor I have had at Yale thus far, and is clearly dedicated 110% to the course and her students. She went far about and beyond what was required to ensure we all had an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0This class is excellent. Strengths include no requirement of previous physics; enough challenge that everyone must work (regardless of background); clear and helpful professor; interesting lectures; a good curve; and a vast array of resources to help on problem sets. One potential weakness is that sometimes the problem sets felt a little bit algebraically intense (there was often a algebraic \"trick\" necessary to solve the problem that did not relate to the physics of the problem). Of course, this might be necessary for any number of reasons (thinking of good homework problems is hard, these sorts of algebraic tricks are useful for the engineers in the class, these sorts of algebraic tricks are considered an important part of a physics education), and, given the excellent peer tutors, is not a big deal. One other potential weakness is that the the peer tutors gave inconsistent amounts of help -- some would essentially write out the solution with you (too much help), others would give just very basic, general advice (too little help), and some (my favorite) would give the perfect amount of help, usually helping us to set up the problem but leaving us to work through it ourselves (but being there to help more/problem solve if we get stuck). More standardization across peer tutors would be great, but I know this is difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing! It is taught in an extremely engaging manner, Professor Steinacker manages to keep it very interactive despite the large class size. All concepts were elaborated on very explicitly with examples and repeated when necessary. The HWs were challenging but Professor Steinacker always made herself available to help. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting, but they are too fast paced and do not start with the basics. It would be more helpful to start with a basic problem / just going over the very simply stuff, and then going into the more advanced topics. Also, the PSets are far too long and take 5-10 hours. I learned a lot from the PSets, but they could be shorter. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a great instructor, but some of the topics are not sufficiently explained between the notes, the book, and the problems. I think it would be helpful to have a textbook that properly corresponds with the notes and the in class lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were quite challenging but that makes sense so that the exam can be broader. I liked how they therefore counted for a lot of our grades since they took up a lot of time. I generally liked the structure of the course and wouldnt change much. ",

            "\u00a0-The psets were sometimes so difficult that I felt like I was missing out on learning the more basic content ",
            "\u00a0Exams were representational of psets, which I really appreciated. However, I felt that the psets could sometimes be unnecessarily long, taking upwards of eight conglomerate hours to complete. I understand the importance of practicing the ideas presented in lecture, but pset problems were sometimes contrived and overly complex. Aside from that, I felt that the subject material was presented clearly, and additional resources were extremely accessible. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job teaching physics. The problem sets and examples were very helpful both for gaining an intuition for the problems as well as for understanding the math. That being said, I often felt lectures could have been structured in a way as to make concepts easier to understand. This could have been achieved, for example, by placing more emphasis on key ideas/equations. It would have been helpful if professor Steinacker had written out key definitions (e.g. torque, velocity, vector, etc.) and boxed key equations. Furthermore, I would have liked a brief summary of key previous lecture at the beginning of every new lecture. Finally, it would have been helpful if the first lecture of the semester gave a more general overview of what physics is and how math is used in it (e.g. why are derivatives important??). ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized because there were plenty of study halls and office hours one can get support from. The lectures are well supplemented with good lecture notes and Adriane is a gem truly. ",

            "\u00a0Course has helpful office hours and study halls. However, if you have never taken physics before, the lecture are difficult to follow/keep up with. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength was the professor because she was very engaging and did a lot to ensure students were enjoying physics. The  only weakness were the problem sets. They could be improved by providing answers to the practice problems to know whether or not students understand the material. Also, it feels unfair to do all the problems and then only have a few graded. "

To be fair, she sometimes offers hints on some of the problems, but for the most part you can't solve them without office hours, which is ridiculous for an introductory course.

She is by far much more valuable than any medically relevant content they might cover in 170. I'm really, really glad that I took this over 170! ",

She tries to derive things only to confuse people even more. At least she sometimes tells good jokes and shows cool physics clips. People who are good at physics and those who are not good are equally confuzzled by what she is saying. Also, since there is a participation grade, you are forced to go to class even though, at least for me, it was kind of a waste of time...\r\n\r\nThat being said, I would say it is difficult to do well in this class if you've never taken physics before. The material is presented poorly, the psets are too difficult to help you master basic content, and the exams are HARD. I've taken physics extensively before in high school, and I probably did well. HOWEVER, stuff was just so unnecessarily complicated and I spent a LOT of time. For me, the exams were kind of fun (like it's a fun puzzle to figure out what the questions are asking!!) but most people probably don't think that way because the averages for the 2 midterms were like 70 ish. Some of the final questions were also kind of brutal honestly - if I hadn't seen them before, I would have no clue what they were getting at.\r\n\r\nThat being said, apparently Steinacker is a saint who will help you a lot in office hours. I never went...so I wouldn't know, but knowing that there is support from the professor is great, of course. \r\n\r\nOverall, despite this long-winded answer, I'm not sure what my answer would be.
