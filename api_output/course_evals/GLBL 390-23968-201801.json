I enjoyed how the course was structured, focusing first on an introduction to the field of cybersecurity first and then spending one week on important topics in the sector. Good amount of engaging reading material. Classes were well-balanced between structured lecture and discussion. Overall I really enjoyed the course and learned a ton! ",

The class brings together a great diversity of students (Global Affairs undergrads, Jackson grad students, poli sci, history, CS, Law, etc.), and the breadth of topics also makes for very interesting discussions. The areas of cybersecurity we discuss are incredibly topical, and Professor Wittenstein does an excellent job of bringing in current events throughout the semester. ",
