The main skills I learned in this course were in constructing proofs and using the LaTeX markup. ",

The material this semester was  less interesting than the fall semester, mostly because we were dealing with more computational things (integrals, volumes, optimization, etc) that didn't really require knowledge of a proof but just their application. I wish I had calc III background to supplement this particular class (didn't really need it last semester) because having seen these topics before would've helped a lot. ",

In regards to those two topics, you learn about them, but probably not enough to do any problems with them. ",

There's something liberating in gnawing at an impossible problem until some intuition arrives, a joy which transcends the plug-n-chug mentality of previous math courses. The linear algebra and calculus we studied was cool, but was incidental to this grander goal. ",

With my proof skills already well-developed, I could really focus on learning the various linear algebra and vector calculus topics covered in the course. I learned so much about linear transformations, matrices, derivatives, integrals, manifolds, and more. Meanwhile, I was also able to teach myself LaTex through the problem sets, giving me an important and fun skill to use in future math courses. Finally, I continued to hone my ability to work with my classmates and build off others ideas to create thorough and interesting proofs, potentially the most valuable skill going forward as a mathematician. ",

I found the treatment of several topics such as manifolds especially insightful, but others were covered in a rushed manner or hardly mentioned at all. In particular, I was disappointed to find that the course did not address integrating forms, orienting boundaries, or Stokes' theorem, especially since these are the natural culmination of the topics like manifolds and wedge products that were discussed previously.

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat really cares about his students and cares about their learning. The psets take ~5-6 hours, which really isn't that bad. You learn so, so much math in 230 + 231: whereas before the sequence I feel like I didn't know what math beyond calculus was like, now I feel like I have a decent understanding of what real analysis/algebra/topology actually mean in practice. The community of students is also great. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Pat handwaves a lot of things that feel really important, so when we spend a whole class on proving a single theorem and half of the proof becomes just Pat saying \"yadda yadda the matrix has full rank, blah blah take the limit as you go to infinity,\" you come away feeling like you didn't really learn anything. That said, it's totally understandable why he does that, it just doesn't feel great. Also, you don't really learn/practice the stuff you'd learn in 120/222, e.g. we learned line integrals and surface integrals in one class the last week of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course excels in teaching students how to become better proof-writers and critical thinkers. It is a very, very good course for this. Additionally, the psets are very interesting, albeit difficult, and promote working with others to come up with solutions. There is no time wasted in any assignment with this class. Finally, the professor is very passionate about mathematics, and this passion is contagious.\r\n\r\nA few weaknesses of this course are that I felt that the subject material was a bit more of a drag as compared to Math 230. I understand that a lot of Math 230 was laying down foundational material for the structures of Math 231, and thus different students may find different areas interesting. Nonetheless, I found this semester a bit less exciting. Additionally, the graders for Math 231 were very slow, so I felt I did not have a lot of feedback on my performance throughout the semester. Finally, the topics themselves felt a little bit more scattered, and I felt the pace of the class was a bit faster than 230, mostly due to the fact that we were moving from proving theorems most students had already seen to proving theorems many had not. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat, the content, the people in the class, and the support structure. Weaknesses: Some of the Psets are really challenging, and while I don't think it's really a weakness, it would be nice if they were worth a bit more of the final grade considering how much time they took. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, but lost some of the energy as compared to 230. There are not as many students in the math lounge or cool outside of the box questions on psets, in my opinion. Some parts tended to get a little bit more confusing in the higher levels, but honestly I am thinking about only two specific days when most everyone got lost, but other than that the course was easy to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely excellent course. Lectures were engaging, problem sets were difficult but extremely rewarding, support structure was great, topics were diverse but came together in beautiful ways. Change nothing, but maybe make the tests easier... ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great prof as always, psets and tests especially this semester really make you think well, good effort to incorporate concrete examples this semester\r\nWeaknesses: a little unstructured going into the end of the course, but content was still good ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Everything but the weaknesses - engaging teaching, and I learned a lot of math.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes some of the material may be presented without as much intuition. It would help if there would be more higher level explanation of how everything tied together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broad range of math topics that allow us to explore our interests in different fields. Ample opportunities to provide feedback through surveys.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can feel scattered and difficult to follow.\r\nNot necessarily a weakness, but very time intensive psets with varying degrees of rewarding proofs ",
            "\u00a0I think that a lot of students get lost conceptually halfway through the second part of the 230-231 sequence. It feels as if there is a rush to finish the big name theorems rather than to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in giving us an understanding of linear algebra and multivariable calculus at a highly fundamental and theoretical level. It also did a great job of teaching us different proof methods as well as exposing us to many different areas of math, including point-set topology, abstract algebra, linear algebra, analysis, and calculus. However, at times, Math 231 felt very disorganized. Proofs in class were often nebulous and poorly structured. A few proofs took the entire class period, like the Inverse Function Theorem proof. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Teaches you basic proof-writing skills\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Is needlessly time-consuming, doesn't teach you applicable skills (as in content, like doing integrals and Lagrange multipliers quickly) beyond using LaTeX, sucks the life out of you by making you realize how much you don't like thinking about math, no matter what you thought in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fun, good intro to proofwriting, fun teacher who very caring and kind to students (and generous regarding deadlines, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very very disorganized, more so than 230, and can sometimes be quite frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat is understanding and accommodating as always, and the friends you make in 230 carry over into the semester (and also carry you through the course). \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were long (switching to 2 lectures/week was not ideal) and hard to follow, material seemed unorganized and disjoint, tests got harder (although they were not that difficult last semester). ",
            "\u00a0Just as great as Math 230 with very engaging psets and exams, helpful TAs and professor,  and interesting lectures. One thing I would have liked is for the class/lectures to be a tad more structured/organized. ",
            "\u00a0Pat is a great teacher and the first semester (230) was great, but he seemed to be much more disorganized this semester and at times it seemed like he didn't really care that much anymore and lost his enthusiasm for teaching. ",
            "\u00a0The major strengths of this course are the instructor, who is wonderful, and the subject material, which is fascinating. Everything is taught in a fashion where it eventually makes sense, and all the people involved seem to really enjoy mathematics itself. That being said, the largest weakness was the way in which Professor Devlin explained things -- he clearly is so familiar with the material that he sometimes made jumps I couldn't follow. The course organization itself, however, was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n-Everyone associated with the course was great. Pat is super friendly, the TA's were awesome, and there was a great community.\r\n-I will repeat: The community aspect was great, it would be a shame to take this course and not take advantage of it at least a little (even if you're so brilliant you don't have to).\r\n-You get much better at proofs and thinking mathematically\r\n-Learn a fair bit of math\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-This semester turned into a slog. The material got more abstract and just more notationally dense which made following in lectures difficult. This made the everything feel more disconnected.\r\n-Grading this semester was absolute garbage, but that will improve I'm sure.\r\n-The psets burnt me out. My attitude changed part way through this semester from, \"let me try to get everything I can out of this pset,\" to \"let me get this pset over with as fast as possible so I can be done with 231 for a week.\" This clearly is not a good attitude to have, but this is what happened to me from all the work and non-stop grind of having difficult psets to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material always feels so related to previous content (Pat makes it as such), the entire one year sequence doesn't feel like it has a lesson out of place. Also, although the problem sets probably took more time than 230, they were great preparation for any exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The longer class times as compared to 230, means that once you get even a little lost during the class, you are pretty much confused for the rest of the 75 minutes as opposed  to 50 minutes which allows you to consolidate before moving on. ",
            "\u00a0Pat could emphasize and reference the textbook a little more. ",
            "\u00a0The regular problem sets led to improvement in my problem solving skills, but they were very long and sometimes made the class intimidating. ",
            "\u00a0PSet feedback could come earlier I guess. (same for 674). Class notes were the bomb. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength is the difficulty of the course, but ironically it is also the course's weakness. While the content was challenging, at times it was too challenging to the point where a lot of students including myself felt completely lost even with guidance from office hours. Proof solutions often made sense, but I still don't feel super confident with generating them from the bottom-up on my own. I think the course could be improved by decreasing the pace slightly so all students can keep up. ",
            "\u00a0Very proof heavy, many classes devoted to a single theorem at a time, and very light on applications and actual calculations. Still though, a great introduction to many areas of math. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course! ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong. My one complaint is that tests were very uneven in difficulty, so although I felt very prepared for the final, it was exceedingly more difficult than the midterms and I dont feel it was a correct testament to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that it was a good continuation of 230 and provided more chances to see if proof-based math is the right thing for you. I also feel that I got a very solid background in linear algebra. And of course the community gained from the class is a strength. The weakness is probably that the class got increasingly disorganized and it became harder to follow the class material and connect it to the pset questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a good breadth of knowledge for those curious of mathematics, but it might compromise the level of understanding the student develops as a result. This class has a special focus on learning math through proofs (regardless of whether it is related to the advertised course material or not). Also, the size of the class is not conducive to a good learning environment. It is much to large for questions to be able to be asked effectively and there must be more questions asked. ",
            "\u00a0Continuing on its strength from 230, the course did a great job balancing material presented in class to Psets, helping me develop a strong understanding of the material through the repetitive process. However, I felt that 231 was less structured than 230, and especially as the material started getting harder (like manifolds), there wasn't a corresponding teaching adjustment to make learning easier. ",
            "\u00a0Thus course had great organization, lectures, and assignments. Though there was a lot expected from students, I never felt alone in my struggles and was able to learn from my difficulties. This course might benefit from a separate section to break down the content from lectures outside of class. ",

            "\u00a0This course is awesome in many aspects. The lectures were always well planned and the psets were a lot of fun to do. Pat also proved cool stuff that extends the scope of this course. I also appreciate how Pat gave us advice on what courses to take next year. This course could be improved by having a bigger classroom, as the classroom this semester was way too crammed. Also would appreciate it if there were more individual feedback from Pat. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the instructor, the wide range yet advanced level of topics\r\nWeaknesses: amount of work ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the community, peer tutors, the instructor (Pat), and the challenge of the course. If you were into math in high school, breezed through your math classes, including calc BC, and want a taste of higher level math, this course is for you. It is a lot of work, but you realize it's worth it by the end of it. A weakness of the course is just how much time you have to devote to the psets every week in order to get the most out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the support network available - from Piazza to peers, there is always help available to those who seek it. \r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this course is the lack of a reliable set of notes - the textbook the instructor offers is too dense to parse, and the student-written notes uploaded on Piazza are often full of typos or incomplete. This makes it exceedingly difficult to catch up on material or understand what happened in class a while back. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are incredibly long and challenging, which is a weakness. But the challenge makes you work with other students which creates relationships which is a strength. Some of the lectures seemed improvised and some of the proofs shown were very long, tedious, and uninteresting causing many students to check out, but for the most part they were interesting. I would shorten problem sets by like one question and come up witha more concrete syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Math 231 excels in challenging students, fostering collaboration, and shining light on the inner workings of mathematics. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who's thinking of becoming a math major.\r\nThe only real negative (which is a veiled positive) is that Math 231 engages minimally with actual computation. We learn what integrals are, but do very few of them! Physics students, who need the practical toolset as well as the theoretical one, find this infuriating. Even mathematics students sometimes find their mastery compromised because they never had to multiply lots of matrices or take loads of determinants. Theory is sometimes informed by (even exhausting) practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: problem sets provided a nice intellectual challenge, instructor was very responsive and willing to help when necessary\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were less organized and rigorous, especially compared to MATH 230. Many of the proofs presented in class had certain points where the justification was not provided well. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that this course introduced me to a lot of different types of math. There were a couple times when class became pretty boring because we were doing a bunch of calculus, or Pat spent all of class on one proof that was hard to understand. Some of my favorite parts of the course came when Pat decided to switch things up, giving us exposure to different types of math and new, fresh problems. I think that is probably the best part of this course: we did not do all the identical practice problems a normal calculus class would do. Instead, the psets included some math that was seemingly unrelated to the current course material, but was at least as rewarding as the main work. We did more interesting bits of math (while still rigorously proving things). Thus this class was like an introduction into pure math. I think a big weakness of this course was the amount of work: psets take like 10 hours a week. There is an upside to this, which is that people are forced to work together so you meet a lot of classmates. Overall I'd say it was an excellent course for people who like math for math. Also Piazza was very useful for asking questions and because of the beautifully typed notes someone posted. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class included the engaging and informative problem sets, the cohesiveness of the curriculum, and most prominently the overall spirit of collaboration and learning. The weaknesses were the somewhat difficult and disheartening final two exams and the sometimes confusing lectures. While definitely good to challenge us, I feel like the exams could be more closely modeled after the first one, with maybe one additional challenge problem. And the lectures are generally fun and easy-to-understand, but sometimes with extensive proofs, such as for the chain rule, it was easy to get lost. I think this could be improved by taking more breaks in the longer (compared to first semester) class period and also by having more (forced) student involvement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pat is a great guy, and in theory the math is interesting stuff. Also the peer tutors are amazing. \r\nWeaknesses: Psets were really hard and because we didn't get them back until very, very late in the year I was constantly confused about whether I was doing things right, whether I had learned anything. Lectures could be kind of boring. Also compared to 230, morale was much lower in 231 - less community in the math lounge, less staying up together, more handing psets in late. The tests were A LOT harder compared to 230, which threw us off and also meant we definitely could have benefited from more than 8 review questions for them. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting. One learns about many interesting topics and gains theoretical foundations for the math that you learned in highschool. At times, the class can be a bit slow focusing more on examples and less on new theorems and proofs. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-designed, and interesting. The workload can be high though. ",
            "\u00a0Like 230, the strength of this course lies in the way the problem sets encourage students to delve deeper into concepts discussed in lecture. However, this course felt less structured than 230, and there were times when it was difficult to understand the motivation behind introducing certain topics, and how the different topics connected to each other. The lectures also felt slightly less organized, with the treatment of some topics being significantly more rushed than others. I think that it would help to introduce more structure within the course, perhaps through a week-by-week syllabus that would serve as a roadmap for the lectures and ensure that sufficient time is given to the final topics of the course.

            "\u00a0Yes! Full disclosure: I did 231 credit/D/fail and it improved my enjoyment of the course immensely; I would totally recommend if it's at all possible. You get so much skill in proving math-y things and get a look at what advanced math looks like. Thankfully, the midterms aren't nearly as hard as the psets, so most people end up with pretty good grades. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will fall in love with math and Pat is incredible ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in majoring in a STEM field, as an ideal way to teach how to think critically and carefully and how to construct a logically solid argument. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have any interest in pure math, as it gives you a taste of everything. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone considering this course will have necessarily taken 230, and I wholeheartedly believe that anyone in 230 should take 231. 231 is no harder than 230 and has significantly less difficult psets on average. (Don't get me wrong, however; 231 will still likely be your most work intensive class.) ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was the best class I've taken at Yale. Learned a ton, was inspired to do more math. ",
            "\u00a0Hell yeah! Pat is cool and the stuff on this course are even more cool. After taking 230, you already know about Pat's teaching method. 231 is actually much chill-er than 230. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, especially to students decent at proof-writing/thinking generally (math team kids usually do alright), Pat brings passion and usually great explanations through some dense math ",
            "\u00a0If you want a challenging math course, take it. You might not understand everything that goes on. But the exposure to proofs and more rigorous mathematics is worth the time and effort. If you're on the edge of being a math major or not, I think this course could help you decide. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they enjoy collaborative logic puzzles and are interested in a broad survey of math. No if they want a mechanically/practically focused course or if they are not willing/able to put in over a dozen hours of work a week. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly advise a student not to take this course unless they have a strong background in writing proofs or interpreting proof based math. Unlike 230 where I think many can get by without having a good background in proof writing, in 231 many classes devolved into frantic writing down of long proofs which took a while to digest. As a student with a much more computational math background (as a good amount of students in the class were) I often found myself taking a lot more time to digest and understand the material and felt at a strong disadvantage to students who had proof writing background in high school or who have already taken proof based linear or multi in high school. I feel overall this is incredibly hard class to teach because every student in the room is very bright but some students have been afforded much more experience in proof writing and Lin alg./multi proofs whereas other students were taking the courses for there first time or had never taken a proof based class before. As a result the teacher often has to decide who to teach to as teaching at a slower pace would put us at risk of not covering all the material and also leaving many more advanced students bored whereas moving at a fast pace left a lot of students confused or lost but satisfied a few bored students. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are willing to put in the work to really understand the material. The course will definitely challenge you. Whether or not you mature well as a mathematician well depend on how you approach the difficult material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The 230/231 sequence gives an excellent introduction to proof-based math as well as math in general, and Pats enthusiasm and quirkiness make the class interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Pats a great instructor and the course material is very fun. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: If you're planning to be a math major, it's a must-take. It'll tell you if the subject is right for you, what you need to improve on, if you vibe with the math department and the people. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: If you're not planning to be a math major, DO NOT take this course. I completely regret taking this sequence and I wish I had dropped first semester. I needed to fulfill the linear algebra and multivariable requisites for S&DS, but I wish I did so in a less life-draining and time-consuming way. I'll never, ever forget how I felt all of those Friday mornings first semester and Thursday mornings second semester after frustrating nights in the math lounge trying to finish psets. When it was raining out or freezing cold and I could have been sleeping or talking to friends or studying for classes I had genuine passion for. It was just a mistake.\r\n\r\nSomehow the workload of this class is discussed in a glorifying sense, as if through trial-by-fire we will emerge as budding mathematicians or at least as students who have grown tremendously and are truly ready to approach the rest of their Yale career. I wish I could say the same about myself. I know I put a lot into it, definitely more than I put into all of my other classes combined (I mean that in a truly literal sense), but somehow I don't feel like I've grown in any meaningful sense. The workload was just a pain. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a first year at Yale and you are interested in the math major, or at least in a more serious study in mathematics and learning about proofwriting, etc., then yes. Definitely take 230 and 231. If you took 230, unless you absolutely hated it, take 231 as well, as 230 is worthless on its own. \r\n\r\nHowever, especially if you're reading this as a first year math major before choosing your fall semester classes: IF YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS CLASS, CONSIDER TAKING A SECOND MATH CLASS ON TOP OF IT. I came in quite well-prepared with proofwriting and found 230 both underwhelming and disorganized. I really did not feel challenged at all. When the fall came around, most of the cool math classes weren't available to me because I didn't take the beginning of the sequence in the fall. 230/231 might be great for students without a hardcore math background, but if you've excelled in competitions in the past, for example, even though you should still take 230/231, you should consider for example Abstract Algebra or other math classes so that you don't feel underwhelmed. Please, shop math classes! Do what's best for you! Learn from my mistakes! And if you don't want to/can't do Abstract Algebra, that's fine! Just take 230 and you'll still be in for a great challenge. \r\n\r\nJust don't take it at face value that it's the one and only math class you should take as an incoming stem student. Especially if you want to learn computational multivariable calculus, this class is barely useful. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course because I had taken 230, and because not taking 231 after 230 puts you in an awkward spot if you want to major in math/applied/relevant majors. I didn't find myself genuinely interested in the material or particularly eager to learn/put in the work that this class requires.  That being said, I don't regret taking this class because I think among Yale math courses it is a pretty solid option - grading is not too bad, and you'll make a lot of friends. This semester there were also less psets than the last, and I found them taking up less time as well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you are interested in majoring in math and are reasonably strong in math. Don't just take it because you always took the hardest math class and want to continue doing so, otherwise you may be caught off guard and have to put in lots and lots of time. Also proof-based math may not be that useful if you aren't majoring in math/physics, so that is something to keep in mind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Anyone considering taking this has presumably already taken Math 230, and not taking 231 is a mistake since you miss half the intended information. Math 231 contains the really interesting and cool material of linear algebra, as well as the juicy parts of calculus. If you are worried about 231 because you didn't enjoy the analysis or super precise material of the previous course, 231 will be better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. \r\nI don't think I can honestly say that I enjoyed doing the work for 231, especially in the middle portion of the semester, but it was a fantastic experience. You meet great people, learn how to work, learn how to think, and learn how you feel about math. ",

However, keep in mind that the course is a little unorganized, as in what Pat teaches literally depends on what he feels like teaching that day, so if you're a engineering or physics student like I am, then you might study practical maths better if you take MATH120. With that said, I feel like this course made me like maths, although this course was a massive pain in the bottom. ",

Peer Help hours are crucial to finishing problem sets, but beware of the not so helpful tutors. ",

This class is certainly not for those who think there is prestige involved in taking it - they will be humbled immediately by proof en-masse. ",

It will challenge you like nothing else, and reward you like nothing else, bypassing \"formula memorization\" for real comprehensive understanding.  \r\nThe only caveat comes for those who care more about the practice than the theory, and are more interested in evaluating integrals than appreciating their theoretical basis.
