            "\u00a0I reviewed most of French grammar, watched films, and read novels in French. I also improved my French essay-writing skills and pronunciation. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot through reading literature/plays, developed writing abilities, and strengthened vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I built on my preexisting French grammar and literary analysis, and also improved my conversational and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my French reading, writing, and grammar. The oral exams were excellent speaking practice. My vocabulary expanded greatly as well! "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Loved the movies, made me appreciate French cinema all the more and got me engaged in class discussions/essays\r\n-Although tedious, the review of grammar was very helpful\r\n-The 6-person seminar worked really well with my learning style\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I see no reason why we read/watched Tous les matins du monde. I did not enjoy this at all, did not learn anything about French culture, and none of our class discussions went into any in-depth analysis... not to mention the extremely sexually explicit film, which brought no value\r\n-The grammar homework was often too long, became \"busy work\" ",
            "\u00a0This course provided plenty of opportunities for participation and speaking practice, as well as growth of vocabulary and literary analysis. The weakest point of the course is that we did not spend much time on grammar concepts in class, even though most of the tests were made up of grammar. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized and though it could be a lot of work at times, the worksheets are helpful and the readings/films interesting. "

            "\u00a0Yes! French is an amazing language, and L5 brings all the benefits of a foreign class without much of the difficulty. It is a great reinforcement of your previous knowledge, presented in an interesting way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is invested in taking French, because it is a lot of work and definitely not an easy 5th class that you can tack onto your schedule. If you've just taken L4 and are on the fence about continuing, shop the class but be prepared for some fairly stressful experiences if you stay in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved having Professor Vysosias and had an excellent group of peers in my class. Class was always enjoyable! "
