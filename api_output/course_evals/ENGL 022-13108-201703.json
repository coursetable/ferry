            "\u00a0A greater respect for grief. More specifically a psychological acceptance of the usefulness of grief and the methods of dealing with loss and trauma. Deeper ability to textually analyze, greater understanding of 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries ",
            "\u00a0I learned some strategies for reading poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I developed a better understanding of mourning and sadness. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about reading and analyzing poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look more critically at grief poetry and elegy and how they are employed by a wide host of authors to convey different perspectives and meanings. I also feel like I was exposed to a great variety of writing from different authors with different styles through all sorts of historical contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me think about death and loss in so many different ways. I found myself mulling over the topic often outside of class, and was always really fascinated with our discussions of these subjects. Since we're all going to die and we're all going to have people in our life die, I think it's something that should be talked about, and this was such a beautiful and thought provoking way to do so. Additionally, after some time away from it, I really got back into reading poetry again, and was inspired by the texts that we were reading. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the elegaic tradition and gained insight to analyze and appreciate elegies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze books and write better essays. I really think my writing improve through this class. ",
            "\u00a0Deep appreciation for elegy and its cultural implications ",
            "\u00a0The Art of Losing helped me learn how to read poems of different forms and from different eras. It also taught me lots of interesting historical information about how people have mourned throughout time. Our field trips to places like the art gallery were very enlightening. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The readings in the class were very interesting and managed to keep me engaged all semester. The discussions were also thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0The course material did not follow what was described in YCPS.  It ended up being all poetry, especially elegy, which was not what I expected based on the erroneous course description. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course name misleading; thought it would be about losing a game or overcoming (general) hardships, turned out to be about the aesthetics and process of mourning. \r\n\r\nI would have preferred more opportunities to discuss things with my peers in small groups. I did not like that class discussion was mostly conducted as one large group. \r\n\r\nI do not think my writing improved much because the feedback I received on my assignments wasn't very clear or detailed. ",
            "\u00a0This course had strong teaching and great source material. I loved the way class was so discussion based. I really enjoyed the class visits to museums and other locations around Yale that had relevant material. I have no real complaints about this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the variation of the material looked at and the professor was just always so engaging and fun in the classroom setting. She really made the class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Levine did a wonderful job in designing our curriculum and classes, so the material we were working with and learning from always had a lot of variety (in terms of time period, style, culture, subject... everything). She shook up the class by introducing things like films, art, relics, and even a visit to the cemetery, which kept the learning process fresh and exciting. The way the reading responses and papers are designed allows for students to follow their own interests and have a great deal of choice and agency in choosing topics. \r\n\r\nI didn't think that the ghost stories were really necessary or beneficial the course. Other than that, though, I can't really think of any weaknesses. I would take this exact same course again. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it could have been more rigorous, but I really enjoyed the pace of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Deeply enjoyed, strengths: openness for different interpretations and all questions ",
            "\u00a0I loved every reading that Professor Levine chose for this course. We read a healthy mix of poems from multiple eras and perspectives; some of these poems shed light on the experiences of marginalized people and their experiences of sexism, racism, homophobia, etc., which I believed to be important. I also liked the incorporation of history lessons into the course and the emphasis on learning about writers' lives so we can understand them and their work better. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other Yale students, especially if they're looking for an English class that will teach them something new about poetry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course because of the professor and the critical thinking and constant excitement of the classroom. You just have to have a heart for the more morbid subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would. It's a really engaging, thought provoking, and well designed seminar. I learned a lot. ",
