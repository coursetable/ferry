            "\u00a0I read foundational texts on Zen theory and Zen practice, and we discussed the essential tensions that have shaped Zen throughout history. Specifically, I learned to put religious practices and literature into dialogue and to analyze important questions about religions. ",
            "\u00a0Reading primary texts and thinking critically about them, thinking critically about how my associations with Zen Buddhism and Western cultures ",
            "\u00a0The student gave a \"shout\"\r\n\r\nBut what skills and insights? Can you name them?\r\n\r\nWatch out. I have a fly whisk. \r\n\r\n(These are all good things, take the class to learn more. Beware the Zen Master). ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of Buddhism and ways to approach thinking about religion in a critical way. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in depth overview of Zen Buddhism. ",
            "\u00a0This course changed the way I thought not only about religion, but Eastern culture as a whole. It also challenged me to question Western notions about life, death, and everything they entail. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that there is much to be taken away from cultures and ways of life that are very far away from yours. Through taking this course, my understanding of Zen life has helped me in my everyday life, being able to apply some of the principles to help better myself. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to write analytically and succinctly, a deeper knowledge of Zen Buddhism and its influences in modern culture, and a greater willingness to discuss with peers about the content with clarity. "

            "\u00a0The weekly seminar format was a welcome change of pace from other courses I had taken, and Professor Greene did an excellent job leading the discussions in a way that was inclusive to everyone's ideas. I would've loved -- actually -- if signing up for a  15-minute office hours session was mandatory around the 1/3 semester mark, and we had a chance to explore our ideas for essays earlier on, and to talk about the interesting / confusing aspects of Zen. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting subject, good structure to the course and class, good discussions, good ordering of topics. Weaknesses: readings were unnecessarily long at times, would have liked to talk more about Zen in the west and modern Zen, essay feedback didn't give specific things to improve on ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the level of reading, the weekly papers, and the class discussions. I think the course might have benefitted from a bit more direction at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: well-organized in terms of overall structure, engaging and knowledgable professor\r\nWeaknesses: I wish I'd gotten to know the other students more ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the information presented in this course is difficult to understand at first, and thorough examination of it often leads to more confusion. Unfortunately, the course was presented in such a way that it wasn't always led by the professor, instead leaving confused students discussing ideas that don't make sense, leading to further confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Topics are interesting, valuable readings\r\nWeakness: spend more time on actual Zen ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the content was very effective. The readings for each week were interesting and different from the last week and gave a substantial introduction to the topic. \r\n\r\nDiscussion could be improved significantly. Often it became difficult to have a good conversation in class. I think this is partially due to the number of students in the class. It seemed a bit too large for discussion to flow properly. Also, I would have preferred for Professor Greene to give more feedback on the weekly essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well designed and I truly enjoyed writing the weekly essays that corresponded with the readings. One weakness, perhaps, was the lack of a course packet. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course come through the required texts that are assigned every week. The order in which we read each text created a solid  understanding of the history of Zen so that we could make our own arguments about the later texts coming into more modern times. I also enjoyed the discussions as the class had fascinating interpretations and insights to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. It has made me reflect on the way I live my life and how it impacts other people around me on a deeper level. I think the only thing I would improve about this course is to decrease the seminar size so that everyone gets a chance to speak about their thoughts. Otherwise, this is an amazing course! "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in Zen. It might be more difficult for people, actually, with strong pre-conceptions about Zen who aren't willing to adjust their framework, but on the whole, I found the class intellectually rewarding and spiritually satisfying. A fun point: when your friends ask: \"So what is Zen all about?\" you will not be able to answer them succinctly. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student but warn them that the readings are lengthy and class felt a bit slow on Friday afternoons at times. Most of the discussions were philosophical and made me think about things in a new way, but some of the topics felt repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course and you will not regret it. This is one of the only once-weekly classes I've taken where I felt truly engaged by the material and class structure. It was a beautiful part of my Fridays and I learned a lot--you will too! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great intro religious studies course! ",
            "\u00a0If the course were changed to either be a lecture or more professor-led, I would absolutely recommend this course to others. As it stands now, however, I would not. ",
            "\u00a0yes. readings were very interesting and professor greene gives a good introduction to zen buddhism. The weekly essays force you to think about what you're reading critically. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! Professor Greene is very engaging and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about a completely different way of life and how it came into such established tradition, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, of course! This course will certainly make you think outside of the box and philosophically about religions and your own life! "
