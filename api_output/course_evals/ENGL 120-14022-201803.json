            "\u00a0I have always been poor at creative writing. Through this course, I was able to gain insight on how many writers develop their story, and the overall format that some writers use. Through it, I was able to develop a better sense of how to write. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about channeling different voices, the writing process, how to write (the short answer is to just do it), how to think about writing and language, and how to write with concentric circles of meaning. I loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely became a better writer, and in some ways, a more sensible human being as well. This course allowed me to become someone much more sensitive to details and introspective thought than I was at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped my writing skills tremendously. My word choice improved so much. "

            "\u00a0I really like how pinpoint the advise given to us on revisions were. I think it was helpful in allowing me to better understand how to improve my writing. I also liked the way discussions were run where there was a certain amount of time dedicated towards each passage. I would like to have a reading that we would have during class so that we can in depth dissect essays and then apply it to our own papers at each section where we have to write a different paper. ",
            "\u00a0The course, especially as it is taught by Professor Stuart, is very strong. You read a lot of amaizng, diverse, beautiful essays focussing on a certain subject or genre, and then you write essays in he same subject. Its great because you can draw inspiration from world class pieces while still thinking f about how to make it your own. You learn a lot about putting your voice into and how to stray away from typical, boring, lifeless analytical essays. You learn how to infuse your essays with heart and soul. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing. The feedback and availability provided by the professor is amazing. The texts in the course are AMAZING. I felt no weaknesses and I would wholeheartedly reccommend this class to any and everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I loved everything about this course. The only thing I would improve is the feedback aspect. If you want to get the clearest feedback, you should go to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that each topic that we explored did not enable us to improve our writing because each topic was different. "

            "\u00a0This course was great. You really do learn how to write, if with the right teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it helped me gain more insight on writing and improve my ability to write, so it would be a great course for other students to take as well if they also wish to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this  course to anyone who wants to get better at creative writing and who wants to read some amazing essays while talking about them in a close seminar emvironment. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it! It allowed me to grow both academically and personally, and provided a challenge that I believe helped me to ultimately adjust to this institution. ",
