            "\u00a0I wish there had been more music theory, and more examination of our final project choice before we had to implement it. ",
            "\u00a0I think a little more attention could be paid to students who are not familiar with working in the CEID. ",
            "\u00a0This course has two distinct parts. First, we learn acoustics and do problem sets calculating various properties and modes of vibrating objects. Then, we build an instrument. Both were well organized and polished. Perhaps the early problem sets were a little over-long and tedious, but the material covered was new and interesting to any engineers or physicists with an interest in music. Building the instrument was f-ing awesome. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to a musician interested in physics, engineering, or computing, but not someone lacking a significant background in one of these. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! However, the final project is a lot of work, and it's best to not do it with students who are taking the course pass/fail ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Definitely gets to be a bit more work toward the end, but if you put in a lot of effort it really pays off. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it! If you are physics or engineering person who also loves music this course will make your semester. Building your own instrument is an amazing experience that works really well in 2-3 person groups. Be prepared for very long days in the ceid during the last two weeks of the semester, but you'll want to be there to make your instrument perfect. Larry seems to live in the ceid during this period and he provides real, practical help and guidance. He will sit down and solder something for you if you can't get it right. He will order any part you ask for, no questions asked, with express shipping. We were able to make some really fantastic instruments because of his support. "
