            "\u00a0I finally learned the ins and outs of the French Revolution for real! I'd always been given a cursory glance of it in high school classes and other Yale courses, but it was so rewarding to finally REALLY learn it with a professor as great as Merriman. I think he also picked a super interesting time frame for the course, since we didn't just learn about the first Revolution everyone talked about, and learned about how the revolutions continued, much past 1848.

            "\u00a0Strengths - lectures were super engaging and interesting, Professor Merriman is a super awesome lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman has assigned some truly great texts, but sadly, there is no real way to read all of them if you are taking a full courseload. In terms of output, there is only one major assignment outside of the exams, which was really nice for someone whose other classes were quite writing-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is a dynamic lecturer, but his lectures could be hard to follow sometimes, which made studying for the midterm and final harder. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of fun to take if you have an interest in history. Because the class covers such a narrow time frame, you learn a lot that you wouldn't in a much broader course. The course is also not a lot of work, and the lectures are made entertaining by Merriman's stories and friendly demeanor. The class also has an oral final exam which is just a 20 minute conversation with one of the TA's- this was a nice break from the rest of finals period and was definitely more enjoyable than spending 3 hours writing essays. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, the course sometimes felt a bit disorganized and many of the requirements weren't super clear. For me this didn't make a big difference because the course wasn't my top priority this semester, but if you care a lot about planning ahead this course might frustrate you. ",
            "\u00a0This course is super amazing. I really enjoyed taking it. I love French history in general and Professor Merriman really taught me a lot I didn't know. It can go off on tangents at times, but overall he teaches you a lot of life skills along the way. ",
            "\u00a0During lecture it sometimes felt as if material wasnt covered, and with stories being told all the time, it was difficult to contextualize things sometimes. \r\n\r\nThe course overall though was super engaging and interesting ",
            "\u00a0I liked both of the textbooks we used and the three novels we read (two of which were primary sources of Zola and Balzac). I would have loved more primary source reading, personally. One big strength was the reading. I rarely enjoy reading for a history class and mostly take them for the great seminars/lectures, but these readings I really enjoyed (maybe just because I love French history). Lecture was a huge highlight of the class. Prof Merriman is a legend for a reason. He sort of consciously avoids repeating anything from the reading, and instead lecture is like adult story time where Prof Merriman tells you all the weird little tidbits he's learned from studying France so closely for so long. He goes on these fun rambles that you just need to be okay enjoying. I think the people who didn't like this class were the ones too focused on having a super coherent lecture that mirrored the readingswith Prof Merriman, don't panic if he goes off the beaten path a bit; that's part of the fun! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Topic itself is inherently fascinating. Merriman is extremely engaging in lecture, and he actually cares/recognizes when you attend lectures despite it being a bigger lecture. The keyword/big picture emails+Canvas updates before lecture were actually stupidly important. The TAs are fantastic, all of them. The paper allows you to explore something you're interested in. The class isn't an insane amount of work but you get out even more than you put in. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Honestly not a ton of weaknesses besides disorganization/lack of syllabus adherence. I can work with some freewheeling, but we were supposed to watch 2 (maybe 3?) movies over the semester which we never got to doing, lectures got shuffled around, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a very interesting period in French history. The lectures are engaging, though they can meander. The exams are straightforward and very doable. Sections supplemented the material well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include Professor Merriman, the material itself, and a History of Modern Europe (his textbook). It's a lifesaver for putting the sometimes segmented lectures together. Professor Merriman is a Yale gem and I haven't found a better lecturer at this school. Be prepared for a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman was not a focused lecturer. While obviously knowledgeable, he seemed to be all over the place during lectures and could do better if he had a tighter control over his material. ",

            "\u00a0The readings are superb. Merriman's texts and the novels were great forays into the material. His lectures, on the other hand, were pretty much hit or miss. Sometimes they were incredibly engaging but oftentimes all over the place. Unless you go to office hours for the TF or Merriman, you'll have to rely heavily on the readings since his lectures often turn into tangential stories. ",

            "\u00a0TERRIBLE LECTURES--honestly some of the worst I've taken at Yale. Readings were often tangential to the material and were terribly spaced throughout the course: one week, we'd read ten pages of some secondary source about Napoleon, and the next we would be assigned an entire 450-page book written in 1877 (L'Assommoir). Sections were not very useful, but judging from conversations with the TFs that was only because Merriman gave them no guidance on what to cover each week. And if you're thinking the TFs should have known from what Merriman went over in lecture, you ought to attend one of his lectures; no one has any clue what he's talking about, and it's a complete mess. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating material, Professor Merriman (though he's not for everyone), had a fantastic TA, light reading load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized (that's just Professor Merriman though, he's a fantastic professor), odd assignments (every now and then Merriman would assign a novel to read that no one actually read) ",
            "\u00a0The course material is interesting but the lectures are hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved Professor Merriman's storytelling. He makes lectures very engaging to listen to both with his presentation of the historical content but also with his fun commentary about French culture. Also, the paper is kind of fun to write because you are given so much leeway with regards to picking a topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that sections did not contribute much at all to this class. My TF was great and helped us contextualize the information with discussions about art, architecture, and literature, but from talking to other people also taking this class, this was not the case in all sections. TFs had very different ideas of how to conduct sections, with varying results. ",
            "\u00a0While most of the material was very interesting, I don't think the course did a good job explaining why 18th French history was important. I was left wondering: how should we apply our understanding of this period to contemporary politics? How does this course relate to other disciplines, subjects, and our larger liberal arts education? Why does any of this matter? ",

            "\u00a0Merriman is so friendly/sweet but hard to follow as a lecturer. He clearly knows so much and cares so much, but he almost has too many stories, and so you lose the thread of the actual history he is trying to teach. Most of what I learned was through googling. Because of this, studying for the tests-- which would be easy if class notes were sufficient-- took extra work. ",
            "\u00a0Great that bullet points for lecture are sent out before, and Merriman's lecture style is fun and engaging. ",

            "\u00a0The material was overall very relevant and interesting. Professor Merriman is an expert in the field of French history and he was successfully able to share his knowledge in a clear and digestible way. The readings were also in the most part interesting, and they allowed students to get a real sense of what was happening in France/Europe during the discussed timeframe. I think the course lacked a bit of structure at times: we were never really sure what was expected of us on exams/assignments, and lectures were sometimes scattered. I would simply recommend adding a layer of structure and making clear how we should improve. But Professor Merriman is notoriously anti-system, so I doubt much will change :) ",

            "\u00a0This course was strong. I think the lists of course terms for each lecture was helpful, although maybe these documents could have more structure. The final paper crept up on everyone, so maybe it would be useful to require a draft or proposal due in the middle of the semester. The course overall was great! ",
            "\u00a0Lecture could be a bit rambling. It would be helpful if we got scans of the textbook readings from the library. ",

Between lecture, section, and the books, students had many resources to call on to reinforce their learning. In terms of books, the second half of the class did not offer resources that were as helpful unfortunately. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong course. Could perhaps be given a little more time to do the three big readings. Other than that, very good course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, French history in this period is intrinsically interesting, and Professor Merriman's lectures are generally fun. However, the difficulty of the class may sneak up if you don't do the readings or take good lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely- it was not a lot of work, and the lectures were entertaining and you learn a lot of interesting things if you pay attention. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - take it! Merriman is a great professor (as long as you learn to enjoy his rambling), and has a lot of great anecdotes and insights into French history. The workload isn't bad either (midterm, essay, and verbal final exam). It pairs well with his European Civ lecture, so don't be afraid to take this if you've already taken a course with him. Knowing some European history (whether from AP Euro or elsewhere) might be helpful, especially at the beginning of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great history course! If you are not super interested in history, this is a great class for you as well because it has interesting material that people would have fun learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would not unless it changed. The content is interesting but the class is highly disorganized to the point where it becomes a lot more challenging to do well than it should be. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Merriman is a fantastic professor and I would recommend his courses to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. All of Merriman's lectures are a fun and wild ride, but I think this one is a particular gem, mostly because the French Revolution is just so cool to learn about. It's like dramatic reality TV before there was reality TV. A few things to note: Merriman lectures about whatever he thinks is cool and NOT the reading really so you need to be independent in that regard, sometimes he rambles and it gets confusing but everything he says is super cool, this is one of those awful finals periods classes that has a paper due the last week of class and then a final so keep that in mind when planning your life. The course felt backloaded in terms of work because all we had early in the semester was the midterm. Also, there is an optional oral final exam that I personally loved, because you wrap up the class by studying the important points and then talking about them with a TF. My oral exam was difficult personally, because the TF sort of grilled me, but for a lot of my friends it was super super chill. Just be sure you really know the material (you get the questions ahead of time) and be prepared for a little back and forth with the TF once you answer the question. This was my favorite class this semester, mostly because I personally like Prof Merriman's style, but mostly because I love this period of French history and it's something I've always really wanted to know about. So I think during shopping period, gauge if you are up for the professor's kookiness and also ask yourself if you are really interested in this area of French history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I thoroughly enjoyed learning about French history and I really enjoyed getting to know Merriman. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Whether or not you're interested in the content (American History focus in the History department here, to be frank I couldn't care less about France), Merriman is an icon. The lectures aren't always relevant to the midterm/final, but the broader themes he talks about during lecture and obscure facts do occasionally pop up on the midterm/final.\r\n\r\nMerriman also tends to rant sometimes and go off on tangents. Merriman is one of, if not the, most engaging professors at all of Yale when he just goes off on a tangent -- his speeches about his friends' weddings, the Yale alumni cruises, his time in Catholic school in Oregon, his time in the archives in France, the time he was a diehard Communist (don't worry, he still is too), comments on the current state of America and France (currently, the Yellow Vest protests are going on in France, he had some interesting thoughts), and more are seriously legendary/memorable and you get just as much out of those as you do from the stuff he says. \r\n\r\nI recommend taking this class for 1) a funny, engaging lecture with a legend in his field and 2) a relatively low commitment course. If you take this course, GO TO LECTURES. Short of you having a midterm/final the same day, go to all the lectures -- it's worth it, even though ~1/3-1/2 the class will stop going after the midterm. He's worth it. The TAs are great too (but that varies year to year I'm sure). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting and Professor Merriman is an engaging lecturer who clearly knows his stuff. ",
            "\u00a0It's a terrific course. Regrettably the oversubscription made the class a little less personal, but still Professor Merriman is a Yale gem and the material is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it if you're interested in the French revolutionary period, and, even then, I'm sure you might find other courses which can deal with this same content in a better fashion. I wouldn't recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Wouldn't necessarily recommend the course if you're looking for an intellectual challenge or structured class. But it wasn't too much work ",
            "\u00a0Ya. It's not a bad course. Great for a fifth spot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fun and easy overview of Revolutionary French history. ",
            "\u00a0yes, because the lectures were fun and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Nope. Disorganized lectures and irrelevant readings led to me learn most of what I needed to know for exams from Wikipedia. In my book, that means it's a bad class. Don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0I was extremely disappointed with this course, especially after having generally enjoyed Merriman's lecture course on European History. It requires almost no effort or engagement to do well. The grade is a midterm (if you study the terms sheet it's easy), final (the questions are given beforehand with an oral option), and 8 page paper on a topic of your choice. The first half is actually interesting if you know little about the French Revolution and Napoloen. But from about 1815 onward, you learn almost nothing besides the names of the most important leaders and the couple relevant regime changes. I think you could summarize the entire second half of the course in about 15 minutes. And Merriman's lectures, which are already extremely disjointed and tangential really go off the rails here. He's completely unstructured and nearly impossible to follow in class, and so I often left frustrated. Really disappointing class taught by someone who can be so interesting. There are much better history classes to take at Yale, don't waste your time. ",
            "\u00a0would recommend because merriman is an awesome professor, and the material is easy to understand. Good for non-history majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a fun and laid-back course, easy to do well in it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, learning from Professor Merriman is an opportunity you shouldn't pass up. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class: incredible professor, interesting topics, light workload, lenient and fair grading. Fair warning: Professor Merriman takes a little getting used to. He is clearly a true expert and knows everything, though his lectures can be pretty disorganized and he goes on lots of tangents about his various trips to France, how much he drinks at various bars, and how many failed weddings he has been the best man at. His style just takes a little to get used to. He's incredibly entertaining, always made me laugh like 10 times a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because of how interesting the material is and how important French history during this time period is to understanding historical events later on. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student who wants to attend fun lectures and get to know Professor Merriman's eccentric personality and style of teaching. His passion for the subject really shines through in his lectures, which is wonderful. He's also a funny person.\r\n\r\nHowever, the readings only really supplement the class (and I felt that some were overkill) and section feels like a waste of time. That said I took this class Credit/D/Fail so it was a lower commitment to me than my classmates. \r\n\r\nOverall I would recommend it, but sometimes the syllabus feels a little irrelevant or illogical as Professor Merriman will just take things his own way (which isn't a bad thing). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The workload is definitely manageable, and I learned a great deal about a very interesting time period. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it - learning from Merriman during lecture is a pretty cool experience even though you have to put up with him being scattered or unclear sometimes. The period of history is also very interesting. The oral final exam was a great experience - much better than a written final could ever have been. ",
            "\u00a0I most definitely would recommend this course to another student because of the energetic nature of Professor Merriman and the knowledgable TAs he brings along with him. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the topic, definitely take it. I took this class mainly because I needed a humanities credit and I wanted to take a class with Professor Merriman. He is THE BEST - his passion for the material is contagious and his lectures include a lot of stories which keep it interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you are interested in France or need a pre-industrial credit for history. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Merriman clearly is passionate about his material, but I'm unsure if looking back I would have taken this course as opposed to another lecture. I didn't get much from it. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Great European history course taught by a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely a mixed bag. It really depends on the TA you get - my TA was totally lovely and so awesome. I would say the hardest parts of it are the midterm and the paper. For the midterm exam, you need to have done all the reading and paid attention very closely in class. For the final, it's a bit easier, because you get given the questions beforehand and can prepare as much as you want. In this class we had to read a ton of books - tbh like no one reads them. The class was full of the typical \"party crowd\" and finance kids, but many realized a few weeks in that the course really isn't as easy as expected. ",
            "\u00a0not a gut, oral final was harder than made out to be and didnt cover lots of course material. midterm fucked everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Good history credit, if you have done well in other history classes you will do well in this class. It can be a bit boring at times. Yeah ",
            "\u00a0It's an alright class for learning about France but very disorganized and that makes it harder to learn the info ",
            "\u00a0I took this credit-d and I think it was a great class to do that for because I could go to Professor Merriman's very interesting and engaging lectures, but I didn't have to worry too much about keeping up with the readings. That being said the midterm was fairly difficult and included relatively obscure questions but then the final was extremely fair and straightforward. And then we just had to write one 7-10 page paper which is also totally reasonable. Overall, I found the class to be quite interesting because I had almost no knowledge of 19th century French history, but that period is fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0Yes-very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Rambling lectures but kind and passionate lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is an interesting lecturer. Take it purely because of his wild stories and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It was relatively low stress and very interesting, especially to people who are interested in European history. I was lucky to have Maggie as a section leader because she is really brilliant and helped us make very solid timelines, which helped with the tests. ",
            "\u00a0Decent way to get a HU credit ",

            "\u00a0Yes, but be ready to throw yourself into the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it has a light course load and is about an interesting subject that a lot of people know little about. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're really interested in France  if you aren't, and take it as just another history course, it may not interest you as much as you had thought. Low reading and workload, and Merriman's lectures are entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in French history or seeks a class that is somewhat relaxed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because French history is so interesting. The class is relaxing yet still intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's definitely a lighter history course but it was fun and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Fantastic way to learn about the history of France. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student trying to build a deeper foundation in their historical knowledge. ",
