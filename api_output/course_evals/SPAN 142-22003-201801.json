            "\u00a0This course helped me develop competence and confidence in my ability to speak Spanish along with learning the best ways in which to maintain that competence. I also learned a lot about being a heritage speaker and how much my Spanish heritage is dependent on my ability to keep it alive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Latin American culture and Spanish grammar. More importantly, the class allows for serious introspection in regards to one's identity and connection to one's heritage. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of vocabulary and grammar structures. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable with my Spanish, speaking, writing and reading. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak my first language with more confidence, better pronunciation, and more accuracy. I also learned to verbalize the intuitions I had about sentence structure and word use, and I also learned new, useful information that will help me better communicate. Alexandrov does a fantastic job explaining using clear examples with the right amount of humor. ",
            "\u00a0Span 142 was a great class for me to take, as I have grown up hearing, understanding, and colloquially speaking Spanish but never truly learned the language formally.  It was a good pace for the level of students in the class, though I did find it a but difficult, as I felt I came in a bit behind everyone else. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish grammar and fluidity and the confidence to speak well. ",
            "\u00a0I heavily improved my grammar  and learned about many different cultures. I learned how to best express myself orally in Spanish but also that it is important to recognize my heritage and how Spanish is spoken in my heritage country. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to connect with my culture and its native language to gain a deeper understanding of my roots. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned more about various Spanish speaking cultures besides my own through the heritage program. There is a greater variety within the language that I known about but had never been exposed to until this course. I was more conscious about my pronunciation, accent, and cultural perspective. "

            "\u00a0This was the most organized and easy to follow course that I have ever taken. The professor made it so that everyday we knew what to expect to learn, how to prepare for it, and what to do to practice afterword. I do not believe there is anything to improve with this course. The professor kept up with our weaknesses and was able to adapt the course to our needs. ",
            "\u00a0I find no weaknesses with this course. The mains strength is its flexibility  if there's a topic which everyone struggles with, then an extra class or two is allocated to perfecting it. ",
            "\u00a0It was well-designed for students who know some Spanish from home but not school. Brought together a lot of people who perceive their heritage language in a similar way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class was pretty small so the learning felt more tailored to our needs\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the class were taught daily so the heavy workload would be more spread out during the week. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness was that homework was declared with just a little too short notice. ",
            "\u00a0Poor weight distribution of areas, too many assignments that don't seem to have a lot of meaning behind them, not enough speaking in class (perhaps due to size of class) ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught well, however, I feel like the class could be more improved through more work in a single medium that can be referred to. I really liked the Spanish workbook however we did not refer to it as much as I would have liked to. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Alexandrov makes the course - she is so dedicated. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well oriented towards native speakers and not only allows for us to individually grow in our skills but leaves room for error as well. The course included interesting reading material ,movies, and helpful homework. One thing that could be improved is the time we spend on each section  maybe by spending less time on certain subjects we can have more time to explore more histories and culttures. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of assignments but they all lead to a greater engagement that served a purpose whether it was grammatical or analytical. It caused students to think in the language beyond the basic level that we typically do. \r\nIn terms of improvement there was a greater focus on Spain instead of Southern American and Mexican history and Spanish. The scope of the class  could be wider beyond what the students present in their projects. "

            "\u00a0I would! Professor Alexandrov was incredible! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely encourage any heritage Spanish speaker to take this course, Professor Alexandrov was able to make me confident and competent with my Spanish and I will always work to improve myself afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any Spanish heritage speaker, especially those who never formally studied Spanish. The class size allows for meaningful discussions and connections. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to another heritage speaker. Being in a heritage language class is an awesome experience because everyone around you understands the language similarly to you, such as knowing that a certain grammatical structure but not knowing why. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an incredible course for improving your languages skills and is enjoyable and interesting at the same time in the material that you engage with through the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Heritage for Spanish speakers to other students because you get to learn in an environment suited for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend if you have trouble getting our ideas out in Spanish but can hold a simple conversation. This class did wonders for my writing, too. I can actually write a well structured and nuanced essay in my own language now, which is great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes if youre looking to improve your spanish, most definitely. The more seriously you take the course the more youll get out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a heritage speaker, please take this course. The material is clearly guided to adjust to your specific needs  whether its more grammar or more speaking practice. The class environment makes you feel comfortable speaking Spanish, even if you make mistakes. But more important, Professora Sybil is a great instructor who gives clear feedback and is always willing to help you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course  especially if the student is looking to not only improve their Spanish but grasp a stronger appreciation for Latin culture. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this class required you to be aware not only of your own skills but those of others and created a collaborative and friendly environment. Not only is the teacher supportive but also are your fellow peers and you constantly receive very helpful feedback. "
