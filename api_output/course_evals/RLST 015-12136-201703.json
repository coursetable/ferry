            "\u00a0In this class, I had the chance to (and did) develop a working understanding of different ideologies present in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. I think that  the biggest insight I developed is that the religious texts in these religions actually contradict each other on many levels, so forging a complete understanding of all three religions (let alone just one), is quite difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to look at religious texts objectively, analyze them effectively, and compare and contrast them with each other, giving me a deeper understanding of each of the religions we studied. ",
            "\u00a0I was so deeply inspired by the texts that we read. Not only did I feel that I genuinely gained insight into all of the religions we studied (and the cultures they developed in), all discussions were held respectfully so that I gained a greater respect for these religions despite disagreeing with them at times. ",
            "\u00a0In taking this course, I learned how to analyze and question religious texts, comparing & contrasting them and at the same time expanding my knowledge of Indian culture overall. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to grapple with problematic themes that are complicated by different authors and texts. I learned how to better notice common themes in the various texts we read. ",
            "\u00a0My analytical skills were definitely developed in this course. We were made to explore challenging material that often required us to think beyond the face value. My participation skills were also developed as this class was made a success by the intellectual discussions that took place between peers, and required everyone to be focussed and ready to share ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I found that my skills in analysis and concise writing were developed in taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class basically served as my introduction to Indian religious studies. I loved reading the ancient stories and the in-classs discussions were engaging and interesting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The class was perhaps not what it was initially presented as. It is less a religious studies class than it is a cultural and literary study class. The teacher was incredibly knowledgeable about the course material, but there could have been more background information presented to the class ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions were wonderful! I learned a lot and felt comfortable participating. There was a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the enthusiasm with which the course was taught, and the texts themselves. Professor Granoff never let classes pass by in silence, so I never left without learning something new. Most of the texts were also very enjoyable. There were some I did not connect with, but I believe this is only due to my personal tastes in literature. All of the texts were on topic and together highlighted several major issues within the religions to be discussed along with the individual aspects of each text. ",
            "\u00a0This course is reading-heavy and discussion-heavy, and if you can keep up & engage in discussions it will be very rewarding. I think the course accomplishes what it sets out to do, giving students the resources & the skills needed to understand and appreciate Buddhism, Hinduism, & Jainism. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes, it felt like the course was jumping around a little too much and we would be dealing with a lot of different ideas without much focus. The strength of the course is with the professor: she always pushed us to ask the difficult questions and to struggle with the difficult concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well structured - we cover a great deal of material in a short amount of time, but not to the point that it is overwhelming. The workload is also very manageable, with weekly reading responses and only two assessed papers. ",
            "\u00a0When the course began there was a little difficulty in having an open discussion about what the students were interested in, but I think this is because the professor was just so excited about the material. In about two weeks the course really developed into a much more open forum, which I enjoyed. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot from this class about the general beliefs of each of the religions but more importantly I got a glimpse of ancient Indian literature and was able to find many similarities even between the different, competing religions. ",
            "\u00a0If the student is curious to learn about some of the most beautiful aspects of a new culture and belief system, explore their or their family's own faith more deeply, or if they simply are inspired by the sort of creativity and philosophical discussion found within these texts, I would recommend it to them. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. There is quite a bit of reading, but the weekly responses allow us to engage with all of the texts in a productive, personal way, and Professor Granoff provides specific feedback that is immensely helpful. My writing improved in this course, I learned a ton in this course, & I would take the course again !! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good course for anyone who wants to develop their ability to work through complicated ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - especially for those with interests in Religious Studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would (and have) recommend this course to some other students at Yale since it was such a good introduction to a field of study that many don't experience in high school: religious study. The course really emphasized the importance of religious studies and the respect that must be inherent in such learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this would be an ideal course for any freshman looking for an intimate learning environment complete with close and personal access to a fantastic professor. "
