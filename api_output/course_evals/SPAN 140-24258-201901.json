            "\u00a0This course helped improve my skills in spanish immensely. I feel much more comfortable speaking in any situation, and I also feel I acquired a proficiency in reading and writing that I did not have before this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about spanish language, culture, and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough knowledge of Spanish grammar and gained exposure to some elements of Hispanic culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned every single Spanish in just a short 13 weeks! I learned how to improve my sentences grammatically and convey my messages more effectively in another language. ",

            "\u00a0My Spanish skills improved tremendously. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped increase my proficiency in effective communication in Spanish and also introduces you to a brief history of some Latin American countries, which I really appreciated. "

            "\u00a0A lot of the assignments were redundant and unnecessary/unhelpful. The course readings should definitely be changed. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it focuses a lot on culture, which makes it less boring to also learn grammar and to practice other skills. My main issue with the course was that the syllabus could be very confusing at times, and I would often have to clarify things with my professor. I felt like it could have been organized a bit more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Great teacher. A lot of work but its organized nicely ",
            "\u00a0Professor Symons is awesome. Shes always willing to help and go above and beyond to teah a concept or practice. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job of getting through all the material but could give the teacher greater freedom. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is Prof. Symons. She was an absolute delight to be in class with every day, and this made the entire class feel comfortable in speaking and participating. Thanks to her, I was able to progress in a steady, easy to understand way. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in a seminar style but it is annoying how the course director decides \"rubrics\" for how to grade quizzes, exams etc. Some other teachers were extremely lenient grading exams while others were with presentations. Profe Symons was amazing and fair and tough! ",
            "\u00a0I like that this course makes a concerted effort to have us engage with Hispanic art and literature, while still giving us good practice speaking and writing in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course, it was awesome! My teacher was amazing and the book was MUCH better in terms of length than the one in SPAN 130. However, I do think the last two weeks had WAAY too much to do. We had the art gallery, presentations, a composition, AND our final written exam? Little too much. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that through the every day class, you will become better in Spanish even if you do not put in 100% of your effort.  A weakness is that there are exams/quizzes/presentations nearly every week, and the last 2-3 weeks of the semester are especially busy. ",
            "\u00a0Best professor ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot very quickly in this class in the way of grammar. The short films in the first half of the course are a fun way to end the week. The latter half of the course, however, is extremely work heavy. On top of the normal class work, there are projects and extra assignments that would be better spread throughout the course. ",

I enjoyed her teaching style a tremendous amount. Many of the topics covered can be dull, but she was able to make them a lot more enjoyable. ",

            "\u00a0Yes.  I think most people would be taking this for the language requirement and it's tough that it meets 5 days a week, but if you can get Professor Symons, it will be easier. ",
