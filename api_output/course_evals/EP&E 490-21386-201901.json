            "\u00a0I have learned so much about the cognitive science of morality and have really been challenged to formulate my own new insights. I feel like I am less sure of the correctness of anything in the field (there are so many great argumemts and counterarguments ) but I have a much deeper understanding og it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different topics that are studied in the CogSci of Morality and specific research/viewpoints on those topics (e.g., moral dyads, moral emotions, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0More about the cognitive science of morality ",
            "\u00a0The biggest skill I developed was the ability to follow through any intuitions or hunches to their logical conclusion through thought experiments and analogies. It forced us to really think carefully about issues, rather than relying on any instinctive responses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss the issues and controversies in the morality literature through the lens of empirical psychology research and general problem solving abilities. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really loved how much Josh put in and how he facilitated conversation. I have never seen someone moderate a conversation so well. We were given as much help as we ever needed and were always genuinley listened to. I wish though that there were more assignments or at least that the proposal for our project was due much earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Josh does an amazing job of making sure each idea is discussed and meaningfully progresses to the next so things can be explored and talked about in depth. He is also very helpful with the final paper, but I wish we had more check ins earlier on. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is related to knowledge retention. I found it difficult to remember the details of things studied in previous weeks, given each week treated such a distinct topic. Perhaps every lesson could begin with a quick refresher of things learned the week before, or maybe two weeks could be devoted to each topic and the number of topics halved (although this would diminish the benefit of realizing the breadth of the study of morality, which I hadn't really appreciated before)?\r\n\r\nAlso, I put 'disagree' to the question below about feedback, but I would like to note that that is my own fault, and my failure to attend office hours. Although, more feedback could be given on weekly assignments perhaps. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how the course was very student led and we were able to take the course to the topics and areas we were most interested in. I wish we had been able to spend more time on some issues but there was not enough time in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the most wonderful, well-constructed courses at Yale. You should do everything in your power to be a part of it. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great class that is so fascinating and I am so lucky to have taken it. This is the only seminar style class that I have ever felt like I was genuinley learning a ton from my peers. If you get the chance to take a class with Josh take it! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course! You learn so much every week surrounded by such intelligent students and Josh Knobe. The readings can be long but the reading response grading is not stressful, so you can make it what you want. The final paper was very rewarding though I wish we were prompted to start earlier. As a Pscyh person, I wish there was more of it sometimes and less of the Philosophy side, but I still really appreciated the content! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Knobe is the most incredible seminar leader! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Professor Knobe is so dedicated to his students and is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about the material. Honestly, any chance you get to talk with him, you should definitely take. He is so helpful and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a laid-back atmosphere so you get to explore your own and others' ideas and ask questions without too much judgement. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. There is a reason a spot in this course is so highly sought after. The discussion was fantastic, and the students and Josh are welcoming of any thoughts or ideas, no matter how half-baked. It is one of the best-run seminars I have been lucky enough to be a part of. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It was incredibly interesting and Professor Knobe does a great job at facilitating and leading discussion. You will gain a much greater understanding of the issues in morality! ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in cognitive science or ethics, this is a must take course for you. Josh sculpts a course that allows everyone to actively participate in crafting new, innovative theories on the cutting-edge of CSM research while exploring a breadth of specific topic areas in the field.\r\n\r\nProfessor Knobe has the best pedagogy of any professor at Yale. His ability to generously read the comments of students, coupled with his emphasis on creative exploration of the actual issues (i.e. not the specific text at hand) creates an unparalleled learning environment. This class is collaborative, insightful, and skill-building: take it!! "
