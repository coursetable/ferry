            "\u00a0Ability to more accurately interact with social science research, engage with sometimes-difficult texts, and craft a basic research project related to electoral systems and parties. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me about political parties and electoral system, allowing to gain a real understanding of how they function and their impact. ",
            "\u00a0More knowledge about the nuances of parties and electoral systems around the world ",
            "\u00a0Had no background in electoral systems or political parties but would now be able to hold an intellectual conversation about both thanks to this course. ",
            "\u00a0The name of the course says it all--I learned a lot about political parties and electoral systems, which I believe is increasingly important knowledge to have given our global political situation. It is very valuable to learn what role parties play in democracies (hint: they're pretty significant) and how electoral systems can affect the kind of people we put in power. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers great exposure to different political party system and electoral systems. Additionally, it allows students to learn more about research design and offers substantial exposure to political science research, both empirical and theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0The basics of electoral system design and the way that design affects the development and maintenance of political parties. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me the theoretical background of parties and electoral systems, therefore leading to me develop the skill of how to analyze and parse out dense political theory. I also developed the skill of presenting Political Science research through in-class presentations. "

            "\u00a0Great reading list and wonderful class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Aldrich, her care and enthusiasm for the class makes for an interesting discussion and great learning environment as her dedication makes everyone participate and engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course encourages participation and bringing in different perspectives ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great background knowledge and nice mix of relevant historical and more contemporary pieces of work.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lacks current political connections ",
            "\u00a0Professor Aldrich is definitely the best part about this course. She is incredibly knowledgeable about comparative politics and how parties work in Europe. She always has really interesting stories to share from her field work that supplements the readings well and it's helpful for us to learn how the processes we read about in the text play out in the real world. The only way I can think of to improve the class is perhaps to broaden the scope to include more countries around the world, although I understand syllabus space is limited. ",
            "\u00a0Great content and great syllabus. Heavily dependent on student discussion, so you need a good group. ",
            "\u00a0The course made a quite dense topic seem interesting, so I appreciated that. We were also able to relate a lot of the theoretical work to the real world while also analyzing and critiquing the theory. The weakness, however, would be that the theory and content could sometimes be a bit dry, but that is expected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Andrea Aldrich is amazing!! She deftly facilitated class even if people didn't talk and always had an anecdote within which we could ground our theoretical stuff. The syllabus was also pretty great! A good combination of theory and modern statistical literature (all very accessible). \r\nWeaknesses: None really, maybe just a little less on the denser older theory or maybe a few diagrams or maps to clarify it.

            "\u00a0Yes, if you have any interest in this area, particularly from a comparative perspective ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class, Professor Aldrich is an amazing professor, very kind, dedicated and engaging. One learns a lot about electoral systems and political parties allowing to better understand politics around the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it will give you a great learning experience in the field of comparative politics ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would. Even if parties and electoral systems are not a strong area of interest, this seminar provided great discussions that were accessible to every level of understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! I think every political science student should take this class. It is important to understand how electoral systems work and how much power/influence parties can have. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a great exposure to an important part of political science research and theory. Additionally, students were exposed to a wide range of contemporary political science research, as well as current events. ",
            "\u00a0I surely would. One must be happy to read all the material, but if you are so inclined it is great. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Even if you're not super interested in Political Parties or Electoral Systems, take this class anyways. You will learn a great deal about the topics, and you will read a lot of important works and authors to help you seem more polished during other seminars, a conference, or even a cocktail party. If that still doesn't convince you, then take it for Professor Aldrich. Professor Aldrich is incredible and hands down my favorite professor at Yale. She makes the class interesting and approachable even if you do not have the strongest background in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Electoral systems may not seem like a super interesting topic, but Professor Aldrich just teaches it really, really well. I never thought about electoral systems or party reform as a particularly significant aspect of democracy, but wow, this class really opened my eyes. Also, I feel like everyone who was in this class self selected, meaning that you've got people who know a little bit more about the topic than you might expect from a less niche class which made our discussions meatier.
