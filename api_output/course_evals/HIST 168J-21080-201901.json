            "\u00a0I learned so much, not only about Canada but also about the U.S. It gave me a great lens through which to view Quebec's political situation. I feel like the way I view North America as a whole has changed as well. ",
            "\u00a0A detailed understanding of the complex history of Quebec! ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an overview of the history of French people in North America. Although much of the course focuses on French Canada, the history of French Acadia and Louisiana are also explored, as are the relationships among the various French people of North America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Canada and its history ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Quebec, Canada, and New France. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Canadian history, more than I ever knew before and more than I ever knew existed. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course has a LOT of readings but the way Professor Gitlin divides them up among interlocutors helps make sure there's always someone in the room who knows what's going on in a particular text. There aren't many concrete assignments to be turned in throughout the semester, which gives you a lot of space to plan and write your final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gitlin is by far the strength of the course  he is an incredible professor, and it was an honour to take a seminar with him. Hard to fault the course, it has no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Gitlin does a great job making the class engaging with activities like in-class debates and presentations. I don't see any major weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class. One of a kind professor ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is endlessly fascinating. It really is wild that this is the only class at Yale on the history of French North America as there is so much to discuss. The professors (Prof Gitlin and Dean B) were also very passionate and enthusiastic. The main weakness was the discussion format. Prof Gitlin got very excited about the material and would oftentimes spend most of the class talking to us. Because he did this, people stopped doing the reading and therefore there was little to no discussion in the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course was Prof. Gitlin. He is so enthusiastic about Canadian history and history in general and he is so interesting to listen to. The two hour classes went by so quickly because he is just so easy to listen to. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious about Canada or is interested in exploring the Francophone diaspora in North America. It touches on a lot of interesting and relevant issues and all the extras outside of class (Chez Ben trip, hockey game, talks) really add up to a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, take it for the history, take it for Gitlin! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in Canadian history and/or in the unique relationship between French and English Canadians. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's a lot of fun, and you learn about an often ignored part of North America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course teaches you so much that is ignored in American history textbooks. French North America is absolutely fascinating and its striking contrast to British North America will teach you a lot about both. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I would say it is a good 6th class/writing credit/seminar requirement for history majors as it is not too demanding and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Most certainly ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course, especially if you are Canadianthere is so much more to learn that they dont teach you in school about Canadian history! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought this course was great! I learned so much and it was fun! "
