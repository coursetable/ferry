            "\u00a0I learnt some very nuanced elements of Latin Prose Composition - not just grammatical rules, but stylistic elements of many of the great Latin writers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger sense of Latin grammar and style as well as how the Latin language has hanged and thus allowed for words in living languages to form the way they are formed. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great way to drastically improve your Latin skill. Teaches you a lot the details that you don't otherwise learn. I definitely feel more comfortable thinking about Latin and forming Latin sentences/phrases. It is a prose composition class, so that's what you'll spend your energy on. Probably only advised for a Classics major. ",
            "\u00a0Greater understanding of Latin syntax. I can now read Latin more quickly and with a more developed eye. I am more likely to notice interesting points of style and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Exactly as the course set out to do, I gained a great deal of skill and enthusiasm for translating Latin to English by learning some ways to translate English to Latin. I also learned quite a bit about the history of the Latin language. "

            "\u00a0It is a fantastic course - the passion of the Professor is the biggest strength, and his asides about linguistics in Romance languages was incredibly engaging. It could have been improved with a midterm modelled on the final, and perhaps having the in-class tests graded to ensure that the material is absorbed! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this course is very interesting, however a weakness would be that the weekly compositions were hard to improve on. I wish there were more homework sheets with simpler sentences, each providing one type of concept learned in the chapter to truly master each chapter. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great and has a pleasant rhythm to it. I liked the the homework was only due once a week. It gave me lots of time to work ahead. ",
            "\u00a0The regular format and pacing of the course is very nice. We could perhaps read more Latin stylists (I think I would cut some  though not too much  of the etymological studies, so as to read a little more of each author). An excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the only real criticism I have is that there were times when I wasn't sure how much of the non-composition-related information being given to me I would have to retain later. "

            "\u00a0Yes - take it! Straightforward, enjoyable Latin prose - watch out for making silly mistakes on the compositions, check them over several times and learn the material, it's fun! ",
            "\u00a0I don't have any friends who want to major in classics, or that even taken Latin, so for that reason, no. However, this is a great course ot take to strengthen your Latin grammar and learn about different styles of different Latin authors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are a Classics major. Of course, it's a requirement for Latinists. I probably would not recommend for a casual Latinist. Lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Any student serious about reading Latin should take this course. My Latin feels much more whole now. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend. Professor Solodow does a genius job of collecting a bunch of learning about Latin prose into a cohesive whole. I fully realized how good the course was during reading week, when I was going through and translating Latin to English and realized how much fun I was having and how much I was getting out of it. If you love Latin, you must take this course. "
