            "\u00a0This econ class was amazing! I felt like I could not only understand the material, but actually synthesize it. We learned a lot about basic macro economics and the ability to apply it to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Macroeconomics seems mostly made up to me ",
            "\u00a0Great knowledge in understanding the economy. I learned a ton from mathematical skills to analytical skills. Really great. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about inflation, unemployment, GDP, and several other macroeconomic theories. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of facts about economy's around the world. In particular, the class focused on income inequality around the world. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a really good overview of macro -- you learn a lot about macro trends, financial systems, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a great course for introducing a wide range of macro topics. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, learned about macroeconomic trends, statistics, supply and demand, labor markets, trade, and other things. ",
            "\u00a0A better idea of how economics pertains to policy, the importance of economics in understanding current policy decisions and overall a more comprehensive subject which I felt complemented nicely the intro micro class as well. I particularly enjoyed how, as the course progressed, insights and concepts from previous lessons returned and were fleshed out more, for instance the lesson on TFP growth across countries and factors which may lead to lower than average growth (i.e. not allowing unproductive firms to fail) became relevant again in discussions surrounding business cycles and financial crises. Overall I felt this was a very useful course to me, especially as someone coming from a background with very little prior experience with economics courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course develops a working knowledge of a number of seminal topics within macroeconomics, including growth accounting, labour markets, debt, central banking, and financial markets. Much of this was new to me, so it was actually really fascinating, and Professor Hawkins is great at integrating the most up-to-date research and developments in the discipline into his class. This course does an especially good job of teaching about US economic institutions, which, as much as I dislike the US' global economic power, can be really important and useful to know. ",
            "\u00a0Intro Macro gives a broad overview of macroeconomics -- this year, the course had less of a focus on the mathematical components of macro and more of a focus on the qualitative aspects. Professor Hawkins also coordinated the curriculum with the lecture courses, and thus both the seminar and the lecture had the same lectures, p-sets, and exams. Econ 111, at the end of the day, is an intro course -- many of the concepts taught, especially this year since much of the math and derivation of theories was omitted, felt very \"hand-wavy\" and felt very basic. Some of the models felt overcomplicated and overemphasized in comparison to their sophistication or application. However, Hawkins is a great professor who really knows what he's talking about and truly cares about his students. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: really in between a lecture and a seminar feel, if you like that; class preparation was usually around 10 minutes a class and psets were only around 2 hours a week at most\r\nweaknesses: this class could arguably be too easy; all of the online quizzes/psets allowed infinite attempts, making the average grade essentially a 100 for those. The exams were also made way too easy to be reasonable, which isn't as good as it sounds when the class is graded on a curve. For example, on the second miderm, you needed a score of 101/100 to get an A (yes, a 100% was graded as an A-), which is kind of ridiculous, since a careless mistake could easily knock you down a grade. \r\nThe class was a seminar, but it was large enough that it really just amounted to a lecture with a few discussions mixed in that essentially contributed nothing to actual material. At this point, just make it a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well taught.  However, the material was oversimplified and not very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No weakness. Best organized course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the seminar. The curve was normalized across all intro macro classes, so it was easier to find study partners from lecture to crowd source when preparing for a midterm. I thought the seminar style (which essentially ran like a conventional high school classroom setting) was very conducive to my learning, and kept me very involved with the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of ECON 11 was its organized framework. By the end of the class, I kinda saw how everything tied together. Also, all the materials in the class were very well organized. Overall, the class is interesting. It looks big picture which can be really cool.\r\n\r\nThere were many weaknesses of this class. First off, the professor was one of the most aggressive and unapproachable personalities. I always felt uncomfortable at his office hours and never really wanted to go to them. Also, never ask him for explanations of why your logic is wrong on a certain problem because you will get an aggressive response that he will not change grades (even if that was not your intention AT ALL but rather you wanted to understand where/why your thinking went wrong). I think his aggressive attitude towards people who \"didn't\" know something that is \"simple\" is one of the reasons only the same five people answered any questions in class. Also, tying into that, the class atmosphere was not great at all. There were clumps of kids who acted like they were superior because they were poli sci majors, grew up in dc, were quality debaters, started a non-profit, parents worked in finance, etc... As a result, class participation was limited to literally the same people. Professor Hawkins did try to open it up to everyone, but his attitude towards those of us who may not have come in with as much prior knowledge made me less confident in participating. I sweat most of the kids in the class had taken macro and Professor Hawkins made it seem like they were the only ones trying/knew what was happening but it was just primarily because this was a repeat class for them. Furthermore, the fact that so many kids had taken the class made the curve ridiculous. Curves at Yale can be ridiculous sometimes, but I've never seen anything as bad as this class. You needed a 102/100 (yes you had to get the extra credit) in order to get an A on the second midterm. That is insane, and either the exams need to be made harder or someone needs to get rid of the downward curve. Another negative of this class was the sheer amount of data/definitions thrown at you. I honestly felt like I retained very little in class because Professor Hawkins flew through the slides and so I spent most of the time trying to keep up and less actually learning. I did most of my learning doing the PSETS or studying for the exam. ",
            "\u00a0Piazza is a good part. U can ask anything and Hawkins answers so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Hawkins's dedication! Always there on piazza and in office hours. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the curve is literally curved up. It would be great if we could make the tests harder to make the curve differentiated. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-organised and Professor Hawkins was great. I just felt that the first midterm was a bit too early and could have been held a week later so that we could get more familiar with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-taught course. Some of the prep quizzes can be annoying -- especially when you have one due the same day as a problem set. Overall though, this is a really good course. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how this course was designed to help facilitate even the most beginner student to do well. The problem sets and lecture environment were low pressure and there was a lot of room for interpretation and debate. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Does a good job of covering Macroeconomic topics\r\nWeaknesses - not enough seminars, classes for seminars too big ",
            "\u00a0A strength was definitely the accessibility of the instructor outside of class and the availability of recourses prior to evaluations such as the textbook, practice exams and outlines of information that would be covered. However, due to the size of the seminar, it was difficult to feel personally engaged at times, I understand this was the result of higher that expected enrollment however this did mean at times it felt more like a lecture than the back and forth dynamic which was expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength is definitely the energy of Professor Hawkins. He makes such a huge effort to make himself available to answer questions and provide helpful materials. I also think that the syllabus had been designed to approach key concepts from key and modern angles i.e. we approached the discussion of money by learning a bit about bitcoin.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is probably a good thing for an intro course, this class is a very high level overview of many topic in macroeconomics. Therefore the material can sometimes feel disjointed. The seminar moved very fast as it had to keep up with lecture, so it wasn't as much a seminar as it was a smaller sized lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging initially, and the material moved at a pace that was more than manageable. However, at the end of the course, the material became more complex, and it became somewhat difficult to follow. If the material at the beginning was sped up a little bit and there was more time for the material covered after the second midterm, the pacing of the course would be much more consistent. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a very minimal workload (p-sets don't take longer than 2 hours), but much of the curriculum feels \"hand-wavy\". The change from last year to diluting or removing much of the math and derivation of theories and concepts made the course much more qualitative and feel much less concrete. I had wished that the professors and the curriculum had spent less time on the basic qualitative aspects of models and had rather spent more time showing us where these models come from and what the intuition behind these models were. ",
            "\u00a0My main problem with the course was the fact that we covered simplified concepts that relied on many assumptions to hold true. I guess that since this is an intro macro course this is inevitable, yet (as a non-econ major) it seemed that I did not learn too much of value ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was well designed but there was a lot of material covered. Particularly towards the end of second semester, some of the topics felt rushed due to the heavy load of content. Otherwise, I felt that the problem sets and pre-quizzes were relevant and helpful in learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0No way to improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was great! William Hawkins was a great professor, the information was taught clearly and concisely, the review sessions were very useful, and even the slides (which were available on canvas) were extremely comprehensive and were very useful for studying for tests. No weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0If you haven't taken macro, you probably need to before taking intermediate. The material is somewhat interesting too, if you're more interested in the social aspects of econ than the math. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Definitely take this class. I was so discouraged after Micro, but professor Hawkins is so helpful and really goes out of his way to help you if needed. Strongly recommend, especially over 116. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think learning economics is important regardless of one's major. It's another way by which we can more rigorously understand how world society operates and what better way to learn macro than in a yale classroom. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Its a great course even for a non-Econ major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are looking to take macroeconomics, I highly recommend this course as opposed to the lecture. It is more engaging, and easier to do well. ",
            "\u00a0NO. Unless you absolutely need this class don't take it. If you're going to take it, DON'T take Hawkins. The class is rooted in interesting ideas and well organized, however, the class itself is not good. There was so many data/definitions thrown at you but it just became mass information that is quickly overlooked. Also, the class atmosphere was not great at all. There were clumps of kids who acted like they were superior because they were poli sci majors, grew up in dc, were quality debaters, started a non-profit, parents worked in finance, etc...

I did most of my learning doing the PSETS or studying for the exam. Overall, the material in this class is not that hard and the workload is low but it is not an easy grade because of the downward curve and the atmosphere will be awful. If you are an Econ major or interested in this class, take the lecture. You won't have to deal with Hawkins or all the kids who have taken micro or think their ideas are better than everyone elses' because of their upbringing. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Taking this class as a seminar was definitely better than the micro lecture as you can ask questions as you learn and know your professor. It is also genuinely interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I think its a good intro course and was well made to introduce you to the topic without too much pressure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, regardless of whether or not you are an economics major this course teaches you a different way of thinking ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend taking macroeconomics in general and this seminar in particular, even if the size is larger than anticipated, it is still smaller than the lecture and more conducive to developing interpersonal relations with both classmates and the instructor who is very open to providing feedback and advice. Also definitely a good class for gauging interest in economics as a subject you may wish to pursue in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This course is certainly better and more interesting than introductory microeconomics, and it will give you a better understanding if econ is something you would like to stick with. I would recommend this course to another student yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to a student who needs the course as a major requirement. However, for those who don't and are still interested in learning about macroeconomics, I feel most of what is covered in the course can be learned by reading the textbook/even economic articles, etc. online. If a student doesn't need intro macro but may need higher levels, I think it would be totally possible for someone to skip the intro course and go to intermediate. ",
            "\u00a0I would. I found the course interesting and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Excellent teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you need it for your major. I believe many of the concepts learned in this course are quite intuitive and it may not be necessary to retake this class. "
