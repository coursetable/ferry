            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about historical context and talk about it in a unbiased way. I learned how to read efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded my knowledge of the relationship between science and religion. Taught me to think critically about historical sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt of the commonly-misconceived interactions between \"science\" and \"religion\" as something far more complicated and political than the product we see today. By taking a wide view of these interactions across the world, you get a better appreciation that what is \"science\" and \"religion\" is really contingent on something else other than just faith and empiricism. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an interesting survey of how science and religion interact, conflict, and coexist in a variety of traditions. "

            "\u00a0The readings werent always great but the discussion was. It really put me in my place and made me think through what i wanted to say before i spoke. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the course's wide scope, which tries to avoid an overly Eurocentric view of what science and religion is. A weakness is that course readings are far too long and too dry  a variety of readings for each topic might function much better than 1-200 pages from a single source. ",
            "\u00a0This class had an excellent reading list, and Im glad that the professor made a point of engaging with them through good discussion and through a few reading responses.\r\n\r\nThe connection between topics often did not make sense, so it would be helpful to tie together the subjects we address each week better.

            "\u00a0Yes! Can be slightly boring, but you learn a lot and have cool conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I'll recommend this course if you are self-driven, and are genuinely interested in the topic of science and religion. Seminar sessions may be hit-or-miss, and the readings assigned might end up being quite dry and narrative. However, the final essay provides an opportunity to take the bits and pieces learnt over the course and do deep research on your area of interest. Otherwise, this course might be a little too touch-and-go to be very impactful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class with a great professor. This sort of interdisciplinary subject is useful for students of many different backgrounds, and the class is a survey in terms of content and not too difficult in terms of reading and workload. "
