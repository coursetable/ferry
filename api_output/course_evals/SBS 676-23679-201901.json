            "\u00a0This course was great. I essentially learned by doing and had a great end product to show for it. However, I wish I would have learned how to use SPSS and run factor, reliability, and validity assessments more in-depth. I would have liked to go deeper into the theory behind these questionnaire evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely valuable for all students, whether or not you're planning to go into research. Although working in a group for the whole semester is challenging at times, it's necessary given the format of this course, since it would be unrealistic for us to each do a complete project on our own. However, I wish the groups were capped at 4-5 people, as some were as large as 8, which can be extremely chaotic. The information taught is well-presented and helpful, but it would be much easier if we were taught SPSS toward the beginning of the semester rather than trying to learn it on the fly while we're doing our actual data analysisbecause nobody had any SPSS experience prior to when we were supposed to analyze our data, many members of the groups worked 15-20+ hours/week on the assignment during that period due to the extremely steep learning curve. This would be remedied by this content being taught earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was good.  The course was very engaging and hands on.  The one criticism I have is group selection in the beginning of the semester.  Marney should step in to ensure that groups are a more uniform size.  Some groups were very small while some groups were very large, and I believe this created unfair workload differences between groups.  Large groups had trouble managing many members while small groups had more work to do.  Group sizes should be standardized.  Other than that, great course. ",
            "\u00a0Wish that the course provided more insight or knowledge on analyzing the results. ",
            "\u00a0great! ",
            "\u00a0In class time often seemed ineffective. We didn't quite reach the crux of the material until well past spring break, at which point we were already winding down and preparing for the final deliverables.\r\n\r\nstrengths: possible to develop a publishable project if your team is equally passionate about a specific topic, learn SPSS through your own data collected if you take the time to explore its features independently\r\nweaknesses: scattered lecture presentations with tangents that detract from understanding QD, unclear understanding of the topic as a whole, had to set up weekly group meetings outside of class to actually complete the work ",
            "\u00a0Great learning experience ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you'll learn qualtrics and SPSS, which are useful skills. Learning to build surveys and questionnaires are really helpful in study design methods, so if you'll work or do additional courses that include this, this is a worthwhile course to take to learn a hard, useful skill.\r\nWeaknesses: group work can be challenging at times. Having more support for how to structure the work from the professor would have helped. Learning more SPSS would also be helpful (some students had it available through Citrix, others didn't and had to rely on computers on campus, and as a result, some are able to learn more than others). ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course! Marney is a wonderful lecturer, and I was excited to take a class on questionnaire design. I wish we had spent more time actually going over how to use SPSS - this was done on our own, which was okay, but some parts proved tricky (and a brief overview would have been great). I wish we had spent more time on certain topics, too, like examples of what not to do on scales (although good examples were provided - these just seemed a little quick). ",
            "\u00a0Good course, able to learn more about survey and questionnaire development. Would've liked more time on the data analysis lecture (validity, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0More structured lectures would be nice as well as more guidance on the more difficult concepts related to survey analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting topic, cool project getting to choose and work through building a whole questionnaire, Marney is very entertaining, enthusiastic, and knowledgeable.\r\nWeaknesses - I think the class size was a bit too large for everybody to be as engaged/get a lot out of the course. I think it would be better if each student had the change to speak directly with Marney or the TF more regularly, and/or if there were more discussions/engagement built into the course! ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Questionaire Development. The structure of the course provided a number of opportunities to engage with the coursework, including critical analysis, evaluating previous research, collaborating in a group setting, and formal presentation. ",
            "\u00a0This class was SO useful! The skills of questionnaire development and validation using statistical analysis packages will serve me throughout my career. It had just the right amount of individual and group assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course is awesome. Super helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to learn about into survey/questionnaire design and methods. It was larger this year than anticipated, and I think that really impacted the structure and feel of the course. In the future it would be nice if this class could remain a smaller, interactive, seminar-style course with smaller groups for the project (it's hard to coordinate and work on a group project with 6 people and feel that you are all contributing equally, and also writing with 6 people and combing 6 different people's writing is tricky...). ",
            "\u00a0Developing and validating a questionnaire with a group makes it extremely feasible. I don't think any of my group members were actually stressed about the workload this semester, and we got to do something that we enjoyed, which made this whole process of learning about psychometrics and what a \"good\" survey actually is, a whole lot more fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I loved this class for the material, the skills I gained, Marney and Adam! I have no complaints about the class itself. ",
            "\u00a0This course walked us through the process and theory behind building a questionnaire on a subject and population of our choice. The lectures were helpful when it came to descriptions of the different concepts we would be exploring, but they were not very helpful when it came to actually doing the project. I felt as though, in addition to the skills gained and applied in the construction of the questionnaire, there could have been more emphasis on navigating group dynamics and how responsibilities and roles could be delineated when approaching a large project like this. My experience in the class would have been substantially more fruitful if my group's dynamics were more productive and involved less hostility or conflict. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Adam (the TA), The group projects\r\n\r\nWeakness:  The course material was not well organized especially during the 2nd half of the course.\r\nThe 2nd half of the course had a high proportion of specialized topics to learn and not as much time was devoted to it . ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: practical, hands-on course about making and developing a questionnaire/survey that can be used for research. Basic introduction to using SPSS and Qualtrics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish there time for a more in-depth teaching of SPSS for data analysis "

The lectures did involve a lot of just listening to concept definitions and not a lot of applied skill, which would have been useful. Most of the guidance we got for our project came from actual discussions with the instructor or TF rather than from the lecture slides. Attending the lectures was not particularly beneficial to me, but the discussions among our group and with the instructors really defined our project and any steps we made forward. ",
