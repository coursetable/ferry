            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a variety of coastal ecosystems. I also think my ability to read, understand and critique scientific papers improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT. It's incredible how much material Shimi packs into this class! I feel like I'm coming away from this class with a lot of new knowledge and better understanding of certain concepts or topics that I didn't really get before. ",
            "\u00a0A knowledge of fundamental ecology of several coastal ecosystems, including marshes, mangroves, reefs, seagrass meadows, kelp forests, and estuaries. A deepened understanding of the threats facing coastal ecosystems, as well as insights into management practices deployed against these threats. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered the basic ecology and environmental challenges facing a variety of coastal ecosystems. We also focused a great deal on scientific papers and being able to understand and interpret scientific graphs. ",
            "\u00a0This course continued  to make me feel more comfortable with quickly reading primary literature and evaluating the evolution of the scientific understanding of ecosystem dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a deeper understanding of science of coastal ecosystems. It walked through the threats (i.e. eutrophication, climate change, sedimentation, ocean acidification, etc) and the different coastal ecosystems (kelp forests, seagrasses, corals, salt marshes, etc). While not a management course, it provided an essential science background any manager should have in order to better understand the nuances of these systems, and the possible management challenges. There was a lot of focus on improving our ability to read, understand and analyze scientific literature. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about coastal systems, but more importantly about the evolution of science.\r\n\r\nShimi is great at making us think!\r\n\r\nI loved going to CERF, but didn't prioritize it as much as I should have (its hard to make yourself skip other classes, but it would have been worth it)- I think if there was an expectation to all go together (with the option to go another day if it REALLY doesn't work) and a more structured follow up session where we talked about what we learned, who we connected with and maybe even suggesing at least one connection for another person in the class would help students get even more value out of the trip. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I developed various levels of skills related to science and ecology in general and specific knowledge of coastal ecosystems. More generally, I learned how to read, critique, and apply lessons from scientific journal articles. I also learned about more general ecological principles related to zonation, food webs, bottom-up and top-down processes, etc. These skills and knowledge would be applicable in any kind of scientific pursuit moving forward. More specifically, I learned details regarding the ecological structure and functioning of various coastal ecosystems - marshes, estuaries, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, mangroves, coral reefs. I also learned about the threats facing each of these ecosystems and the most likely solutions for each. ",
            "\u00a0threats to coastal ecosystems, differences between these systems ",
            "\u00a0So much new knowledge. Favorite class in my entire life. \r\nDeveloped the ability to read different types of graphs and charts. \r\nAlso learned about different coastal habitats and their significance for humans and nature. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I gained a well-rounded knowledge on coastal ecosystems, in particular salt marshes, and the biological and physical processes associated with them. I also felt the course was taught in such a way that I was able to see how these principles would be useful to environmental managers in the future. It was a science-heavy course, but very accessible to those without an ecology background. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about coastal ecosystems (salt marshes, kelp forests, seagrass meadows, and more!) and the threats they are facing from human activity. This course also improved my ability to critique scientific papers and not just take their results at face value. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about coastal ecosystems! ",

            "\u00a0I think I was expecting a little more detail about each topic; although we certainly did dive into marshes and other ecosystems, I thought we'd spend a little more time on specific examples during class time. This was more of a survey course on multiple ecosystems, which was great! We certainly got a lot of detail from our readings. ",

            "\u00a0I think Shimi was very clear about what the course would cover but we ended up not having enough time to get as in depth on some of the ecosystems compared to others. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. We spent the most time on salt marshes but that is Shimi's research so it was expected. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered in this class aligned quite well with my expectations. I would have been happy to do a bit more advanced quantitative work on the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0It exceeded my expectations. Shimi is the master of packing a ton of information into a short semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton, loved the field trips (particularly the rocky shore), and seeing Shimi and practitioners in the field. Was more about marshes and estuaries than I thought.\r\n\r\nI was really excited about guest lectures, but I found them less engaging than Shimi's teaching and a little boring, even though the subject matter was interesting. Having fewer guests and more field trips, or meeting them out in the field instead might be better. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills and insights gained in the class aligned very well with my expectations. If anything, they exceeded my expectations in terms of some of the generality of their applicability (i.e. ability to interpret results from a scientific paper and general ecological principles). ",
            "\u00a0Great! ",
            "\u00a0Aligned perfectly ",
            "\u00a0I was really satisfied with this course as a whole. I do feel that the majority of focus was put on salt marshes, as this is Shimi's research focus and the most accessible ecosystem for field excursions, but I would have appreciated a little more time or emphasis on coral reef and mangrove ecosystems. However, overall I felt I got a great introduction to coastal ecosystems and what challenges are facing all our near shore environments. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well. ",
            "\u00a0The material was maybe a bit more heavy on the salt marsh environment than I was expecting ",
            "\u00a0I was surprised by the distribution of the course. We spent 20 minutes on mangroves, but a couple weeks on marshes. Granted, this is a reflection of the strengths of the professor, but I don't agree with this distribution.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, fantastic professor and course! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great! I would be excited about a few more specific examples of management strategies? But also that's not necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really awesome diversity of readings. From typical science textbook to journal articles that dismantled \"standard\" concepts or delved into a how/why behind research and science, not just the results. I think the way it's structured is really good for benchmarking and making sure we've got a good grasp on things, especially given the fast pace of the class. The field trips were also much more fun than I expected!\r\n\r\nThe only thing I might change is being able to see classmates' reading responses.  I liked/benefited from hearing everyone's perspective in class discussions and their ideas or questions that were cited in slides and lectures. It would have been cool to be able to get more of this. But I totally get why Shimi would want to avoid this! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths = incredibly interesting lectures and very organized and effective pedagogy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses = I would have liked to have spent more time on seagrasses, kelp, mangroves, and coral. Possibly less time on salt marshes and physical science. ",
            "\u00a0The course really focused on salt marshes, estuaries, and intertidal systems. I think we had to rush through some of the other ecosystems at the end because we had more material than we had time to cover. \r\n\r\nPer usual, Shimi puts a great deal of thought and effort into this courses. I think the variety of learning that occurred (field trips, lecture, conference, student presentations, guest speakers) contributed to a well rounded experience. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellent as is. One thing that could be an improvement if possible would be to space out the fieldtrips a little bit more--maybe have the rocky intertidal fieldtrip a little later. I also thought it was a little bit unfair that we had to spend so much for the books and CERF, but worth it in the end. It would be great if there were other funding sources we could tap into to get the CERF day fully covered, or to get more copies of the textbooks in the library. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful overall but it was a bit uneven over the course of the semester. The latter half of the class was taken up by the CERF conference, guest lectures, and many student presentations. I think we would have been better served by continuing to cover material at the same pace as the first half of the semester. I felt that we went into less depth on latter topics, which were also areas that I had less prior knowledge of. The strengths of the course were the strong choices for readings and Shimi's lectures, which were always focused, well organized, and very informative. I didn't get as much out of the Castro & Huber readings as I did the Bertness. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is an amazing professor. His commitment to the topic and the students is a major strength of the course. His frequent quizzes force the students to constantly review the material, which really helps when it comes to the final exam. The class is well organized and moves at a quick pace so it is important to stay on top of the readings. Shimi is very available for students who need extra help with the material. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that the class sometimes felt rushed because Shimi would try to fit too much into one class session, but there were many ways to review information at your own pace outside of class at your own pace. ",
            "\u00a0The time and depth could have been spread more evenly- it felt like eelgrass, kelp beds, mangroves, etc. got short shrift and marshes and estuaries got a lot of time. It's hard because they are all so cool.\r\n\r\nAssigning one or two nature documentaries or videos instead of or as an alternative to a few readings might be a way to give the feeling of more depth even if we don't cover a system in depth in class (Chasing corals, Planet Earth blue planet on Corals, Coasts or other systems). Many of us are not lucky enough to have seen or expect we will see these systems in real life, so videos and pictures are a big inspiration.\r\n\r\nTextbooks were great, especially Burtness.\r\n\r\nThe focus on how science evolves is an unexpected strongpoint of the class.\r\n\r\nFormat, the structure of content and flow (readings, responses, etc) and physical layout of the classroom is great. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of the course is definitely Shimi's teaching. He presents complex concepts very clearly and concisely, which creates a level playing field in the classroom. I also appreciated the strong emphasis on student's questions and thoughts. By requesting reading questions and comments, Shimi is able to keep students engaged during every class. Finally, I also found the field trips to be a strong component of the course. It was very valuable to see how some of the studies are carried out and observe the ecological principles and theories discussed in the classroom in reality. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is a great professor and clearly cares about students, wanting them to learn. He is very knowledgeable about salt marshes and draws in good scientific papers/current knowledge.\r\n\r\nOverall the class was great but I would have liked a class or two focusing on restoration. I also think too much of the class focused on the CERF presentations. It was highly valuable to go to the CERF conference, but a short paper would have been more valuable than the presentations. In terms of efficient use of class time, I got little from listening to people's presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - can't think of any. More on mangroves would have been fun\r\n\r\nStrengths - Professor was understanding with grading, thorough in his instructions, and enthusiastic about teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was presented in a very clear way, and I really appreciate that Shimi printed off each classes powerpoint slides to take notes on. The quizzes were also really useful for staying up to date on the information, and come the final exam, I realized I had really learned everything the first time given that I had reviewed for the frequent quizzes. \r\n\r\nI was not a big fan of the Bertness textbook, and felt like I gained much more out of the Castro and Huber readings. I think that the required text could be limited to one book in tandem with the frequent scientific papers. I also struggled with the rescheduling of the reading response questions. While I understand how they're useful for keeping students up on the reading, I think it would be helpful to give students a number of responses to budget for the semester from the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my all time favorites. It was well structured with a mix of lecture and class discussion. The readings were also a good mix of text book chapters to establish background knowledge and recent publications to give a sense of important research happening in the field. Shimi established the importance of doing the readings from the first day, and short reading responses helped to hold us accountable throughout the semester. This worked really well to foster interesting discussions while creating an atmosphere where questions about the readings were encouraged. Weekly quizzes ensured we knew the material while they never felt like Shimi was trying to trick us into getting something wrong. If there were any weaknesses I can't recall them now! ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is a fantastic lecturer and engages students well in his lectures and field trips. A little less time could be devoted to salt marshes and could instead be used to explore other aspects of the coastal environment. ",
            "\u00a0Spend more time on the systems that hardly got covered. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Shimi is a wonderful instructor. He's very caring and is so knowledgeable; it shows in his teaching style (always oriented towards answering questions and encouraging conversation) as well as the excitement he brings to the classroom. There's a good deal of work, but it's manageable, and you'll come away with a much greater knowledge about several coastal ecosystems. You'll also get to practice reading scientific literature for issues below the surface. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! ",
            "\u00a0You will come away with a lot of knowledge and as a deeper thinker! Very engaging course but also asks a lot of you. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a great deal of work so students should only take this class if they think they can dedicate the time necessary to read all the papers, study for quizzes, do problem sets, and complete the presentation requirement. I also think it is hard to keep up if you don't have any scientific background/ understanding (basically you really need to take Physical Sciences before this class). ",
            "\u00a0I would say take the course if you are interested in coastal protection, fisheries, coastal wetlands and marine conservation, etc. It's important to do the reading, especially the journal articles. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi lays out the expectations for the course really clearly. Keep up with the reading and come to class ready to contribute and you'll have a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you are prepared for a very science heavy course. If you don't have a background in ecology or marine biology you will be at a disadvantage, but you can still get a lot out of the course. It's a very important course for anyone interested in coastal systems. ",
            "\u00a0Shimi is a gem. Take every class you can with him! The focus on how science evolves is an unexpected strongpoint of the class, and the field trips are wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are at all interested in coastal systems. It does not have to be an ecological or scientific interest - it could be planning, design, policy, or anything. This course will be of value to you. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! It might be a little more difficult if you do not have a science background but still worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very useful introduction to issues of significance in our coastal environment and what professionals hoping to work in these spaces should be aware of. I highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0The course is great, but does have a substantial amount of work to complete on a weekly basis (quiz prep, problems sets, etc.) "
