            "\u00a0Knowledge of the interaction of color and how it has developed over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned good craftsmanship practices for collage and different color theory. I also learned the value of flexibility and patience in a slow moving and on the fly class (I'm guessing this is what most art classes are like...) because, as an electrical engineering major, my classes are always very high demand and high pressure without a lot of time for reflection or breathing room. I appreciated the opportunity to slow down despite it feeling a little too slow sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how colors (and different kinds of colored materials) interact with one another, and how distinct visual effects can be created with color contrasts. \r\nThis class was a fun exploration into colorful media and color techniques. ",
            "\u00a0To be honest, I don't really think I learned anything. Maybe a higher sensitivity to color? And a greater awareness of its subjectivity? ",
            "\u00a0I developed an eye for color nuances and the vocabulary to engage in art critiques. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about color and how color is always relative. Simultaneous contrast, transparency, additive and subtractive color, etc. We also went on field trips to the Peabody and Albers Foundation, which were both really fun and informative. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about color theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to use color in my art and the different meanings and implications of colored art. "

            "\u00a0Class time often feels too long. Breaking up the class into half lecture/half work may help students remain engaged throughout the entire two-hour span. ",
            "\u00a0The class facilitated a lot of really cool color work -- especially the final projects!! However, I think doing more mini projects in class that relate to our homework would be beneficial. We mostly spent class time talking about reading, critiquing, or looking at slides when I think that actually doing projects was what related most to our outside-of-class projects and growth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor with plenty of one-on-one interaction, great class organization (the syllabus was clear and made sense), meaningful and engaging projects\r\nWeaknesses: some of the projects take a lot longer than expected! I was also not in love with the prompt for the final project unfortunately. ",
            "\u00a0The class might seem a bit slow at first, but it really does alter the way you think about color. I found the class and the assignments to be very enjoyable and not especially stressful. ",
            "\u00a0No improvements ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is that Halsey is an amazing teacher and the assignments were interesting and clearly planned and easy to understand. The discussions about the readings were also interesting. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is relaxed and interesting. Ian, the TA, and Halsey, the prof, were both delightful! Very upbeat and positive. The class moves pretty slowly and I'm not sure it is the most practical class (you don't really learn any new skills per se?) but it's a cool way to start thinking about color and how tricky it is! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone, even people who have no prior art experience, because of how great it is as an introduction to color concepts, theory, and methods. \r\nThe workload is manageable if you start early, and the readings are interesting for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0I don't feel like I got a lot out of this course. But if you're looking for a chill class where you get to look at a bunch of color optical illusions for four hours a week, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student, regardless of how much art experience you have. It really opens your eyes to observing color. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would if you want to learn about and do a lot of experimentation with color. "
