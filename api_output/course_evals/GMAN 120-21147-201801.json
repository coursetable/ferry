            "\u00a0I learned elementary German culture and language skills. The topics ranged from learning the past tense to debating how current events are shaping modern German society. It was a very insightful class and a great continuation to German 110. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better view of German culture & better speaking/communication skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learn how to speak German fluently and confidently ",
            "\u00a0I learned German and some German culture. ",
            "\u00a0Overall better understanding of the German language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Basic grammar and vocab of German "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging, with a lot of in-class speaking, listening, reading, and writing exercises, and outside of the classroom we interacted with other students via forum boards. There are no weaknesses I can identify. \r\nThere are no aspects of the class that I can advise to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fairly well-organized format, lively teacher, frequent assignments keep you on top of the material (good for people like me who often lack the self-motivation to review foreign language class material). Weaknesses: some things were brushed over and then just popped up on the test, feedback on assignments was kind of vague/unspecific and grading the essay component of tests always seemed sort of arbitrary, and when we would do exercises in class we wouldn't always go over the correct answers because we were trying to breeze through the material. ",
            "\u00a0I love how Thorsten taught and engaged the class in almost everything. He was always there to help\r\n\r\nPush the project video in the first few weeks of the semester so we can really bond with our classmates ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Good \"class culture\", most classes seem to work together well\r\nWeaknesses: The jump in difficulty from L1 is far too steep. It's unrealistic, discouraging, and the way this course is taught when compared to L1 was frankly disappointing. The curriculum jump needs to be more realistic, taught more slowly, and modelled more closely after how L1 is taught. ",
            "\u00a0Connect was very frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I like the structure of the course overall. Perhaps having a book in German that we gradually read over the course of semester would be a nice addition to the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The course was very engaging and facilitated student learning. It is a good deal of work, but the work was rewarding in the end. The grading system was also fair, which meant that it was not very difficult to do well in the class if you're on top of your work. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn German, then yeah, this is a good course. I think German is a challenging but also really fun language to learn, so if you're interested in possibly studying it, it's totally worth a shot. I don't have any particularly strong feelings (negative/positive) about this class/instructor in particular, but Thorsten was a really cool guy & I think he did a pretty good job of teaching the language. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. the structure and enagement makes it easy to pick up ",
            "\u00a0Only if you really want to learn German. We'll see if L3/4 is worth it; L1 was good. I feel as though I spoke more German at the end of L1 than I do now. ",
            "\u00a0Well worth it if you want to improve your German. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A good way to continue building up German language skills after L1. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the German department at Yale is an interesting and supportive community as well as a solid foundation in the language. "
