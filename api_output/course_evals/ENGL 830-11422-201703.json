            "\u00a0As someone who was drawn to this course mostly by the literary part of it, I felt a little intimidated at first by the level of the discussion on the art; however, I feel that by the end of the term I have learned a lot: from Professor Yeazell, critical readings, visits to YCBA, discussions in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic! I loved the idea of combining literature and art in the classroom. I had not read quite a few of the works for class, and was very happy to have the chance to read the texts and discuss them in such a warm environment. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be helpful in a number of different ways: it was simultaneously a survey of some major novels in the Anglo-American literary tradition, an introduction to important scholarly work on literary characters, and an examination of the constantly shifting relationship between fiction and visual art (which had not really come up in previous classes I'd taken). It was useful to me both as a broader course on the history of portraiture and the novel and as a focused investigation of a smaller set of literary questions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new ways to approach questions of text and image, especially when it comes to the depiction of people. ",
            "\u00a0This course enabled me to combine a study of the techniques of visual and literary art in a way that I had not previously done. It significantly increased my knowledge of painting, portraiture, and the history of art. Through its emphasis on interpreting various authors' use and creation of characterization by focusing on specific characters within novels rather than following the entirety of story and plot, it also introduced me to a different and very interesting new way of reading character in fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot more insight into talking about paintings and history of art, as well as thinking about character and how this has developped over the time period addressed on the course. I gained a lot of knowledge of the texts studied and of the artists - it was especially interesting going to the YCBA and seeing the works in person, and hearing about them there as well to develop what was discussed in class. "

            "\u00a0I very much appreciated the fact that close reading was crucial for our work with texts: it is often overlooked and substituted by theory completely. Personally for me it was very refreshing to be a part of the course that did not take the use of the theory to the extreme. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. I really appreciated the after-class sessions at the YCBA and the class field-trip to the Morgan. All four events were wonderful opportunities to see the art we discussed in class, and really helped bring the material even further alive. (Thank you for organizing them!) ",
            "\u00a0This course was, overall, a great asset to my learning and a fun experience in itself. It could have been improved by providing a little more context on the works in both media, and by focusing more on the comparison between the two in discussion. I also felt that the inclusion of \"Picture of Dorian Grey\" contributed to the slightly superficial treatment of the course material; most of the other texts had very novel or distinctive ways of depicting people, whereas the Wilde simply had the kind of thematic link. There also -must- be some portraits from the nineteenth century that could be included; while portraiture wasn't the only marketable kind of painting in Victorian England/America, it certainly still happened. What about Luke Fildes, William Etty, Frank Holl, Tissot? The Pre-Raphaelites also painted portraits? In general, though, it was an interesting opportunity to think in an interdisciplinary way. I appreciate the emphasis on broad, comparative examinations of depiction. ",
            "\u00a0If not for the focalization on the (in many ways) similar techniques used during the processes of portrait-making and characterization, I think that the material may have been to much for a single semester. However, because the course was so tightly focused on portraiture and characterization, its combination of paintings and novels was very interesting without being overwhelming. I thought that the pairings of painters and novelists were especially powerful and adept. Especially in the cases of James-Sargent and Woolf-Bell, they provided wonderful insights and illuminations into one another's art. ",
            "\u00a0I felt the mixture of literature and art history was very interesting and I enjoyed the approach of thinking about a particular genre of painting alongside the novels. The selection of the material was great and I felt that discussion was encouraged and was interesting. I also enjoyed the format of having short responses discussed at the beginning of each class. I would have enjoyed being set a little more critical reading to inform discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- This course is great if you're interested in art history and/or literature. It is a very interesting and unique look at the relationship between the two arts. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The concept of the seminar is incredibly interesting and fruitful, in my opinion, as a line of inquiry. It is always so nice to learn from people in other departments, and I appreciated the interdisciplinary of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's an unusual opportunity to examine worthwhile novels and portraits in juxtaposition with each other, and with colleagues one normally wouldn't get to take many courses with. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I thought that the combination of painting and fiction was also especially useful for understanding the context of the novels. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - wonderful learning experience - great research opportunities. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course because it was really well taught, was interesting and a great approach to the material. I enjoyed the novels and paintings - particularly interesting given that so many of the works were actually on display at the YCBA - and this gave a greater insight into the works. I felt it was a good way to start looking at paintings from being from a literature background. "
