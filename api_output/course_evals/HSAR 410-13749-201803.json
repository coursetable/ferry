            "\u00a0This class was a wonderful overview of American painting and literature until the Civil War. I learned a lot about how to analyze paintings in isolation, and draw larger comparisons and narratives from looking at paintings in combination. This course also drew in aspects of American history to contextualize the artists' lives and works, which was really interesting to me as a history major. Probably the most exciting part of this class was when it delved into museum curation  we took an excellent trip to the art gallery to hear from the curators about the American Art exhibit, and for our final project we were tasked with designing and planning our own imaginary gallery exhibition. That was something I had never done before or explicitly learned how to do, but I really enjoyed the challenge of putting an exhibit together with the knowledge learned over the course of the semester and the support/encouragement of Professor Wolf. ",
            "\u00a0A new appreciation for American Art History, and for art history in general. More confidence in close-looking and analyzing visual artifacts. Also got to go on a lovely field trip to the Catskills! Prof. Wolf is truly a gemhe is incredibly knowledgable, and his interdisciplinary approach to art history was really engaging and edifying (and is totally different from the norm in all the best ways). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about influential early American thinkers who operated in different media. I also learned new ways of conceptualizing the role of art. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this course, I learned history and understanding how to analyze and interpret an image ",
            "\u00a0How to look at art properly and how to see its beauty in a different way. "

        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this class is terrific, and I think the only downside was that we didn't actually get through that much of it. I also loved the fact that our class was held in the YCBA and across the street from the YUAG, but wish we could have had more time to explore those galleries and look at their artwork in person as a class (when we did that for our class at the YUAG, it was fascinating). I think perhaps the course tried to tackle too much given its relaxed pace and introspective tone, but I actually preferred the slower, calmer atmosphere because it really helped me appreciate the art we were looking at (I thought a single painting wouldn't be able to hold my attention for more than a few minutes, but I was wrong). ",
            "\u00a0Leminar format is closer to the truth: class discussions punctuated Prof. Wolf talking about the slides. Which is a great thingI learned much more than I would have had the reverse been true. \r\n\r\nThe final class assignment of an imaginary museum exhibition was also a treat. I got to flex creative muscles together with the analytical ones. Lots of fun and about as low-stress as a Yale seminar can be. ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal class! The class material is engaging and cohesive. The final project is a really fun exercise where students get a lot of freedom. The field trip that we went on was an amazing opportunity. I think my recommendation for the class would be to set all field trip dates right out of shopping period using online tools where people can mark their availability remotely (such as when-to-meet or doodle poll) so that we don't have to spend as much class time on it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wolf tended to lecture rather than making sure that class meetings were more interactive discussions. This was both a strength and a weakness -- hearing his insight was fascinating, but I also would've liked to hear from my peers more. The course was also lacking a logical structure. ",
            "\u00a0It was a bit too much of a lecture but super interesting ",
            "\u00a0It was an extremely welcoming environment to learn in and was very interesting, but sometimes the attention of the students seemed to wonder a bit. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Wolf cancelled a lot of readings assigned to focus more so on the reading he felt were more important, which was both good and bad: good, because our discussions were really amazing, and bad because I thought the work load was a little too light honestly. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to everyone, even people without art backgrounds (although I'm sure having one helps)! It was such a lovely break from the demanding and chaotic classes we all take that require us to churn out research papers and problem sets and presentations, and I learned so much about American art in a historical context. I think the interpretive and analytical skills we practiced in this course will be useful when visiting galleries and museums on my own in the future, and some of the painters and phenomena we learned about have shaped my perspective on American history itself, in addition to the world of visual and literary arts. It's one of those special classes where you learn a lot without feeling overwhelmed, and I think I had an \"aha\" moment about something at least once a week. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Prof. Wolf is kind, and wise, and willing to give you time. He brings an approach to art history that I hadn't scenelots of philosophy/theory, but also a willingness to embrace the lowbrow along with the high. Humbugs was a fun, interesting, low-stress seminar. With field trips! Feel incredibly lucky to have knocked out my Early Americas requirement with this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! Professor Wolf is a great section leader who has picked an interesting topic and created a fabulous class. The workload is fair and manageable, and the field trips are really special experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, loved professor Wolf ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because Prof. Wolf is the rare type of professor who is both brilliant and a really pleasant person to be around. I went to his office hours just to chat. "
