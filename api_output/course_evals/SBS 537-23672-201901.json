            "\u00a0I truly did not like this class. I was not at all interested in this material. In future, please allow students to pick a SBS class they want. This class was so basic : high school feeling, and the material learned, alas a lot, it felt more like general knowledge. I truly did not enjoy this. I would have preferred to pick one SBS class, for example a class talking about aging, and take a deep dive on this issues. I am very frustrated at the administration for making this class compulsory. What a waste of expensive money. Just take a few topics and learn further about them. Also, the homework assignments were so unnecessary. Most students just read the discussion and came up with lame critic questions. Almost everyone in class were in their laptops doing other work. Please think of other ways to reinforce positive learning. Reading more, and doing more writing does not improve quality of class. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely poor course unfortunately, material is disparate and assignments are busy work rather than helping to instill learning. Please take this course out of the offerings. ",
            "\u00a0While I feel bad criticizing this course, I feel obligated to do so given the numerous, significant issues with it. the professor largely read off of prepared slides in class, and the the in-class discussions were incredibly slow with most students disengaged / on their laptops. Many of the activities given in-class felt like those assigned in high school -- \"talk to your neighbor about X.\" These conversations lacked any sense of depth. Having a quiz at the beginning of class was not helpful. \r\n\r\nAlso, the topic areas covered in the course are largely research-focused. Applying these topics to fields outside of academia would be useful for those of us who do not plan on becoming academic researchers. Since many of the topic areas are very very relevant outside of academia, I think this would add a lot to the discussion / usefulness of the class. (Thinking more about how social relationships affect work environments, public health interventions, etc as opposed to discussing how you measure a concept if you're doing research). ",
            "\u00a0good class. Did not feel like I learned a ton but it was a nice discussion course. Would recommend to break up a course schedule for anyone taking strictly quant-based classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of the social and interpersonal influences on health. Though Professor Monin had to take on a lot of different subjects throughout the semester, she somehow managed to make every lecture pretty specific. I liked that we had a lot of discussion time in pairs/small groups. The only thing that would have put this class over the top would have been a final lecture wrapping up the entire semester, given that we covered so many disparate areas. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Very interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0interesting topics ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was good choice of interesting readings. However, the assignments and participation grade felt like busywork, not tasks that I was gaining a lot from. ",
            "\u00a0Great! ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course, a great overarching exploration of social and interpersonal influences on health. ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a large variety of topics, many of which were personally interesting to me. The assignments were due at inconvenient times, particularly if we were traveling for otherwise engaged for parts of the weekend. I loved the lecture from the Child Life Specialist, I would definitely recommend bringing in more guest speakers or lecturers. There was not a lot of guidance in terms of the review paper, but the instructions and examples made the assignment clear. ",

            "\u00a0Joan is a very nice instructor, helpful and loves her work. \r\nI just didn't like the class. I would take an advanced class she teaches that focuses on few SBS topics. \r\nGood professor, just horrible class. ",
            "\u00a0Very unprofessional though seems extremely nice. Could not lead an impartial, academic or professional discussion, and fostered an unengaged and uninspired environment. Too many personal anecdotes and lack of synthesis of topics. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Monin seems like she knows her area of research well and is genuinely interested in the topics. \r\n\r\nA big turn off for me was that the professor made numerous political comments, insinuating that those with certain political opinions (namely conservative) were bad. This normative stance on certain policies made for an environment where only one viewpoint (very, very liberal) was expressed. If someone did hold a differing opinion, they certainly wouldn't have comfortable expressing it. The professor would say things such as, \"I found out my neighbor supported a certain political candidate and I stopped wanting to interact with them.\" I think this is a concern for YSPH in general, as one opinion / voice is becoming the only one heard. Making sure that those with differing (and middle of the road or even slightly conservative!) viewpoints feel comfortable sharing should be prioritized. Many solutions in healthcare will require bipartisan cooperation. Furthermore, equating the worth of a person to their political opinions is strange and uncalled for -- especially in a classroom setting where her voice is elevated as a professor. These types of political comments are more appropriate when you're in the company of family or close friends. ",
            "\u00a0Great Professor. Timely feedback and a nice personality. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Monin is a great lecturer. She created a healthy environment for students to ask questions, but also challenged us to think more critically about our statements. She is also good at allowing for silences, because a lot of professors would not wait around long enough after they ask a question to make sure students speak up. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Monin was very encouraging and supportive of students.  She offered a lot of great topics for those who do not have a heavy sociology/ psychology background and taught them in a very digestible way. ",

            "\u00a0This was a great introductory course to the social and interpersonal influences on health. The workload isn't huge, and you get a lot out of the readings. It's great for someone who is drawn to social psychology but doesn't necessarily know exactly what aspect (e.g., dyadic relationships, social media, etc.) is most interesting to him/her. ",

The assignments were not extensive but became time-consuming and particularly difficult to complete if there were any conflicts during the weekend or if the end of the week was particularly busy. ",
