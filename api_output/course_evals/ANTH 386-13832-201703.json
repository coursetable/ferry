            "\u00a0This class got better as the semester went on. First, you learn about moral/ethical dilemmas in the field of humanitarianism today, and then once you've hammered that to death and get tired of it, you move on to more practical applications. But the earlier stuff is very necessary as a foundation for the later stuff. This is the kind of class where you learn a ton without really realizing it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the challenges in humanitarian intervention. It was a very humbling course on the limitations and capabilities of humanitarian groups. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about broad strokes policy issues in humanitarian affairs, with particular emphasis on the connection between humanitarian and development work. Professor Panter-Brick's feedback on written work was always constructive, but I'd say the main focus of the course was learning the vocabulary of this sector. Especially with a high volume of guest speakers, this was essentially a pre-professional colloquium where students learned about this field of work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to summarize my papers into 2-3 bullet points (\"research highlights\" as we called them) which helped me figure out if my paper was well organized and properly articulated such bullet points. I knew very little about humanitarian efforts before this course, and I now feel I have a broad understanding of different approaches to humanitarian aid and the current problems facing humanitarian organizations and workers. I especially gained key insight into the Syrian refugee crisis and how the government, NGOs, and the military interact. ",
            "\u00a0As someone from a more development heavy background, this course in humanitarian interventions opened my eyes to complexity of humanitarian crises from their nature to the response. I enjoyed hearing from and having opportunities to ask questions from experts in the field - grounding our readings and discussions in reality. ",
            "\u00a0Issues and controversies in humanitarian practices; the relationship between humanitarianism and development, as well as humanitarianism and the military; humanitarian principles and how they are enacted in practice "

        [
            "\u00a0The class discussions could be a bit more structured. The guest speakers were excellent. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course as is ",
            "\u00a0The course is organized well. I think stronger emphasis on individual case studies (as opposed to broad strokes issues) and written responses to guest speakers could make this a better space for critical thinking and slightly more methodological rigor. Also, the student presentations at the beginning of each class were never 10 minutes, and usually ranged closer to a half hour. They were boring if you did the reading, and it would have been better to only have students bring in questions, or plan some innovative presentation of a particular element of that week's material . ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Panter-Brick is very very sweet and caring. She knows when you're tired and when you want to keep pushing on the material. However, the material itself (while an interesting topic) was throughout very surface level. The guest speakers she brought in where a highlight for sure but week to week class wasn't that valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how each class began with a group of 2-3 students summarizing the readings and coming up with discussion questions and key ideas because this really helped focus the conversation and make sure we covered all important aspects of the week's overarching theme. I did find, however, that the conversation tended to dwindle and that by the last 15 minutes or so of class that there was very little to say. A few times, Professor Panter-Brick allotted time at the end for some small group activities that were both engaging and ended the class on a good note, so in the future, I hope these kind of activities are utilized more frequently. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course with great discussion, one thing I would say is somehow making speaking time more equal somehow. Sometimes I felt some people dominated the conversation and others couldn't get a word in. ",
            "\u00a0At times the course didn't feel very structured and I wish we had been able to go into more depth. I also think a greater lecture component would have helped, because I wish we could have had a better idea of Professor Panter-Brick's perspective and the big picture. The speakers were fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great overall. Professor Panter-Brick was lovely  she always had interesting contributions to guide our discussions, relevant anecdotes from personal experience, and a great personality and sense of humor. The course readings were also very interesting. The only improvements I might suggest are more readings earlier on of case studies I really enjoyed the weeks near the end with a lot of case studies of humanitarian actions and the issues those actors faced. I think these would have been incredibly helpful to ground our discussions on more theoretical issues and readings earlier in the course rather than being concentrated in a couple of weeks. I would have also appreciated clearer guidelines earlier on on what our critical analyses and research highlights were supposed to look like. "

            "\u00a0Phenomenal course. MPB is a gem of a professor. Very involved in her field. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are thinking about a career that engages with humanitarian work. This is not the space to learn about critical theories of globalization or third world/post-colonial studies perspectives on humanitarianism, but it is wonderful space to think deeply about humanitarian issues from the perspective of a humanitarian practitioner. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't love this course. As with most medicre seminars, you don't really have to do the reading. Final paper can be interesting if you pick a topic you like. CP-B has weird taste in what she cares about when it comes to papers but the grading is generally generous. That being said, you won't learn a ton because it doesn't go very deep on any topic. The speakers are a highlight though and know a ton. Also, the class depends a lot on who is in it. This year's bunch had a lot of section a**holes, so be wary of that. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is looking to engage in interesting, intellectual, and relevant conversations about humanitarian crises (natural disaster, conflicts, wars, etc.) and how governments, militaries, and NGOs can work together towards the common goal of bringing relief to those suffering. Even if you are someone who has no intention of entering the humanitarian sector professionally, this course is pertinent to most global affairs and international economics approaches, so it is helpful to gain information about how humanitarian efforts are executed and academically analyzed for any field of study. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Panter-Brick is a wonderful supportive professor who clearly delineates her objectives of the course and what she expects of her students both in their engagement and their uptake of information. I learned a lot in this course from actual content to improving my writing and public speaking. Definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for anyone who thinks they might want to do anything relating to humanitarianism. It really opens your eyes about the field and gives you great case studies and opinions to analyze. The workload is manageable and the discussions are great! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Useful for many disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in working in an NGO or in the field of humanitarianism/development in the future, I'd highly recommend this course. It was a good introduction into some of the issues surrounding humanitarian practice and the relationships between humanitarianism and development work, as well as humanitarianism and the military. Professor Panter-Brick is a great professor and keeps the discussions interesting. My only complaint is that the course sometimes felt a little disorganized; the weeks were organized such that the first half was largely theoretical, while the second half had more case studies. Consequently, a lot of the first half of the course was pretty dense, and it was hard to ground our discussions in many real-world examples. The topics in the first half often overlapped, so it could be hard to see what the progression of the course was. Overall though, would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone, regardless of their background in Anthropology or Global Health. It's a great way to inform yourself on current events and to ask yourself challenging questions about what it means to be a humanitarian. "
