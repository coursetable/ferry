            "\u00a0English 120 was fantastic-refreshing after years of science (I am a STEM major). We read wonderful writing, got great feedback on our essays, and I really felt comfortable in the environment. I learned a lot about my personal style and how to write effectively and draw the reader in. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about personal essay writing! Especially the profile, humor, and place essays. Having the opportunity to take a second class with Prof Sexton was great because I also learned how to ask for feedback and incorporate criticism better thanks to the deeper connection with my instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write for an adult audience and how to use a mature tone that was still my own voice. In addition, I gained insight to all the different types of nonfiction pieces there were that aren't related to strict factual sciences. I realized that nonfiction could be just as creative as fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write lengthy essays with ease. I grew more and more comfortable writing as the course moved, and it was nice discussing various works with my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much more direct writer. I think I got a better handle on my voice as an author, and I am grateful for the instruction I received. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to focus on the numerous choices I make throughout the writing process, to create an essay that is engaging and clear. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of how to write in many different ways for different audiences. How to effectively tell a story. How to be funny in writing. How to use detail. The art of the lede. And much more. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths would be the professors-they are incredible and so engaged in the course. They also are very good at moderating conversation. In addition, the seminar format is also excellent-capping the classes is necessary to facilitate the wonderful discussions we had on readings. The only weakness was the one guest speaker we had this year, Emma Allen. I wish we had had normal class because that session was not that informative. ",
            "\u00a0We ran behind the whole time, and often ran out of time to discuss readings. When we did discuss readings, we often only attacked the lede, and didn't get to delve into the overarching structure or literary choices made later on in the essay. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness would be that there weren't more shorter assignments sprinkled throughout that could provide additional opportunities to improve. The Strengths were int he pieces read in class and the workshops and discussion where not only did the students learn how to write, but also how to professionally critique writing. The classroom atmosphere was warm and welcoming; it was easy to speak freely. ",
            "\u00a0It would be helpful if we had discussions structured around a specific theme every once in a while, instead of allowing the conversation to casually flow from topic to topic. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class did a good job remaining personal. Writing is such an individual process, and Professor Sexton does a good job viewing each student's writing as his or her own. However, often time his advice was vague and (at times) unhelpful. He seemed to change his mind throughout the editing process, and often his comments left me confused. ",
            "\u00a0Really loved how workshops operated. Thought we could have stuck to readings a little more. Really liked what we read and the assignments we were given. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You will develop a personal style and love for reading and writing that you may have lost from so much academic writing/reading! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutelytake ENGL 120 with a great professor, and a great professor is Sexton. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to those who want to improve their writing or need to complete a requirement. Otherwise, I wouldn't force someone to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class with Prof. Sexton. He is an experienced writer, an excellent teacher, and offers detailed feedback on all your assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it helped me become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0If you really are interested in nonfiction essays, then perhaps. It does force you to focus on some of the more micro choices in writing, but the course will be frustrating. Often times expectations are unclear and Professor Sexton's feedback is not timely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think I became a much better writer by the end. "
