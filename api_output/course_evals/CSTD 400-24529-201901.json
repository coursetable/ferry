            "\u00a0I learned about the Buddhist underpinnings of mindfulness, its relationship with meditation, the secularization of mindfulness, how exactly to define mindfulness, how mindfulness operates in social interactions, and much more. In addition, since we spent 30 minutes meditating during each class, I learned how to properly conduct meditations such as body scans, open awareness, and loving-kindness. Overall, it was a very informative class, on a subject that is rarely discussed in academia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH about the science, psychology, and historical and religious traditions behind mindfulness and meditation. I loved the interdisciplinary nature of the course. I felt like I became better at reading science articles and feel more confident in approaching scientific articles. Most importantly, the lessons I have learned about mindfulness (nonjudgmental awareness, self-compassion, metacognition) will help me be a happier and healthier person. I feel confident meditating on my own for an hour, and being at peace with my thoughts. The lessons I've learned will help me throughout my life. ",
            "\u00a0Learned many different perspectives on mindfulness and its practice, including historical, psychological, and medicinal. There are many different kinds of mindfulness practice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about mindfulness ",
            "\u00a0Helpful ways to deal with anxiety and stress, how to meditate and its history, and other valuable insights about buddhism and how meditation fits into the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that meditation can change your life and I'm so so grateful this seminar was offered this year. ",
            "\u00a0I got practice with mindfulness. And learned to majorly skim long scientific articles. "

            "\u00a0The class could have been improved with more grading transparency, since we were not made aware of any of our grades until the end of the semester. Also, I would have liked more specificity on the paper assignments because I often felt uneasy not having directions on what exactly to write. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) Meditation practice halfway through the classes was very helpful. I felt like I was becoming a better meditator, and would return to the second half of the class with a better mindset to engage in discussions and lecture. \r\n2) I liked that the course was broken up between lectures and student-led discussions. \r\n3) I liked the scope of the coursehistory, science, and psychology. \r\nImprovements: 1) I would have appreciated a smaller reading load with the most important readings. I found myself reading one piece a week in great detail and then having to skim the rest due to time constraints. The scientific articles were especially daunting, and I would have appreciated having more time to read them. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the balance of discussion and lecture. The multidisciplinary nature of the material covered was also good. I wish that there had been more material and that there had been more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really interesting and I learned a lot about mindfulness. I think clearer instructions about assignments and more timely feedback on them would make the course better. ",
            "\u00a0It was not very organized and we never got grades. Right now checking grades I have no idea what I have. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong because of its meditations each class and fruitful discussions, the only weakness would be the quizzes as they seemed slightly different from  the focus of the course/its topics. ",
            "\u00a0I love that the course provides scientific backing to the practice of mindfulness. Many people are skeptical of meditation because they believe it lacks evidence,  and the class incorporates the discussion of neuroscience and cognitive psychology in its teaching of mindfulness, which I find really useful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It was not a good class. The classes were boring and monotonous. We read all of these semi-irrelevant readings and then spent a full 1.5 hours reviewing the thing we already read. It was so boring and poorly structured. "

            "\u00a0Yes! A great course. Not only will you learn a lot from the interdisciplinary nature of the course (history of religious traditions, science, psychology, mindfulness in society), but you will become a more mindful person. I can now meditate up to an hour by myself, without guidance from a meditation leader or audio. This class really improved my understandings of how the mind works and how I can apply it to my life to be happier and healthier person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an interesting class without too much effort/rigor. ",
