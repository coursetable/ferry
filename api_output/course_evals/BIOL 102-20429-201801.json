It felt like a poorly taught high school class in that we were looking at different aspects of cell biology, but in such a superficial way that it ended up being a class of straight memorization and regurgitation rather than genuine understanding and critical thought. I understand that it is an introductory level course, and, as such, it should give a \"taste\" of each aspect of cell biology, but the time spent on each topic was so fleeting that we failed to actually learn any of the skills required to be a real scientist.

I found discussion sections really helpful for cementing what I learned and to go over the topics I wasn't as sure about. ",

The homework problems were generally representative of material covered on exams, and having the TFs go over one homework problem during section with the opportunity to ask questions was extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nAt times, there was a clear continuity between the things we'd learned in BIOL 101 and this class; at others, the transition was difficult. This class, in general, felt less well-designed to facilitate student learning than 101, because we had one single midterm instead of weekly quizzes, lecture slides were only posted the morning of class and contained far less info on them, sometimes the readings did not match up very well with what was discussed in class and seemed to offer unnecessary background info. ",

This was a major disadvantage to athletes taking this course who cannot miss practices. ",

",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it has very interesting material and that even though it is a lecture class, it is relatively engaging with discussion and activities. The course could be improved with more practice questions within lecture or more discussion of the application and process of experimental methods. ",
            "\u00a0The sections should be more engaging and the homework questions need to better reflect the content of exams. ",
            "\u00a0The course does give a good overview of general cell biology, but it lacked detailed explanations and organized notes. Many times, the powerpoint slides presented in lecture were not exactly as they were in the print-outs, which made the student's job much harder to get all of the necessary information to succeed in the class. Also, most lecture slides contained only minimal explanation of the diagram of picture presented, which meant that the student had to try to gather most of the important information orally from the professor. This made it hard for anyone who wrote slowly or did not fully understand what was happening to keep up. It would be very useful to slow the lecture down, go through each slide in depth, and make sure that people have time to write down the necessary information. I think this would reduce the number of clarification questions asked because more people would be able to get all of the proper details for each slide. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches you the basics of cellular biology and I think does a good job of trying to create critical thinking capacity rather than just forcing you to memorize terms. However, it was somewhat unorganized (lectures and readings didn't really line up at times). ",

I also didn't like the new quiz format - I like doing readings for a unit after we cover it in lecture (especially because exams only test material covered in lecture and if you do the readings after the lecture you know what to focus on) and the pre-lecture quizzes meant that you had to superficially skim the readings before lecture, which then just encourages leaving the reading at that.

I understand that this is part of intro biology sequence and is meant to be the most basic biology course taught at Yale, but I think that it could benefit from being split into two or three different levels based on the preparedness of students, like how the first-year chemistry courses are split. While enrichment exists for the students who are less prepared or have not taken AP/IB Biology classes, the class is taught at a level that is too simplistic for more experienced students. This is not a complaint, but considering that the course is a requirement for many more advanced science majors and that it is unlikely to place out of the intro biology sequence, it would make sense to either increase the content difficulty of the class or split it into various levels.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I would suggest a minor improvement on the types of questions that are asked on homework and exams. Currently, most of the questions involve several paragraphs of reading with only very small pieces of relevant information, which then lead to extremely simplistic answers. Though this helps to develop the skill of extracting useful information, I think it would be more useful to make questions either difficult enough to warrant the lengthy descriptions, or to simplify the descriptions to match the simplicity of the current questions.

Therefore, instructors in the class (Prof. Sam Lin) don't really care about the needs of students and are super rigid with regards to everything, even the simplest things. In this class, I felt like everyone was making sure that my life was the hardest possible, and there is absolutely no flexibility with regards to anything. For instance, ask any piazza question they will ask you to look at the syllabus, even if it has to do with desmosomes or vesicle formation. I regret taking this class so much, and this is mainly due to the way instructors dealt with students. Professor Horsley on the other hand tried to be as helpful as possible. ",

However, the course can feel restrictive at times: Whenever a student had a question that went beyond the context of the course, but still related to cellular biology, the TAs and professors would often dismiss the question. Additionally, the professor didn't always seem prepared for lectures--some of her answers to questions contained incorrect or confusing information. The grading on the homework assignments was fair, if a bit harsh at times and overly concerned with wording.

These practice exercises gave me the opportunity to explore the knowledge more deeply and identify my areas of weaknesses in my understanding.

Rather than talking about things in vague terms, the course really focused on making sure students had the correct vocabulary to talk about biology. A weakness of this course is that the textbook was not well matched to the lecture. On one hand the textbook we used was very impressive in the detail it would provide; however, its level of detail was beyond the scope of the course and had the effect of making it difficult to parse out what was important to know for the class. The quizzes exacerbated this problem by asking very nit-picky questions that were not the type we would see on an exam. I preferred the quiz system in 101 because it made you study every weekend and gave a better sense of what kind of knowledge we needed to know. Another weakness of the course was the totally disorganized slides. Unlike in 101, where each slide very clearly fit in the overall presentation and was clearly labeled to state the key points, the slides in 102 were really difficult to follow when reviewing. Our professor also often changed the slides the night before class without updating them on canvas making it a struggle to take notes because I would print out the slides before class and take notes on them. The final weakness of the course was the inconsistency of the study guides with the slides. The study guide often did a poor job reflecting the slides and would occasionally add new information that was never discussed in section or lecture.  Because it was already hard to tell what we had to know from the textbook, not being able to turn to the study guide or the slides for a definitive list increased that challenge. ",

For instance (and this is just one example), a student was asked to refrain from asking \"these types of questions\" when they asked about effectors and second messengers because apparently the slides directly answered that question. When I went to the slides specified in the response (and looked at the slides around it), though, the only information there was a very vague definition of an effector and the fact that second messengers could be effectors.

A lot of the material in this course consists of rote memorization of uninteresting. highly-specific topics. The lectures were bad, but the lecture slides were even worse, so you're screwed regardless of whether or not you choose to attend lecture. The study guides don't even come close to including all of the highly specific material that you'll be tested on. You'll likely have to endure the painfully boring, occasionally incorrect lectures if you want to have a chance at knowing... what exactly you should (theoretically) be learning in the course. Sections are fairly useful for reviewing material, but they cover material at a much lower level than you'll be tested on. \r\n\r\nIf you're considering this course, you're likely a premed or a bio major anyways and don't have a choice. Don't worry; it will get better. ",

She does not actually teach. She merely reads off of her already confusing and vague slides, which only explains concepts with circular definitions. The tests do not access how well you understand biology; the tests only access how well you can regurgitate exactly what they envision your response to be. The material covered on the tests is completely different from what her lectures aim to, but fail to, teach. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you have a genuine love for science and biology. This class is way too detailed and involved in order to take it as a gut science class. The pre-class quizzes are untimed and generally easy, the homework assignments are definitely easier than BIOL 101, and the midterm/final are probably the worst part of the class. "
