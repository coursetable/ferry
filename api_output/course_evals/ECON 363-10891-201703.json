I have also gained key insights on the key causes and indicators of general financial crises. I now feel that I understand what happened and am better equipped to combat financial crises in the future. ",

Having had very little knowledge about the financial system beforehand, I learned a lot about the major financial institutions and their relationships with each other as well as with government agencies. I feel that I gained some technical knowledge about finance that I didn't expect. ",

I'm now able to evaluate many more of the op-eds and books written about the crisis/financial regulation/the banking system from a more objective, evidence-backed point of view. I've also learned so much more about how debt and liquidity operates in our  financial system, as well as the function of various financial giants/about shadow banking and layers to our financial intermediation system that I did not know before. Would highly recommend to anyone curious about why 2007 happened and what we did in the aftermath. ",

We got to interact with people who were directly involved with government interventions, especially former Treasury Secretary (and head of the NY Fed) Timothy Geithner. ",

Metrick is an incredible lecturer (possibly the best I've had) and brings in incredible guest lecturers that are experts on their respective topics. Tim Geithner is very interesting to listen to but he only give 3.5 lectures so he isn't REALLY a Co-Lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Metrick is very skilled at giving an in-depth explanation about complex aspects of the financial system that could have otherwise been very dry. I think the class was well-designed to encourage as much critical thinking and discussion as possible. It did sometimes feel as though we were jumping around chronologically on the timeline of the crisis, but that might've just been the nature of how everything was interrelated. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: metrick was a great lecturer, I liked the series of memos - they really solidified my understanding of certain conceps - I also thought the outside-of-class coursera lectures were helpful to my understanding and enjoyed the \"flipped classroom\" format\r\n\r\nweaknesses: I thought that sometimes, the Q&A got tiring and did not seem to have a particular direction even if it revolved around a theme. the large classroom format also did not mesh well with any true \"discussion\" - I would suggest maybe more classes that are breakout sessions in the future (the ones which we did do I really enjoyed) to encourage each individual student to speak and engage more as the professor rotates between the classrooms? or maybe having one large prompt for discussion that everyone can jump in on during class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of class worked overall, lecture/discussion format was good\r\nWeaknesses: Maybe if there were more background readings provided on some basic finance (i.e. ABCP, stocks, funds, etc.) that would be helpful ",

I would definitely recommend it to anyone regardless of whether they are specifically interested in the financial system - the lessons we learned about policymaking and thinking about risk will probably be useful in any other area of work.

This class is NOT A GUT- there is a lot of writing for it- but you will learn a lot!\r\n\r\nMetrick is a great lecturer, and it is super cool having Tim Geithner come and speak! Some guest lecturers (e.g. Robert Shiller) were not very good, whereas others (Gary Gorton) were great.\r\n\r\nI learned A LOT about finance and about the Global Financial Crisis. I think that the inverted classroom actually works pretty well. Most classes are just Metrick answering questions submitted the night before, but I do wish that he would answer more of those questions, as we tended to get sidetracked and waste 30 minutes on one question.\r\n\r\nI obviously don't know my grades yet, but I think it should be graded fairly easily. This is my ideal Yale class- do a lot of work, and get an A\r\n\r\nI preferred the memos from the first half of the semester to the longer papers of the second half, because frequent memos forced me to have an understanding of the topics, while these longer papers just forced me to understand a handful of topics. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Absolutely crucial class to understand where the global economy is today. ",
            "\u00a0This class is probably my favorite class I've taken since coming to Yale. Professor Metrick is seriously AMAZING, just a wonderful person and a wonderful lecturer. I feel like I've learned so much through this class--I came in with literally no knowledge of how our financial system worked. More than just understanding the crisis, this class is a really great primer for understanding the financial system. It's seriously a phenomenal class, and I highly recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the economy or just having a basic knowledge of how the economy works. \r\n\r\nBe warned though: even though I loved this class, it is SO MUCH WORK. Everyone I talked to has shared this sentiment. As someone who has next to zero econ-related knowledge, I think the amount of work was justified and really enriched my understanding of the material, but if you don't like writing, don't take this class. Not only is it flipped, you have a bunch of papers to write throughout the semester that require you to do a bunch of extra reading on pretty complicated subjects. I know this would never happen, but the workload warrants either a writing credit or the class being 1.5 credits. \r\n\r\nOverall, amazing class, HIGHLY recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to get a better understanding of what happened during the global financial crisis and what consequences that later had for the eurozone and our financial system (as well as political impacts) today. despite the amount of times the phrase \"break up the big banks\" has been heard, most people probably have not seen the data/research into the crisis (I know I didn't before this class) which is really helpful for getting an objective basis for opinion. Additionally, Metrick is an AMAZING lecturer - he really takes time to make sure that everyone understands what's happening and conveys information very clearly. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Metrick is a great dude, school of management students can be super interesting bring a tonne of ~wisdom~ to the discussions. \r\nBeware, it's not a \"hard\" course but there is a LOT of work.\r\n\r\nGood for anyone vaguely interested in finance, history, law and policy to take. Awesome guest lectures and super interesting material. \r\n\r\nWish there was more focus on effects of the crisis on people, specifically minorities who were disproportionately affected by it. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course - I have reviewed in the grad evaluation ",

            "\u00a0I think every Yale student who's interested in finance, whether academically or professionally, should take this course. Metrick and the TAs spend so much time giving individual feedback and making sure that everyone can keep up. If you're hoping to work on Wall Street or in government, this class might help you prevent the next crisis! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, it was intellectually stimulating and so cool to understand the crisis that affected our lives so acutely in such detail. ",
            "\u00a0The video lectures contain most of the content of the course (and they are available on Coursera), so Prof. Metrick dedicated most of the 90-minute classes to Q&A sessions. This really took away the incentive to show up to class since that's a long time to listen to answers to other people's questions. The lectures are presented logically and are extremely interesting, but again they're available on Coursera. Take it if you'd like, but you're basically enrolling in an online class. ",

There are many guest speakers which keeps it different and allows you to hear from people who were directly involved in the regulatory and corporate side of the crisis. ",
