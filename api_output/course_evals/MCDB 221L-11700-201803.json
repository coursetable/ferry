            "\u00a0This course helped me develop fundamental bio laboratory skills. I also learned how to better write about science in a succinct manner. ",
            "\u00a0You work with a variety of model organisms (Tetrahymena, fruit flies, zebrafish, C. elegans, etc.) and learn a lot of techniques (ELISA assay, PCR, gel electrophoresis, spectrophotometry, etc.). You also learn the techniques of scientific writing (after all this is a WR course). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a few basic biology techniques used across a wide amount of fields in biology, which was nice. I was an older student who took this course, and some of this stuff I had learned through other courses or research. This class would definitely teach students more as first-years. The class is less focused on the actual model organisms as the title would imply. I would say its more about basic biological research techniques and wiring scientifically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write legit scientific papers (in the form of lab reports). Practiced basic biology lab techniques like pipetting and microscopy. Learned how to think about and design experiments to test a certain question. ",

            "\u00a0TOO MUCH WORK! This class was by far my biggest workload, and worth the least amount of credit. While playing with the techniques was interesting, I would not take this class again or recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing I would like to see improved is allowing students to work more at their own pace. Getting all 16 students on the same page was often difficult which made the class take longer than it should have. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the wide range of organisms that are covered. The ability to actually work with different species is really interesting and a great opportunity. Each week there is something a bit new and different. The whole class also works together a lot which is really great. Dr. Moreno also makes an effort to learn the names of all her students and knows who everyone is, which is missing in a lot of biology classes. Weakness would be clarity. There are many times where things are a bit confusing, whether it is protocols or the reports. Making the guidelines more clear on what is expected from the reports and notebook entries would greatly improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0One major weakness is the lack of feedback. Essentially all of my lab reports were written only having received one graded report. I think that feedback should be much more transparent both for the lab notebook and the lab reports so that students know what to improve on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material is really really really COOL!!! You get to view amazing stuff and actually get to work with many organisms :) Professor Moreno is also a great strength of this class. She is really caring, chill, and is happy to answer your questions whenever you have one. \r\nWeaknesses: the workload is overwhelming sometimes. We had 5 lab reports this semester and each one requires around ~10 hours of work (except the last one which was really easy). The workload seems to taper off towards the end of the semester when we transitioned from lab reports to lab notebook entries though, but if you take class be prepared to be hit with the heavy workload during the first half of the semester. Also the grading seems to be inconsistent sometimes and it feels like the TA's grade your stuff based on whether your lab report meets each bulletin point in some obscure rubric (that you will never see) that they decided themselves. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is the Moreno hand-designed it, so each lab has some sort of purpose. I really like how Moreno put a list of labs that research whatever we were doing that week; that is super helpful for first-year students looking for research. Moreno was present during lab, which was also nice. Getting to work with the different model organisms was fun, although this was limited in its scope. As far as weaknesses go, the class sort of confused me at times because it felt like we were doing nothing a lot of the time. The actual lab time seemed really drawn out most of the time for now reason for like 70% of the experiments. Moreno definitely views the class as a class geared toward scientific writing, and, as such, there were lots of writing in the notebooks/lab reports. The lab notebook was a bit strange because some of the stuff we wrote in there, particularly toward the end of the semester seemed unnecessary/redundant. I see what Moreno was going for with the lab reports, but some of them were very, very long for no real reason and, more importantly, there was often not much instruction about how the data/figures were to be made/analyzed, which led to people doing different things in the Results section. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was Prof. Moreno. She works so hard to get the course together and guide us through the labs. She is always on top of it and knows what she is doing. We had to write a lot of long lab reports, but that could be both a strength and a weakness. The strength is that we got a lot of practice writing a scientific paper and presenting it in a professional format, which is necessary to get better. The weakness is that they took hours on end, and the expectations were often not clear. The experiments done in class were not stressful at all, and overall I really enjoyed being in class. It was a nice escape from all my other stressful things in life. ",
            "\u00a0Tons of work every single week. Not fair it's only 0.5 credits. Learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for someone like me with very little biology lab experience. The experiments were interesting and facilitated my learning of biological concepts as well as how to use lab equipment. One weakness was the workload. Although there were only 5 lab reports, most of them took a very long time to complete (literally a whole week). The expectations for them also werent very clear, which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the many opportunities to do hands on work. The weakness was that it was poorly organized. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that Dr. Moreno carefully designs each lab, and each lab stands on its own and is interesting. A weakness is that depending on the size of your class, there can be a lot of waiting around as Dr. Moreno or your TA are organizing logistics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this class definitely exposed me to what real world science looks like. Every experiment consists of a Design Your Experiment component that allowed us to apply what we learned in class and test our ability to come up with an experiment to test a specific hypothesis. It really allowed me to start thinking critically and scientifically. \r\nOne small weakness is the disorganization of the class. For most of the lab reports, the instructions were unclear. The expectations of the professor and all the TAs were very different. Maybe in the future, during class time, if the professor could take 10 minutes to discuss what is expected on the lab report, that would make the class more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Moreno is a fantastic, detail-oriented, caring, and informative instructor. You can tell she really cares about her students, so it's great to work with her. The lab time itself is not overly strenuous and you get to become close with a small group of other biologists. Working with a variety of organisms keeps things fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lab reports were very lengthy and tended to be more full of \"busy work\" than I would have preferred. It was nice later in the semester when we had fewer lab reports, however. "

            "\u00a0TOO MUCH WORK! This class was by far my biggest workload, and worth the least amount of credit. While playing with the techniques was interesting, I would not take this class again or recommend it to anyone. Also, we rarely got clear feedback on our assignments so you never really knew what to do or how to do it or if you were doing it right. Unless you HAVE to take this course, don't do it. ",
            "\u00a0If you wanna learn basic lab techniques, this is a very good class for it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class. I was initially hesitant to take this class due to the writing credit, but it ended up being a good experience. There are only 4 lab reports and then a final writeup after the final lab. There are notebook entries too, but those arent too bad. The writeups can take a while, but once you get a hand of the style and expectations from each section they get a lot better. There may be some frustration at times with the lack of clarity on expectations and some different points. But dr. moreno makes an effort to get to know all the students and really cared that her students are learning and taking something out of the class. You also get the chance to actually work with real organisms, which is a really cool opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to many pre-med students especially without lab experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Although the workload is not light, the amazing model organisms and the professor far outweigh the stress brought about by the workload. You won't regret taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0It's kind of hard for me to answer this question because I am a bit confused about this course still, even after taking it. Like, it wasn't horrific, but also I'm not sure that we did *anything*? I'm not really sure that I learned anything. Sometimes labs were fun, but often students are just siting there a bit confused as to Moreno's \"master plan.\" Moreno is a character though, and the class might be worth taking just to experience having Moreno teaching you. But yah, I am not sure if I can actually recommend this class. It's a lot of work for (nothing)? I took this class for no reason other than curiosity, so it may have been a waste of time for me, but if you are just looking for a bio lab for some reason, this might be a good fit? Idk? I'm still a bit confused. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because of the instructor. There is a lot of work, but it is worth it to develop the writing skills and lab notebook entry skills that are necessary in the real world if you are thinking about doing research. The experiments were laid out nicely for us and we received sufficient guidance for the experiments. Just make sure you aren't taking like biochem along with this, because it is really a lot of work in terms of the lab reports, although it gets much better towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0Tons of time in lab and working on long lab reports but professor Moreno is amazing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course but with caution. This is probably one of the best intro level bio labs you can take to fulfill pre-med requirements. However, you will have to put in a lot of hours to do the lab reports and lab notebook correctly. So as long as you are aware that the work is a lot more than other 0.5 credit courses and willing to put in the work, youll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was very practical and quite enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I found the labs to be really interesting, and Dr. Moreno is really knowledgable and willing to help if you have questions about what you're doing. The five lab reports are each a lot of work (probably at least 10 hours each), but manageable, especially if you space out the work. Dr. Moreno is also flexible with deadlines if you happen to be really swamped at some point in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0All of the lab reports take a really long time to write, and really everything in this class ends up taking way more time than expected. But if you do the work, then the grading is very fair. So really as long as you put in the time, this is a really good lab class for the MCDB requirement. You also get half a writing credit so thats a plus. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a biology major, this is certainly a solid lab course to take. Especially if you have limited exposure to working in a lab, this class will teach you the basicshow to organize your lab notebook, how to write a lab report, how to pipette properly, how to culture bacteria, how to run a PCR, etc. The best part of the class is definitely getting to learn from Professor Moreno. She is one of those teachers who you can clearly tell cares about her students and wants them to actually learn. If you are having a crazy week and need an extension, Professor Moreno is always empathetic to that need, as long as you are responsible. This is a class where hard work pays off. Although the lab sessions are quite relaxed and enjoyable, the bulk of the class work comes from the lengthy, and somewhat tedious, lab reports. These lab reports require an introduction, results with figures, a discussion sectionmany of the basic components of a real scientific paper. In part, Professor Moreno wants you to have experience with this type of writing. As someone who has worked in a lab, I can't say that I learned that much new information. Perhaps some other lab classes would have taught me more content and been more challenging content-wise. However, I thoroughly enjoyed learning  from Professor Moreno, so I found the class worth it.
