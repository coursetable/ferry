            "\u00a0I learned a lot about process control. This is a subject that you have no exposure to before this class, so there is a lot of information to be absorbed, but you gain a new way of thinking and better understanding for the ways in which materials and processes combine to produce different effects. ",
            "\u00a0In the first half of the course I felt like I was really learning, but the second half was more like I was just doing things because I was told that's what was correct. Obviously if you're taking this it's required for chem eng, so you don't have a choice. Some aspects of this course we're rewarding, but it was also a bit of a mess. ",

            "\u00a0This course is very hard and Altman does not seem to care. He provides little guidance and a lot of snobbish comments when we don't understand things. This course could be improved by finding a new teacher. ",
            "\u00a0The project for this course is extremely vague and confusing and took students endless hours. The project description definitely could have been a lot more straightforward, and time should have been devoted during lecture to helping students complete the project tasks. In addition, tasks for the project were due weekly, and on top of weekly problem sets, this was asking way too much of students. ",
            "\u00a0In the beginning and end of this course I generally liked the professor, but during the middle it was horrible. During the beginning I thought he was a good teacher who cared about teaching, and during the end I felt the same because of how committed he is on helping with the semester project, but during the middle, when the material became less and less logical, he seemed to be disappointed by us and insult us every lecture. It was highly demotivating. I think it would be extremely helpful to force students to meet with him once in the beginning of the semester one on one so we are not intimidated by him, because once I came in a lot for the project, I felt a lot more comfortable around him and asking him questions. Some of my other professors have done this with great success. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Matthew (the TA), the clear notes for the first half of the semester\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Altman (it was clear that he didn't actually care about his students), the unclear and rushed notes for the second half of the semester (after the midterm, notes became rushed and it seemed as if Professor Altman was no longer concerned with actually teaching the material and just wanted to throw as much information as possible at us in the given time without actually teaching), the assignment of a final and a final project (it was unrealistic of Professor Altman to think that the amount of work he gave us during the semester - weekly problem sets, a midterm, a final, and a semester long project - was fair or reasonable; it addition to this, what we were taught in class was not nearly sufficient to prepare us to complete the final project) ",
            "\u00a0Course is hard and a bit disorganized. There's a lot of information and you never really know what you need to know. ",

            "\u00a0NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. This course sucks. I enjoy the material, but the way it is taught is just terrible. If you are reading this review it means that this course is being offered again with the same professor and I am very sorry that that is the case. You will perhaps gain camaraderie with your fellow classmates who will be as frustrated as you. ",
            "\u00a0On a scale of 1-5 in terms of workload, I would give this class a 7. This course has weekly problem sets, an extremely difficult project that must be done throughout the course of the semester, and a midterm and a final exam. The workload was such that I would have been stressed out and busy even if this was my only class. I do not recommend taking this course unless it is required of you. ",

            "\u00a0If you are taking this class you don't have a choice, but if you have the opportunity to take his class with Loewenberg, do it. This class simply just asks too much. the problem sets are very challenging and take up very significant amounts of time, and doing those in tandem with a final project was just too much to ask. ",
