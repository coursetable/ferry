            "\u00a0I learned how to parse a screenplay, how to follow an idea through, how to write and re-write scenes. I also learned the structure of a film's narrative. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about film theory and writing screenplays. It was brilliant, you must take this class if film interests you. ",
            "\u00a0All tools and applications: theme, set-up, catalyst, midpoint, acts, final contest and final image; how characters react to events, how a cinematographer sees, how to structure an act most effectively, how to open your eyes and see the pains and wonders of life. All done succinctly! Fewest words on the lecture slides! ",
            "\u00a0Beyond basic story structure, I really learned to tap into my inspiration and flush out the story brewing in my subconscious. This was such an eye-opening process for me and I learned so much about myself in thinking through the story I wanted to tell. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned an immense appreciation for film, how to parse a film, the structure of a film, and the art of distilled screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything, this course taught me how to approach the process of movie storytelling - how to dive into the world being created, how to structure the flow of the plot, how to develop characters. I learned many tools to craft a screenplay and new lenses through which to analyze and appreciate films. ",
            "\u00a0I am much more capable of critically watching movies after taking this class. I have a better understanding of structure, motifs, and the like. I have also learned many strategies for defining your own characters, their journeys, motivations, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lots about story structure and screenwriting. Moreover, I learned lots of different integral filmmakers that I did not have exposure to prior. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to structure screenplays, how to set up storylines and characters, story pacing, how to place narrative and emotional turning points, and much more. This class has taught me so much about understanding film structure and visual storytelling, and helped me improve my writing. "

            "\u00a0I think that one of the simultaneous strengths and weaknesses is that the class has a very freeform structure. I think that the best part of that is that the class would go where the students needed it to go, but sometimes I would have preferred to have gone into class with a bit more intention or expectation. I would also say that there were very productive assignments and meaningful meetings outside of class that I think contributed positively to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Only strengths! This class was extraordinary. Camille is a gift. You will learn so much about writing, thinking, and film. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Camille is a wonderful professor who makes you really want to engage with the work she's giving you. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomasson is an angel, no flaws in her teaching. Believe what EVERYone says. ",
            "\u00a0This course balances learning from film and learning from your own story. At times you find yourself taking time away from your script but I believe the only thing that could improve this is more time but that may not be feasible. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this course is nearly flawless. I do wish there was a bit more workshopping during class, but Camille's constructive criticism is so insanely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized, and the workload never felt overwhelming, yet still felt substantial. However, it is best taken upon yourself to meet with Camille or others in the class about your script in between deadlines, otherwise, you have one 4 page assignment and one 15 page assignment, with nothing in between. But this is a matter of self responsibility that is then demanded not necessarily a fault of the class. ",
            "\u00a0There is very little I would change about this course.  It was very well done and every class period felt purposeful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0All of the writing exercises are extremely helpful to make you understand a story from different perspectives and improve it. They give lots of insight on how to develop stories and characters. Professor Thomasson's feedback is incredibly detailed and perceptive and really helps you improve your writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I think that to get the full benefit of this course someone would really have to invest time after the course completing, and revising a full script, but given the interest I personally have developed that is my intention. I think that ultimately this course is best done with either previous creative writing experience or a good understanding of film, either historically or critically. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if you have any interest in screenwriting. You will be surrounded by lovely, caring peers and a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You have to take this class, material and professor are phenomenal! ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes, take this course to share her devotion and appreciation to the cinema and life! You get what you put into this course, and I gave it my all. I'm still realizing the handsome reward, and I hope others can partake in the effort and joy. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in film or screenwriting or just want to explore a new creative outlet, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0This course is the best course I have taken at Yale. If you have any interest in film, take this course. If you have any interest in writing, take this course. If you have any interest in working with one of the best professors at Yale, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This has simply been the best course I've taken at Yale with the best professor I've had at Yale. Just take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to anyone with any interest whatsoever, regardless of major or experience. If you take the class for nothing else, Professor Thomasson alone is worth the investment. She is an amazing professor and person, who comes to class with food, an infectious enthusiasm, and created an environment that felt relaxed but still engaging. I don't look at movies the same anymore after having had this class. A part of me has to accept the fact that the class is over, but my script, which I have been inspired to continue, the knowledge/skills I've gained, and the relationships I've formed will surely continue forward because of it. This is one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. It is perfect for film majors or non-majors that want a very good introduction into writing a feature-length script. Professor Thomasson is phenomenal at fostering a creative environment for students. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in writing fiction, especially anyone who wants to write for film or television. The class really helps build your understanding of how these stories are written, and is a very supportive workshop atmosphere. "
