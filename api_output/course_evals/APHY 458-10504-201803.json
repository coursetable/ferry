            "\u00a0The theories covered in this course dont go past basic electromagnetism. Rather the course focuses on discussing interesting applications of optical systems in a variety of fields from biology to quantum devices to telecommunications. I found this course useful in brushing up my knowledge of optics, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning about cleverly designed optical devices in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a good understanding of optics in its classic and modern applications. It has a good balance of learning about cutting edge research while also gaining an understanding for the fundamental principles of optics. "

            "\u00a0I think perhaps this course could benefit from having problem sets cover the theory-of-operation behind some devices more deeply. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the broad range of topics covered and the understanding Professor Cao has for the material. It could be improved if some of the lectures were taught at a little slower pace or if some of the math was spelled out more explicitly in class. As a whole, it was a great class. The final and presentation felt like they could have been shortened by a couple pages and 5-10 minutes respectively. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I think Professor Cao is a fantastic lecturer. She organizes her slides well and covers a bunch of highly interesting topics. Not particularly difficult, but I came out of it feeling like I had learnt a lot! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any physics major looking for a different elective that provides an understanding of a field that the rest of the major does not teach. Lectures can be overwhelming and advanced at times, but the problem sets are very fair. It ends up being a good balance. If the term paper is still 8-10 pages single-spaced, beware, it is likely longer than the thesis you will write. "
