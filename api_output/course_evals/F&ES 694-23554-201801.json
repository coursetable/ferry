            "\u00a0Learned to see the issue of invasive species from many different angles. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much better grasp of how to approach complex issues and how to look critically at all sides of a problem. Of course, I also learned a lot about species invasion from ecological, social, policy, and economic standpoints. However, even more than the invasive species content, I felt that the gist this course was about how to engage simultaneously with both the environmental and the social sides of real-world questions. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a great course! I learned a TON about invasion and also was provided a fantastic example of really top notch discussion facilitation and how professors can be extremely respectful and create a very safe learning environment. One of my favorite courses ever! ",
            "\u00a0In addition to the actual course content I also learned: How to read, digest, and respond to academic readings. How to participate in meaningful dialogues about topics that I am less familiar with. How to read across disciplines ",
            "\u00a0This course did a good job looking at both sides of the invasive species debate. Many of the species we covered had negative ecological effects, but had positive economic effects. We also talked a lot about who and how species are categorized and invasive, and whether or not we have the regulations and procedures in place to combat invasive species. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were one of the most valuable components of the class. I loved reading all the \"seminal\" papers in invasion ecology, and I wish there were more reading seminars at F&ES to engage in the primary literature. Both field trips I went on were also super informative (the USDA Quarantine facility and NYBG). ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about invasive species ecology and management, current policy debates, and prevention/ eradication/ control efforts. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion facilitation - each student was responsible for leading two 2-hour discussions on complex topics throughout the semester, which required not only a deep understanding of the material, but also thoughtfulness about how to present the material, how to ask rigorous questions that would get people talking, respecting all group members' opinions, etc.\r\n\r\nInvasive Species - I came into this course with very little knowledge about native/non-native/invasive species, outside of a garden-management perspective. I learned so much from Marlyse, Sara and all my classmates about different philosophies and approaches to management, how invasive species interact in an ecosystem and landscape, etc. "

            "\u00a0Well aligned, but would have liked a bit more on invasive plant ID. ",
            "\u00a0That focus on problem solving and critical thinking was not what I expected going into the class, but I'm very glad for it. I don't think that learning about invasive species without that framework would have been nearly as helpful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Very well - the course matched its description. ",
            "\u00a0Better than expected - I obtained skills and insights from this course that I never anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0I was looking forward to this course, and felt that we covered a lot in the semester. A lot of the species we looked at were ones that I had either never heard of, or knew little about. I was a little worried at first that because the professor's background is plants, that the majority of the invasive species we would be discussing would be plants. But she purposefully made an effort to balance invasive plant species with invasive animals, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course aligned with my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. I learned a lot in this class about invasive species ecology and management, current policy debates, and prevention/ eradication/ control efforts. It exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectations! When I signed up for the course, I didn't know much about the subject matter itself, but was so drawn to taking a class with Marylse since I had such a great experience with her during MODs. I was excited by a discussion-based course, led by two female professors, on a topic that was being approached from multiple perspectives: environmental, economic, political, philosophical. In that way, the course very much aligned with my expectations! "

            "\u00a0This was such a valuable course, and opportunity to learn about invasive species specifically, and how to navigate as a woman in science today. The discussions each week were interesting and useful, and felt like a safe space to explore new ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course was the discussion format, and how much I was able to learn from every single person in the class. I appreciated how Marlyse and Sara taught what they know, but also opened up room for everyone else to share their areas of expertise. The flip side of this format is that the class sometimes felt a bit too loosely structured. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the discussion structure and the facilitation by the instructors. The weakness was that three hours is a long time for a discussion. I think the class worked best when we had a case presented alongside our discussion. I would recommend having a case of some sort for every class. I also think it would be helpful to have the readings in a bit more context, whether that be provided by the instructors before we did the readings or included as a written note. It seemed like some members of the course had a knowledge of the author's already and so that provided them with some helpful context but that was not knowledge that we all shared. ",
            "\u00a0excellent selection of readings and field trips. Discussions were interesting and open - this is the ONLY course I have taken at FES where the professors truly created an open and accepting environment for dialogue to take place. I found myself - as well as other in the class - who are often more quite and reserved gain confidence and a voice through the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nOnly weakness was addressed in mid-semester evaluation that earlier in the semester some of the discussions were too long and not as direct - Marlyse and Sara swiftly responded to this by opening each discussion with a short presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of this course was the small class size. The professor purposefully wanted to keep the class size to a maximum of 10 or 12 students, which I think was a good idea. This was the first semester where I took discussion courses, and I wasn't sure if I would like it, but I felt like it was usually easy to ask questions and pose your opinion. Everyone was very polite, and the professor would ensure that we led the discussions rather than have her lead them. \r\nI also really enjoyed the other subjects we branched off into also, in relation to invasive species (like the ethical implications of managing for invasive species) and the sciences overall. This included women in the sciences. Maybe this had something to do with the class being made up entirely of women, but it was still really great.\r\nI also really liked that we had the choice to take the course for either two or three credits. I had a pretty heavy workload this semester, so having a little less work to really about was really appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my favorite class I have taken at F&ES. Overall, the quality of teaching at F&ES has been disappointing. Faculty are rewarded for research-- not teaching--and I have never been in an institution where that was more apparent than F&ES. However, Marlyse and Sara break this mold; they are two of the most inspiring instructors that I have ever had. Facilitating a three hour discussion is an extremely difficult task, but their level of engagement and knowledge was so high that they were able to seamlessly facilitate a student-led discussion and take advantage of teaching moments. \r\n\r\nI loved having guest speakers in the beginning of class (or another presentation). Three hours is a bit long for a discussion, so it's nice to structure the class with presentation or guest speaker to start. This would also ensure that we are learning not just from each other (the students) but also from others with different perspectives/experience. \r\n\r\nThe field trips were great. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a wonderful class and I found it highly engaging, educational and thought-provoking. Marlyse's and Sara's leadership was a highlight. They were both wonderful instructors - deeply thoughtful, considerate, and knowledgable. After this experience, I would highly recommend taking a class with Marylse to any forestry student! She is a rockstar. \r\n\r\nThe only part of the class I did not enjoy or find helpful was the debate at the end of the semester. The format seem contrived to me, the time constraints didn't allow for deep engagement in the material, and, compared to our typical discussions and work, it felt a bit like busy work. Other than that, I really liked just about everything about this course! Including the field-trips, which were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Discussion Based Format\r\n- Nuanced approach to the topic of invasion\r\n- Teaching and mentorship from Marlyse and Sara!\r\n- Intentional community dynamics and expectations\r\n- Field Trips\r\n- Some guest speakers\r\n- Flexibility of final project, encouragement to do more than just a \"paper\" and work on something that has real-world implications/partnerships\r\n- Final policy debates\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some of the guest speakers brought a perspective, and a teaching style, that felt a bit jarring, or not inclusive. Thinking about how to incorporate outside expertise, while also honoring the group dynamics that have been established with such an intimate, discussion-based group will be a challenge. \r\n- The weekly policy papers were a great exercise, but I think there could be room for improvement in how they're used, how questions are phrased to make them more like the final policy debates where we're forced to represent a particular stakeholder, take a stand on one side of an issue, etc. "

            "\u00a0Well-rounded, systems-thinking approach to invasive species. Brought together many issues from economics to politics to sociology as they relate to how humans respond to threats from invasive species. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in examining how differing values intersect in environmental problems, whether or not they would say that they are already interested in learning about species invasions. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class but is entirely discussion based. Only take if you are willing to commit to being an active participant! ",
            "\u00a0Take it! If not only for the content for the unique experience of being taught by smart women who are truly committed to the class.  This was  without a doubt one of my favorite course that I've take at FES - we need more female professors with a passion for teaching! ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a beneficial subject matter to learn about, even if you don't plan to focus on invasive species or the hard sciences. We focused a lot on societal implications of invasive species, which is important to know for many fields. Some of the students in the class, for example, are focused on food, and took the class to learn more about pests and invasive pathogens. Some students had a focus on animal intelligence, and were interested in learning about the ethical implications of managing invasive species (a subject we covered extensively). ",
            "\u00a0People of all backgrounds could benefit from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend it! I learned an enormous amount about invasive species ecology and management, current policy debates, and prevention/ eradication/ control efforts. ",
            "\u00a0I have been telling everyone I know to take this class next year!  My advice would be to fully engage, be open and curious, and to use the discussion time to really challenge yourself, and approach issues from a systems-thinking perspective (ex: what are the unintended consequences and feedback loops?) Even if you aren't sure how Invasive Species fits into your specialty at F&ES, this is such a fascinating topic that integrates so many other transferrable concepts - stakeholder engagement, policy and legal frameworks, business and trade, ecosystems and landscapes, etc. "
