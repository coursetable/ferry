            "\u00a0One strength is that this teaches interesting materializing slides, hands on activities, and videos.\r\nOne improvement could be to make each class time longer. We are almost always going over class time, making me late to me next class. ",

Lt Col Snow is easy to understand and helpful with answering questions. \r\n\r\nImprovements:  \r\nThe tests and quizzes came straight from the text, which was helpful, but sometimes, tested my ability to read the texts more than my understanding of what we were learning.
