            "\u00a0I reached a thorough understanding of the Iraq War  how it started, why the U.S. chose to invade, what went wrong, and what comes next. You come away from this course  or at least I did convinced that invading Iraq in 2003 was the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I got an in-depth look into Iraqi history, politics, and problems. Like extremely in-depth. I can't imagine a class at Yale that teaches Iraq with more depth and focus than this one. ",
            "\u00a0Learned what the hell happened in Iraq. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate the U.S.'s foreign policy in Iraq and learned more broadly how to evaluate military strategies, insurgencies, and the role that local factors play in determining a good military policy. I found many aspects of the course to be quite enlightening and the foreign policy knowledge gained to be pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the geopolitics of Iraq starting with its creation after World War I, and stretching all the way up to today (with a particular focus on US policy and involvement kn Iraq). ",
            "\u00a0You learn a ton about the ins and outs of the various interventions in Iraq. Primary focus is on the Western world and its actions. If you want a class about Iraq itself, this isn't exactly what you're looking for. But it's incredibly interesting nonetheless. "

            "\u00a0I think Professor Howorth should get rid of the weekly student presentations. Many of them were poorly delivered, and I hardly learned anything from them. The structure of the syllabus, however, was admirably constructed and should not be changed. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussion is great and the readings are interesting. I do wish there were more assignments though, to force students to engage with the material more deeply more frequently. ",
            "\u00a0Great great course. Super interesting. Class was structured well. Teacher was intelligent and engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in that it had a good syllabus (was well crafted to focus on setting the context of 2003 by examining Iraq's History), a reasonable amount of reading, and a good distribution of types of assignments (presentation, short paper, and long paper was the right amount). There weren't really any weaknesses other than it dragged on a bit at the end. I feel like by the final couple weeks no new themes were being uncovered even though the conversations continued to be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I like the seminar setting, but sometimes it was hard to get involved in the conversation because other students had a more extensive base of knowledge on the topic. ",
            "\u00a0The grading structure could be more clear. For example, the presentation and the midterm paper should be weighted separately. The questions about the readings were not mentioned in the syllabus, even though we were verbally told that they were mandatory. "

            "\u00a0This is Howorth's last year, so unfortunately he won't teach the course anymore here. I enjoyed the seminar style of analyzing a contentious issue, but felt that sometimes the group discussions lacked cohesion and many diverse voices. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, Professor Howorth is no longer teaching at Yale, but this was a great course. Howorth's knowledge of U.S. and Iraq history is astounding. We learned what we came to learn about the Iraq War how it started, why the U.S. chose to invade, what went wrong, and what comes next. At the same time, I don't really understand how this class got such rave reviews. Previous evaluations called this class a \"must-take,\" and \"one of the best classes out there.\" It was a good class, but it wasn't excellent. Some weeks felt repetitive and boring. Other weeks felt great and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! You are unlikely to find a better class about Iraq at Yale. Since it has such a narrow focus (basically 1970-present), you really get to sink your teeth into the region's history and politics. We talked about the Iran-Iraq War, Saddam Hussein, sanctions, international debates on how to deal with Iraq, the 2003 invasion, the 2005 elections, insurgency and counterinsurgency, the surge, the 2010 election, ISIS--everything Iraq, it's all here. I thought I knew a far amount about Iraq going in, but turns out I knew very little. It's an incredibly complex region with incredibly complex problems, but seeing as the 2003 Iraq War is probably the defining U.S. foreign policy disaster of the 21st century with deadly ramifications still being felt today, I think you owe it to yourself to understand Iraq better. \r\n\r\nThe workload is entirely reasonable (two papers, occasional discussion \"posts,\" and a book presentation), and Professor Howorth is wonderful, witty and caring and intimidatingly knowledgable about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Won't be taught again by Howorth unfortunately. ",
            "\u00a0It's an interesting class, a reasonable amount of work, and Professor Howorth is enjoyable in the classroom. It's by no means an exceptional course, but it is worth taking to better understand the Iraq War/Middle Eastern policy in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to understand what has happened and what is happening in Iraqwhether for academic purposes or just so you know what theyre talking about on the newsthis is the class for you (although I believe this was the last running of the course). ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, I learned a lot about US involvement in Iraq. The readings were all very good. Professor Howorth generally starts with a mini-lecture, then students give presentations. Unlike many seminars, where students simply summarize readings we have all read already, presenters are given a separate set of readings to present to the class, which I liked. I found the student discussion section of the class to be more structured and interesting than some other seminars I've taken. Professor Howorth often poses questions, pushes back on students, and makes sure people speak in turn, unlike some professors who will sit back and allow a few students to ramble on about whatever they want, interrupt each other, and monopolize the discussion. If you are interested in the topic you will enjoy this seminar; it is well organized and you can learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Not too hard of a class, great discussion, wonderful professor. "
