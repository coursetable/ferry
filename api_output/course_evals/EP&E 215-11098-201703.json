            "\u00a0This course provided me with a informative survey of major works in political philosophy. I learned how to better analyze and thoroughly comprehend dense texts, and I learned Professor Kapustin's insightful interpretations of these popular works. ",
            "\u00a0I find that the way Professor Kapustin lead class allowed each student to understand deeply complex and highly theoretical philosophy. At moments, we engaged in close reading and used textual analysis to illuminate some of the more opaque texts, but mechanics of this sort did not constitute the core of the course. I would say my most fulfilling insights are almost exclusively theoretical. Professor Kapustin seeks to have each student walk way with both a firm understanding of political philosophy and a new appreciation for inter-disciplinarian thought. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skills in reading, comparing, and analyzing complex theoretical texts. I developed a deeper understanding of classic thought in ethics, politics, and economics, and how those fields intersect. ",
            "\u00a0Classics of EPE with Boris Kapustin is, without exaggeration, one of the best classes I have ever taken with one of the best professors at Yale. Believe the hype about Kapustin -- his level of teaching is unparalleled. He is intensely engaged with the material, an expert at conveying key insights about complex texts, and yet incredibly gracious wit his students. This class is a must-take for all students at all interested in political theory, social theory, or philosophy. \r\n\r\nThis course is so rich in insights. It has reshaped my worldview irreversibly. The main insights of the course come from understanding the rise of commercial society (then capitalism) that has come to dominate our lives, and how it compares with ancient systems of political economy. Reading writers like Hume, Ferguson, Hegel, Hayek, and Schumpeter in particular will help you better appreciate our modern condition. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read and evaluate the classics critically, and discuss their relevance to society today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the core ideas and thinkers that influence the study of ethics, olitics, and economics, as well as how all three of these fields have been interrelated in the past. ",
            "\u00a0After reading the likes of Ferguson, Aristotle, Hegel and Bentham, I attained a good insight into the ideas that have largely defined Western Ethics, politics and economics. I developed my reading skills, analytical ability and gained comprehension of very difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0Intensively read original classic works of the Western cannon, understood the philosophical systems of Aristotle, Hume, Hegel, Hayek, Schumpeter etc. ",
            "\u00a0Classics covers the some influential thinkers in the Western Canon, with particular emphasis on their interdisciplinary thinking. "

            "\u00a0One strength of this course was Professor Kapustin's incredible teaching. His interpretations of the works we read helped clarify their meanings and helped provide new insight to how they fit into the broader trajectory of the literature of political philosophy. One weakness of this course was that despite being a seminar, we didn't have as much class discussion as I would have liked. This is also a strength, though, because it allowed for more time for insights from Professor Kapustin. ",
            "\u00a0The course's most salient strength is unequivocally its professor. I have found that often in Yale courses that are anchored in theory, students, especially in seminars, use the class as a mouthpiece for whatever political opinion they have. This tendency could not be more invalid in context of Professor Kapustin's course. He carefully directed all our conversations, using a sort of hybrid lecture-seminar style of teaching. He would ask a specific question to the class and once we had discussed as a unit, he would artfully synthesize our comments. Additionally, he is not afraid to reject someone's proposal as incorrect (something I believe Yale professors tend not to do), but his rejections are never rude; they are simply his effort to making sure we understand precisely what tricky theory is trying to explain. The course's greatest weakness is likely that it is slightly overambitious in what it tries to accomplish in one meeting. Readings could rarely be discussed in full during one weekly meeting, and would bleed over in the next week, disjointing the schedule and making delaying our reading for class by nearly two sessions. ",
            "\u00a0The texts are amazing, and the amount of reading is heavy but manageable. This was one of the seminars I most looked forward to each week - Professor Kapustin is incredible, and each class, I felt as if I was really learning something new and thinking deeply about the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are many: outstanding professor, excellent syllabus, well-run seminars, and a completely reasonable workload.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are few: perhaps too much time & liberty given to students to speak their minds in seminar, too many students in seminar, and maybe too much time spent on a few authors (Bentham in particular) that could have been devoted to Hayek and Schumpeter instead. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its relevance, carefully selected readings and assignments. The weaknesses include the amount of texts we are required to purchase from different places ( not everything is included in the course packet) ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. Classes were well-structured, and it felt like we made full use of the time available to us. I can't think of any way to improve this. ",
            "\u00a0The course has to limit who is in and out of the syllabus due to constraints of time. I do however wish there was more representation of female writers as well as people of color. There were notably none. The authors we read were incredibly important and insightful, but I think it is worth to include more diverse perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course, very well structured and taught -- really enjoyed being in this seminar. \r\n\r\nSome thoughts: I enjoyed the latter half and more modern authors more so would appreciate more time on that half / adding more modern philosophers. Drawing more connections between the authors would also help -- it felt like we read Aristotle/Hume and effectively forgot them when we moved on to Hegel/Hayek. \r\nOverall enjoyed and would have liked to spend more time with these books! ",
            "\u00a0The class is very exciting, insightful, and challenging. The quality of the discussion is also incredibly great, mainly due to Prof. Kapustin's enthusiasm. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Even if you aren't an EPE major, learning these texts and learning from Professor Kapustin are opportunities you should not pass up. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in political philosophy or majoring in Ethics, Politics & Economics. In addition to being a requirement for the major, this course provided intimate knowledge of and critical engagement with the important works, which will be helpful with my coursework as background knowledge for the years to come. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think Professor Kapustin is an excellent introduction into deeply complex philosophical thought. He makes sure you understand the pinnacle to Western philosophy in an extremely robust way. Additionally, for any students seeking to deepen skills of interdisciplinary thinking, this course is absolutely for you. Professor Kapustin contextualized each philosopher we read, and drew meaningful connections between philosophers and different academic realms, e.g. politics, economics, sociology, ethics, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a wonderful overview of ethical, political, and economic theories. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!!!! Whether you are an EP&E major or not, this class is seriously one of the best, a true gem of a liberal arts education. You will be intellectually challenged, but with not too much stress along the way. Each class feels like a joint discovery - you are in it together with Professor Kapustin & your fellow students, all working to gain a deeper understanding of the ideas that continue to shape our society. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. For students with any appetite for political philosophy or social theory, this is one of the best courses at Yale with an unbelievable professor. You will come away from this course with a re-shaped worldview as you understand the historical development of economics, business, and commercial society. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kapustin is a great lecturer and discussion leader, and I would highly recommend taking the course with him. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course will challenge you to deeply read important texts, and give you a setting where constructed vulnerability is allowed. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend it to any student interested in philosophy, politics, or economics. I think it would add immensely to anyone's intellectual growth. ",
            "\u00a0Even if you are not an EPE major, this class is extremely useful and Boris brilliantly conveys ideas that have shaped a lot of Western political thought. Boris is an excellent teacher and I am so glad I took the course with him. You can certainly get a lot from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Don't miss this class. Kapustin is incredible, I got a lot more out of the readings through the discussions he led and would look forward to class every week. One of the best courses I took at Yale (from a senior CS + EP&E major). \r\n\r\nYou read a bunch of classic works, 2 weeks each. Thoroughly understand each philosophical system and Kapustin leads a brilliant internal critique of the authors. I was skeptical of the old-white male dominated ancient authors but learned a lot just from being in class w/ Kapustin. Take this for the great professor!! ",
            "\u00a0Students should take Classics with Professor Kapustin! His seminar is great as he creates an environment where students are pushed to participate and learn from one another. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this class for ANYONE. It is a really exciting class; one of the few classes one sit in and feel like you're learning. Whether you're EPE major or not, Prof. Kapustin is a must-be-taught-by! "
