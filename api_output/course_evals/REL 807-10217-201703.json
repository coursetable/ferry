            "\u00a0Willis is the best.  He curated such a gentle, fun environment in which to do role-plays without fear or shame.  Our discussions were always rich; his perspective on chaplaincy (in prison and parish) was invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0great listener\r\nexceptionally experienced\r\nvery supportive\r\nlow stress ",
            "\u00a0I loved our practicum leader! She was incredibly helpful and kind and really guided the group well while pushing us when we needed it. ",
            "\u00a0Willis was a fantastic practicum leader. He was thoughtful and provided really helpful insight during out practicums, and his real life experience was extremely informative when dealing with the things we talked about in class. He also allowed for organic conversation of the things we talked about to occur, and helped guide the practicum in a really helpful way. ",
            "\u00a0He was knowledgeable and encouraged further discussion around what we were interested in talking about. He also has a great sense of humor, which was helpful in dealing with serious role plays. ",
            "\u00a0Kris helpfully brought in her own practical experience to make the class more practical. I thought it could have been more helpful to get more constructive feedback rather than only affirmations after a role play. ",
            "\u00a0We had an excellent small group, and Julie was wonderful in engaging all of us in role play while making us feel completely comfortable in the process. She should definitely continue to lead a small group for this class. She is warm, encouraging and offers deep insights into the material as well as years of pastoral care experience. she is also direct and honest. Between Julie Kelsey and Joyce Mercer, this class is an absolute gem. i loved it! ",
            "\u00a0He had enormous expertise and a personality that wanted to share it with all of us.  His experiences as a prison chaplain and as a church minister were enormously useful.  He is a wise and holy man with much to share, and was always willing to go the extra mile in discussing the scenarios we received from Dr. Mercer and the extensions we posed for him.  He should definitely be invited back next year. ",
            "\u00a0Willis was the greatest. I really appreciated the way he made our practicum group a comfortable environment for each of us to practice and learn through the role plays. He took the time to get to know us and respond to our individual questions and concerns. ",
            "\u00a0Julie brings her own experience as a pastoral care giver.  Positive presence in the room, but not over-bearing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Kris was great! She had an ability to take the scenarios further and make them applicable to our lives and what we could expect in our ministry. ",
            "\u00a0Julie was absolutely amazing. She was incredibly pastoral, which was very helpful when we engaged in the difficult work of the case studies. She allowed us to ask questions as they emerged in the case studies, which I especially appreciated. I am just so grateful that she facilitated my group. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -\r\n> flexible in allowing students to volunteer for roles, thus allowing us to be aware of and address the areas we felt were necessary\r\n> challenged us to take on roles when necessary\r\n> didn't leave a single role-play as the final answer\r\n\r\nWeaknesses -\r\n> lack of experience to reach back to for suggestions or answers in certain scenarios "
