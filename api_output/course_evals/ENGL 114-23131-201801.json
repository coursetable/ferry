            "\u00a0I developed my knowledge about current issues of social inequality in the world today, including the phenomena of mass incarceration, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the Alt-Right movement. I also learned about the different sources of inequality and the different ways of thinking about social inequality. Furthermore, I improved my writing by taking this course through the various writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I gained the necessary skills to close read a text and construct an argument. I learned about proper citing and how to eliminate ambiguity between my own opinion and information provided by my sources in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0English Writing and origins of inequality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the mass incarceration movement in the United States and how to better write a research essay. ",
            "\u00a0This course did very well in advancing my writing skills, as an ENGL 114 course should, but it also explored the various aspects of inequality in the US very well. I feel so much more confident in my essay writing skills now. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to develop my critical thinking and writing skills as well as my public presentation and speaking skills. This class really helped me learn how to write in a professional manner that emphasized my style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt about some important topics that relate to modern issues in equality. Learnt about structuring academic writing, and received guidance regarding better writing in general. "

        [
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was that the material was very interesting and the course followed a logical progression from the origins of social inequality to modern-day instances of inequality. The course could be improved by incorporating more student discussion and collaboration into the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think one weakness of the course was that we spent a lot of time covering the Black Lives Matter movement toward the end. I think this is an extremely important topic especially in our society today however I think it would have been interesting to talk about other movements going on today to get a broader understanding of inequality. ",
            "\u00a0There is not that much of class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think the writing skills taught were invaluable for students' academic performances throughout the rest of Yale. I also think in the future, Professor Kreiner could lecture a little less and solicit more student involvement. ",
            "\u00a0This course was always engaging. Going to class was never a chore, and Prof. Kreiner was certainly always enthusiastic and led the class discussion well. The assignments were never too overwhelming and there was enough freedom to talk about things that I was very much passionate about, making them definitely bearable and sometimes enjoyable (the P4 assignment in particular was a lot of fun). The topics of the class were definitely well-picked and intriguing. I did feel like the class brushed over LGBT issues much more and the lack of any global perspectives meant issues such as religious discrimination were not covered. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class was that it was quite small and the readings were very interesting. The teacher was also amazing because he was willing to put in the time and effort to make sure you did well on your assignments. There were no real weaknesses of the course other than the working getting to be too much sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I generally found that this course was well-organized and productive. The readings were exceptionally interesting and always of a reasonable length. The staggered deadlines were really effective in making us stay on track with our work and receive timely feedback so that we were less stressed when it came to producing a final product. The in-class discussions were also often quite interesting and stimulating. The workload overall was quite reasonable as well. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student; Professor Kreiner gives very helpful feedback on writing assignments and an improvement in writing skills is guaranteed for anyone who takes this course. The material is very engaging as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was engaging and relevant to the issues going on today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I vastly improved my writing skills from it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This ENGL 114 seminar was engaging and was never too overwhelming or stressful. Prof. Kreiner is always there to help and his comments on the drafts were very helpful. However, if issues like equality and social injustice aren't in your sphere of interest, then this seminar will be dull and boring. If you're like me however and enjoy looking at these, you will really enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because it was a great introduction to writing. I learned the basics, such as sentence structure, things you would've have learned in high school. The class does an amazing job to help you out no matter where you start. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. The course was well-organized, helpful and very interesting. "
