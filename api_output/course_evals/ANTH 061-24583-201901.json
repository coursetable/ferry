            "\u00a0I acquired a much fuller understanding of the evolutionary history of humans from tree-dwelling primates to anatomically modern humans. Additionally, I feel I better understand now the nature of scientific discovery and the machinations of how scientific work is published. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about paleoanthropology in-depth: both the existing research and information, and the methods used to discover more.  Something important about this course is that it is PALEOanthropology, not cultural anthropologya lot of what you learn will be essentially paleontology. However, it is still very interesting and you will learn a lot about the origins of our species. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater knowledge of human ancestry, fossils, hoaxes, a broad survey of different sciences that go into anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the origins of humans, how we evolved to be and what makes us who were are today.  I learned a lot about techniques modern paleoanthropologists used today to date and identify fossils and artifacts and most importantly what a discovery takes and all the circumstances that surround a believable discovery. ",
            "\u00a0This course has taught me A LOT about human origins. Before taking Professor Thompson's course, I didn't know really anything about this subject, but now I know have a broad understanding about the origins of our species, stone tools, different important hominin fossil/species discoveries, and the like.

I also learned a lot about the scientific community and its workings, and I have a better idea about how to engage with ideas in a professional and scientific way. I think that before taking this course, I didn't even realize how much I didn't know, and not only are some vast questions about human history more clear to me now, I also feel like I have a good foundation to keep up with new discoveries as they come out.

            "\u00a0This course excelled in providing a personal look into the field of paleoanthropology and not only what the big discoveries in human evolution were, but also how they were discovered and the stories behind the fossils. Additionally, the workload for the class was really well-distributed. The course was very much a marathon and not a sprint, and at no time did I feel that I had to \"cram\" for any purpose. The biggest grade attributed to a single assignment was a final 1200-word paper, which was still only 12% of the semester grade. This allowed for a much better learning experience. I also felt that the subject matter was presented in a sensible order and that the materials were informative without being overbearing.\r\n\r\nThis course could improve in that I expected a first-year seminar to incorporate more discussion. There were two debates and two days of presentations were there was significant class engagement, but other than those four class days the classes consisted of lectures with time for questions on specific matters. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthsinteresting content, minimal workload, very nice professor\r\nWeaknessesnot a seminar (just a seminar-sized lecture with Q&A at the beginning and end of the lecture), \"activities\" instead of papers or tests ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of work and a lot of information that was packed in. I think maybe cutting out a couple assignments or lectures would have allowed a deeper dive. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great!! Lecture was always very interesting, the assignments were fun to complete, and the in class activities were always very engaging.  I wish there had been more hands on time with the fossils or artifacts though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is perfect as it is. The workload is decent (dare I say easy) and not stressful and since there are no final or midterm, there is no pressure to learn for the sake of a test, rather learn for learning's sake. ",
            "\u00a0Well, it definitely wasn't what I expected out of a first-year seminar. Last semester, I took a different seminar that was super engaging and the students basically talked the whole class. This was not that. It was lecture-style, with opportunities all the time for questions, but no discussion. I actually think given how limited our knowledge was about the subject, this worked perfectly. I'd say that it could involve students just a tad more, but I also think Dr. Thompson does an excellent job. ",
            "\u00a0There werent any weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I found the readings interesting and worthwhile, but it would be useful to tie them into class discussion a little more. However, I liked the way the work was distributed fairly evenly over the whole semester, I feel like we covered incredibly interesting topics, and I always found the class engaging and useful. The activities sometimes felt a bit disjointed from what we learned (I think largely due to time restraints in class), but overall they were interesting. Because we weren't tested on the material, I think some people didn't always find an incentive to engage, but personally I felt that that made it more genuine and authentic--we were interested because we wanted to learn, not just get a good grade. In general, I think this was a really well-run and engaging class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: seminar style teaching\r\nWeaknesses: covers a lot ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting, instructor was clearly passionate about her work and organized the course effevctively. \r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of information with limited time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible and the content is very interesting. I also think the assignments for this course are very engaging and unique. I can tell Professor Thompson put a lot of thought into the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job conveying information in class and with the major project, although I did feel like some of the take-home activities were not particularly conducive to learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting, and class discussions were always quite interesting and dynamic. The assignments and final project also allowed us to use much of the information we had learned throughout the semester. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning a bit more about the history of humanity, and also to anyone looking for a painless and fun social sciences credit. ",
            "\u00a0If someone is interested in paleoanthropology or the biological origins of humanity, they should take this class. However, they should be prepared for an unusual class (not in a negative way though). The assignments are all \"activities,\" like middle school worksheets but at a college level, and we don't have any papers or tests; the professor also is extremely great at answering questions and will spend as much time as necessary explaining things to people, but it is still a lecture course disguised as a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Thompson is very enthusiastic about paleoanthropology and Im considering it after taking this class. Ive learned a lot and it is relevant in sometimes surprising ways. A big workload but nice because it is spaced throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! It was extremely interesting and fun to take and leaves you feeling like you've learned a lot and understand more about where humans come from. ",

            "\u00a0I totally would! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, as long as they are interested in the subject at hand. I think that this class really works well for people who care about the material, because it's really a situation where you get out of it what you put into it in terms of effort, attention, and engagement. With that said, I think that this class provides an important foundation for understanding humans, and even if the knowledge you gain is sometimes very specific, the broader picture is useful for conceptualizing our past (and present).
