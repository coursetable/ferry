            "\u00a0I feel like I have a strong foundation in both theoretical thermodynamics and applied. ",
            "\u00a0in depth thermodynamics skills, mostly from the view of chemistry. very similar to the fist semester of Physical Chemistry here. ",
            "\u00a0General chemical engineering thermodynamics; entropy, state functions, work, heat, phases ",
            "\u00a0This class was an up and down experience for me. Overall I would rate it as a positive experience. I feel like I learned a lot in the class and developed a strong understanding of thermodynamics. There were select moments when this were unclear or felt unorganized but overall it was an enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0we got a solid overview of and practice solving problems about the laws of thermodynamics, thermo state functions, and the relationships between heat, work, temperature, and other everyday ideas previously mentioned in physics classes "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was a very hard class, but I definitely learned a lot. There were times when I felt very overwhelmed and lost in the material, but other times when I realized how much I was learning and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Shu Hu is getting better as the years go on, and I thought he was a great professor who really cared about his students. great guy, and always there for clarifications. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are breadth are content. Weaknesses were definitely lack of clarity as to what we actually needed to know and the distinct gap between learned theory and applied knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the passion that Professor Hu had for the material that he was teaching and the help of the Zhu (the TA) at weekly sections. The course could be improved by providing more example problems during class so that completing the problem sets is easier to do. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured in a way that allowed breathing time between new waves of material, and lectures came with lecture notes and chapter readings. I had trouble extracting understandable information from the first couple chapters of lecture notes simply because the course seemed to suddenly jump into very high expectations of our thermo knowledge levels. Later on, I found the notes concise and thorough. Something I could've benefitted from was probably simpler or more straightforward exercises that weren't always included in our book. I found that sometimes the difficult homework problems a struggle to approach sometimes. "

            "\u00a0Definitely one of the hardest classes I have taken at Yale. It was a lot of work, and at multiple points you will feel lost and confused. The first half is a lot harder than the second half, but by the end of the class you will be impressed by the amount of knowledge you have. Definitely tons of work, and can be very frustrating at times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Shu Hu makes himself available to students, the weekly sections are really useful, and the homework/exam load is very reaonsable. Recommend taking with Pchem though since in the beginning concepts are explained clearer in that class and in general there is lots of overlap! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, need it for ChemE and some other engineerings. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're a Chem E major, which is probably why you're here. The course material is so dense and theoretical that it's not worth investing your time in unless you actually need to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I am an environmental engineering major, so I had the option to take either ChemE thermodynamics or MechE thermodynamics for my major requirement. Given how disorganized the professor for this course was, I would recommend shopping both if you are given the opportunity before you decide which one to take - I've heard the MechE thermo professor is an excellent teacher. Of course, if you are ChemE, then you're kind of stuck with this class. ",
            "\u00a0The first pset for this course was awful but after you get through that, it gets substantially easier. Definitely go to the weekly sections because the TA will provide you with very helpful hints to get the psets done. Although lecture is not always very interesting, Professor Hu is very passionate about helping us get the most out of his class and his is very fair with the grading. He puts more emphasis on the effort that you put in rather than the number grade that you receive so as long as you go to lecture and put in effort, don't stress too much over your grade. ",
            "\u00a0For students considering this class it often is not optional, so to those that will be taking the class in the future I would say not to fear it. If you are willing to put in the work the class is manageable, and I feel that you can be successful. ",
            "\u00a0Chances are that you have to take this course for your major. It's not the worst course, but most of the time you will be confused as the textbook does a poor job of explaining concepts that Prof. Hu reviewed in class. If you are not required to take this class and want to take it, then why would you do this to yourself? ",
            "\u00a0While taking other engineering courses, thermo became easier to understand since the same concepts of work, heat, energy, pressure, and so on are all connected and explored in depth. Thermo also reinforces and provides insight into why things are the way they are in other engineering classes. "
