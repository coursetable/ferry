            "\u00a0This course primarily allowed me to develop my knowledge of Northern Renaissance Art. However, the course was structured to include discussions of broader historical events and their impact on the production of art in the early modern period. This course also enabled me to articulate a more clear understanding of genre painting--its origins, its expansion etc. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a rich understanding of 16th-century artistic practices in the Low Countries, and of the history of \"genre painting\" more specifically. The began with the intriguing question of how the category of \"genre\" was developed and cemented, creating a theoretical framework that propelled our thinking about specific art historical case studies. Because the artist Pieter Bruegel was at the center of the course, I learned a great deal about his practice and reception in the ensuing centuries, but I also became familiar with a variety of other significant artists of the period. The course emphasized the cultural and historical context underlying the artwork we studied, and so I gained significant knowledge of socio-political forces at work in the early modern Netherlands, leading to the birth and rise of the Dutch Republic. Another key aspect of the course lay in investigating the methodological stakes of different approaches to the study of the genre painting. This structure provided me with a useful lens through which to regard future research not only in this particular field, but in other art historical areas of study. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a deep understanding of art in the 1500 and early 1600s in the Low Countries. It helped me reinterpreting what we call \"genre painting\" by expanding the number of ways we might understand everyday life scenes. In addition, thanks to the research topic I worked on for this course, I investigated the relationship between art, natural history, and the history of collecting in early modern Antwerp. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of genre painting between the 15th and 18th centuries, as well as the historiography of the genre tradition. The course emphasized the difficulty of classifying \"genre,\" which allowed productive readings of a variety of painting types and styles. I also gained special insight into the paintings of Bruegel, a crucial artist in the development of the painting of modern life. "

            "\u00a0This course had no weaknesses--it is by far one of the most well-run seminars that I have participated in at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the greatest strength of the course was its organization. The material unfolded logically over the course of the semester, allowing us to become comfortable getting into the nitty gritty aspects of Bruegel and his contemporaries, whether or not we had begun with substantial knowledge of the period. In general, assigned readings were compelling, and clearly related to each other in ways that allowed me to make connections and think critically about the material, largely through a comparison of different approaches. \r\n\r\nOf course, the trip we made to Vienna served to reinforce everything we had thus far learned and added a visceral thrill to our engagement with Bruegel. The trip was a wonderful opportunity to contend with Bruegel's oeuvre at large and regarding the works physically in space really did transform how I thought about it. An attendant pleasure was the chance to have extended discussions with my peers and with the professor in the Bruegel exhibition and in other Viennese collections. On returning from the trip, my understanding of the material and its context had immeasurably grown. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses in the course and its design strike meoverall, I found it incredibly useful to my development as a scholar. I do think the course could be taught again in the future without a trip to Vienna. Perhaps a visit to another, more local collection, such as the Met Museum, would allow for a similarly fruitful (though less intense) engagement with Bruegel's work \"in the flesh.\" ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely well-structured. The materials were consistent and well-chosen, which triggered lots of discussions that helped to understand the matters at hand better. The fact that we got to see the artworks we were working on also helped our understanding of the paintings in question, and the formulation of our \"conference talks,\" which in turn facilitated our final paper projects. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely well organized; readings always felt relevant and contributed to class discussion. Seeing works firsthand was, of course, an incredible experience. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in developing their knowledge of early modern northern art. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. I've rarely before finished a course so newly enthusiastic about its subject matter and eager to consider it further in the future. The material itself and the way it was presented were both exceptionally fresh and exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student! Even if the art of the early modern Low Countries is not one's research area, the course is useful for students who study later modern art - for the studied period and region of this course is the foundation from which later modern art was born-, and also for students who study earlier Renaissance art, because the course provides a mapping of the path that art took after the High Renaissance. If a student's research area falls outside of these two areas, it is still a thought-provoking and intriguing course to take, which will help one to understand art, particularly everyday life scenes better. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. The material itself is fascinating, and Professor Bass does an excellent job of communicating it and organizing seminar. "
