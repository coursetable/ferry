            "\u00a0I am a STEM student, and coming into this class, I was very bad at conducting research for non-stem fields. This course has a few assignments, but all assignments are very strategically placed within the curriculum to enhance the learning experience. This course is a must take for anyone who has an interest in China or an interest in anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I decided to take this course because my family is of Chinese descent, but since my upbringing is in America, I am unaware of the political, social, and cultural circumstances of the place my family calls home. This course was an entire run-through of Chinese history from the very beginning of the Chinese dynasties to contemporary China. My eyes were opened to all of the turmoil, history, and background that took place. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a very brief overview of China's history and some anthropology themes and terminology used to characterize the formation of communities. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about Chinese mannerisms and concepts that I hadn't heard about before but I actually witness on a day to day basis. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive understanding of Chinese culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Chinese history and culture. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I felt like the lecture style of the class was more helpful than a seminar discussion--there is a lot of information to cover in this field, and I did feel as if a professor walking us through every step was the most effective way to learn the material. With that said, I did not feel as if the discussion sections were particularly helpful or insightful. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions help relate our readings to what was going on in class, but if we addressed our readings in class more, I believe we could get deeper analysis and understanding of both class topics and readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! So many details and information learned every day of lecture. I would say that the only way this course can be improved upon would be to have the course be a little more engaging, but that is easier said than done since it is a lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't say there was anything particularly useful to take away from the course; in its entirety, it didn't really convince me that anthropology was valuable. The structure and the way it was taught made it seem like over-complicated terminology was assigned to rather common sense behavior. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course gave a great introduction to some of the topics and factors shaping present-day China. I really enjoyed the selected readings. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more assignments that aren't just the papers. Currently all the assignments were papers and some based of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Great course that is really interesting but also low workload. "

            "\u00a0Easy fifth class ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course introduces anthropological methods through examples of how they were used in China, but most importantly it teaches anthropological thinking. To excel in this course, a student must deeply analyze the evidence presented to them. However, there often is not an easy connection between the different topics mentioned in class, and students must work to find and understand the subtle but important parallels. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely, this course was absolutely amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who either wants to learn more about China, like I did, or a class to fulfill credit requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend it. None of the material taught in class is ever tested on so there's no incentive to go to class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but on the condition that they're already interested in Chinese culture and society. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you know nothing about China, and want an interesting class with a low workload. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Chinese history and culture. "
