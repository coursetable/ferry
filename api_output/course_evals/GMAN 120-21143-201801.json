            "\u00a0Sometimes topics seem irrelevant (the unit on fairy tales) ",
            "\u00a0I felt like a lot of grammar was taught this semester, but none of it from a practical standpoint. In my opinion, grammar is most effectively taught using examples rather than rules so that students can understand the context in which it might fall in everyday conversation. Rather, the grammar was taught from a prescriptive, rule-following standpoint, which a) is not as useful and b) leaves out the millions of exceptions that occur in German. "

            "\u00a0Yes and take it with Thorsten! Semi useful but something that is not spanish or French and the department isnt a pushover but also isnt too hard ",
            "\u00a0I mean, as languages here go I think German is among the more laid-back ones. The professors are very good about giving feedback and understanding that students may not learn a new language so quickly at this age. "
