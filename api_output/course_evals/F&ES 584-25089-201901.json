            "\u00a0Wide breadth of exposure to different growing systems and agricultural concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating insight into the rapidly growing field of agricultural and natural/working land solutions to climate change. Definitely keeping a look out for leaf protein concentrate as a future food supply. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best, if not THE best, professor in FES. Incredibly interdisciplinary, global, locally relevant with a perfect level of technical information and political context, ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insights into what kind of work is being done on this issue, the gaps in that work, and the major barriers to progress. The tools we used in the assignments were really interesting and helpful for understanding how farms operate and how we can solve global challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I know so much more about climate change and agriculture!!! ",

            "\u00a0This was my first class in Agriculture, which helped me understand different approaches that can be used to improve farming to improve yields, livelihood and help to harness climate change ",
            "\u00a0I had purchased Eric's book before starting at FES, and was very familiar with most of the concepts he described. I learned a lot from the assignments. My main takeaway: everything is different everywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Greater insight, facts and myth-busting related to sustainable agriculture practices, agricultures contribution to global climate change and socio-economic and cultural considerations related to these topics. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the ag industry and how new technology and intensification techniques can make a substantial impact on global carbon emissions. ",
            "\u00a0The class exceeded my expectations, excellent class. It incorporates many aspects of environmental justice that are not present in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Very well! ",
            "\u00a0This class taught us everything that I had hoped to learn and more. I just expected to get a good idea of the various agricultural methods of climate change mitigation, but now I feel familiar with the global agricultural sector as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Totally better than my expectations! ",
            "\u00a0Very well, got exactly what I expected when I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class certainly met my expectations. I learned many new and interesting things about agriculture, and I went on a great field trip to MA to see various farming systems. Overall, I am glad I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0Well ",
            "\u00a0I have broad experience in wildlife conservation and my research explored human-wildlife conflict which was linked to crop farming. This course has imparted knowledge that will help farmers who experience conflict to explore other unpalatable crops by wildlife to minimize conflict ",
            "\u00a0My impression of this class is that it's designed to give people who don't know anything about agriculture, but are interested in policy matters related to agriculture, an overview of global issues and dynamics in agriculture. As someone with a strong background in agriculture, I didn't learn anything, which is maybe a good sign that I do actually know things. However, my concern for the target audience of the class is that if people have no experience in agriculture, they shouldn't be trying to get involved in ag policy matters. I think this course definitely helps in giving people a sense of the scope of the issues, and hopefully make them want to get some actual experience. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, Eric suffered a huge personal tragedy in the middle of the semester. The result was a disjointed semester, which kind of interrupted the flow of lectures, and so my expectations were not met. But this was circumstantial, not because of anything the class did or did do. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: a practitioner perspective that is outside of the normal FES wheelhouse. We need more classes at FES taught by people like Eric. Really appreciated the global perspective and wide breadth of topics and approaches to mitigation. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: tradeoff to the wide exposure is that everything remains pretty superficial. A topic this large really needs a full semester to even start to engage with subject areas meaningfully. The group work was also a little goofy - harder to organize getting together than to complete the actual assignments. Would have been better as either more rigorous work or as individual exercises. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Eric's broad knowledge base beyond just agricultural and also tying in social justice and indigenous rights into his lectures. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Best class ever. ",
            "\u00a0Class hours are a bit long, but overall learned a lot about agricultural practices and how they can have positive impacts on the environment, people, and communities! Really enjoyed the professor and the group projects outside of class! ",
            "\u00a0Total strengths. The only thing that would make it better is having it be a full credit course and having the final project be more applied in nature. Every class at F&ES does a final paper. I would love to do something more productive and applied! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - in depth information on carbon farming, with practical experience from the instructor. \r\n\r\nWeakness - Through no fault of the instructor, there was too much information for a half semester course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great at giving a broad overview of agriculture as it relates to climate change. All of the information we were given was grounded in data, and I felt like I came away from it from a much better understanding of what solutions are available and what would be most effective from a climate change mitigation perspective. Sometimes the lectures felt like long lists of various agricultural practices, which made the information hard to retain at times. I would have liked to see more in-depth case studies to break up the monotony of single-topic powerpoint slides. ",
            "\u00a0Could be a whole semester course. Lots to unpack! ",
            "\u00a0It was great to work in groups that helped understand the coursework ",
            "\u00a0The course was a huge information dump that I think people without background really struggled to assimilate. Shorter classes (not 3-hour lectures) would be more effective in giving digestible doses of information. The problem sets were global in scope, which was perhaps aimed to give students a sense of how complex these issues are, but were not optimal teaching tools. ",
            "\u00a0Eric is a practitioner, and that is a huge strength. He has been involved with a bunch of cool initiatives, including his own Perennial Solutions and Project Drawdown. He's been places, done things, and has a wide range of experience in farming, policy, consulting, and business--all that experience is evident in his lectures and the way he answers questions. He's also really great at saying \"I don't know,\" which I love. \r\n\r\nHowever, the course is mainly lecture, and is 3 hours long at night. I know that's probably the only time that makes sense for Eric, who lives pretty far away and has a long drive home at the end of class. But it's a tough timeslot to stay awake and present. Maybe instead of just lecture from Eric, students could do 10-minute presentations, or we could break into groups more often--something like that. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course. In addition to the topics covered in the space of time, Eric is one of the few lecturers that Ive encountered that seamlessly wove topics like climate justice, socio-economic equity issues, the good and the bad, into his lectures. Very rare, very refreshing. "

            "\u00a0Take it! It is worth your time and you will enjoy the professor's teaching style! ",
            "\u00a0Take this if you care about food & ag and climate change. ",

            "\u00a0Highly recommend, but due to extraneous circumstances, the course engagement had to be highly reduced for my class. If not for that, this class would have been amazing! Lots of long lectures, but as long as you commit to paying attention, you'll learn a ton. Professor is genuinely enthusiastic about the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Do talk to Eric before or after class, because he is super knowledgeable. Bring coffee or a snack to class--seriously. It will help you stay focused during the long lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class for anyone interested generally or wanting to dive deeper into agriculture, agroforestry, and climate change. "
