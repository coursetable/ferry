            "\u00a0We learned a great deal about both modern policy challenges and the historical and social background of both Iraq and Afghanistan. The course covered a breadth of topics on post-US invasion issues in both countries, including democracy-building and foreign aid. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the history of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as various historical efforts by the US and subsequent effects. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good deal about the history of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as American interventions in these two countries. I gained insight into some of the theories and debates surrounding various themes of these conflicts, including modes of refugee integration and critiques and defenses of human rights rhetoric. ",
            "\u00a0Naysan taught us how to be critical in every context. He showed us the nitty gritty of conflict and instability, and in doing so, he showed us that every political event is fraught with complexity and unforeseen consequences. This class taught me how to better express my arguments both in speech and in writing. It taught me about the history of Iraq and Afghanistan, but also gave me political lessons and considerations I know I can use anywhere. ",

            "\u00a0The way the syllabus was organized, with a historical focus in the first few weeks and individual topics in the subsequent ones was one of the biggest strengths of the course. It gave us the context to fully engage with the material in the second half of the course. One of the weaknesses of the course was timing in that we often did not have enough time in class for discussion of the material as a group. The presentations were quite lengthy so at times the class also finished later than its scheduled time, so it would be great to have shorter presentations in the future to ensure there is ample time for student discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was clearly very knowledgeable about the subject areas and picked out very important topics of discussions. However, we covered a lot of different topics and in the process had to learn about them in the context of both Iraq and Afghanistan simultaneously, which could sometimes be a bit overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0More discussion, and more feedback on reading responses! Strengths include comprehensive material and quality of guest lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that this is an incredibly interesting course AND a writing credit is a godsend.  Loved learning form Professor Adlparvar and the incredible guest speakers that he brought in.  I thoroughly enjoyed the critical nature of thoughts and discussion in class.  I do wish to learn more about the broader histories of these nations but understand that it would not be possible given the amount of class time.  I kind of wish this class met twice a week rather than once to maintain engagement and perhaps manage time better.  I also would like to learn more about the political discourse pertaining to these conflicts by nations other than the US. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting guest speakers, some interesting readings (especially in the second half), Naysan's high level of engagement in the course and his dedication to his students\r\nWeaknesses: not enough feedback provided on our work, some weeks had unnecessarily long and/or many readings, student presentations were typically not very stimulating--I would prefer more discussion time, lack of clear guidelines for reading responses that led to these assignments being fairly stressful for me, class frequently went over time ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had more class discussions! Some of the presentations were too long  in the future I think it would be better to strictly adhere to a time limit for the sake of preserving discussion time. The speakers we had were all incredible, and Naysan was always insightful and brought out the best thoughts in people. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn and think critically about the most pressing issues in Iraq and Afghanistan and how international actors have and should intervene. ",
            "\u00a0Yes overall! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but with the caveat that it is quite a lot of work (readings, reading responses, a long final paper). Naysan is a devoted and enthusiastic teacher who brings in very interesting guest speakers, and I believe that the course will be improved in future terms to allow for more discussion time as opposed to student or professor lectures and to provide more feedback on written work. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! Naysan is amazing. Take it if you can get in. You learn so much and grow immensely as a writer, thinker, and citizen. "
