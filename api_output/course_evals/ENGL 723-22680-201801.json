            "\u00a0A very thorough understanding of the different forms, experiments, and paths that the novel took. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this seminar and learned a great deal from it. I hadn't taken many eighteenth-century/early novel courses prior to this, so it was immensely useful to me as an overview of some of the major thematic and formal developments in European fiction from the time of \"Lazarillo de Tormes\" through the first decades of the 19th century. I also greatly appreciated the course's transnational outlook: I think it made visible a history of the novel that simply wouldn't have been evident otherwise. "

            "\u00a0I thought this was an excellent class in every way. The syllabus and assigned readings were great: Professor Trumpener clearly put a lot of care and thought into designing the class, and it showed. I found all of the assigned novels very worthwhile and enjoyed seeing how they built off of one another formally, thematically, and philosophically. The short response papers were an effective way to engage with secondary criticism without allowing it to dominate our in-class conversations. The class discussions themselves were always thought-provoking and illuminating. I honestly don't have any suggestions for improvement -- I thought the class was great already. "
