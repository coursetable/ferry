            "\u00a0yes, great professors, relevant topics ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you are into history and politics, and really want to look at the flaws of American nationalism and identity and its war with Islam, which is very relevant today \r\nHowever its a lot of work, the readings are interesting but take up a lot of time, as well as the critical response essays due every week, which takes up A LOT of time because a critical response (a 400/500 word essay due every week) requires you to have actually read the readings thoroughly, and the readings could be a whole book and more a week \r\nLess of a discussion during seminars, sometimes discussion was taken over by some students who had sufficient background in politics, if you dont have much background its hard to contribute ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student -- the combination of a historical look at race and religion in the U.S. and current events in the media has been an interesting and unique take on social science at Yale. The syllabus was an excellent blend of theory and modern events, and class discussions were fascinating. "
