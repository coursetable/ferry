            "\u00a0I learned about the intricate relationship between grief and literature, and specifically how stories have historically empowered humans to get through tragedy (especially unexpected). ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much on reading, writing, and discussing. ",
            "\u00a0My literary analysis, writing, and language skills developed during this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about developing a clear argument and incorporating sources into my writing. With our writing, we spent a lot of time developing our own voice and making sure that it was understandable and clear throughout our work. ",
            "\u00a0The most important thing I learned in this course was how to improve my close-reading skills. I also was able to read many interesting books and was given new insight in how individuals mourn the loss of loved ones and how they express their emotions. ",
            "\u00a0I understood academic writing requirements, developed skills such as close reading, researching, and argumentative essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to experiment with my essay-writing techniques. Throughout high school, you become very accustomed to writing in a five-paragraph format. This course, however, challenged me to approach papers in new ways by interweaving thoughts and not making my papers so segmented. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the importance of writing in the active voice as opposed to the passive voice. Before taking this course, I would often (unknowingly) use passive voice in my writing, but I learned in class that active voice is much more sophisticated and engaging to use in academic writing, which has really enhanced the quality of my writing. I also learned how to effectively craft an argument about a scholarly piece through the lens of another work, which is something I had no experience with in the English classes I took in high school. (And which I very much enjoyed learning how to do.) I also learned how to effectively craft topic sentences in an essay, which should set up an argument for a paragraph rather than merely set the scene. Finally, I learned how to critically and meaningfully analyze literary works by examining the context and implications of each piece, as opposed to merely analyzing such things as symbolism and syntax, which I examined extensively in high school English classes.

            "\u00a0Strength- The class has a clear application, considering the reality that we will each experience death in our families, communities etc. I think our learning was motivated by this application, and yet, class period wasn't explicitly sad which was helpful especially when talking about the books that made you cry. \r\n\r\nWeakness- Although I appreciated the way ENGL 114 acts as a sample for the various types of literature, there's a lot of variety between the text you read. (For example, Chaucher vs. a modern biography/obituary) Again, variety can be good, but I think it comes at the cost of really digging into a particular type of literature, and then conversation about such literature. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: There's honestly too many to list. The class is well structured and well balanced. I learned to improve my writing and discussing on the readings while continuing to read difficult texts. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great class in reading a diverse but related set of works and analyzing how mourning and death is characterized in literature. I think the biggest improvement would be more work on writing skills early in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course that featured a lot of interesting readings. The strengths were definitely the discussions that we had on each of the books and the time we spent learning about the different forms of mourning. I would suggest having peer reviews start with the first paper, since they were really helpful for our final papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n-engaging class discussions\r\n-interesting selection of books and various other works\r\n-helpful and present teacher willing to assist with any concerns\r\nWeakness\r\n-needs more instruction on writing development specifically in the improvement of sentence structure ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely the engaging discussions. The seminar is particularly well-organized, and the reading materials do complement each other especially well. The only weakness might be that only a proportion of the reading material is discussed in depth due to time restraints. ",
            "\u00a0The best attribute of the ENGL 114/115 courses is that the research paper is due before Thanksgiving Break. Therefore, the final stretch of this class is very simple. It allows you to focus on your other courses at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nClass discussions were highly engaging and thought-provoking, and I often felt as though I learned much more from my classmates' commentaries and insights than I did from reading each piece itself. I really liked that our professor let class conversations direct themselves, as this allowed us as students to develop our own insights on each work and encouraged us to build off of one another's ideas and insights. \r\n\r\nWe frequently did peer reviews in and out of class, which not only allowed us to enhance each other's works, but also allowed us to seek out new ways to improve our own writing based off of the ideas of our peers. \r\n\r\nWe also received clear and detailed feedback from our instructor after writing the first draft of our essays, which really helped to improve my writing and the articulation of my ideas. \r\n\r\nWe also learned how to streamline our writing by eliminating unnecessary words and learning how to write in the correct voice, which I had never realized was an issue until I saw how much this process enhanced my voice in my writing. \r\n\r\nWe often studied articles to accompany the main piece that we were studying, which  improved my understanding of each work by introducing new ideas and insights on each piece or providing constructive criticism. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nWe were only given a few days to craft an intelligent, engaging thesis/idea for our essays, which felt a bit rushed to me. For someone who takes a long time to think about what they've read and come up with a convincing and original thesis to work with, this was a bit difficult for me. I would often begin writing with little direction since I was not fully convinced with the idea that I originally came up with, and thus I would often be forced to re-direct my writing after the first draft. \r\n\r\nWe were also only given a week to write the first draft of our essays and only a week to edit and submit the final draft, which, for me, since I tend to take a long time to develop an essay, felt a bit rushed. Also, we read each piece in a very short time frame and thus there was often a large amount of reading that had to be done in a very short amount of time. This also felt quite rushed to me, and I felt as though it was hard to really appreciate each piece and delve into the entire piece on my own, as I simply did not have enough time to do so in the short amount of time I had to read such a large amount of text.  To improve this, I think it would be helpful if students were given a bit more time to work on assignments and read each piece in the future. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend The Art of Mourning with Ann Killian specifically to another student. Annie is, perhaps, the kindest teacher I've ever had. She carefully crafted every aspect of the class, from our Hamlet viewings with pizza to our field trip to Grove Street Cemetery to see the grave of a man we had grown to love through one of our books. This class is a hidden gem here at Yale, and actually teaches you about the \"real world\" in a unique way. Don't miss this opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great class where you learn so much in a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! This class was so helpful in learning how to become a better and more concise writer, and our course selections and discussions were all super interesting! Highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this is a great class and a great opportunity to improve ones reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0It really depends on how interested the student is on the subject, because we are talking about death and mourning a lot(!) but I think it was a great experience personally and I really liked reading and learning with Annie. Shes a great professor and overall really nice person and I wouldnt miss out on the opportunity to have a class with her. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student. Not only was the material we learned interesting, but it was also well taught. Professor Killian, is an amazing teacher that taught me how to improve my writing abilities as well as close-reading abilities. Another thing, which I did not find in other instructors at Yale, was that she was considerate of how much work to give for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Killian is an empathetic, understanding, and thoughtful instructor. Her presence in the classroom makes people feel comfortable opening up. The conversations in the office hour are indeed very enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0English 115 is a great course to take when you are a first-year or if you need a writing credit. The reading is rather easy to accomplish and the papers are not too demanding. If you take one of these courses in a subject that you are really interested in, then I think the class should be very rewarding for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! If you are looking to improve your writing skills or you are already a strong writer and would like to brush up on your skills, this is a great course to take. However, it is definitely a bit challenging, so I would not take it lightly. You should be prepared to think critically and write meaningfully when you go into this course, so if this is not for you, reconsider why you want to take this course. However, with that being said, you will receive a lot of feedback, advice and encouragement from Professor Killian in the writing process, and there are ample opportunities to meet with her during office hours outside of class, so you should not be intimidated by this course!
