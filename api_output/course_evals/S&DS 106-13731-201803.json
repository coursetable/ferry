            "\u00a0I gained a general understanding of the principal statistics concepts necessary to conduct statistical analyses. I also learned how to use the R coding language to complete these analyses. ",
            "\u00a0Stats 100 was great, brilliant. Learned a lot and the professor was very engaging. Learned about basic statistical concepts that are very useful.\r\n\r\nStats 106 was meh, a little bit of R. To be honest was not impressed with this class. ",

            "\u00a0Great course; loved the first half and the section with Prof. Brinda on R is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0One strength in the general part of the course is that all the lectures are recorded and you so you never actually have to go to lecture. Also, JRS is a pretty enthusiastic teacher and I liked his sense of humor during lectures. It helped make the lectures more engaging than they otherwise would be. One weakness is that while the first half of the course is very well organized, the second half of the course is very disorganized, but because the material was relatively easy, it was fine in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Stats 100\r\n\r\nStrengths: extremely well organized for learning. Power points and lectures were great no weaknesses.\r\n\r\n\r\nStats 106\r\n\r\nStrengths: teacher had written out his own textbook and programming assignments were fairly easy to complete given this. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The teacher was extremely boring and the class did not flow well from stat 100 which was very good. Felt like he was just deriving stuff on the board without engaging students at all and didn't really have a plan. On Canvas, it said we had like 10 different assignments due but only 2 of them were actually real. Very disorganized. For a while there was no central place for homework and instructor would change homework in class on a daily basis by writing it on the chalk board like a high school class. In fact, that's what it felt like -- a high school class. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Reuning-Scherer is fantastic. He presents basic statistics in a creative and interesting way. \r\nThe R-programming part of the course was poorly organized and I admit to feeling bored during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0It was well taught and the professor was passionate. ",
            "\u00a0The slides for the first part of the semester are very important and well put together. The exams are fairly easy as long as you study and actually try to learn the material. Since all the lectures are live streamed and posted, you dont have to go to class itself. There are a lot of TAs and people who can help, and I really liked the Canvas page and how it was composed. In the second half of the class, it was a little boring to go through R code all of class, but Dr. Brinda still tried to show us the beauty of R and statistics, especially data visualization. The class is very fast paced and a little boring at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great instructor, well-taught material, very engaging lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: NA ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: they've clearly taught it a million times before, so it's pretty streamlined\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt I didn't learn much yet could still slide by and do decently just by regurgitating information they gave us. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Super relevant to science and research courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Before taking this course, I had never taken AP stat so I was able to learn a lot about basic statistical concepts. The course also wasn't particularly difficult, and I did fine in the course in spite of the fact that I had never taken AP statistics before. As for the second half of the course, I would recommend it to students, but if you are not actively planning on using R in the near future, the course will seem rather boring and useless. Because you don't actually learn that much about putting together lines of code in R (the only coding you do involves a few short homework exercises), you won't actually become that familiar with the language. Personally, I became much more familiar with R through the course, but only because I was coding a script for my research lab at the same time. Of course, if you are looking for an easy second half statistics course, this course does provide a very easy 5 weeks as you don't learn any new statistical concepts and the R that you do learn is very basic. Full disclosure, I had done a little coding in python prior to taking this class (all through self-learning) so I was somewhat familiar with basic concepts in coding such as functions and variables. These basic concepts were pretty poorly explained in the class, but they are also pretty easy to grasp so I don't think it would be a problem even if you had never had any exposure to coding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any Yale student, regardless of their major. The knowledge you gain in this course can be applicable in any field; you should take this course at some point in your Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Stats 100\r\nYes, loved it. Learned a ton\r\n\r\n\r\nStats 106 \r\nNo, this had the feel of a high school course, was very boring and unorganized, and the professor had no energy. Total let down from Stat 100 taught at the beginning of the semester. I never knew what the homework was. Thumbs down. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that students learn R-programming, but hesitate to recommend this particular course to other students. It was quite boring and disorganized at times. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was informative and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because learning a little bit about data science is important. I really liked taking 106 specifically because R is really important for most careers and it can help to get you started with using it. Also, the topics are very well connected to the first half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0NO, this course was pretty bad. Not well organized, very grade-centric, did fine but didn't learn much. "
