            "\u00a0I learned so much about birds (which I didn't really expect) and about humans (which I did)! The class was very interesting, mostly because the book Richard Prum wrote is extremely wonderful. I learned a lot about queer theory and a lot about birds and how they attract mates. DUCK SEX IS SO INSANE. JUST BE WARNED. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this class helped me strengthen skills related to scientific and critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I gained many insights into the nature of aesthetics and evolution, and discussed so many topics that I've never even given much thought to before. A very illuminating, thought-provoking course. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an introduction into the process of aesthetic evolution, and provided me perspective on the debate the evolutionary biology world is faced with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that there is a whole different side to evolution. This class made me question a lot of things I thought I'd knew about the world around me (in a good way). In this class we also took this aesthetic view on life, starting with birds and other animals, and found ways to apply it to humans, art, sexuality, and so much more. Such an interesting and unique class! ",
            "\u00a0Because this class is intended to be for everyone, not just STEM majors, much of the skills will not be strictly pertaining to ornithology. You will gain a fuller understanding of evolution as a whole and be able to better understand the origin of traits and behavior, but you will also have insight into a range of connected issues, Iike art in the natural and human world and sexual coercion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about novel aspects of aesthetic preference, sexual selection, and female evolutionary autonomy. I am sure that I could not have learned any of this in any other class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new insights into the evolution and how other factors rather than survival played a role towards making species evolve. "

            "\u00a0This class had some problems because I don't really think it's a seminar class. We simply read the book and then came into class to ask Professor Prum questions. There was not much to discuss, because there wasn't much to interpret about what we were learning. Science doesn't lend itself easily to a discussion based class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material of the class was extremely interesting, and I love how it was centered on in-class discussion of the material.\r\n\r\n If there was any way this class could be improved, it could possibly be by having more readings from opposing scientists. I also felt like the course moved a little slowly, but this wasn't entirely bad. The fact that the pace was a little slow actually made the workload a bit lighter and helped me not be completely overwhelmed by schoolwork. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths would be the topics discussed, which are so interesting and illuminating. However, the weakness would be the discussions. As a seminar, the discussions were a little stilted, and more on the Q&A side. ",
            "\u00a0At first the course didn't haven too much structure and students did more listening than participating but by the middle of the semssfer we were participating in debates, explaining concepts, finding our own real life applications/implications and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0There could be different ways to discuss the material rather than just randomly talking about topics every class. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is the fact that some students go in with little understanding of evolution and ecology, making it sometimes difficult to have meaningful conversations in class. However, Professor Prum is a very enthusiastic teacher who helped bridge the gap between the material we learned and our prior knowledge (and often, prior misconceptions). I think one way to improve it would be to assign a range of readings. We stuck mostly to his book (which is fantastic!) and academic papers, but perhaps integrating other online resources would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the discussions were a bit loose ended and made it a bit hard to engage, but once they became more structured the class definitely improved. My favorite part about this class was definitely the fact that Professor Prum was the only one in his field that held these beliefs, and therefore that he was the expert on everything that he was saying. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with less reliance on the students to generate and continue class-wide discussion. Class format often consisted of the professor opening the discussion up for questions about the previous chapter that had been read.  There was no structured prompts or leading ideas, and this made for a boring hour of class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the high extent that the professor made it to be very engaging, through the contents presented and the multiple debates. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class if you enjoy reading about birds and if you enjoy learning about sex and why we find specific things attractive. It's a great book to read anyway. Richard Prum has so much knowledge it's amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class because it's very interesting and not too difficult even if you're not much of a science person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, mostly because of how much I learned. However, I'd hope that the discussions would improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You not only get a glimpse of ornothology but you also are introduced to ideas that completely oppose what you learned in high school and make you question the world around you. ",
            "\u00a0This course opened my eyes to so many connections between human behavior, traits, and art and that of the non-human animal world. As an artist who usually avoids science, I was skeptical going in, but Im so glad I took this class as I see the world differently and think about art differently, as well. I would recommend this class to anyone who is curious and up to a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  Professor Prum holds very interesting class discussions, and the text is easy to read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you will not be able to learn this material from anyone other than Professor Prum. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who have a clear interest in the details of bird behavior and sexual relations, since most of the course focuses on birds rather than humans. "
