I learned the emphasis of relative status in the polite/humble forms of speech, and the in-group out-group concept. I am able to fluently write the hiragana and katakana scripts, and have learned the 75 kanji required for this course. ",

I have interacted with fluent Japanese speakers and been able to simply express my ideas in Japanese. I was surprised at how relevant every word and form we learned was for basic conversation.\r\nUnfortunately, this class moves very quickly, and even though I was committed, I did not have the time to fully learn all the material presented. I picked up most of the key points, but I was not able to spend time doing speaking drills or additional listening practice simply because there was so much. ",

            "\u00a0Very demanding but not necessarily a bad thing. Wish was infrastructure in place that would make missing a class feasible. For example, had I fallen sick last semester, I STILL would've gone to Japanese because the thought of missing this class was frightening. ",
