            "\u00a0The course provided an overview of European history from before WWI to Brexit. ",
            "\u00a0Im still not quite sure. I know that this is not a traditional history class and that the intent of the course was to change/question the way we think of history, which in turn should help inform our thinking about contemporary events. However, I dont know that I actually gained that. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Snyder doesn't seem to particularly enjoy teaching the course. The 1 hr/wk seminars weren't enough time to fully engage with the readings and the seminars themselves often felt disorganized and like a waste of time. There was not enough guidance or feedback to develop or refine skills in history so I'm not quite sure what the point of the course was. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting, but an ambitious concept to teach the core of historical analysis techniques and cover a broad range of topics in a single class. This meant that students were often struggling to complete readings and rushing through the material.\r\n\r\nAs a core course for Jackson, the focus of a history course could be broader than (eastern) Europe.\r\n\r\nI got more out of the class listening to the professor speak and discussing themes/readings in class. The simulations component was weak. Especially in the case of Brexit, the simulation was not well organized because there was a lot of confusion about the mechanics of how it would work. While I learned a lot about the topic, the Brexit simulation also seemed an odd choice for a history class given how dynamically events were changing - it seemed more of an IR class simulation. ",
            "\u00a0- Virtually little to no structure to the course. I would say this is the major contributor to why Im still not entirely sure what I was supposed to take away from this course because there did not seem to be a sense of purpose or structure to each class. While there were assigned readings each week and they appeared to be in a linear fashion starting from WWI onward, the classes themselves had no structure. Most days we would go around the table and discuss a theme we took away from the reading and Prof. Snyder would offer his thoughts. While his insights were certainly interesting, I dont think much else was gained out of that, frankly. \r\n- Instructors offer minimal guidance for assignments. My classmates and I were often quite confused as to the homework assignments as very minimal guidance/instruction would be communicated  when we asked for further clarification, we were usually told to refer to the syllabus, which offered minimal information. This was a particular issue when it came to the simulations as groups were often unsure of what was expected in terms of briefs (length, format, content, etc.) and presentations. \r\n- Simulations did not seem particularly relevant and were far too amateurish to be helpful in terms of professional development. We were also informed that the lack of structure or a set format was intentional, which lent to the haphazard nature of these simulations  no one ever knew what they should be doing before or during these simulations. They are also so far removed from how real negotiations are actually done. I thought the last simulation on Brexit seemed particularly poorly planned (e.g. why was Poland was included, but not Ireland, until the last minute?). And again, there was no real structure or connection to reality in these negotiations, which meant there was little to be gained in terms of professional development. ",
            "\u00a0strenghts: interesting material, i liked the format, engaged professors for the most part\r\nWeaknesses: the final negotiation was extremely poorly organized, which created much uneccessary stress for students, and I consider was very disrespectful of both the students and also the guest professors we invited. It showed a lack of engagement and understanding of the professors of what a real negotiation entails, and perhaps a lack of willingness to learn and a stubborness in improving the event. Unfortunately, the negotiation in itself thus fared poorly because of lack of clear preparation, which is unfortunate as it was an interesting project. "

            "\u00a0No. Frankly, I didnt see the utility of this class in terms of my professional or academic development. If the intention is to include a class to develop policy class in the Jackson core curriculum, then I would suggest having an actual policy class  not a history class that tries to incorporate policy.
