            "\u00a0This intro course taught me the basics of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and whetted my appetite for delving into global health and research. It talked a lot about the challenges of global health but also talked about ways to get involved with interventions and responses. ",
            "\u00a0So much. The Big Three, health systems, social determinants of health, healthcare supply chain, WASH, NTDs, ethical issues in health, etc.\r\n\r\nI also didn't expect to learn so much about looking at data and being CRITICAL of data. We were constantly asking - where did these numbers come from? What is missing from this chart/map/histogram/whatever graphic? ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different diseases and about global health as a whole. I also learned a little about how global health works, and how complicated the overall area is. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much biological, social, and economic background about disease around the world.  The course gives you the tools you need to ask questions about global health and maybe find some answers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the state of healthcare around the world. I really feel like this class should be mandatory for anyone traveling abroad in a health-related way. I look back at how little I knew about global health before this class and I am shocked by my own ignorance. I loved learning about communicable and non-communicable diseases and how we are handling these issues. I also got the opportunity to hear from many guest lecturers about the incredible work they do in this field. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great for bringing an interdisciplinary, broad approach to global health topics. ",
            "\u00a0Didn't learn much content about global health. Learned a lot of life advice from various speakers in global health. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me think critically about a lot of issues in global health I had only ever though about in passing or from a general, abstract perspective and about a lot of issues I'd never have thought would be so important. I learned a lot about the different ways a career in global health can develop, which was hugely beneficial and eye-opening for me because that is what I want to do with my life, and I learned about the different skills necessary to forge such a career. Because I am a science major myself, a lot of the scientific topics of the course were taught a little slowly for me, but they ended up contextualizing the broader, more human topics nicely. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to analyze global health challenges from a systemic viewpoint, focusing on policy and institutionalization (taking the blame off of the individual). We learned about communicable diseases (HIV/AIDS, Malaria, TB), non-communicable diseases (diabetes, cancer, ischemic heart disease, etc), the different components of a health system, and more. It' an accessible intro class that seriously teaches you a ton.\r\nI've never taken any HLTH or GLBL classes before, and after taking this course, I believe I want to pursue some sort of career in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much information about global health in this class--from the variety of communicable and non-communicable diseases to water and sanitation problems to global health funding. I also learned how people apply global health in their own lives through guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the global complexity of public health on many fronts, and learned to think about issues regarding public health (and beyond) in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many of the most pressing issues in global health and what challenges accompany them.  We discussed what can be done to mitigate and overcome these challenges, as well as what is currently being done to do so. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough understanding of the basic concepts in global health, including analysis of the big three communicable diseases, neglected tropical diseases, and noncommunicable diseases. Insight into the mechanisms of global health funding, resource management and dispersal, research ethics, and socio-political context of disease. ",
            "\u00a0I learned close to nothing from this class. Only the 1/4 of the class can actually deliver some knowledge. The rest, is extremely repetitive, boring, non-informative. The big three and some epidemic definitions help, I guess, but what else is there in this class? Probably not a lot. The prof puts up a powerpoint so patchy that resembles the work I did in high school, in which you stayed up till 3 in the morning and spent 45 mins to make the powerpoint. She doesn't understand the methodology behind the data, nor how to interpret the data correctly. The way she presents the knowledge offers no insight in the global health field at all. ",
            "\u00a0There is the emotional element to global health and there is the intellectual element. This class teaches you both. It teaches you the quantifiable in unison with the social. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about global health on a molecular, societal, and holistic basis. This course taught me to analyze existing health issues and figure out possible solutions. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot more science-heavy than previously imagined (pretty exclusively in the first-half of the semester) however, it's a perfect set up for understanding the social and political aspects of how diseases impact the world and the global burden of mortality and morbidity. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing! Professor Talbert-Slagle provided a comprehensive view of global health issues from historical, biological, social, and economic perspectives thus illustrating global health studies as a truly interdisciplinary field of study. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a comprehensive introduction and survey of global health. We began by learning about the \"Big Three\" communicable diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS), and transitioned after the midterm to the study of noncommunicable diseases (such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes). We also covered related topics, such as environmental determinants of health and neocolonial perspectives on modern global health efforts. We also learned how to write concept notes and policy briefs through the two writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class on all the major themes in global health. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about all sorts of aspects relating to the healthcare field both locally and abroad. I definitely learned of the value of interdisciplinary work and a well-rounded education in the healthcare field. One of the most important insights that was reiterated over and over again was that we did not have to be on a clear-cut path to a healthcare career but that we ought to rather do as much as we can to help others and ourselves as we are able. I really enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a very good introduction to what global health is. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of global health problems and past responses and some skills for coming up with solutions myself. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the world of public health and challenges on a global scale. \r\n\r\nExperience in writing a policy memo and a funding proposal.\r\n\r\nOpportunities to listen to public health experts talk about their career experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Interplay between government/ policymakers, health workers, and the public.  I realized how crucial funding sources are, the importance of distribution channels and organization, and the balance between cost-effectiveness and spread vs. depth of treatment. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course really emphasizes asking questions during class, but the class is a tad bit too big for that to be effective in implementation. Section does solve this issue though, except that section wasn't explicitly mentioned as a part of the class on the course selection, and students were not aware of it until class. Also, there was little structure and guidance for the papers, and some students were very surprised when it came to grading/expectations. The guest lecturers (about 1 every 1-1.5 weeks) have been absolutely inspiring and amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Really gave a great holistic view of global health. All the different things that can affect and individual and a population. Social determinants of health were emphasized ALL the time. Loved the guest lecturers and Q&A session with them - it was awesome to see all the different areas of global health, pathways to get there, etc. Everyone was so passionate talking about their work. Writing assignments were pretty good, forced me to learn a new way of writing to specific audiences in the context of global health - no artsy writing needed; just very straightforward, concise, powerful language. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how we broke the class up into different areas and subjects, it helped clarify things and made the class as a whole more understandable. However, the class could be a bit better organized because it was very unclear how important the readings were, and how much I really needed to know. Some classes also got very bogged down by graphs (and people asking about graph axises) which although they were important and interesting, didn't really give me concrete knowledge to use. So maybe a few less graphs because they often tell a similar story, and a bit more solid information. I also really appreciated the detailed instructions for the writing assignments, but a rubric would have also been helpful since there wasn't much feedback and some of the grading felt very arbitrary. \r\nI also liked the guest lecturers, they were all very interesting a brought in good and different perspectives (though some of them needed to speak louder because it was almost impossible to hear them). However, there were a few too many guest lecturers in my opinion, since they broke up the flow of class, and I learned a lot about their experiences but not as much about global health and different problems as a whole. So maybe a balance between having guest lecturers but not that many. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED the discussion based learning style of this class. There were so many helpful learning tools-- the discussion sections, the flipped classroom, the global visualization maps. Also, as the main strength, Professor Talbert-Slagle was amazing and super friendly. I think every student fell in love with her personality. She was amazing. I'm not sure how this course could be improved because it was already so good! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the breadth of this course! We learned not only about communicable and noncommunicable diseases, but also the social determinants of health and the cultural context of health care. I really feel that this class broadened my horizons and bolstered my understanding of public/global health. ",
            "\u00a0Hearing the life stories/research of the guest speakers is an interesting introduction to global health. However, I never really felt like I learned any content and the topics we learned about were very disjointed.  Overall, I wish the class had more structure and maybe some more specific case studies rather than huge general statements. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course's curriculum was wholly valuable, but if it were reordered, it would set a much better tone. We started with biology, which was important as I mentioned but a little dehumanizing and certainly apolitical. Thus, when we had to write concept notes or policy briefs and later moved into topics like funding and neocolonialism, I felt a little removed from the human impact of the issues. This was especially true in section, as we worked with a lot of cool infographics that reduced these issues to numbers and statistics. I think our time in section on the whole could have been used more effectively--it was nice to go over some key terms leading up to the exams, and it was good to do group work, but there was a large missed opportunity for more critical discussion not forced into the framework of one of these infographics or learning platforms. As a side note, there was really slow turnaround time on every single assignment (we still haven't gotten feedback on our final writing assignment, which was due over two weeks before the end of classes). As for lectures, Prof. Talbert-Slagle was very engaged with the class, but there were a lot of guest lectures, so it was hard to have continuity within the curriculum/a lot of the content was presented by different people in different ways, so it was hard to make connections and string it all together. On the whole, I really wish that this class were not exam based--I think that reducing this incredibly valuable and important field to some definitions, some short answers, and ultimately a numerical score based on a rigid rubric is limiting and defeats the purpose of trying to paint the discipline as holistic and human. I know that there have to be grades somehow, but I think that more papers or projects would have reflected the values the course strove to instill better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content is very interesting, many famous guest speakers, passionate professor, cross between a lecture and seminar, not too many assignments, readings are optional (complimentary to the lectures)\r\nWeaknesses: inconsistent posting of the lecture slides, a few too many guest lectures, some activities were \"trial by fire\"-esque, tangents happen often ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the most interesting and informative classes I took. The lectures and guest lectures as well as discussion sections were all very helpful in solidifying our understanding of the concepts. And Professor Talbert-Slagle was a fantastic instructor and was very enthusiastic and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class, in large part because of the staff. Prof. TS is so caring and puts so much effort into the class and into her students--she wants to make sure that everyone is comfortable, learning, and heard. She also is incredibly receptive to questions and inquiries, and if there's ever something she can't answer, she notes it and comes back to it the next class rather than dismissing the question. It's a small lecture that almost has a seminar vibe, and creates an amazing learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great intro course and was really meaningful.  It could be improved by discussing some of the barriers to global health in general--such as issues like financing and neocolonialism--more towards the beginning of the class because they would have provided a different lens through which to see the rest of the issues we discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong survey of the major issues and trends in global health. Almost every other class was taught by a guest speaker from the YSPH or the Medical School who gave lecture in their field of expertise. \r\n\r\nBecause the field is so broad and covers so many different massive issues, it often felt as though each individual topic was done only superficially. This is not any fault of the structure of the class because there is no way it could've been done any differently, but it was still a frustration. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:  to blind student's names on their midterm and essay is good. except I don't see the point if one TA grades everything anyways. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nProvide real insight into global health please. understand the methodology behind the development of DALYs, understand the data, how they are collected and what are the potential biases. Grade things faster. Make the coursework less repetitive. Follow your own rules (late, phone etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n-It was amazing to have so many guest speakers with such interesting ideas. \r\n-The exams and writing assignments were extremely fairly and well designed to actually facilitate learning and not just for the grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting, and we moved at an appropriate pace.\r\n\r\nHowever, some assignments took a while to grade, which could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting!! Thoroughly loved it. \r\nWeaknesses: If you're not science-y the first-half of the course could be a little dull, but it's ultimately worth it ! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting material and professor really cares about everything she's teaching\r\nWeakness: I'm not really sure how our stuff was graded and I wish we got more information about how we can help our grades. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall great. It is definitely going to be one of my favorite courses that I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how Professor Talbert-Slagle encouraged extensive class discussion even though this course was technically a lecture. The two writing assignments offered a nice window into the types of work that global health researchers and practitioners carry out, and the guest speakers illustrated the various kinds of work being done their respective fields of global health. This class could be improved with a bit more structure, however, because sometimes there was so much information to present that there was no clear beginning or end to a given topic. ",
            "\u00a0Major strength is how passionate Professor Talbert Slagle is about the material. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength is the humanity and kindness of all the instructors, as well as the guest speakers who were incredibly interesting and had a lot to say. I think that a weakness is a weakness that all introductory courses face - i wish we were able to go into more detail about certain topics of interest. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Talbert-Slagle and the TAs obviously care a lot about the course, and they are wonderful. However, so much of it was listing of random things that could just be provided. For example, we spent an entire class looking at the affect of alcohol on various NCDs, but it was just the professor reading graphs on the spot, which we could easily do. We also spent an entire class listing various players in global health funding. It was pointless to have the class provide this; I did not think about anything all class. If the list were provided on a slide, I would have the same takeaway in maybe three minutes. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course is that towards the end of the semester, the information that we learned in class became very repetitive. However, the lectures are very clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: section discussion was great, I enjoyed the moment where we had to critically reflect on the issues within global health, the guest lectures were usually pretty interesting too\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures often got very wrapped up in details that didn't further understanding of course material or facilitate discussion or reflection, the attempts to plan out section undermined great discussion that naturally come from the topic material, the division of the class meant that important ideas like ethics or equity that should underlay the entire subject were relegated to a couple lectures in a way that felt reductionist ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has many strengths. It teaches public health in a person-oriented manner, paying careful attention to teach students to choose their descriptive words carefully in an area of health studies that deals with large populations of people and groups of marginalize minorities.\r\n\r\nOne small critique was that the expectations for written assignments grading was rather unclear in most cases. \r\n\r\nOverall, the course material is great. Covers a breadth of the sphere of public health. However, I think the way the course is structured in a lecture format does not lend itself well to maximum student engagement. The class in its current form is an untraditional lecture format that encourages students to engage in answering questions during lecture. However, I think the class would be more well-suited in a seminar format, with occasional lectures interspersed throughout the classes. I often felt that sections brought up some of the most insightful points of discussion, and to have a \"small group breakout\" format and then a large group amalgamation of sections (like we did in the flipped classroom classes) would be a great way of having students engage with the material. I realize the logistics of planning out a seminar-based introductory course is difficult, but courses like ENGL 114, 120 could be good examples of structures that work. Moving to a seminar/lecture format of the course would also eliminate the need for a separate discussion section. ",

Seriously, this class is amazing and you should take it just because its offered. Its also not very difficult so if you're looking for a chill but engaging fifth class, this is great.

It is not that demanding of a course but does require some engagement. If you know that you're interested in global health and this course is not a requirement, it might be a little frustrating because there is a lot of focus on the sorts of specifics that can be memorized and forgotten and not enough focus on critical discussion of the issues that shape the field in the first place.

You get exposure to many of the best researchers in global health on Yale's campus and get to have relatively small, in depth interactions with these people. ",

            "\u00a0Do not take this class, unless you want a BORING gut,  because this class offers no new insight, like, not at all. The worst class I have taken so far at Yale. \r\n\r\nThe lectures are extremely boring and repetitive. Prof Talbert-Slagle seems pretty nice, so I guess that's why most people (first-years) in this class like her, but she is never around, and she never grades your work, or give feedback( which is honestly, something you don't even need). The PPTs and lecture material are SO PATCHY. Arrogant as I might sound, I can put up similar PPT within 2h. All you need to do is go on PubMed, search key words like \"diabetes\", and then copy the nice looking graphs that come in the top results. You don't need to do any of the readings, why? Because I don't think the Prof herself does any of the readings. Whenever a student asks a question in class, regarding the data, or the methodology behind the data, chances are that \" she will get back to you next time\", and she rarely does. All she does is to cite papers and put the nice-looking graphs on her powerpoint, without understanding how the data was gathered, how to interpret the data, and what are the weakness of that measurement. In essence, I don't think she understands the material much better than a layperson, OR, she assumes we are all dumb and takes a whole semester to understand 2 simple concepts. \r\n\r\nThe work of this class, is easy and boring. Same as most Yalies, I like studying, learning new things, gaining new ways of thinking. No matter how difficult or easy the class I take, I always find the exams or assignments challenging, or satisfying, or both. If the assignment or exam is hard, and I find it difficult, but I know I am learning new things and need to put in more effort. If the assignment or exam is moderately difficult, and I feel like I can do well in it, then it is satisfying, because I know I have put in enough effort and received the corresponding reward --- a good grade, or the feeling that I have mastered something. I GET NONE OF THESE. The work is neither challenging nor interesting. Whenever I do work for this class, I couldn't help but question what's the purpose of the work, and what I am getting out of it. Sitting in the exams, I just want to leave, because the exams are so dreadful, and you feel like you are writing the same thing over and over again. No thinking is required for this class, just regurgitate whatever you recited in class, and pour all of it on the exam day. You will be fine then. \r\n\r\nIn all, not worth your time. plus, this class goes overtime very often. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Talbert-Slage is amazing, as is the work that she does. Her teaching is thoughtful, meaningful, and excellent overall. I really enjoyed going to class and found it easy to remain engaged. I feel like I learned quite a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course tries to be good, and the professor and TAs are wonderful, but I really felt as though I did not use any critical thinking, or thinking at all. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0No, don't take this class unless you have to for the Global Health Studies program\r\nThe material is theoretically interesting, but taught in a way that makes it a boring class. There are other classes that cover the same or very similar material that are more engaging ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in how culture, economics, and behavior influences health outcomes around the world, I recommend.  Interesting to observe how health trends have changed (infectious disease morbidity to NCDs). "
