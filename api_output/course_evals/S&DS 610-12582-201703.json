While struggling to solve the problem sets, I learned many interesting ways to handle theoretical questions in Statistics. Moreover, both take-home exams were extremely challenging and exciting!\r\n\r\nWith respect to the problem sets, I have only one suggestion: providing solutions to the exercises would be very useful for the students' learning process.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is that, frequently, the lecture time was dedicated to solve very simple questions or to give multiple examples about one topic. Dedicating more time to complicated proofs and general examples may be more efficient than showing several simple cases. ",
