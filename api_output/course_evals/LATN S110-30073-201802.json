            "\u00a0It is a hyper-aggressive course; I'd suggest not taking it concurrently with anything else! ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of information to take in in just 5 weeks. They course could be longer so as to allow students more time to process concepts. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in languages, linguistics, the classics, Rome, or anything related to Latin. You'll need to be interested because this class is tough and there's a LOT of work, but Professor Robinson is excellent and funny and makes the class a lot of fun, while also being an incredibly intelligent and insightful teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to another student as being extremely interesting; however, I would also mention that the pressure to master so much information in such little time could prevent someone from engaging with the language as much as one would like. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! But this is not a class for the faint of heart; if you're taking the summer module, I'd suggest not taking it concurrently with another class, because the workload is quite aggressive. That said, you get a lot out of it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Although it is pretty intensive course, the materials and the explanations of the professor allow the students to grasp the elements of Latin Grammar very easily. The fact that the students learn to read Latin in just a few days makes the course really attractive. The fast improvement makes the effort worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if that student was interested in Latin or required it for research. "
