            "\u00a0The course examined representional strategies in three genres/media: novel, film, and history/historiography. The course provided a survey of some of the most important works of francophone African literature and cinema and read them in tandem with historical accounts. An underlying goal, I think, was to attend to the particuliarities of each genre/media and to try to understand what spaces and avenues of inquiry are opened up by aesthetic works such as literature and film in contrast to more 'official' historical records/narratives.
