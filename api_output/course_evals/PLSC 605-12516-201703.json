            "\u00a0I learnt about the development of Western sovereignty, both in the broad sweep and granular detail, and then how different concepts of sovereignty impact migration and human rights law. It was my first time in a political philosophy class, and I learnt how to engage in this discipline at a graduate levelboth from the texts and from discussions between my fellow students/professor. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging with the long (and contentious) history of the concepts of sovereignty and human rights helped me to apply theoretical tools to contemporary issues. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Almost complete overview of Western sovereignty, which is helpful in itself. Put readings forward that could open up new lines of thought/ways of thinking through old problems, which should help shape the next generation of political thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0To the extent that there was classroom discussion, it was highly fragmented, with people talking pass each other, and most often took the form of 20 people each having a one-on-one conversation with Professor Benhabib. However, I did enjoy Professor Benhabibs own lecturing -- it was clear and helpful. "

            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. Prof. Benhabib does an amazing job at making us think innovatively about ways in which sovereignty and human rights can be subtly connected, and the syllabus provides for a coherent and compelling progression throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Brilliant professor, brilliant subject, and of practical importance. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses I have taken. Prof. Benhabib managed to construct a syllabus with tremendous breadth without compromising on depth. The class discussions were consistently stimulating, and the opportunity to think through recent legal cases in light of the theory discussed was very valuable. I would recommend this course without reservation for all willing to work hard and participate in class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student that would like an experience, but not if what they want is substantial intellectual growth. This class has an unusual arrangement in putting students with different backgrounds (law, philosophy, political theory) together in the same classroom, and the readings were also a very diverse collection, yet there was very little productive discussion in the classroom -- people seemed to be talking pass each other all the time, precisely because they came from different backgrounds, using different jargons and mindsets, and there was little guidance as to how to explain their thoughts to others who dont share their background, not did they (by they\" I mean some) seem to care about helping others understand what they were talking about. At the end of the day, Professor Benhabuib seems to be the sole person who was able to understand everyone, and got the most out of this class. "
