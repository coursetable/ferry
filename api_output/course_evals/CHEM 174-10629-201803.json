I did not expect organic chemistry to include so much analytical thinking. Initially, I thought it would be a lot of memorization and quantitative thinking, but we hardly dealt with numbers. Instead, there was a lot of memorization, but memorization of concepts and patterns that you had to apply and defend the application of. By this, I was pleasantly surprised. ",

This information relates heavily to the corresponding CHEM222L course, and the lecture and lab built off each other. I also learned that organic chemistry is quite hard, and certainly requires both memorization of circumstances and an innate understanding of your situation, including rules and visualizing molecules in your head. A model kit is essential, will help your grade by the time you hit discussions on chirality and molecular rings.  Finally, I understand electron-pushing formalism and mechanisms.\r\n\r\nI also believe I learned this information better than I would have in the sophomore level course-- the topic is covered with greater depth and exams are generally more difficult. However, this gets made up for by skipping general chemistry lab and a year of general chemistry. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is how passionate the professor is. Unlike other orgo classes, this one focuses on understanding of reactions, instead of routine concepts like nomenclature (though it became a bit rushed with more memorization towards the end). While this admittedly makes the exams harder, it also makes them a lot more interesting. I wish we had been given more time on tests, though. Sometimes lecture felt a bit disorganized as well with notes scattered everywhere, though it definitely helps if you read the textbook beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0We cover all of the material very quickly, so it is an advanced version of an already difficult subject. Exams are designed to be difficult, but the weekly psets are relatively easy. So, students generally have a good understanding of the material, but only after going above and beyond assigned work (re-copying notes, going to office hours, doing many practice questions, etc). I think that it would be beneficial to have problem sets that are more similar to exams in difficulty, or to lower the difficulty of assessments. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that it only met for 50 minutes three times a week and not any longer, as this is close to the maximum time one can pay attention to this material. I also liked how the lecture material correlated very nicely with the information in the textbook. The TAs, peer tutors, and Professor Miller were always available for help, which was very nice. The tests were challenging which made them somewhat hard to study for, but also very rewarding in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, challenging yet intriguing content\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we had more opportunities for individual help ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the class is how much we learn. One weakness of the course is that it goes a bit fast to try to cover several topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting to learn and keeps me engaged.\r\nThis course can improve by taking more time going over the topics that are more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The course should have provided more practice problems for the three tests. Three practice tests per in class test would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0There were many avenues available to get help on the course material. TA led sections, TF led office hours, and professor lead office hours were always helpful and abundant. Weaknesses of the course include poor communication of the grading curve and no feedback on problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Scott Miller is very engaging in lecture and the material is interesting but the course moves along at a very fast pace and is definitely challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum of this course was not very organized. We would jump into a random topic, then come back and learn the foundations of that topic. That made learning all the material very confusing. (This problem was partially the textbook's fault, but also partially the professor's fault.) ",
            "\u00a0It's a little bit fast paced but it's also super engaging and interesting. There's a bit of a gap with the lectures and problem sets and readings, but strategically, the readings can be made as a primer for lecture material if you have the time. At that stage, I think that's the optimum way to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: professor was very knowledgable in the area and the class was very interesting. Tests were relatively challenging but grading was (for the most part) reasonable.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the professor would sometimes go on tangents, and while they were interesting, it was difficult to differentiate what to study for on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Miller does a great job at posting and addressing really interesting journal articles about the relationship between class material and current research. This class is definitely difficult, but it is well-rewarding. \r\nWeaknesses: Discussion section wasn't always the most helpful and was very TA dependent. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of the course is that many of the students are very passionate about the subject, and thus I was able to connect with many of the students who took the course.  Another strength is that there is a clear correlation between lectures and the textbook, and thus there is plenty of supplemental material to assist learning. However, a weakness of this course is that students are not expected to have read the chapter covering the lecture BEFORE the lecture. I think this class would be improved if homework for the chapter was due right before the professor began lecturing on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the textbook, the TAs, and the Professor. The weaknesses of this course is that sometimes you are tested on material that was not mentioned in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The depth of the tests far exceeded the textbook. I would suggest changing to a more comprehensive text. ",
            "\u00a0It oftentimes felt as if Prof. Miller expected us to know a lot more than I did, and his class moved extremely quickly. He'd often just name-drop terms and expect us to know them, and I felt lost for a lot of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness is that frequently the tests ask about material not directly covered in lecture and that frequently material only made available during office hours is present on tests. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Miller was an incredible instructor. He was a mentor to all of us, and encouraged questions and group collaboration. His knowledge of organic chemistry is immensely vast, and it was simply inspiring to be able to see how Prof. Miller thinks when given a problem. I did not see any weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0it's super hard and requires a LOT of time, but it's well taught and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness is that the problem sets mostly consisted of problems not directly related to the material covered in class and many of the problems were on topics we did not cover. The strength is the amount of resources available to students, the many opportunities to get your grade up, and the number of resources available to students. ",
            "\u00a0Do more examples of things in addition to teaching theory ",
            "\u00a0The most helpful aspects of this course were the TAs and peer tutors. They definitely affected my engagement with the course, and they were the most helpful resources for learning the material. The lectures were a little all over the place, but they more or less followed the textbook which was very helpful. In the future, I would suggest maybe forming a more structured syllabus. At the beginning of the year, I felt there was a lot of uncertainty about the class, and I think a structured syllabus would help those hesitant about taking the class in the first place. I would also maybe suggest revising the problem sets. The problem sets, to me, felt like busy work that didn't test/challenge my understanding of the course material. Problem sets that prepared me for the exams would be much more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Manageable workload\r\nContent of tests not specifically stated before ",
            "\u00a0The specific questions on the exams are incredibly difficult but the problem sets dont reflect this difficulty. Maybe an adjustment to the type of homework assigned? ",
            "\u00a0There were many different resources if you needed help with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was very well taught. The beginning of the course seemed very fast-paced but I was able to adjust over time. It may be helpful to gradually ease in to the course but I was very thankful for the many resources we had throughout. ",
            "\u00a0The exams given in this course were not always representative of the material taught. For example, the final exam included a question that was not addressed in class (and even contained a disclaimer saying that we would learn about this topic in the following semester). The midterms each contained at least one question that addressed topics not taught in class. I felt that it would be more fair if the tests given for a subject as challenging as organic chemistry allowed us to perform as best as we could given the material we had learned/had access to. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a strong guidance into a notoriously difficult subject. Professor Miller made the material interesting and gave real world examples about how the material is applicable. People say that he has too many anecdotes but I think theyre interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely the discussion section. Having TF's to break down concepts from class saved me multiple times. I do feel like the course was harder than it's sophomore counterpart, but I suppose that's to be expected if you voluntarily choose to take orgo as a freshman. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a very manageable and the tests are (usually) fair, but the homework problem sets sometimes don't feel relevant to the material. Often, the questions asked in the psets are not reflective of what will be asked on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: does a good job of teaching why something occurs rather than just memorization\r\nWeaknesses: moves very quickly, as all teaching is done on the blackboard, it is difficult to go back and review material you didnt understand (more online teaching material would be awesome) ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting and the professor taught with genuine passion. Everything was communicated very effectively. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is the structure of the course itself (starting with review of general chemistry topics and using those to understand organic chemistry reactions and mechanisms). ",
            "\u00a0It was good a little more structure would be nice ",
            "\u00a0The class is really well organized and really well taught, and because it's first-years only, there's a sense of community even though it's a big lecture class. Be warned that orgo is really really difficult. I would say the biggest weakness of the course is that there's a sense sometimes that no matter how hard you study, you just won't be able to get the material that you'll be tested on. That being said, you'll be in the same boat as a lot of your peers, so it's all okay in the end. ",
            "\u00a0The review sections were very helpful as topics are sometimes skimmed by the lecture, or many mechanisms are presented that you may not actually need to know. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the informative lectures, the TA's, and the lab course. The main weakness of this course was the ability to seek out extra help because all of the tutoring sessions were usually pretty busy. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the courses involved the clear way in which lectures matched the textbook almost exactly in sequence and the mechanistic explanations offered by the textbook and the instructor.  A weakness may be how fast we moved through material and how the material taught in lecture was sometimes a chapter ahead of the problem set we were assigned that week. Maybe this course could be improved by shifting the problem sets so that we would be required to do a chapter's problem set before rather than after the material was taught. Additionally, maybe extending class time by an additional 10-15min would make the class a little easier to follow as well as allow more time for questions at the end of a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course causes a lot of stress as about 500/600 of its points come from 3 midterms and a final. The midterms are situated directly after break. While this may help some students (as Professor Miller thinks we will study during break), in reality it seriously damages procrastinators and leads to a hectic week back. I believe averages would be higher if exams were directly before break, as the material would be more fresh in our heads. I also think that testing students based on lectures close to exams is unwise-- while exam content generally sticks to 3 chapters and the lecture prior to the exam is not tested, Professor Miller did test us on relatively easy problems from a chapter he gave one lecture on prior to the exam. As we spent most of our time studying the other 3 chapters, the majority of the class missed those points and he had to give a make-up quiz to normalize the curve. Finally, the problem sets have a few long and difficult problems, but collaboration is allowed and they are not graded on correctness so this isn't the biggest deal.\r\n\r\nThus, the weaknesses are mostly about test timing.\r\n\r\nIn terms of strength, the course is set up to minimize weekly stress (at the expense of exam stress). Problem sets are graded on completion, not accuracy, and students can read answer keys to understand their mistakes. We also got extended HW weeks on test weeks-- we never had both due on the same day, even when other classes would have done so. We got extra days whether the chapter was long (in one case) or if we needed to study. Professor Miller also makes sections relatively open-ended, and TFs are left up to their own devices (and generally help students where they need it, not follow a curriculum). If you miss a section or two, you are not penalized, and you can sit in on others. Finally, tests are graded within two days, and while grades are not posted online, the turnaround time is RIDICULOUSLY fast. Finally, there are plenty of review sessions, barring the Monday and Tuesday after break (another disadvantage of the test after break model). Tutors, TFs, and Professor Miller hold frequent sessions and office hours.  Professor Miller is kind and funny, and truly believes everyone can succeed in his class-- he gives help until they do.\r\n\r\nThus, the strengths are about keeping students relaxed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: challenging and intellectually stimulating course, pushed my understanding of chemistry to a new level, urged me to truly comprehend and apply topics rather than simply memorize, super helpful TAs (thank you Jon you were amazing!!), plenty of review sessions/resources\r\nWeaknesses: My understanding of all the individual topics we learned only came together by the end of the semester with synthesis reactions, where I had a sort of \"aha moment\" that never came to me previously. I wish we had understood the greater relevance of concepts like acidity or resonance in the moment, and had done more practice problems in class rather than just on psets, so that I could have better applied concepts while learning them rather than while studying them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging subject matter, well organized, the 3 midterms give you a feel for your progress in the class. Weaknesses: The adjustment to the class from high school can be a little much at first ",
            "\u00a0This course was a challenge, even for someone as interested in chemistry as myself. However, it was enjoyable and engaging, and the resources available with regard to extra help and information were essential. The assigned material in the Loudon textbook and the material covered in class ran more or less parallel for the semester; however, there was some occasional ambiguity where the textbook covered material not discussed in class and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0On exams not to have so many weird exceptions or to go over them in class so that when we see them on the exam we are not at a loss ",
            "\u00a0I dont think turning in the problem sets accomplished anything as they were only graded for completion; Id rather the practice problems be suggested practice, since that would help us develop more independence (which I think is part of why theres a class just for first years anyways?). \r\n\r\nThe lectures were excellent; definitely a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The material. I really did feel like what we did was very interesting. Professor Miller made sure to incorporate journal articles and tell us about how concepts were discovered. Those were some of my favorite class moments! I very much enjoyed learning about the process of how the field has advanced -- it really made me feel that we were learning relatively new concepts! Additionally, I liked the discussions we had regarding medication and other applications of organic molecules.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like my test scores did not demonstrate my knowledge. I know I was not the only one who felt this. The average on our third test was 64%, which is pretty much failing. If that was the average, for me, that indicates something about the test/teaching not lining up (as I know that many students worked and studied VERY hard to prepare). ",
            "\u00a0I felt this course was very rigorous and forced me to learn a lot in a short span of time, which I enjoyed, and I especially appreciated the help of the TAs throughout the semester. I also enjoyed how Professor Miller connected concepts we've learned in class to real life scenarios. I feel that the organization of the material could be improved as sometimes we would be tested on concepts we would not learn until much later. ",
            "\u00a0The TF/TAs for the course were great, especially Jon. In section, you synthesize and apply the information you learned about in lecture and the textbook--you learn a lot from section. They really are there to help you succeed. \r\n\r\nProfessor Miller was a great Chemistry professor in terms of knowledge but had troubling explaining concepts to undergraduates who were exposed to organic chemistry for the first time in their lives. Lectures facilitated learning, but they were very disorganized and I felt that many topics were just thrown at us in lecture. We were expected to understand the concepts perfectly after that. Because this course builds on itself, a lapse in knowledge from the lecture was almost detrimental and led a spiraling of mistakes later on. Professor Miller was a great resource and could have been even better with greater organization in lectures as well as the ability to \"dumb it down\" every once in a while. He also goes on tangents a lot.\r\n\r\nIn terms of course workload, the problem sets are fair but it is more to get students to read the textbook than anything. If you're a student that does not learn through the textbook, this course may be very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course is the lecture format. Professor Miller essentially just repeats the textbook (almost word-for-word sometimes), and I would rather have a lecture that is fresh where the textbook supports the material in lecture (and not be the same). ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths:* Clearly a very knowledgeable, entertaining, and passionate professor; thoughtful exam questions that really made you think; grading of the tests was extremely fast, very impressive; section was helpful with TAs who actually did practice problems on the board that helped you learn the material.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* The class was basically teach yourself the textbook, guess what might be on the exam, study that, then hope you can figure out what actually appears on the test. Little partial credit is given if you get a step wrong. Psets were assigned from the textbook (graded for completion and you get to drop onedefinitely positives), but on material that wasnt yet covered in class. Several problems on each pset appeared only on the pset (absent from class and on tests). It was totally on you to learn all the material from reading the textbook (dense and pretty good), do the problem set, and then *the next week* Professor Miller would *start* talking about the material on Monday for the pset you turned in the previous Friday. Not that it really mattered, since Millers lectures didnt foster understanding or ones ability to apply the material. There seemed to be no lesson plan. Professor Miller would sketch a few things covered in the previous weeks textbook chapter (read by us then, so we could do the homework), but really only present a few very specific reactions without explaining them in a way that would allow you to apply the principles more broadly (textbook did a good job of this). Often, half the class was spent on some byzantine reaction using some out-there reagents with a long, multistep mechanism that was technically an example of whatever the previous weeks textbook chapter title was, while the other half focused on a research publication only tangentially related. Sort of interesting but appropriate during class time only if (1) we actually did instructive problems during class, and had time left for this, or (2) on tests we didnt get random stuff never seen before, that could have been covered in class if we used the time effectively instead of reviewing publications. Every test included material we had totally never seen before, which was subsequently explained in class the following month, since it was actually three chapters ahead in the reading. I didnt understand the timing for those test questions (you want us to think 180 pages ahead??), when clearly Miller thought they were distinctive enough to give them explicit treatment during lectureweeks laterand the textbook thought to separate them by over a hundred pages of background.\r\nVery disappointing, as Professor Miller clearly is knowledgeable, so its a shame the lectures werent beneficial for understanding. Much of organic chemistry relies on pattern matching, so without doing problems to build intuition, youre SOL. Miller wrote all of the exams, but none of the homeworks (really boring, typical, lengthy textbook word problems with parts A through H), so we didnt practice on problems similar to those that would determine our grade. Exams had simple but interesting questions that challenged your knowledge, but without having prior practice in the methodology, you often got questions wrong, since many were exceptions to standard practice, and againnot much partial credit (class average was 64 on one test). Grades are entered as raw scores into canvas so Im hoping for some sympathy on the curve after I turn in this course review. On many of the practice exam problems, youd have little idea what was going on, go to a ton of review sessions, study the hell out of them, and then the actual exam was usually very different. When asked for additional practice problems in the style of the tests, Professor Millers suggested we Google practice problems, but you end up practicing random stuff, with no direction as to the exams coverage. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: rigor, helpfulness by TAs, certain grading policies\r\nWeaknesses: lectures were sometimes unhelpful; the disparity between exams and covered material is very large ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I thought the course went quite well, I just wish that the lectures and the content of the textbook lined up a bit more closely, as often, problem sets were covering content that had not been covered by the lectures. Additionally, it was sometimes unclear as to what parts of the textbook were relevant to the course, as there were times when content was covered in problem sets, but not in lectures or section, which left us a bit confused as to whether that knowledge was necessary. \r\nAdditionally, there were times when the midterms included content that had not yet been covered by the course at the time, which was a bit frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The professor goes on tangents and tells students irrelevant information HE finds interesting. More time spent on actually learning the mechanisms would have been time better spent as the time to cover such vast quantities of materials was already so limited. "

It takes time to fully understand the lectures and textbook, especially if you had no previous exposure to organic chemistry. It really is like learning a foreign language. However, the professor is wonderful and so passionate about the field, which is inspiring. He cares a lot and does a great job of showing why what we learn is important. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; Professor Miller's enthusiasm for the subject was contagious. The lectures were engaging and explored the topics with great depth and clarity. Professor Miller always found ways to tie the material back to it's real-world applications and often included humorous anecdotes in his lectures.

I really enjoy puzzles and problem solving, and came to discover that this class involves much more problem solving than I thought. For example, in one of the problems on our final, we were given a starting material A and a final B and had to write a multi-step synthesis reaction to get from A to B. Personally, I really enjoyed solving those types of problems and enjoyed the types of questions on tests (even if I wouldn't do as well as I hoped). ",

This is because many students who take CHEM 174 have already been exposed to organic chemistry in high school, and have a leg up. In addition, I learned that CHEM 220 students are allowed to drop a midterm score, whereas CHEM 174 students are not. Thus, it became known that it is relatively easier to achieve a higher grade in CHEM 220 as opposed to CHEM 174. ",

            "\u00a0I would, but keep in mind this class is HARD. It is harder than sophomore organic chemistry, but it is good to bite the bullet in a few scenarios. \r\n\r\n If you have a major in which you can get acceleration credit out of organic chemistry and escape a year of general chemistry, TAKE THIS COURSE. I am an EEB major who needs chemistry through 1st semester orgo, and I have much more flexibility (3 semesters vs 1 semester, which is better?). Other examples include a friend in chemical engineering, who I believe needed 2 semesters of orgo and 1 of p-chem, and will be done with her requirements a year earlier than most of her peers. IMPORTANT: If you are placed into CHEM 163 or 167, I would cram for the placement test into 1st year orgo, as you are ineligible for the easier general chemistry track unless specifically noted. I didn't do chemistry in about a year but passed with about 8 hours of last-minute studying, and most everybody I have talked to has said that the material of those classes, while interesting, is difficult and doesn't really apply to the lab.\r\n\r\nIf you are only taking orgo for a requirement and can do so to get out of general chemistry, do it. It will be hard but then you will be done.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, if you are premed, I would advise talking to a DUS. Most med schools require a year of non-orgo, and if you take this class, that means doing p-chem. You don't want to do p-chem. It may be worth skipping this class in that scenario.\r\n\r\nIf you can handle a particularly tough first semester and do not want to seriously consider chemistry, I would take orgo provided you have a strong chem background (a 5 on the AP or 2 years in HS). It is worth it. The only issue is that some students have already taken organic chemistry, so you may be going in at the lower end of the curve. Regardless, it is still possible to succeed on exams with just a bit more effort.\r\n\r\nProfessor Miller is a joy. While you will often find yourself getting lost in his lectures, and his tangents sometimes do not really apply to his class (and are much harder than your textbook), he has lived an incredibly interesting life, and he is quick to relate questions in class to interesting anecdotes, jokes, and stories. He is truly a wonderful teacher, despite some confusing moments. ",
            "\u00a0YES - I know this course may seem daunting but it was so worth it! Though it may not be easy to get the best grade in this class, you learn so much as a freshman that it more than makes up for it. As a prospective bio major I did not think I would be able to have as great of a handle on chemistry as some of the other students in this course who were prospective chem majors or who had taken organic chem in high school already, but by the end of the semester, I felt confident in my understanding of the material and feel capable of pursuing higher level chemistry courses in the future. Content is actually very interesting if you choose to invest in it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I think you just need to be prepared to work very hard and understand that even when you pour hours and hours into the class, sometimes you won't do perfect on the exam. Focus on your learning and understanding and make an effort to ask questions right away when you don't understand something. This class was very stressful, but very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0For some background, I took CHEM 174 because I wanted to explore Chemistry coming into Yale--it was an interest of mine from high school. After passing the placement exam, it also fit with my potential to be pre-med. If you know for sure or am leaning toward becoming a pre-med student, I think CHEM 174 is the right choice because support for a first year in orgo is known to be much better than support later on. However, if you were like me and wanted to explore Chemistry, the answer is it depends. You will never know if you'll enjoy Chemistry unless you try it and if it was that much of an interest, CHEM 174 is a great place to start. However, if you're going to take organic chemistry just for the sake of pride, I would not recommend this course because it is quite a challenge. Also, just because you passed the placement test does not mean you have to take organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0The most interesting part of this course is solving the problems that Prof. Miller gives on the exams. The lectures and problem sets tend to be the more tedious task. Being able to solve the complex problems that he gives you at the end of year (like retro-synthetic analysis) is the most rewarding part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No, I absolutely would not recommend this course. Its not that Miller is inherently a bad professor; hes just not good for this course. At least until he has more experience teaching it (this was his second timefirst was in 2015) and develops a course structure with lectures that actually help you learn and communicates what he wants you to know. The review sessions before exams were jam-packed with like 70/85 of the students in the class as everyone was struggling to get some semblance of preparation. Id strongly recommend taking Organic 1 in the CHEM220 section with Ellman as he has been teaching this course for 10+ years, Ive heard great things about his lectures, and he gives you practice exams that are consistent and prepare you for the tests: 3 midterms mostly multiple choice so the answers are explicit and clear (unlike this course where when you make one small mistake on one mechanistic step write-in and end up getting like 8/20 points on a question on a midterm worth 100 points) and you get to drop your lowest midterm (not the case with CHEM174). I feel like Miller would be a good professor for a higher-level synthetic chemistry course where you already have a good intuition for the material and its not 100% on him to teach you everything you need to know. Had this course been the CHEM418 Advanced Organic Chemistry course I believe it would have been a much better experience, since although the lecture order seemed to follow the Loudon textbook chapter titles (the textbook listed for this course), the content the course covered seemed like a much better fit for the Advanced Organic Chemistry, Part A textbook by Carey and Sundberg.
