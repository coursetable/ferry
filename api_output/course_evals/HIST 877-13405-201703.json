            "\u00a0One strength is the concentration on a specific topic each week, making students read and discuss extensively on a single topic. One point that could be improved is that maybe the instructor can select some essential parts from several books for reading instead of making students read one or two whole books. ",
            "\u00a0Opportunity to discuss books and arguments at length. A shorter reading list and a common book/reading requirements for the week would be great. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I will recommend. The course has a great selection of historical studies of late imperial Chinese history, and the instructor has comprehensive understandings of this period and different topics to help students navigate through those works. ",
            "\u00a0Go for it if you are looking to develop the skills needed to succeed in a graduate school context. Lots of focus on discussion, and requires a deep knowledge of the books being discussed to be meaningful -- you can coast, sure, but it will be a horrible experience if you're having to wing it in seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The seminar is very thought-provoking. And a comparative perspective is always applied in discussion. "
