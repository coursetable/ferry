            "\u00a0I gained a good overview of environmental and natural resource economics. It was very interesting to learn about this from someone who, like professor Mendehlson, has enormous experience in the field. In a way, he embodies the field of environmental and natural resource economics in the recent past. Furthermore, I learned how theoretical frameworks relate to political economy issues, and global affairs. ",

            "\u00a0Well. The questions in the problem sets were often too much of \"toy problems\". However, I understand that this may be more appropriate for a class were most students are undergraduates. ",

            "\u00a0Sections were very diverse. This is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength since it allows teaching fellows to apply their personal teaching styles, and some students may identify more with some teaching styles than with others. However, it also meant that some students learned more from sections than others.\r\n\r\nFor strengths view the response to question 2. ",
            "\u00a0If the presentation of power point could be uploaded before class, then it would be better for the preview ",
            "\u00a0Strength - I think the course was really interesting and added a lot of knowledge that I wouldn't have picked up elsewhere.\r\nWeakness - The class size being so large made it really difficult to engage in class and have any discussion. I know sections are for participation but there are certain things that only make sense contextually and being to used to class discussions, this class was very different to my usual classroom experience.
