            "\u00a0SO MUCH. Aside from the incredible breadth of stage combat skills, I learned so much about analyzing violence, reading theatrical works with a critical eye, working as a team, how to engage safely and successfully in difficult physical situations, how to ethically portray violence on stage...and, of course, fun things like how to make fake blood! ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough and effective knowledge of the basics of unarmed fight choreography, including everything from how to walk properly, to weight distribution as an individual as well as in pairs, and various actual combat choreography techniques. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned a lot about physicality of action and how to do stage combat in a safe and effective way. We learned to be very aware of our space and the nuances of action in order to make everything convincing and painless. We also examined texts for clues about how the text could be brought to life and the proper moments to add violence to a scene. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to analyze texts for incidents of violence, and characters/relationships for styles or modes of violence. I was equipped with the skills to choreograph and act out a fight in line with this analysis. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to perform stage violence from a safe and academic standpoint. You discuss the necessity for violence in a theatrical context. You learn how to choreograph your own stage violence pieces that are cohesive and that make sense within the text. You discuss the societal implications of fighting and how the people involved impact how the audience views the fight. This class also pushes you to try things you've never done but in a way that always feels safe and supported. ",
            "\u00a0We learned the foundations of stage combat as well as many different moves, as well as how to read through a script for instances of physicality and violence. I can't watch a play or a movie fight scene anymore without thinking of how they might have achieved the effect of each move and comparing it to what we did in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to analyze texts for incidents of violence, and characters/relationships for styles or modes of violence. I was equipped with the skills to choreograph and act out a  ght in line with this analysis. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH. Not only did we talk about the mechanics of performing stage combat (how to keep your opponents safe, the different techniques for creating the illusion of violence while having a really great time with your fight partner), but also couched all learning and discussion in the wider lens of acknowledging the role of violence in drama, interaction, and daily life -- how violence reads when performed by different bodies, and the responsibilities we have as performers of said violence. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so enjoyable and hugely developed my understanding of stage combat and the skills behind it. ",
            "\u00a0- How to effectively navigate physical spaces\r\n- Different techniques and tools for stage combat\r\n- How to score a script\r\n- Etc etc ",
            "\u00a0I now know how to create a safe atmosphere when approaching difficult material on stage, whether it is violence or not. There are lots of useful and fun theatrical skills I got from this class, but the most important thing was that it provides the tools for open and collaborative discussion for any topic, and the atmosphere Mike created was incredibly valuable.

            "\u00a0It fosters an incredibly healthy and supportive working environment in which I felt comfortable pushing my limits. The instructor understands very well where each of his students are in the learning process and does an amazing job allowing everyone to learn the same things at their own rate. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved everything about the course. The professor was very attentive to every student. We all were able to work at our own pace to master the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught brilliantly. The professor was very mindful of identities and personal boundaries at all times, which is so important in performance classes (where students are already vulnerable). The tone of the class was upbeat and constructive, and a variety of paces were facilitated and welcomed, while the skill of performing violence was always treated with an appropriate level of respect. The only improvement would be to offer it every year! ",
            "\u00a0This class was wonderfully done. The syllabus was very flexible because the nature of learning all of the moves was very fluid; some classes, we would learn many new moves because we all collectively learned them quickly, and some classes we focused on only one or two new moves because they were harder for us to get a handle on. The fluid nature of how we learned new things worked very well. The exercises we did towards the end to create our own choreography was very helpful when choreographing our finals. It really helped us to see what moves flowed naturally together and which didn't. By breaking moves down into simple parameters - fight distance, alignment, and target - it was very easy to pick up new moves. Overall, I thought the way the class was taught was very good in terms of pacing, exercises, and how the moves were broken down. I also felt incredibly safe and comfortable learning new things throughout the course, and the class dynamic felt very positive. Also, Mike was very good about providing feedback. His feedback was always personalized and clear, so I never felt like I made the same mistake twice. It was very easy to learn from him and for that knowledge to stick. ",
            "\u00a0Great pace of the course - it was fit for both complete novices and more experienced theater studies majors. ",

            "\u00a0In terms of improving the course, I really wish this course could be offered 1) more often, 2) with additional semesters for armed combat and/or stylized combat, and 3) allowing us to become background characters in the Hollywood saga that is the life of Michael Rossmy.\r\n\r\nThis course did well in balancing the backgrounds of the different students (from theater majors to CS majors and anyone in between) as well as the respective physical abilities -- there was always room in the class for different bodies to learn and perform the skills we were learning, and we were never limited by strength or size or agility. Mike's policy is to \"yes, and\" everything, which means that any of our impulses (even some of the wilder ones) were taken seriously, assessed in terms of safety and feasibility, and more often than not, performed. ",
            "\u00a0Was paced perfectly and was never boring! ",
            "\u00a0- Very welcoming and accepting to students of varying background levels\r\n- Extremely engaging and interactive\r\n- Safe classroom environment that encouraged creativity ",

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. Mike is an incredible teacher, and this class is just as intellectually stimulating as any Yale course should be, just in a different medium. I feel like it actually helped me succeed in other classes by building teamwork and critical thinking skills, as well as by giving a physical outlet for all the stress Yale can bring. The class ended up feeling like a family, and I feel so honored to have worked and learned with such a wonderful group of people. This class is for anyone, regardless of physical strength or theatrical background--if you put in the practice time, you will get so much out of it, and leave feeling joyful and successful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I have never taken a course I enjoyed as much as this course, and I felt my abilities grow every class period. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to theater majors and non-theater majors alike. Not only is this class a true joy, but it also taught me a lot about physicality of fighting and subtext. It is a great class to stretch your mind and add variance to the type of skill you learn at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested. It was an enjoyable learning experience where students felt excited (not just obliged) to do their work, and we were always bringing in and being introduced to new ideas. It is a fantastic class both in terms of the technical skills of fight choreography, but also the instructor's active awareness of the power of violence made the course also an effective class in building and maintaining trust, and in practicing active consent in performance spaces. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible class; I would recommend it to any student who wants a class that's really going to push them in ways that no other Yale classes do. This class encourages you to push your own boundaries in terms of physicality and performance, but never in a way that's uncomfortable. I found myself willing to try moves by the end of the class that I never thought I would try at the beginning. If you willing to explore new modes of physicality and performance, you should absolutely take this class. It also isn't limited to theater majors, or even people who do theater. My class was a nice mix of theater and non-theater people, which brought many new perspectives to the class. This is a tiring class, so you also have to be willing to put in the physical work necessary for the class, but it's so worth it. I was always so excited to come to class, and the times when we had to meet outside of class to practice, I always looked forward to it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!! Mike is absolutely amazing and the class is so much fun. It felt more like an extracurricular than a class. The midterm is learning a choreographed fight and performing it, and the final is to choreograph your own fight from a play with a partner. It's in the gym, and every day you basically come in and stage fight. You learn punches, headlocks, slaps, grappling on the ground, and various other moves and ways to depict fights. The class is really chill and relaxed, and the pace is great for everyone. You don't have to be a theater studies person or have any theater experience at all to take the class, either. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested. It was an enjoyable learning experience where students felt excited (not just obliged) to do their work, and we were always bringing in and being introduced to new ideas. It is a fantastic class both in terms of the technical skills of  ght choreography, but also the instructor's active awareness of the power of violence made the course also an e ective class in building and maintaining trust, and in practicing active consent in performance spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to every student possible. This course does an exceptional job in bridging the physical and intellectual aspects of stage combat/theatrical violence, and I, as a dancer, learned so much more about movement and how movement can be read in different situations and contexts. I absolutely adored coming to class every day, since the class was such an open, welcoming, and supportive environment to just try weird things that I got a kick (sometimes literally) out of everything we did. And I would urge students who are held back by shyness, lack of background, or anything that is not a legitimate concern (i.e. physical injury or total disinterest in the course) to overcome those petty doubts and just come to the first class. Meet the blend of sunshine, puppies, and muscles that is Michael Rossmy. I guarantee you will fall in love that day. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course was so enjoyable and such a nice change from the stuffy academic classrooms that we're used to. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. It was a great way to engage with new skills and learn through another medium, and definitely pushed me to try new things or consider the technicalities of stage combat in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class. Just do it. If you want to do theater, it's very useful to know fight choreo. If you don't want to do theater, it's incredibly fun class that is not stressful and doesn't have a ton of work but that teaches you a lot, and it's a lot of something that nothing else teaches you and that engages a different part of your brain in a very creative and physically fulfilling way. And even if you have no experience with fight choreo or are not a very physical person, Mike is very good about meeting you on your level and making sure that every student is able to engage with the material and have a good, valuable experience, no matter what you come into the room with.
