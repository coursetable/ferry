            "\u00a0An understanding of the Caribbean from colonization to present as a place and a site of projected imagination; a ton of fascinating readings, long as some of them were. ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much about the history of the Caribbean, colonialism, the US, and the world as I know it. ",
            "\u00a0We learned to read history that exists in completely new ways and how to understand history that's not explicitly there. ",
            "\u00a0I started to think of different kinds of perceptions of humanity. In a lot of ways, I knew that Black people were very much dehumanized but I just did not quite understand the multitude of ways that Black \"bodies\" have been reduced down to the corporeal; just the body, just the labor, just the pain and painlessness at the same time. It was interesting to sit in a class where we were able to discuss and grasp the many ways that dehumanization occurs.\r\n\r\nThe balance of history and interdisciplinary analysis was also interesting to work with, and I am sure has had a large impact on my senior project. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, taught by two very talented and incredibly smart professors.  I gained a much greater understanding of the Caribbean, Caribbean history, and ways to subversively think about the narratives and understandings we have of this world space.  This is important not only in terms of thinking about the Caribbean, but the world in general.  As explained in the course, this area of the world was an important testing ground for many of the world systems we see today, and the course did a great job of exploring the history and present realities of this space. ",
            "\u00a0On finishing this course, I realize that when I commenced it I knew nothing of race, or empire, or the atlantic. This course provides crucial and necessary grounding for anyone interested in ER&M, critical race theory, history (from the 17th century onwards particularly), and political theory. The texts and analyses provide embed the atlantic and the processes and histories that unfolded - brutally, messily, unevenly - in the Caribbean. It also changed my understanding of academics entirely, offering the opportunity to read, talk with and meet professors doing extraordinary research (against the archival grain, extraordinary comparative analyses, embroiled in heated historiographical debates that play out across texts, at conferences, and within this university). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about gender constructions in caribbean slave societies. I also learned a lot about the unfolding of slavery in different islands. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very valuable intellectual methods for uncovering typically overlooked histories in the Caribbean archives. Additionally I learned a great deal about the Caribbean and the structures and cultural histories that shape Atlantic modernity. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: teaches an interdisciplinary history, which is really the best kind of history. Clearly tracks change and continuity. Discusses the imaginary of the Caribbean as much as it does the Caribbean as it actually was, which makes the course a lot more self-aware than most history courses. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was a very strong, interesting course. I wish we could have gotten some kind of vocab lists or something similar, because there were so many topics covered and sometimes it was hard to note down exactly what the important facts were. Overall, I think I still learned a lot, especially about different ways of making history. (Marisa Fuentes' reading and guest lecture completely blew my mind). ",
            "\u00a0I believe a lot of the strength of this course was the fact that it was taught by people in two different, but still related, fields.  I really enjoyed the way the dynamic worked between Professor Ramirez and Professor Eller, and I loved the different perspectives and insights each instructor would bring into the course. Somehow the different approaches didn't confuse the learning, but add to it.\r\n\r\nI do think one of the weaknesses of this course is that it was not given extra time outside of the lecture. I wish we had been able to get a TA for further discussion in an actual section, because a lot of the time, I felt that we would get the readings in and not be able to delve as far into them as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exceptionally strong.  Without a doubt the highlight of the course was the fact that it was co-taught by Professor's Eller and Ramirez, who are great co-teach partners.  Not only did their work, lectures and readings build off of each other, but the fact that they were friends was clear and made the course even better and more engaging.  This course was great, and could be improved by being at a time when more people who are interested in the course could take it, rather than having to make hard decisions between this course and several other Latin American Studies courses. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extraordinary course, challenging your every perception and assumption about the Caribbean and its history. Sometimes it was difficult to follow - dates move quickly, the professors use Spanish, French, Creole terminology, the islands all relate and provide context for each other - but Eller and Ramirez led us through. Occasional confusion became impetus for more reading and learning, forcing us to delve further into texts and revisit our (pre)conceptions, urging us to engage and learn, assuming that we were both willing and capable. The dynamic between Eller and Ramirez as co-lecturers was electric - you could see them trying to support one another's work, provide structure for the following lectures, build off one another, contest and respect one another's disciplines. I would emphasize that this semester it did not have a section, only the two lectures, with discussion during that time slot, which I really enjoyed - I think it was the perfect structure in which to learn and dig deep into the texts, without making the course impossibly time-consuming, and I hope they continue with the format. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness was the speed of some classes and the assumed background information. I think it was not clear what the expectation was beforehand- we were told we did not need to have background but i felt left behind a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so much fun. I learned so much and really enjoyed the dynamic between Professor Ramirez and Professor Eller. The course was well organized and the readings were informative and well-picked. Probably my favorite course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this class! The small lecture worked perfectly, and the co-teaching was creative and always engaging. The only weakness I can think of is that I would have preferred to discuss some of the readings for longer, but since we didnt have sections, that wasnt always possible, so its understandable. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Some of the history gets a bit dense and granular, especially if, like me, you haven't studied Caribbean history before, but once you grasp the general themes it's a lot easier to organize the details. ",
            "\u00a0I would HIGHLY recommend this course. Professors Eller and Ramirez were amazing. It was always fun to go to lecture, and I think their dynamic was great. Both of them had slightly different focuses and I think it worked very well in the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professors RAmirez and Eller are wonderful, approachable, humorous, and remarkable teachers. They communicate dense, multilayered histories of the Caribbean in a way that is accessible, but also not dumbed down. They do a phenomenal job of inviting students into the complexity of 17th-19th century Caribbean history, historiographical warts and all. I would wholeheartedly recommend this to students who are interesting in learning more about Black freedom struggles, the historical development of racialized capitalism, and plantation colonialism. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course - one of the best I've taken at Yale. The professors are brilliant and wonderful, the material is mindblowing, and you gain an entirely new perspective on Atlantic history. This course is necessary/important, a definite must-take. I was genuinely sad leaving on the last day of class. ",
            "\u00a0Hell yes.\r\n\r\nPlease take this course.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic between Professor Eller and Professor Ramirez is amazing. They are very knowledgeable in their fields but are also very capable of explaining their insights in a way where even people with little to no background on the subject would be able to understand and engage in conversation. You will learn so much in this class - in many different ways, under the variety of disciplines covered.  11/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  Professor's Dixa Ramirez and Anne Eller are both wonderful and unbelievably smart.  They are without a doubt the highlights of a course which has a nice amount of very insightful readings.  It is not an exceptionally difficult course, and you get so much out of it.  The best part is being able to take a course with two smart and inspiring professors, whose lectures and syllabus make the course worth it.  Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would unreservedly recommend this course, if not urge most students (particularly ER&M majors) to take it. As a structural lattice-work for encountering and engaging with theory, it is indispensable, as is the ground and history it covers. Its structure - co-taught, small (this time?) - allowed for deep and sustained learning and both professors made themselves freely available for office hours and discussion, which I think everyone benefited from enormously. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone take this class! Its engaging and opened my eyes to the vast history of the Caribbean. "
