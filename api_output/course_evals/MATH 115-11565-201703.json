            "\u00a0My overall knowledge of Calculus improved, although the topics seemed relatively unrelated. I had a background in AB Calculus and had seen most of the topics related to integrals, volumes of revolutions, and some differential equations, but the sequences and series unit and the polar and parametric curves were completely new. Because of the Flipped Classroom setup, students who did not have a BC Calculus background seemed to be at a fairly significant disadvantage. ",

            "\u00a0Flipped style doesn't work well. Concepts are not explained well enough in videos to not need more lecturing ",
            "\u00a0The course is meant to be flipped class room, but the instructor still spent most of class lecturing. As a result, I was extremely bored and disengaged in class, as I had already learned the content by watching the assigned video the night before. The course needs to abandon the flipped classroom or follow the system properly. ",
            "\u00a0The reverse teaching style is hit or miss. You watch short videos online about the material your going to learn and have to take a mini quiz on it (not worth that big a grade so its no biggie), and then the teacher is supposed to just give you examples to practice with. \r\n\r\nWhat really works best is doing the videos and quizzes and then your teaching re-explaining it to you to cement it. Thats what we ended up doing, and it helped loads more than the other method. Another weakness is the frustration you feel when your taking the quiz and have absolutely no idea how to do it, but you have to do it anyway for the points, so you end up guessing and waiting until later to learn it. Also, some videos are very helpful, some aren't. generally they are okay though. ",
            "\u00a0Exam 1 was far too difficult but the course was very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0Flipped courses suck. Prof. Adelstein was a good lecturer and math should be taught more traditionally. Just pushing in technology where it isn't needed can sometimes detract from the experience. ",
            "\u00a0I all but despise the flipped class setup. The videos we watch barely help you actually learn the required material, so you're basically forced to read the whole textbook to learn it. I don't have a problem with reading the textbook, something I try to do for all of my classes anyway, but if I'm taking a class at Yale University, I expect to be taught by a professor/instructor like I'm paying to do. Luckily, my instructor was great about this and often had \"lecture-style\" classes to teach us material. I hope that other instructors do this too, because it was SO much more helpful than the usual class setup. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was well organized. Sometimes, I thought that the videos we watched for homework were not that helpful and often had to watch additional videos and read the textbook in order to understand the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0There is a disconnect between the videos that the students watch and the concepts that are tested. The videos tend to be nice introductions to a new concept, but the tests ask highly conceptual questions that require deeper conceptual understading than is offered by the videos or in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the videos did not encourage students to absorb information. I think that if concepts were taught in class, more content would be internalized. ",
            "\u00a0The Flipped Classroom setup was not effective because the videos were not sufficient in teaching the information to those who had never seen it before. Often, the professor ended up lecturing for most of class and my class specifically never got many practice problems, thus making the tests far more difficult then they otherwise would have been. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more practice problems in class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought all the videos with Professor Rolfe were very well made and informative. I don't think the flipped classroom style worked well with having the Tuesday/Thursday 75 minute session because classes sometimes dragged on for a long time, but it probably would have been better with a M/W/F section. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel particularly prepared for exams. Even after reading the text book in addition to watching the videos, doing the practice quizzes, and completing problem sets, I did not feel like I'd seen many questions like those that came up on exams. I think doing more practice questions in class at the level of the exam questions could help improve the course. "
