            "\u00a0I further improved my ability to conjugate various verbs and refreshed much of the vocabulary I have accumulated over the years. Definitely helped my extended writing capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. I reviewed the basics of subject-noun agreement and adjective-subject gender agreement, while further extending my Spanish skills to being able to create \"if\" phrases using the imperfect subjunctive and conditional tenses.  Coming from a rural, underfunded public school, I did not speak a lot of Spanish in my Spanish class; it was basically just worksheets and some listening. This class allowed me to develop my speaking skills in a way that I did not think was possible; I actually surprised myself on the oral exam at how well I was speaking! ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my understanding of all the verb tenses and vocab I learned in L1 and L2, while adding a small amount of new material. I also felt I got exposure to real examples of Spanish culture through interesting (and usually strange) short stories and movies. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new grammar and vocabulary skills in this course that gave me a more comprehensive overview of the Spanish language. It definitely helped me bring my Spanish to a new level in both speaking and listening. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about new tenses and grammar, read literature including short stories and a book written by prominent Spanish-speaking authors, as well as gaining an understanding of the culture of many Spanish speaking countries through movies and other texts. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved immensely. I feel as if I've gone from somebody who could follow along in a conversation to somebody who could actually hold a conversation in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new grammar as well as cultural history. My speaking skills improved, as well as my ability to listen and comprehend extended periods of concentrated talking in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Virtually every aspect of my Spanish fluency improved during this course. The various grammatical skills that I had learned in high school were brought together and combined with my reading, writing and speaking. The class was a pleasure, and every day I picked up nuances of the language. ",
            "\u00a0Though grammar is never enjoyable, the textbook was very helpful and the professor was good at clarifying questions or concerns. That being said I felt I improved my grammar and vocabulary the most this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an increased proficiency in Spanish, and learned more about the Spanish speaking world. ",
            "\u00a0The primary skills this course gave me were better reading comprehension and putting me much more at ease speaking smoothly. "

            "\u00a0My professor was very engaging and cared about his students. Additionally, the textbook was well organized and there were many study resources from both the course packet and text book which helped prepare for tests. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was the short stories which we read. Many of them were dated and focused on vocabulary and grammar which loosely, if at all, tied into what we were learning in class. The content of these stories was also evaluated on exams. I would have rather spent more time improving my Spanish skills than memorizing stories. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the tempo and the repetition of the course. I loved how fast we moved to cover a lot of content yet manage to retain almost all of it. I loved having it everyday of the week because it helped me improve my Spanish speaking skills. The professor was also INCREDIBLE; he made Spanish so engaging and fun that I hardly felt like I was in class, just learning some things with a group of friends. The only weakness I saw, however, was in the reading of the story, \"relato de un naufrago\". While this book is incredible, I felt like the assigned readings were way too long and the exercises were way too extensive, especially this close to finals. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the class community that's built as a result of meeting everyday. The is a pretty consistent workload that is manageable, however once every couple of weeks there is an additional assignment that takes up a huge amount of time to complete thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is highly organized which was incredible. I always knew what to expect in everything from classes and homework to even tests and quizzes. There was also a great variety of ways to interact with the Spanish language in this course, from presentations, to movies, to even books. It was a refreshing change from high school Spanish which relies mainly on the textbook. A weaknesses would be that it moves relatively fast, and there is less of a stress on grammar in class, which can be difficult for complicated grammar concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the high level of peer collaboration and feel that I got to know the other students as well as the professor better than I did in any other of my classes. I think one weakness is that there wasn't quite enough time put in to fully learn new grammatical concepts which would have been more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the organization and syllabus. I enjoyed the structure.\r\n\r\nSome of the readings were very odd and weak; I don't think any of my class enjoyed the readings. Further, FIVE classes a week is quite a bit  4 days a week might have been better ",
            "\u00a0Focusing on the student's needs was a big strength for me, and the accessibility of individualized tutors. A weakness was the assigned novel; the vocabulary made the assignments take 3+ hours a night, and it was hard to comprehend what the text was saying at many points. ",
            "\u00a0The course did an amazing job of integrating the learning of the language and the actual implementation of this knowledge. The only weakness was that the divide between \"homework\" and \"preparation work\" could be a bit more clearly explained in the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was very helpful in learning material, and the professor very helpful with clarifying ideas. I liked the overall course outline as well, and finishing with the novel and the movie. I also thought the practice pages were very helpful for studying for the exams and quizzes. That being said, given the weight they have on the grade, I sometimes felt preparation for the exams was rushed. (I believe the syllabus was tightly packed, and that our professor did everything he could to prepare us). ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness is that too much material is crammed in the end of the course. Strengths is pretty much everything else. "

            "\u00a0I would not strongly dissuade a peer from taking Spanish because the class overall was a fun experience, however I had many frustrations with the strange assignments and many different types of homework that we needed to complete everyday. Additionally, I do not feel as if I am significantly stronger at Spanish after all of this work. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student!! It was a great class and my professor made it really engaging, 10/10! I loved how everyone in the class became so close and you were forced to speak a different language. Plus, you learned about Hispanic cultures as well, which widens your perspective a bit. ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken L1 and L2 at Yale, L3 is essentially a review of everything that's already been covered (you start the semester learning present tense conjugations). I found this extra practice really useful and overall really enjoyed the organization of the class. You do end up learning a few new tenses, but overall there is much less new material than the previous levels. I have loved all my Spanish profs at Yale, and Prof. Lestayo (Josera) is no exception. He builds a relationship with every student and is an excellent lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course; it was very manageable, yet I still feel as though I learned a lot and I definitely have seen an improvement in my Spanish abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because even though there is quite a bit of work, and you meet daily,I learned spanish at a much faster pace in this class than in any other previous Spanish class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student wants to learn Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to anyone interested in working towards fluency in the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but mostly for the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes would highly recommend. Joserra is a fantastic teacher, and the class is enjoyable. You begin to feel much more comfortable speaking in Spanish after taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an interesting and fun course. "
