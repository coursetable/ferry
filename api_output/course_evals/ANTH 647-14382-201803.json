            "\u00a0I learned anthropological theories grounded in mobility and transnationalism. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a methods course in many ways, and one could learn both research and writing through the insightful discussions both in class and on canvas. It also helped develop skills for participating in critical discussions, verbally. ",
            "\u00a0General knowledge about mobilities and transnational research paradigms; how to articulate feminist research questions; how to have cross-disciplinary conversations. ",
            "\u00a0My biggest take-away from this course, beyond being exposed to writing forms, theories, and areas of study that I had not previously encountered was a deeper consciousness of various disciplines and their methodologies and their implications for the subjects under study. As a result of this course I have become increasingly aware of the power of description in shaping understandings of a given topic and how modes of research/writing frame the conclusions that one draws. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced students to the mobility turn in the humanities and social sciences. We explored questions of mobility, movement, migration, identity, and transnationalism. I learned how to discuss across a variety of academic disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge on various approaches to transnationalism and mobility. This was increased by the range of types of students in the course, so we heard from many disciplinary perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a wide range of scholarship exemplifying what it looks like to think transnationally. In addition to learning how to read widely, I learned how to engage in academic conversations cutting across disciplinary lines, which provided me with new insight into what being part of an interdisciplinary intellectual community could look like. "

            "\u00a0For those entering without much background, it can be a bit daunting, but what youre able to learn and become discussant in far outweighs the initial adjustment. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course was how it was structured with clearly assigned readings for each class, a discussion response at the end of each week which became a continuation of the class discussions online. There was a midterm book review which was great and warmed up the class for writing the final paper which too, was discussed quite a few times in class including a final presentation where the rest of the class gave invaluable comments and suggestions that really helped shape the arguments of each essay. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the interdisciplinary conversations; guest speakers were wonderful; professor's wealth of knowledge and facilitation; writing posts after class was a good call.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the assignment guidelines could have been posted earlier. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. The class was a diverse group of students who brought backgrounds, projects and viewpoints to the course material that contextualized and extended this material. Many themes carried across multiple weeks and this helped draw even more connections between various approaches while also opening up the course to discussions of methodology. The weekly responses to class discussion were a particularly welcome innovation that allowed and encouraged complex reflection rather than the simplistic summary that most reading response formats result in. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the diverse perspectives that made up the class. \r\nThe weaknesses may be the broad thematic groupings of readings (but they were still so generative) ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that we approached the topic from a variety of angles and disciplinary perspectives.\r\nThe one suggestion would be to include a few more basic readings that help orient how the discourse on nationalism developed, to better understand the shifts towards transnationalism and mobility. This would help better understand what the authors we \"writing against\" ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated having reading responses post- as opposed to pre-seminar, which provided me with an opportunity to reflect on our weeks discussion, in addition to the readings. \r\n\r\nThough we had a bit of grounding with Urry, I felt it could have been helpful to have had more groundwork concerning the transnational and mobilities turn toward the beginning of the course (ex. in the form of presidential addresses to different academic associations concerning the \"turn,\" roundtables among academics in different fields discussing transnational approaches, and so forth). Given that the students in the seminar came from different disciplinary backgrounds, I felt that having something akin to a foundational critical vocabulary or understanding of \"transnationalism\" or the \"mobilities turn\" might have been helpful for going forward.

            "\u00a0Yes. For anyone doing work on the applicable themes, this is an amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially those looking for interdisciplinary ways to broaden their research questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course provided some of the most meaningful interdisciplinary engagements with other areas of scholarship that I have encountered. The topic and kinds of students it draws effectively challenge engrained intellectual frameworks and worldviews in a provocative and important way for those interested in doing non-normative work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class expanded my thinking and aided my project. Professor Grewal is also very engaging and a great facilitator ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a course that would be beneficial to students studying a range of topics and disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I think that anyone in the humanities or social sciences would benefit from exposure to this course - the readings were encompassing enough to speak across humanistic disciplines while remaining specific enough to address each students region or subject of interest. "
