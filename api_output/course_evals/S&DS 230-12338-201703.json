We learned about data analysis fundamentals like data cleaning, plotting, simulation, bootstrapping, permutation tests, analysis of variance, cross-validation/model selection, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression via their application in R, but these can all be applied in other statistical programming languages as well: R was just the vehicle with which to teach them. The midterm was more focused on R coding so that we'd get a handle on R and be able to apply it in understanding these concepts, but the final was much more conceptual, as it covered more advanced data analysis topics and didn't need to test us on the small details of R syntax anymore. We also learned about two R packages called ggplot2 and dplyr. ",

            "\u00a0Weakness: \r\nI take issue with the exam format. The exams are an incredibly poor method of measuring performance in this type of class. When doing homeworks, its encouraged to look things up online, take time to think, and then use critical thinking to solve the problems. This is how we learned throughout the semester. The exams took small snippets of some of the topics, and we received points by knowing the exact code for these snippets verbatim. The analytical parts were similarly small in scope. A final project would've been much more useful for us, to continue learning by doing, and for the professor, to see that we can do something useful in practice.\r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\nLecture notes are incredibly detailed and Susan is a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0The course would've been a great course but I think the tests were a very poor way of testing knowledge. In the real world, we would not have to memorize exactly how to use specific functions in terms of syntax... ",
            "\u00a0Solid class, taught me how to use R. I wish we could've spent a little bit more time on the Statistics element of it, but overall a good class ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Problem sets were fair, and office hours were extremely helpful. Professor Wang is an incredible, brilliant and very helpful professor. The only thing that could be improved was the tests: I felt, especially for the midterm, that some of the questions were graded overly harshly. On the final, I felt that it was much harder than the practice exam, with several \"trick\" questions, which was quite frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0VERY Steep learning curve that if you don't go to the first class you can get behind easily ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is really fascinating to some people, and Professor Wang brings a bright personality to the class.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses are that it's a little hard to engage with the material during class because you are so busy either typing what she types, or trying to even follow along while she types on a terminal (not the most captivating performance).\r\n\r\nThe other weakness is that I was really hoping to learn data scraping.  I guess we touched on it (?) but not to the extent that I actually know how to do it or can use it as a skill in my future life. ",
            "\u00a0It was very well taught in terms of concepts, but I felt I didn't get a super great grasp for syntax and could potentially still struggle if I were asked to use it in industry. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are a really great way to learn. They are not too difficult and always are based off of class so they are actually do-able and they are a great way to get practice. ",
            "\u00a0I think the large lecture format made it a bit hard to follow along with the lecture if you got a bug in your code - so a lot of times coding along with the lectures was very difficult. \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving to post on piazza for participation point was also a pain and VERY STRESSFUL since the instructors would answer people's posts so quickly lol so it was hard to find unanswered posts. Sometimes I would just add mostly irrelevent information to other people's posts because everyone else had already explaining most everything. I think it would have been a lot better if participation wasn't built into the grade - maybe give a small bonus for posting on piazza instead?\r\n\r\nI think it would have also been a lot better if the concepts in the lecture notes were posted in an additional document. Like first introduce/explain concepts in a pdf document with no code. Then, do data analysis/examples in R studio. That way, it's more clear what conceptual ideas we need to know. ",

            "\u00a0Very well organised and to the point. Would have been nicer to have a final project instead of final exam though ",
            "\u00a0The course hinges on R, as it is a class about R, so if it's easy-ish to jump into if you know anything about coding. Psets are also easier because you can literally copy code and going back through the instructor's code from class can really help solidify understanding. The exams, however, are written, so it was awkward to transition from copying code to writing out R commands on paper. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very organized and well taught course. I can't think of any way it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course had a lot of strengths and systems in place to help us learn the material. The weekly problem sets really encouraged forming a solid knowledge base throughout the course. The wide range of office hours ensured that help was available if needed. The main weakness was in following lectures, although this is typical of computer-based courses. If something was wrong in your code during lecture, it became difficult to follow along. A clearer sense of what we were going to learn each lecture presented in the beginning would have been helpful to follow and study from lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, and honestly I have no complaints. The exams were a bit annoying; in the sprit of programming, I wished that they had been take-home projects instead of in-class exams. But the final exam at least focused mostly on the statistics part of the class, as opposed to the programming part, which I thought was good. The lectures were enjoyable and helpful, and the homework assignments were just right. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wang runs the class very well. She is very knowledgeable, clear/easy to follow, fair (on psets, exams, etc.), and accessible. I also thought she did a really great job on the psets and lecture material, both of which clearly took time to put together and were well-constructed to maximize our learning. I actually enjoyed doing the psets (I've never enjoyed doing psets in any other class before, and I've done a lot of psets...), as each one felt like a little project, and they guided you through so you wouldn't get super stuck. They were also very specific and not open-ended, which I felt made them better for learning. Having Piazza was useful if you did in fact get stuck, and Professor Wang was very responsive on there. Requiring students to answer others questions (participation is 10% of your grade, and you get an A if you answer a question every other week, which is a pretty reasonable standard) also struck me as a smart idea that gets us to engage with our classmates and the material. A small point on that: I do wish we could post fully anonymously on Piazza. Of course, our responses wont count for participation that way, but the ability to ask and answer anonymously is a big part of Piazzas value. I also liked that we used real-world datasets and the class felt very applicable: one of the few I will take at Yale that is actually useful in life. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were in its fundamentals, and learning coding technique. The weaknesses were that there was not that much theory taught, and the lectures were mostly going over R code. "

She uploads incomplete notes to Canvas before each class so that everyone can follow along and fill them in and then posts the finished notes after class. \r\n\r\nI learned a lot in this class and enjoyed it a lot. I actually looked forward to doing a lot of the psets. The only downside I can think of is that it was at 9am but even then, I dragged myself to every single class for the first month and a half despite her excellent online notes because I liked it so much (coming from someone who struggled to get up for 10:30am classes). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class to get started on practically analyzing data. It uses the theories from your basic stat class, and you gain a great toolset to learn how to take in data and understand its significance. ",

            "\u00a0Yup, solid course if you want to learn R. Would not recommend if you don't have a decent intro stats background though, as we don't spend a ton of time rehashing old statistics concepts ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this class!! The material was actually really interesting, and the data sets were topical and relevant. Weekly problem sets were very manageable if you went to one of the office hour sessions offered each week (I'd say I spent ~5 hours on the average pset total). Professor Wang is an AMAZING lecturer and human being, and she does a great job of allowing the lecture to still feel personal and encouraging questions. (Her office hours are particularly helpful!) The Piazza participation model is annoying but also pretty painless. The midterm and the final were surprisingly difficult (lots of unexpected twists in the answers), so be warned! However, even if you're not a great statistics test taker with pen and paper (like me), if you do all the psets really well you can still do well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to review coding a lot. Also, don't take this if you haven't taken intro stats (with Johnathan RS !) yet. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I thought grading was very fair and the whole class was well taught. I learned a lot and think the content will be useful in the future outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course purely for fun, and it was totally worth it.  There are weekly psets that are the perfect (slight) amount of challenge to be a break from other homework.  Besides that there's only one midterm and the final.  A fair bit of stats background and a little bit of coding background is probably necessary if you don't want to feel overwhelmed the entire time.

            "\u00a0I think the content itself was not very interesting but the class itself was fairly good. A lot of times, the class became more coding that actual data analysis. \r\n\r\nIf you're interested in learning R, I think this is a good class. Otherwise, there are probably more interesting classes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great class, great pace, and very useful skills. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely. It's one of those rare courses at Yale where you come out with some actual skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for any student interested in gaining experience with R and being able to manipulate different data sets. The problem sets are fair and reflect what is learned in class and the tests are reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn R and you don't think you'd learn it on your own time, this is a great way to hit the ground running. If you're more interested in the stats side of things, this course could work as it is very stats-oriented but you might want to take a class which has stats as its main focus. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn R. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning skills for data analytics. It really teaches you the baselines of R and throughout the course you learn how to continue to teach yourself what you'll need in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! Make sure to pay attention in class; it's easy to get distracted. Also make sure you understand the statistics and not just the coding; you can get by not really understanding it for most of the class, but on the final exam you need to know it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in data analysis. There are no programming prerequisites, but having some coding experience would certainly be very useful. I took CS 112 before this, and even though Java (taught in 112) and R (taught in this class) are not related at all, understanding how programming languages work does help. That said, don't be scared off if you've never programmed before. You're not writing giant blocks of code, and you are explicitly taught how to code everything you need to do. Workload/grading is weekly psets (adding up to 40% of your grade, which I think is reasonable given the nature of data analysis and the psets themselves), a midterm, and a final, plus a participation grade, where you'll be fine as long as you answer a few Piazza questions throughout the semester. The psets are each their own mini-project in data analysis, but they guide you through the steps, so it's always really clear what you need to be doing. I thought they were very thoughtfully done and helpful to our learning. I came out of the class understanding much more about how data analysis works. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to be able to use R for any statistical application, this course is for you. So for almost every student I would recommend. "
