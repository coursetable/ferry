            "\u00a0I learned so much about the religious nationalism literature, as well as the history of the US engagement with Jewish-Christian-Muslim rhetoric and narratives. I also learned how to connect these things to what is happening in current events. "

            "\u00a0I liked the readings and felt that they were very approachable. I liked the reading response assignments because they helped me engage with the readings in a focused way, and the feedback that Roger gave each week showed me that the instructors were engaged in our thoughts (especially when they'd reference them in the discussions in class). I also thought the class facilitation was great because the students all talked with each other and bounced ideas off of one another. It was a great balance of lecture and class participation. I would have liked more opportunities to learn each other's names, even just down to having name cards in front of us for the first few weeks so we could learn names. I also thought that the reviews of Christianity and Islam were really helpful considering I didn't know much about the religious tradition of Islam. "
