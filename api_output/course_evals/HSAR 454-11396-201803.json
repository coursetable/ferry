            "\u00a0This class was so helpful in thinking through ideas by interacting with the objects we discussed. There was so much we had to cover in the class, and Professor Gordon organized everything so well. He also offered very helpful feedback and led class so well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about glass than I ever thought possible, and it was incredibly enjoyable. I didn't realize glass as a material presented such an fascinating perspective on American history (and the present). The YUAG has an amazing glass collection, and it was wonderful to be able to handle the objects. I have a much better understanding of how the world around me was made because glass is so prevalent in our daily lives, even if we often overlook it. I loved the museum/curatorial component of this class, even if it was a bit rushed. It was great to learn about how a YUAG exhibit is developed from start to finish. I have a better appreciation of every aspect of a YUAG exhibit, and how much thought and work was put into it. ",
            "\u00a0You really learn how to appreciate glass, whether it's fancy Tiffany lamps or just plain Pyrex. This is an incredible tiny seminar wherein you are constantly handling objects and finding extraordinary in the ordinary. Also, a really good way to get practice writing art history papers, objects labels, and thinking about objects in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write for and think more critically about art.  Specifically with an eye toward curating an exhibition "

        [
            "\u00a0Spending class time in the art gallery working with the objects was such an amazing opportunity. Professor Gordon was such an engaging teacher and made every class exciting. There was so much to cover in this class with the exhibition and learning the material and I think Professor Gordon did an amazing job at making everything happen in the semester. The writing assignments were really helpful and also enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I think an obvious strength of the course is its close connection with the YUAG collection. Being able to handle the objects was so important to our understanding and analysis of the objects. I think the main weakness of this course was the timeline. Everything felt very rushed because we were trying to learn and design an exhibit at the same time. It was sometimes hard to balance. I also thought the individual assignments were rushed. Because there is not a lot of literature on glass, I would have loved a little bit of extra time to experiment with researching different things and to think about and engage with the objects we were writing about. I always felt like my assignments were a bit rushed, and because the I found the subject matter so interesting, having a bit more time to really think things through would have been helpful. Overall, though, I'm really proud of the work that our class produced. ",
            "\u00a0Content of the class is great and needs no improvement. I will say that having a really long class in the art gallery at 9:25am on Mondays is kind of brutal because you can't eat or drink in it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the hands-on, small classes where we discovered something new every day in discussions.  Weaknesses were often the readings, but that's mostly due to the nature of glass literature being scant. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend that other students take any class with Professor Gordon. He is an amazing teacher and his enthusiasm is so clear and makes class exciting as a result. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even though this was a seminar at 9:25 on Monday mornings, I always left inspired. Glass is way more fascinating than you might assume. It also feels really great to have a final project like a YUAG exhibit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I doubt it will be offered again, but it's wonderful and very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for a student whose interested in learning more about curation or about an artistic medium that isn't talked about a lot. "
