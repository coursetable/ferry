            "\u00a0Analysis of modern literature ",
            "\u00a0This course (like all the directed Studies courses) is beautifully designed. I learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Learned to close read and write ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to close-read some of the greatest literary minds in the Western tradition. Prof. Jewiss' insistence upon close reading, both in class and in our essays helped me learn to unpack the complexities within and below the surface of these texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think with a kind of granular specificity about language: how authors use it, how it's used pedagogically, how I use it in class, how I use it as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0The second semester DS Literature syllabus was by far the most enjoyable of the 6 DS classes. We read fantastic books, hands down. Some highlights include Don Quixote (though I admit I wasn't happy about the sheer number of pages we had to read in one week), Faust, Madame Bovary, Proust, and Omeros. I am very grateful to not have read War and Peace over spring break--please spare the future DS students and give them those two weeks to rest! ",
            "\u00a0- Close-reading and textual analysis\r\n- Clear articulation of ideas in section\r\n- Appreciation for how different texts in the Western cannon are very much in conversation with each other "

            "\u00a0Strong course, needs more war and peace ",
            "\u00a0The amount of reading is a bit overwhelming at times, but I dont consider that a shortcoming... it just makes the class a very immersive experience. Since youre investing so much into it, you really do take a lot away. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in its representation of diversity within the array of early-modern to modern thinkers. The course was strong in its free-flowing seminar discussion which was conducive to natural and ever-elevating inquiry. It could be improved by giving students a clearer understanding of book lengths well in advance. Obviously, this is a challenge for any Directed Studies course. ",
            "\u00a0There should be a proper Victorian bildungsroman on the syllabus. George Eliot or Charlotte Bronte or something. ",
            "\u00a0This was the strongest DS course, in my opinion. The reading load was the most demanding, I would say, but also by far the most enjoyable. I'm quite glad we got to read Walcott as our final work; I would also love to read Borges, but am unsure as to which work I would steal time from. Professor Jewiss gave our class a copy of \"Pierre Menard\"--that could be a good compromise, if we could spend a few minutes in class discussing it. "

            "\u00a0Yes, DS is a challenging but worthwhile experience. The spring semester texts in Literature are excellent, a joy to read and discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course to any who enrolls in Directed Studies ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved all the parts of Directed Studies, including this one. The community of people is amazing, and I wouldnt trade the experience for anything. Do it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes- its interesting and not too hard ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is definitely the best course I've taken at Yale thus far. The raw beauty of these works surpasses that in any other DS course (in my opinion). This course teaches not only writing and speaking skills, but it fundamentally asks the student to reflect on the human condition and how it can be portrayed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: this course will make you a better writer and a more careful thinker no matter who you are. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student in DS, though with the caveat that none of the texts we read can be done justice in 2 seminars. I loved getting to hear from many lecturers across the university, because I now have a running list of professors with whom I would love to take a class. I was particularly impressed with the Professor who gave the Tolstoy lecture and the Professor who gave the Woolf lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was incredible seeing the connections between different texts as we progressed through the semester. "
