            "\u00a0I further developed my written and conversational skills in Korean from L2. I feel that I learned some especially useful grammar this semester, relatively more so than in past semesters (besides, you know, learning the alphabet and how to make a basic sentence). ",
            "\u00a0Korean writing, speaking, and listening skills are developed from korean 110 and 120. I think I improved a lot with listening and incorporating more complex grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I increased understanding & vocabulary of the Korean language & culture ",
            "\u00a0More complex grammar structures and vocabulary. Also more about Korean culture. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Comprehensive material, challenging but manageable pace.\r\nWeaknesses: Early in the morning leads to low engagement, professor Choi doesn't always understand the questions we are asking, unclear homework. ",
            "\u00a0Having this course small helped with individual discussions and developing speaking skills. How homework was assigned and graded was sometimes unclear and a source of frustrating; the schedule given would be vague or contrary to what was said in class at some points, and things were sometimes assigned quickly and arbitrarily in class. Improving the structure of this class, and making expectations more clear, would be really helpful to future students. ",
            "\u00a09:25am everyday is a terrible time slot. Daily homework and quizzes just doesn't work for some schedules especially engineering courseloads. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There is a lot of practice with the material and the exams are fair.  Professor Choi is approachable and knowledgeable about the material which facilitates the learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are 4 exams and a final. However the exams happened relatively early on in the semester, so it felt like we didn't get as much practice with the material learned after that 4th exam in preparation for the final.  Sometimes it is unclear what the homework assignment for the night is because additional assignments are added during class time. Also be prepared to go through basically two textbooks this semester: Sogang and Jane's Travels. "

            "\u00a0If you are taking Korean because you want to learn Korean specifically, then take this class. It's not horrible.\r\nIf you are taking Korean just because you need to take an L3 language, proceed with caution. You may not want to continue. ",
            "\u00a0Korean remained a fun language to learn, and I felt like my skills were improved throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn Korean sure, but if you don't want to learn korean then why take it? ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a good class and I enjoy learning Korean. ",
            "\u00a0The complicated grammar is explained very well. However, I believe there should be more speaking assignments/evaluations. "
