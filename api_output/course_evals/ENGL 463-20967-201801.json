            "\u00a0So much! There's the endless stuff you learn just by reading your classmates' stories (and them reading yours!) and discussing them in class, where we draw out their success and their failures and the reasons for both. Aside from the obvious benefits of the workshop format, there's Professor Crowley himself, who usually set aside 20-30 minutes of every class to discuss one fascinating topic or the other. He shared numerous, simple but illuminating insights into the basics of storytelling (what is a story? how is it told? who tells it? what is a scene? what are its betas? etc.) and the types of stories told (varieties of fantasy and sci-fi, shape stories, the monomyth, etc), and even the practical realities of writing as a career. It's super fun listening to Crowley explain these things.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the greatest benefit of the class is the sci-fi/fantasy-filled headspace it puts you in. Immersed in that kind of environment for the entirety of the semester, you're able to think more creatively and push more boundaries than you otherwise would have, especially when you witness the brilliant weirdness of your classmates' work. The class might not fundamentally transform your prose, but it will sharpen your understanding of what storytelling can is and expand the horizons of what you think your own storytelling can be. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that this course combined fantasy and science fiction. At first, I was wishing for only fantasy, but seeing the two genres combine pushed my writing in new and exciting directions. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes at Yale. I've always loved writing speculative fiction, and Professor Crowley (and my classmates!) gave me ideas and feedback that helped me grow so much as a writer. We'll all be sorry to see Professor Crowley go - he will be missed. ",
            "\u00a0I rekindled my love for reading through this class. I was given free rein through my Reading Log, and I used it as an opportunity to allow all kinds of literature to challenge my view of writing and influence my writing. "

            "\u00a0The workshop format, Professor Crowley, the lesson plans--all great. Like any other workshop class its quality is, to a very large degree, contingent on the quality of your classmates. Fortunately we had a strong batch this semester, so that wasn't a problem. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so awesome, and it opened the doors to a world of fantasy and science fiction to me. I really loved working on my reading log, because I could add any amount of books and readings, from widely-ranging sources, and allow those to come together in the reading log and influence my writing. I really learned from class readings and reading my classmates works. I got to study so many different writing styles and pick up different writing skills along the way. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, though sadly Professor Crowley is leaving so if it's offered again it'll likely be in a very different form. He's a huge part of why this course is so successful--his storytelling advice is illuminating, his teaching style is engaging, and his enthusiasm is contagious. He'd always come to class excited about one thing or another, and showed an unfailing interest in every single story we workshopped. His feedback was always insightful and, most importantly, honest (he called you out on your shortcomings, but not in a way that was cruel). The sheer breadth and depth of his knowledge is formidable: he's a sci-fi/fantasy/storytelling guru, sharing with us a litany of (sometimes obscure) literary concepts and compiling a mind-blowing list of short story/novel recommendations. I made sure to take down notes vigorously, because much of the wisdom Professor Crowley shared isn't easily gleaned from storytelling guidebooks or websites. Best of all, though, was how he set the tone of the course and the classroom dynamics. Classes were always relaxing, with none of the intense high-stakes pressure you might associate with other workshops. Plenty of criticism abounded, but it rarely felt personal and was always shared in a spirit of good faith. I think Crowley's style of laid-back fun and incisive critique helped cultivate that kind of class environment. \r\n\r\nThe course itself largely adopts the straightforward workshop format, with three stories read and critiqued every week. Prof. Crowley usually set aside 20-30 minutes at the start of every class to discuss a particular theme or idea, discussions which usually consisted of simple but illuminating insights into the basics of storytelling (what is a story? how is it told? who tells it? what is a scene? what are its betas? etc.) and the types of stories told (varieties of fantasy and sci-fi, shape stories, the monomyth, etc), and even the practical realities of writing as a career. Crowley would also occasionally assign a handful of (very) short science fiction stories, which we'd also discuss at the start. We also have to keep a reading log throughout the semester, which is not a very stressful assignment at all--if anything, it gave me the opportunity to read for leisure (but technically not really) for the first time in a long time, and it supplemented the course itself excellently. \r\n\r\nUltimately, the greatest benefit of the class is the sci-fi/fantasy-filled headspace it puts you in. Immersed in that kind of environment for the entirety of the semester, you're able to think more creatively and push more boundaries than you otherwise would have, especially when you witness the brilliant weirdness of your classmates' work. The class might not fundamentally transform your prose, but it will sharpen your understanding of what storytelling can is and expand the horizons of what you think your own storytelling can be. ",
            "\u00a0If you love reading and writing science fiction, definitely! Although I think Professor Crowley is leaving after this year. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! If you're reading this right now, you probably already know you belong in this course. This was one of my all-time favorite classes at Yale and this is coming from someone who's graduating in a week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is AMAZING! Please take it! You get to write about anything within the realm of fantasy and science fiction and get the superb feedback of Professor Crowley and your classmates. I really loved my group of readers, and will definitely keep in touch with them in the future and look out for their writing. "
