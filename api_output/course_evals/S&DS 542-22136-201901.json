The course itself is informative, and sometimes it is hard to make notes when the professor is only speaking but not writing the ideas on the backboard.\r\nI also hope the TAs are able to hold the discussion session at some more reasonable times instead of late in the evening.

I barely needed to read the book, because the explanations in class were so clear. The first part of the course was great, the second one less so. I felt that during the second part, we saw too many different topics without too much depth, but in the end, the problems were still relevant to learn the material. I feel that we need more time for the second exam, rather than having it on the last day of class. The discussion sessions were also useful to dive deeper in the material. ",

This course should modernize by allowing homework to be submitted via Canvas. Using Piazza to allow students to ask questions of the professor and TAs would have been very helpful for understanding concepts that came up in homework that were never taught in class (or explained well in the textbook), and would probably save the TAs significant time since they wouldn't have to answer the same question multiple times from individual students. I feel there must be better textbooks on the market, in terms of presenting material thoroughly and clearly. ",
