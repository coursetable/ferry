            "\u00a0I learned a lot about regulation and policy surrounding the United States and its relationship to the environment. There were so many different lenses that we covered in this class in terms of politics, ethics, legislative, economic, and linguistic ways of looking at these issues, but the thing that really set this class apart and allowed us all to learn so much from the course were the engaging discussions that took part in the seminar structure. The class was packed full of individuals who each had separate but super interesting expertise in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about American environmental politics and some about the American political system at large. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of the various ways in which politics and environmental policy intersect in the United States. The course takes a useful thematic approach (communication, business, law) to look at examples of environmental success and failure. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting analysis of environmental policy through the actors involved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some of the political history of the environment in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what is going on currently, and has been going on, in politics regarding climate change. I learned about the different actors that contribute to this, and why it is such a complicated issue. I also learned a lot about the political system in general. ",
            "\u00a0Generally, I learned the intersections between politics, and business, and how they shape environmental policy. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a good overview of the politics surrounding climate policy. The class explores the topic from various perspectives, including anthropoligical, political and technological perspectives. Most students in the class are fairly passionate about the subject and professor Swenson makes sure the discussions stay interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the landscape of environmental policy and the major actors at play. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the evolution of the environmental movement from its more philosophical origins to the free-market environmentalism of Fred Krupp. I also felt that I gained a greater understanding of current environmental policy proposals and the stakeholders involved in the movement.

            "\u00a0Strengths: seminar format, the argument papers as a way of evaluating our engagement with the class material, the readings were super interesting.\r\n\r\nI think it'd be a good idea to incorporate more styles of information media next year like more videos/podcasts.  Whenever students presented videos/news it provided another layer of evaluation that I very much enjoyed! ",
            "\u00a0One of the course's main strengths is that a different area of intersection between environment and politics is covered each week, making the class quite comprehensive in its survey of environmental politics. Additionally, a good part of the class is students presenting papers on the week's topics, which makes for great discussion!\r\n\r\nI can think of no significant weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Very tangible, realistic and practical analyses of what has to happen to make policy work, how money and power affect institutions that should run smoothly.  That being said, you are not going to design environmental policy specifically--this course is a political class studying environmental policy history. ",
            "\u00a0It's not a well organized class. There was little class discussion about the readings or material, mostly lecture by professor or lecture by student followed by a few questions. The actual lectures felt superficial and the readings sometimes were good but a lot of times lacked depth. Until the last few classes it felt like everything could have been summarized with a half a page descriptor of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings are really interesting and a lot of them are recent articles which is helpful in keeping you up to date with environmental politics. The class covers a lot of really important topics in an organized way, and you write 4 shorts papers during the semester to solidify the ideas which also make you think about solutions. Lastly, every class a few students present their short paper, and it's really cool to see the ideas your peers come up with and debate them.\r\nWeaknesses: The actual seminar was hard to sit through. Prof Swenson knows a lot about this stuff but the way he presents it is not the most exciting or engaging. We would just go through slides for over an hour until student presentations and it felt LONG. Also the final paper was meant to be 15 pages based off a very confusing prompt, and there was no structure to it which made it really challenging to write. ",
            "\u00a0While there is a lot of interesting information on the syllabus, it did not feel particularly conducive to learning or discussions that were happening in class. There were a lot of times that I read an article that pointed out an argument. While those arguments were true, they did not seem particularly surprising after I had read them. I don't think that was the syllabus's or the professor's fault, rather the reality of Politics of the Environment are just broken.\r\n\r\nI do have to acknowledge that as the course continued, I enjoyed the readings more. ",
            "\u00a0The readings of this course are its strong suit. They are all incredibly engaging and interesting, and most dont feel like a bore at all. The papers that we have to write are very self-driven, so I had a lot of fun writing them and really liked what I came up with. The discussions and presentations in class take up a majority of the time, so they can be pretty hit or miss depending on how everyone is feeling. Dont expect to include the readings in discussion, but do them anyway for your own interest and for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are great and students in the class are genuinely engaged in the material and often come from an environmental background. The argument papers are also spread out throughout the semester and you have the chance to choose what to focus on for each. I also enjoyed the student presentations, although I sometimes felt that between the presentations and the powerpoints, we had very little time for discussion. I would have liked if the lectures explicitly addressed the readings, since the only time articles were mentioned was during student presentations. However, I learned a lot from the course and I appreciated the freedom to deep dive into the topics I was genuinely interested in. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I believe this is subject matter that every student at Yale could benefit from learning/knowing more about. ",
            "\u00a0A fascinating course with important and engaging readings. If you're interested in doing any work related to environmental politics or policy in the future, take it. I went into it thinking I knew a lot already but learned even more. It's not a huge stress and the work is enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Climate change is without a doubt THE issue of the 21st century, and understanding the ways in which the American legislature has failed to pass regulations is very important to understand what you as a citizen can do to bring about change.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if you're interested in politics in general, definitely try to take this class. A lot of the reasons that explain the failure of environmental legislation hinder progress on many other issues in the United States - you will gain a better understanding of the way American politics in general works. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, but know that it focuses heavily on the politics rather than environmental. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe, depending on what your interests are and what kind of class you want. Take this class if you really have a passion for the environment and want to learn about all the factors that go into environmental policy making. You really will learn a lot and most of the information has turned out to be very relevant to my everyday life. Don't take this class if you want to be really excited to go to your seminar everyday, or don't really care about environmental politics. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think that I would. While this class has the potential to be a great seminar, I didn't have that experience this year. It felt somewhat lacking in certain areas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do think that this class was great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a very solid introduction to the topic and its taught by a professor who approaches the topic like a puzzle and invites the class to join the solving process. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I would advise that the quality of the course depends a lot on the engagement of the students and the interest his or her peers have in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for the readings alone. If you are at all interested in the environment, this course provides great foundational material and the opportunity to deep dive into topics that peak your interest. I actually enjoyed writing my argument papers and the challenge of inventing my own policy proposals and presenting them to my classmates. I liked Professor Swenson's lectures at the start of each class but the real experts in the field were my fellow classmates, many of whom had past experience in environmental issues. It was a ton of fun to participate in those discussions. "
