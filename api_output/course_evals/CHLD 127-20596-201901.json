            "\u00a0observational skills, analytical skills ",
            "\u00a0This course taught the fundamentals of child development in the context of the classroom and taught us how to better understand and interact with young children in a classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I've gained great awareness about our early childhood education system and how to think about developmentally appropriate standards for the next generation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various elements found in a high quality early childhood education, including the curriculum, parent-teacher relationships, importance of play in development. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of a wide range of philosophies on kindergarten education, both historical and modern. Additionally, I became well aquatinted with many of the most pressing contemporary issues and subjects of debate surrounding kindergarten. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the importance of play, the multiple ways science is incorporated into the classroom, the importance of how the physical space of classrooms and playgrounds are curated, the roles of the teacher, and how thoughtfully gender expression and anti-bias curriculum are brought into early childhood ed. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed my understanding of early childhood and education. So, so much goes into making a successful early childhood education program. Carla and the course do an incredible job providing a broad overview of both the theory and practical challenges of early childhood education. "

            "\u00a0I love Carla - she is so thoughtful and flexible. She comes into class so prepared with stories and pieces of news. ",
            "\u00a0Biggest strength was the observations! They were so fun and we all learned so much from them! ",
            "\u00a0I think the hour and 50 minute setup can drag a bit at times but this leaves the rest of the week open for the observation which is what I found most interesting and rewarding about this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal course and Professor Horwitz is incredibly knowledgeable of her field of study. It is incredibly structured (weekly readings, seminar discussion, and observations). The seminars are interesting but I wish there was more opportunities to engage with the materials that the children are using. ",
            "\u00a0This courses strength is that it is unlike anything else you will ever take at Yale. The opportunity to get off campus and engage with the New Haven community in such a grassroots way is truly special. Furthermore, if you are at all interested in the world of education (from the perspective of policy, history or philosophy) youll definetly get a kick out of the reading material. Although at times it feels like a strain on time, the 2 hr long observation is also a really cool/different element of the course. I almost forgot to add (because its so obvious to me) that the major strength of this course is Carla. She truly has an incredible view of the institution of kindergarten given her experience in the industry. \r\n\r\nThe major weakness of the course was that the readings were rather redundant and need to be selected more carefully. I often put about 1.5 hours into reading the materials for a given week, skimming when necessary, or simply reading the intro and conclusion of each chapter. I also took notes on major ideas and interesting quotes. Even though this meant that I wasnt completing all of the reading, I felt quite prepared (if not over prepared) for both class discussion and the written journal entries. \r\n\r\nAnother weakness of the course is that it often felt more like a small lecture as opposed to a seminar. Im not sure if it was just my section, but we never really had any contentious discussions or conversations in which there was disagreement (which is what I expect in a seminar). I also felt like lecture needed to be broken up with more alternative actives given that it is a rather long time to be sitting in one spot especially if not much participation is required. Obviously we cant play with blocks every day, but I also think that the class would benefit from taking a short break in the middle or breaking out into partnered discussion. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: observations, interaction with current early child ed teachers and professor horwitz, materials available to us, presentations\r\n\r\nweaknesses: too many readings and little coverage of them in class ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed lectures. Of course, the observations are a very fun and unique learning environment, but I think the lectures are actually underrated -- they do an excellent job combining what we see in observation with Carla's years of experience and wisdom.  Overall, this course was the best organized for student learning of any class I've taken in my four years at Yale. \r\n\r\nOne very small point of improvement is in the clarity of assignment instructions; with the first couple journal entry submissions I was not entirely clear what was expected. Perhaps providing a few (anonymized?) examples on Canvas would be helpful. "

            "\u00a0Yes - amazing class if you love kids. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a lot of fun and we learned a lot about how children develop and how important different aspects of early childhood education programs are for their developing minds. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you have any interest in working with children or working in fields related to education or childcare then this course gives you a much greater understanding of just how complex developing minds are. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you can grab a spot in the class, it's a wonderful seminar with a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is perhaps one of the classes that I've taken at Yale that I see myself using later on in my personal life, especially as I prepare to start a family! I have learned a tremendous amount about the elements that go into a high-quality early childhood education and I can easily pinpoint the fundamental characteristics now. I also learned how to interact with young children and about how they develop over time. I also learned about the importance of unstructured and free play in the daily lives of children and the dangers of jumping onto the Common Core too soon. ",
            "\u00a0For non-ed studies folks, I would recommend this class if your looking for something on the chill side that will also get you engaged in New Haven. Being interested in kids/kindergarten is also an obvious pre-requisite. ",
            "\u00a0definitely! it is so fun and you learn a lot about early childhood ed. theres already very few options for learning about education at yale and even less tor this specific age group. id highly suggest taking advantage of this opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you're at all interested in children and education, this is the Ideal Yale Class. You get to take advantage of Yale's amazing resources, like Calvin Hill, and amazing faculty, like Carla. You'll learn a ton -- the course combines observation and lectures and journals in a really unique way and provides insight into the other side of the educational experiences we've been having for most of our lives. I'm a STEM major with little background in education and no future plans in education, and still this was probably the best course I've taken at Yale. "
