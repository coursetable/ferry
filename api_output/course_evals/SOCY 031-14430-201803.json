            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the conservative movement, and how that history impacts conservative tactics today. I was also introduced to the field of sociology. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much. In this first-year seminar, Professor Mullins pushed us to widen our perspective towards the conservative party and analyze what has made the party so organized and structured, which has all lead up to the era of \"fake news\" and Donald Trump. We learned about the inter-workings of conservative institutions and how their network is so complex that it wins elections. I learned a lot about myself and my family, as my family is conservative and has cultural circumstances that has allowed for them to exist in the echo chamber of fake conservative news media. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Sociology and how they apply to real life movements over time. Furthermore, the class introduced me to the research available to us here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper knowledge about the historical lineage of US Conservatism, and how that history shapes its modern existence. A fair deal about the present \"crisis of public knowledge\" and its causes. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about conservatism in the United States in historical and more present-day contexts. Also learned how to form my ideas better in seminar format and how to argue points in papers. The class made me a much more in-depth thinker as Dr. Mullins constantly challenged our reasoning and arguments to make us more concise. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the structure of the Republican Party, the historical foundations of the American conservative movement, politics on college campuses, outrage media, and how people process information/misinformation. This course featured content that felt extremely relevant, and it was refreshing and exciting to analyze current events and recent political developments from an academic perspective. Dr. Mullins is incredible, and under his leadership, the class maintained a climate that was nonpartisan, respectful, and productive. I loved hearing about his own thinking on the topic and the ethnographic research he's conducted on conservative politics and the GOP over the last few years. We spent a few weeks pinning down the foundations of the conservative movement, and once we were caught up to speed, our class focused on developments in the last decade or so. From a material standpoint, I thought learning about the outrage media industry and its appeal to so many Americans was especially fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a plethora of knowledge and skills. All of the course readings allowed me to understand the origins of the Republican Party, how it gained traction, how it evolved and how it became the party it is today. We studied how fake news spreads though outrage media and how there is a crisis of knowledge where more information buys more stupidity. We analyzed how scientists were able to obscure the truth on tobacco and smoking as well a study global warming and how this created a ripple effect in putting forth mechanisms to spread fake news today in politics. The four assignments (two annoyed bibliographies and two papers, with the second arguing against the first paper) forced us to dig deep into many journal articles and do the work of a researcher or sociologist. We learned how to create strong arguments and then contradict them with reasonable claims. The skills and knowledge I gained in this class are countless, and I am so grateful to have experienced this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a side of history as perceived from the political right that I'd never encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course honestly. It was so interesting, and I was always engaged. I learned a lot about the organization behind the Republican Party. I learned how to make a stellar annotated bibliography and make sure that I actually got good sources before writing my paper. I also learned what was a good source. ",
            "\u00a0An extensive knowledge on the history and rise of Conservatism. Extensive. ",
            "\u00a0I am most grateful for the critical analysis skill that I developed by taking the course. The opportunity to first identify a problem we see in contemporary American politics and later argue against the previous stance is especially rewarding. "

            "\u00a0The readings were always very interesting and engaging, and Professor Mullins was a great leader of discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is the discussion; Professor Mullins loves to discuss current affairs and relate them to the readings from the previous night in some obscure way. i absolutely love hearing him talk about conservative political theory, even though i didn't speak much in class. The only weakness that I saw was the timing of the class; I was so tired at 9AM and it's so difficult to wake up and begin discussing political and sociological theory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nUse of evidence\r\nContemporary Pertinence \r\nTouches on lots of different areas of study\r\nEmphasis on knowledge, not grades\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nSome unequal participation in the class ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the content and readings for this course were very interesting and engaging, and I enjoyed Dr. Mullins's teaching a great deal. I wish we had more opportunities for open ended, professor-moderated, class discussion, as I found those to be the most fruitful spaces for learning in the course ",
            "\u00a0The seminar format is awesome as it allowed for class discussions and class debates with classmates who we considered friends. The two paper assignments were also a great intro to college writing and to argument in general. If anything could be added to this course, it would just be more structured debate topics for each week so that students could further explore their ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Mullins is very smart, engaging, relatable, and a great shepherd of class discussions. He cultivated a really great classroom dynamic -- probably my favorite part of the course -- where students felt like they knew each other pretty well and could chime in with any thought or comment that popped into mind without fear of judgment or scorn; modern, relevant readings and class material; lighter workload than most of my other classes and very fair grading, which I felt allowed me to really focus and enjoy on the material and our class discussions. Weaknesses: the beginning of the course started a little slow and our discussions felt abstract and very theoretical as we talked about the historical basis of today's conservatism. I wish we had more time for open-ended class discussions where we strayed a little from the nightly reading. We got to that point in the final three weeks of class, which I loved. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses to this course. All of the course readings were extremely eye opening and manageable to fit into our busy schedules. During class, Dr. Mullins would carry the conversation through brief lectures and ask thought provoking questions to challenge the students. Everyone participated and enjoyed interacting with each other as the course material and subject of fake news and conservatism was extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty good the way it is right now. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Mullins is super engaging, and I loved his teaching style. I love the way this course was graded because it set you up to do well if you put in the work. The reading was also very interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like class participation did not matter at all because we werent graded on it. Other than that no real weaknesses to this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned a TON. Good class interaction.\r\nWeaknesses: Find a way to make the reading more mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is high-quality classroom discussion and well-selected course materials. The only weakness is that we don't have enough time to discuss about all materials in depth. It might be worth considering to delete some of the readings. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. For those interested in politics, this course provides a comprehensive understanding of the conservative movement. The workload is very manageable; there is usually about 30 pages of (very interesting) reading between each class, and, overall, there were 4 assignments (2 annotated bibliographies and 2 5-page papers) for the semester. Professor Mullins is very knowledgeable and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a great class, very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would! This course was very introspective for me, but if you love discussing politics with others and hearing what others think about the current era of conservative politics, i highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes\r\n1. So relevant\r\n2. A field of study that many aren't familiar with \r\n3. Fantastic Professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Dr. Mullins is smart, interesting, and kind. If the subject matter is in the universe of a student's interest (even if they are conservative!) I think this class will be illuminating and engaging. Not too much work, too, at least in the present iteration (two annotated bibs and two short papers over the semester) ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Incredibly interesting material and fun class. Not too much work, either. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was easily my favorite class my first semester. The workload was not too bad and it truly made me a stronger thinker and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student. It was one of my favorite all semester. The workload is very fair (a chapter or two of interesting material to read for class, two annotated bibliographies, and two five-page papers), and I gained a lot from the discussions, which always felt incredibly relevant. I'd be sitting in class fascinated with the material and simultaneously frustrated that not everyone at Yale could be sitting in on the same discussion. The 9 a.m. class was something that would stick with me for the rest of the day, and I'd end up talking to my roommate about everything we talked about at dinner or at night. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to all students- those interested in political science and sociology and those, like me in enginering, who want to learn, appreciate and understand the inner workings of the Republican Party. This was by far my favorite class this semester, and I hope other students will have the opportunity to take this class with him at another point.   \r\n\r\nDr. Mullins was an amazing professor. He created an environment where all of us were challenged to think beyond our preconceived ideas and notions. He also made us all feel extremely comfortable to voice our opinions in a class which could have been extremely divisive and contentious. His brief lectures during the seminars and interesting course materials were all engaging as we aimed to understand the prevalence of fake news, the current republican party and how it came about. I cannot emphasize enough how transformative and illuminating this class was, especially given our current political climate. Dr. Mullins is an incredibly inspiring and thought provoking professor that I was lucky to have! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it offers a greater understanding of the right of the political spectrum that many of the more liberal-minded Yalies will not have encountered in their lives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It wasnt very hard and it was so interesting. A very good course whether or not youre interested in politics. It will mess up how you think about the two party system in America. Some may not want to take this class because ignorance is bliss. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot and was not stressed out. ",
            "\u00a0The course is absolutely a highlight of my first semester. The discussion of conservative politics is timelier than ever. The link between real life and theoretical works is unbelievably intriguing. Even students who do not have prior knowledge of sociology/political science will enjoy the course very much. I love it. "
