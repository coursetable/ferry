            "\u00a0A new way to look at policy problems. Using Ostrom's IAD framework and applying it to our own issue, we were able to actually analyze a real-world problem with a political economist's mindset. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting look at the the relationship between policy and science ",
            "\u00a0I became versed in the Institutional Analysis and Development framework for policy analysis. The focus of the course on common pool resource management through the real-world case study in a seminar setting was very conducive to learning. This was one of the most well-developed courses I've taken at Yale and would recommend it to everyone who is willing to do the work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply Elinor Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development framework to public policies. I also learned about alternate methods of managing common pool resources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about Elinor Ostrom and her IAD/SES frameworks, environmental management, certain case studies (lobsters in Maine, China one-child policy), local/state/federal/international environmental and climate governance, how to think like a social scientist and like a political scientist, and all about democracy. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new perspective on democracy and resource management system. Now I am able to concretely discuss complicated governance issues in a multidisciplinary way. ",
            "\u00a0I've gained a thorough understanding of Ostrom's IAD framework and how to apply it in a variety of contexts! We've also explored how science is used in policy and how to ask the question \"what is really going on\". ",
            "\u00a0Learned about how to analyze institutions, the ways in which democracy and sustainability interact, the LOBSTER industry, and a variety of life lessons taught through coursework. \r\n\r\nGreat class, great mix of topics! Our research projects were particularly interesting, each student focused on something very different which was exciting to learn about. "

            "\u00a0Professor Fotos is a really kind and passionate instructor. The readings were quite interesting but also a heavy workload. Class discussions were wonderful. Professor Fotos also helped with my writing. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows students to explore a policy issue using the IAD framework. I thought discussions in class were productive, and I appreciated that Professor Fotos invited two guest lecturers to speak to our seminar. I think the course could be improved by focusing slightly less on the IAD methodology. I finished the semester wondering how else to assess policy outcomes and felt that the seminar did not present any alternatives to the IAD. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Fotos.  He's kind, incredibly intelligent, thoughtful, well-spoken, and more prepared than most other professors.  He takes careful consideration of the work you do before class each week through feedback on any prompts we've responded to, prepares a long lecture for the beginning of each class, guides class discussion simply but purposefully, and follows up every class with a detailed recap of that week and a primer for what's next.  In short, he's an amazing professor and man.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the use of peer editing for our second drafts was so helpful and rewarding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nWith such dense and comprehensive material, I think that this class could benefit from meeting twice, rather than once, a week.  I found the class crept up on me each week so I couldn't be as on top of things as I would have liked because it just felt like a smaller commitment.  Meeting twice each week would not be a burden and would not have dissuaded me from taking the class--I just think it would have been more helpful to really grasp all of the information presented in readings and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is friendly and super nice, but the feedback he gives is often unclear. I find the grades are also very surprising in scope. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were very interesting, and I found the class discussions thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening. One potential area for improvement would be maybe more guidance on our independent research projects. I felt through some of the research unsure if I was looking for the right types of information. Otherwise, I enjoyed the class very much. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the theory readings at the beginning of the course, but got confused midway through when we started talking about different visual representations of theory. I appreciated bringing in a different way of learning but felt it was not as clear as the rest of our modules. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is very well developed, having been taught a number of times over the years, and I loved that Prof Fotos brought in speakers who were relevant to the issues were discussing. I could suggest that the standards of assessment for some of the assignments were made clearer/given more guidance! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class as a writing credit. In addition to learning how to write a research paper, the weekly assignments all taught something different, and they weren't all essays. I feel like I learned a lot more about writing through this method of teaching than I did through 115. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in understanding the relationships between policies, economy, and conservation. It does a great job integrating political theory with the on-the-ground practice. Definitely take this course if you have the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would tentatively recommend this course to another student. It introduces students to the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, which is helpful in thinking through policy problems. Additionally, Professor Fotos is fantastic and one of the most caring individuals I have met at Yale. However, the reading load can be overwhelming. Also, the assignments are quite rigid for a college seminar. I wish students had been able to at least critique the IAD framework rather than follow it blindly. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class to any student interested in democracy, sustainability, climate, science, economics, political science, social science, etc.  Professor Fotos is a very inspiring and motivating professor, and though the workload is high, you can get through it by doing most of the readings, being active in class, and putting lots of effort into the final paper.  The teaching style is dynamic and designed to help us as students.  Great, quality Yale class. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in understanding the relationship between governance and common pool resource dilemmas, this will be a very informative class for you. You also are given chances to improve your writing skills and learn an institutional analysis framework. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great yale seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as one is ready to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend. Professor Fotos is incredible and the class is worthwhile and relevant, whatever major you are. "
