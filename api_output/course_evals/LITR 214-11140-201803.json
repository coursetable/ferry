            "\u00a0I gained extensive knowledge on the French literary tradition and also improved my close reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned about different forms of literature that defined the 19th and 20th century in France. We were introduced to writers such as Balzac, Proust, Camus, and Duras. ",
            "\u00a0This course was phenomenal: not only did I learn more about how specific historical events could give rise to certain literary forms, but it gave me a sense also of the wider literary and intellectual culture of France during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the last two centuries of French literature, as well as the historical context that accompanied the novels. A truly fascinating course! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Modern French literature and French culture! ",
            "\u00a0Literary analysis, understanding of the 19-20th century French canon ",
            "\u00a0I developed my French reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was a wonderful course! I feel that I definitely gained a basic cultural literacy of the modern French novel and of French literary culture more generally. I did the French section, so the course also helped me keep up my reading skills (and especially work on French reading efficiency!) and practice oral French once a week. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the novel and how it has changed through French leadership. I also learned about French culture to the extent that I feel familiar with French literature at a broad level. ",
            "\u00a0Beyond learning about the modern French literary tradition - which has influenced and reflects a broader literary and intellectual tradition - I learned about literary criticism and how to read novels in conversation with one another. I feel like a much stronger reader now, and even skills as a writer have improved despite being in the non-WR section. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are always interesting and section was very helpful in reinforcing what we had learnt in lecture.  The debates at the end of each lecture provided useful alternative viewpoints on the novels we studied and were also entertaining to listen to. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was very strong and well taught. The lectures were very interesting, and always left me very excited about exploring each subject. I really enjoyed how professor Samuels and professor Kaplan would leave time at the end of each class to debate, showing the way these novels could be interpreted differently. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for the course felt extremely polished, well supported by secondary material, and yet, distilled enough for an audience unfamiliar with the material. However, the debates could sometimes feel somewhat forced - making me wonder if Q&A might be a possible and better alternative. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are by far the lectures, as both Professor Kaplan and Professor Samuels are wonderful lecturers. Every text they assigned was fascinating and of a very high quality  it certainly felt like the class had been well planned and thought through. The only way to improve the class would be to ensure that it is taught every year for many years to come! ",
            "\u00a0Wonderfully taught! A strength is the two professors that build off of each other and challenge topics from 2 different perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are amazing. The two professors each gave half of the lectures, focusing on their specialty. The section was very engaging as well. ",
            "\u00a0Section discussions were productive ways to understand the lectures. It was a good idea to have two professors to allow for some debate. There was not much time for debate at the end of the lecture, however, and I did not feel that it was as engaging as it could have been. ",
            "\u00a0The professors were wonderful, knowledgeable, and funny. The lecture was a real delight to attend, and the novels were diverse in style and seemed instructively representative. The reading load was heavy to the point where it wasnt realistic to do all of it (especially if, like me, you were a non-major reading in a non-native language) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging, fun, and absolutely worthwhile!\r\nWeaknesses: didn't look at the text as much as I would've liked. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard to find many weaknesses in this course. I loved the dual 19th and 20th century perspective that Professors Samuels and Kaplan provided, I loved the end of class conversation between the two of them, I loved the historical approach to literature, and I found the discussion section to be an illuminating compliment to an already very bright lecture. Personally, I think that it would have been time better spent to replace the film adaptation class with a short Sartre piece, given his towering presence throughout the course. Otherwise, great, great class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the main strength of this course to be the content, which gave us an understanding of French literary history and its influences on French and non-french societies. It was interesting to see how writers were able to shape latter generations through their works, subsequently lending power to new writers who they'd influenced.\r\nOne weakness could be the text to general information ratio. Possibly because this course was designed to discuss literature in its historical context, there were times when the lecture covered the background and not the text itself or vice versa. While I do understand that discussion sessions exist because they offer immense amounts of help in trying to cover what went unmentioned in class, a more comprehensive lecture style would be great. "

            "\u00a0Yes - it was my favourite class this semester and I would highly recommend to another student because it felt the course was very much about learning for learning's sake.  The structure of the course meant there was minimal stress but a lot of gain, and the testing didn't feel as important as the learning. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This course is amazing, whether you're an english speaker or a french speaker. This class was so interesting and a pleasure to take. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course very highly -- to both humanities students and everyone. The books are moving. The lectures are thorough and clear. Everything is well contextualized. The co-teaching is dynamic. You will get a broad overview of the books / movements as well as close textual analysis. This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn so, so much about French history and literature under two amazing faculty members. Definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Whether you take it in English or French, you will read some incredible novels (and it is a joy to read fiction during a busy semester!) and learn a lot about them, their writers, and French literary history in general. This is one of those must-take classes at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommend!! Learned a lot in a positive learning environment that kept my attention! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in French literature, this is an amazing course to take. The breadth of the class is a huge plus for someone who's interested in exploring different schools of literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good class to take it you are committed to doing all of the reading. It is a heavy courseload, but it is worth the challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and would highly recommend it to another student! The professors are both very accomplished in their field and great instructors (which can seem hard to find at Yale). The reading list is fantastic, and the pace is fast  however, you can definitely get by without doing all of the readings and still get a lot out of the course. Take it for a Hu credit; take it for a Wr; take it to make time in your life to read essential French novels. You wont regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is a great example of a topic that is unfamiliar to most but relatable to all. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. I shopped this course on a whim and was immediately drawn in by Professor Samuel's insightful, lucid, and entertaining lecturing style. Even if you don't expect to enjoy French literature, just sit in on the class and give these passionate professors a chance to change your mind. I feel like a more well-rounded student now, and I even won Final Jeopardy last week to boot (gotta love Proust and his cookies)! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they were interested in reading unconventional types of narratives and wanted to explore writing. "
