I also think that some of the quizzes, in particular Professor Gendron's quizzes, weren't really written to fit the material that well. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't like the set up of this class very much. The bi-weekly quizzes were really difficult and they added up to 50% of the overall grade. I came in not having very much background and from the very first quiz I felt like I wasn't on an even playing field with the rest of my peers. I reached out to my TA and my peer tutor, but I didn't feel like it helped me very much. Overall I felt like this class was a very \"do it yourself\" kind of class. Even the problem sets are optional, which is kinda nice, but there's no one to keep you accountable for the work except yourself. There isn't much collaboration at all. I still felt like I learned a lot though. My grade probably won't reflect that, but I'm not too upset about it honestly because I knew very little about these topics before taking this class, so I definitely got something out of it. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are pretty bad in my opinion. The MCDB department should try to get professors that will focus more on their teaching style and way of presenting their material. And, Gendrons quizzes were unnecessarily challenging, which I found quite frustrating. In my opinion, this course needs to be overhauled. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the setup of the class where we had \"special Tuesdays\" ever other week where the class broke up into sections to discuss research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Quizzes are difficult and time consuming but studying definitely pays off ",
            "\u00a0The course is set up in a way that makes sense. The quiz format was fine, but the questions tended to be worded confusingly and I felt that some students were missing questions because of that rather than because of a lack of knowledge. The special Tuesday sections were fine, but I think the participation portion of the final grade was too high given how little time each student really has to talk. ",
            "\u00a0The transition between Dellaporta and Gendron is HUGE. Teaching styles are very different and test questions are also ridiculously different\r\n\r\nI really like the format of the class where we have special tuesdays and get to discuss papers that have to do with the class material. the quizzes were helpful for keeping on track ",
            "\u00a0The special Tuesday format of the course helped facilitate student learning by keeping you on top of the material without stressing you out every single week. The only weakness was that some of the quizzes had somewhat confusing wording and made it hard to demonstrate knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dellaporta and Professor Gendron were both knowledgeable, entertaining, and clearly passionate. I also liked the alternating structure of lectures and sections, as I felt that it allowed us to focus on more traditional lecture content as well as in-depth discussion of papers. Additionally, although the course was a large lecture, I always felt engaged, and I felt that both professors went out of their way to engage students. I felt that the biweekly quizzes helped me keep up with material and prepared me for the final exam. That being said, I would have liked to have a practice exam available, as the problem set design was different from quizzes we had taken before. ",
            "\u00a0One of the things that NEEDS to be improved is that students should be allowed to access the quizzes after they take them. There is some sort of top secret thing going on when it comes to returning the quizzes to students, so we don't actually know what we got wrong on the quizzes except for the score that is posted. Maybe this is because the professors want to reuse the questions next year, but honestly this hurts my ability to learn. They offer a chance to see the quizzes by setting up specific times with the TAs, but we should be able to know what we got wrong without having to do that. Perhaps alternate the quiz questions every other year to avoid reusing the questions, but please make the answer keys accessible to us, as we are busy with other things to try to figure out a time that works to look at our quizzes and we can't even take the quizzes with us to study later. ",
            "\u00a0Personally, I did not like how some of the quiz questions were solely tricky because of their wording. I do not think this is an effective strategy to gauge who truly knows the course material, and I found it frustrating to lose points on a quiz simply because the professors misled us. Other than this, I think the course was fair and truly interesting. My TF was wonderful, and I did not find the short-answer format of the final exam to be overly difficult; however, I found that it expected rote memorization from the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well taught and I really liked the format of three lectures followed by a quiz. However, I felt as though the final should have been worth more in proportion to section and the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was spectacular. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was very effective. The module and special Tuesday system worked well to break up the course into coherent segments. The lectures sometimes seemed less informative than the textbook, and I think the course could have gone into more depth on topics in the second half. The quizzes were fair and helped me stay on track, and the ungraded problem sets were also helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the topics covered in this course and the order in which they were taught. I think they followed a logical, engaging order and the textbook reading actually helped. I also enjoyed being able to be taught to by 2 great professors. I also liked that section was used during class time every other Tuesday. The readings for section weren't always the most interesting but I liked being able to gain experience reading and analyzing primary scientific literature. Additionally, the quizzes were very tricky. The wording and formatting made the questions confusing. Sometimes, I felt that I knew the concept but was got the question wrong because of misinterpreting what exactly the question was asking and how the answers were distinct from each other. I also didn't like that we weren't able to keep our quizzes and look at them throughout the semester. However overall, this class was very engaging and I learned so much interesting topics about genetics. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class was much more quantitative and calculation focused than the second half, which was okay, but it seemed almost like two different classes in one because of it. The first half was more genetics, while the second half felt more like the molecular biology core course. ",
            "\u00a0Disorganized, and could do better with their TAs. The class throws a lot of information at you and then has biweekly quizzes that are not straightforward and stressful. ",
            "\u00a0More feedback from professors/TA ",
            "\u00a0good course overall; gendron's quizzes too confusing; doesn't make sense that we can't keep our quizzes we don't know what we don't know ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of information to remember, but not really anything that can be done about that\r\n\r\nI appreciated Prof. Gendron's breakdown of the topics for each lecture, and when I went back to study it was convenient to break everything down into those topics. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it would be helpful to provide a practice test for the final because it is such a different format from the quizzes. Additionally, I think that sometimes the topics were confusing but due to time constraints, we would have to speed through the material. Lastly, there were so many interesting studies about genetics that were published during the semester and I would have valued at least some class discussion of them. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion it would help to have either smaller weekly quizzes or a study guide for the biweekly quizzes. The material covered for the biweekly quizzes was hefty and deep, and made studying stressful and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the course had quizzes every two weeks because it was helpful for us to keep up with the information. ",
            "\u00a0Lecturing was fine and actually quite engaging. However, even doing readings and problem sets were not sufficient to do very well on the quizzes, which were often unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent upper level MCDB course with an appropriate amount of content and excellent professors. The only weaknesses of this course are its over-emphasis on more classical concepts in genetics and lack of in-depth discussion of newer technologies such as next-generation sequencing and CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dellaporta. He's a wonderful lecturer and very enthusiastic about his material. Gendron is also a fairly good lecturer. Weaknesses: Gendron's quizzes. They're not incredibly clear or fair to the material being taught, and he doesn't tend to address this well in class (tends toward being a little defensive). Another weakness is that the biweekly quizzes aren't given back or an answer key released--our only option is to find our TA in off hours to see our own quizzes. This isn't exactly ideal for long-term referencing of material we got wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the stretch breaks, it would be nice to have those for the entire semester, not just the second half. Although, I can see why we didn't have any breaks during the first half, since it seemed to me like Professor Dellaporta was rushing to finish or didn't finish everything he wanted to cover during the lecture. The special Tuesday setup is nice because having section outside of class time can be inconvenient. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the quiz format, and the instructors were great, but I honestly think that the lectures could have gone faster. The same amount of time was spent on easy and hard concepts, which made some things feel slow and some overwhelming. Both professors were very nice and knowledgeable! They could make sure that all the slides are printed, but that one slide that has a few changes doesn't get 10 pages of paper. ",
            "\u00a0Dellaporta's lectures in the beginning are a bit too rushed, I think it would be good to introduce less information so it sticks better instead of becoming things that are crammed and later forgotten ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the \"Special Tuesday\" set-up, because the biweekly quizzes ensure that student stay on top of the material over the course of the semester. The teaching fellows and professors were also readily available if students sought their help, and review sessions were held prior to each quiz. It was also helpful that optional problem sets were made available to help prepare for the quizzes, and that the lowest quiz grade was dropped. Finally, it was very nice that printouts of the lecture slides were provided each class. The slides were often very repetitive, so it might be good to try to cut back on repetitive slides for the sake of saving so much paper and ink. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the discussion sections, and it was interesting to get the perspectives of two different lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: Completly nontransparent grading and just really bad quiz questions, etc.  basically each question on the quiz is a point on your final grade (I think? unclear?) and a lot of them have multiple answers or are poorly worded etc etc. Some of the lectures were also a little confusing. Honestly the class should just drop the quizzes and have a midterm ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that it is a very interesting course. However, Dellaporta is super scatter-brained and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: subject and topics of the lectures are super cool (if you like genetics ofc) , low work yet biweekly quizzes ensure that everyone is up to date w the material and attending lecture, both lecturers are engaging; weakness: multiple choice quizzes aren't always straight forward so knowing the material wont necessarily be enough to answer the quizzes, gendron quiz and test questions can be really ambiguous and not straightforward ",
            "\u00a0The professors were amazing. The quizzes were very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest problem I had with the course was the fact that quizzes were multiple choice. They were annoyingly tricky, and I feel that for subjects like biology, this form of assessment makes it difficult to show your understanding of the material. People tended to make mistakes because they did not understand the question, not because they did not understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The review sessions should be more structured. The lectures are good, but Gendron's quizzes are not as fair as Dellaporta's.  We are not able to keep quizzes and there is no answer key so it is hard to know where we went wrong in our logic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Both Professor Dellaporta and Professor Gendron seemed genuinely kind and eager to helping their students; I liked the discussions about research papers; the material and lectures were interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't think the multiple choice quiz format was necessarily the best way to demonstrate our understanding of the material; the explanations about probability and various statistical tests were not the best. ",
            "\u00a0I think the multiple choice format of the quizzes could be updated to better reflect the format of the final and also to encourage more learning during the semester. I liked the biweekly quiz schedule with special Tuesdays, though. ",
            "\u00a0n/a ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic professors (definitely the two best MCDB professors I've had thus far), fun lectures, interesting content and 'special Tuesdays' actually weren't that bad when you got used to the swing of them. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course was very TA-dependent. I had a great TA (Kei) who was (seemingly - haven't seen my participation grade yet) relaxed and inclusive when it came to being a part in section. I have friends in the class who were assigned less friendly/stricter TA's who made their time in this course less pleasant. Participation is 25% of your grade, and so this is a huge factor in the class. Also, the quizzes (50% of the grade!) were often fairly ambiguous in how they ask questions and will purposefully try and trick you out. Most of the time they were fine though. Never getting your quizzes back was a pain though. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and the material is interesting. The quizzes, however, are not the best way to test the material because they are all or nothing (multiple choice) and the questions are seemingly worded to purposely trick us. The paper discussions were great but the bad quiz experiences every other Tuesday made the class not that enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoy the lecture and the special Tuesdays! I don't like the quizzes. I wish they were every week, because every other week is just too much content. They were also very tricky because they were multiple choice, I struggled with them despite knowing the concepts well. I would prefer short answer format because I feel like thats a better way of showing what I've learned. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the layout of the course and liked how there were quizzes every other week as opposed to midterms. I also liked the papers chosen; however, I almost wish there would have been a weekly mandatory discussion session. There's a lot of material, and I feel like talking it over in a discussion section with a TA would have been more beneficial than talking about one paper in the sections. Also, the weight of participation in the section discussion should be lowered. It seems too high for a discussion on a paper. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly, no. Unless you're MCDB and need an elective and you think this is your best bet, no, I wouldn't recommend it. The second half with Professor Gendron was definitely more engaging and better taught in my opinion, but even so the class was very lackluster. ",

The MCDB department should try to get professors that will focus more on their teaching style and way of presenting their material. And, Gendrons quizzes were unnecessarily challenging, which I found quite frustrating. In my opinion, this course needs to be overhauled. ",

The course was well-taught and well-structured for student learning, and I found the content interesting. Both professors did a great job, and I now feel much more prepared to take higher level biology courses that might rely on a background in genetics. ",

I thoroughly enjoyed the class, and feel like I gleaned a lot of information from the instructors, although I was not the most ardent supporter of the quiz format or particularity of the questions.

I feel like the professors tried to make the questions so hard that they came at the cost of coherence, i.e. the questions were so convoluted that they didn't make sense. Moreover, I'm confused why the professors didn't want to post quiz keys and why they didn't let us keep our quizzes, which would have helped immensely with studying. Instead, we had to find times to coordinate with our TA to look at our quizzes. ",

If not, I think this class would still be interesting but it might be harder to be motivated to understand and study all the info that is taught. I think this is great course to take following bio 103 because some of the same topics are gone over and extended upon in this course. The quizzes are tricky and I spent basically all of my Mondays every other week studying for the quizzes. I found the quizzes hard to show how we much learned (because it was all multiple choice) but the final was better in that it was short answer and we could better show what we were thinking and understood.

            "\u00a0if you're interested in genetics ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is my favorite of the MCBD core classes. It was fascinating and taught in a way that made it understandable. I would (and have) recommended to anyone who is looking for a higher level biology class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great MCDB core option. It is really interesting but challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because it was really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Nope. Didn't learn anything beyond what I already knew. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any pre-med at Yale whether or not he/she is a MCDB major. It is an excellent course that teaches essential concepts in genetics but also provides an introduction into current research in the field of genetics through paper discussions on Special Tuesday meetings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it's a quite good MCDB course, mostly thanks to the teaching. The instructors are generally clear and enjoyable in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is taught better than the genetics module in the intro bio sequence (ar at least the spring genetics module, I didn't take the fall one). There's a quiz every two weeks and a final exam, plus section every two weeks. I think it was a manageable workload and both professors are generally good lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good MCDB core class, and was very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, its interesting and its interesting to have two professors at once ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found it extremely interesting, and also taught very fairly. ",
            "\u00a0I've heard cell bio is better, so if you're choosing between them 100% wait until the spring and do that. This class ends up being decided not based on how much you know or don't know, but on the basis of silly quiz questions. If you're interested in genetics or want to take The Human Genome class then 100% yes, just do the readings on your own and honestly, it'll make more sense than the lectures. That being said I do feel like I learnt something. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class only to another student if you have to take it. The second professor is so much better than Dellaporta. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you like genetics or need an elective for mcdb ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely if they are interested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0If this class can be used for your major (MCDB/MBB/Neuroscience etc.), then absolutely! It is definitely the best of the MCDB core classes, and the most enjoyable Bio class I've taken at Yale so far. You actually feel like you're learning new content at a reasonable and digestible level. Dellaporta and Gendron are fantastic professors - both have different personalities and teaching styles too, so swapping half-way through the semester is great for engagement levels/keeping you interested. The course also has very little actual work outside of the (somewhat intense) studying for the quizzes and papers every second Tuesday (unless you choose to do the *optional* problem sets - these are critical for the final exam, though). \r\n\r\nKnow that participation is a HUGE factor for this course (25%!), which is unlike any other Bio/STEM class here, and if that isn't up you're alley, potentially this isn't your course. I managed however, and speaking in class is a fear of mine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Id recommend this to someone who is interested in learning more about genetics. The professors are much more entertaining and engaging lecturers than most. The material is quite interesting as well. This is an easy lecture with easy participation grades. If you study for quizzes and exams, it is not too hard to do well compared to other bio classes. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I would not recommend this class. The material is very interesting and the paper discussions are great but the quizzes are not fair and mean-spirited in nature, which makes the class not too enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I did not love this course but I feel like it is necessary to take if you are an MCDB major, I would recommend Cell Biology and Dev Bio more! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone interested in the subject material. "
