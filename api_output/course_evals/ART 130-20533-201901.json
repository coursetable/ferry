            "\u00a0I learned so much! I learned how to look at the world in a new way and truly appreciate art. I learned about color mixing, composition, texture, and basic painting skills like surface preparation and canvas stretching. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I expanded my art horizons greatly. I learned just how far I can push my art in general while also learning how to use a new medium, oils. I've gained a new mindset about art that allows me to use every element of a piece to better convey the experience I want to create. ",

            "\u00a0This course was really really strong! I loved the amount of freedom we had to explore different subjects and be creative. ",
            "\u00a0It's strengths was that it allowed students to think creatively. It was really exciting to engage in a class through the medium of paint.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if we also learned about painting techniques (impressionist, cubist, etc), rather than just painting with the skills we already posses. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was pretty strong. Free structure, great teacher, awesome classmates, and a great setting. The only weakness might be that for people with poor time management skills, the work can really sneak up on you, but if you can plan ahead, you'll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nvery easy going and exploratory. I think we all developed our style and preferences through just exploring with the oil paint. \r\nWeakness: \r\nnot a lot of structure so it was harder to plan when I should be dedicating time to doing the work ",
            "\u00a0Great class no weaknesses. The emphasis was on creativity rather than artistic perfection or prowess. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was very fun and a new way to approach academics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I wouldn't say this is a course meant to teach you how to paint if you've never painted before, but if you have had some experience painting, this course will improve your perspective and ability as an artist for sure! ",
            "\u00a0You get what you put into it. I put in a lot of time and thoughts, and really left the course with the certainty that I will continue to paint outside of the course. The class meets twice a week and we either painted or did critiques of the paintings. Kenny never says that we have to do anything a certain way or that something is wrong. There are suggestions about missed opportunities but never a negative comment. It's a safe class to explore your own style. ",
