            "\u00a0I learned how to come up with - and study - a research question of my own, with the help of qualitative interviews and a short survey. I also learned about some of the foundational texts in sex and gender studies. It has changed the ways with which I analyze the biological and cultural world, which I also now know cannot be separated. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about gender and who it operates sociologically, as well as how to produce sociological research papers ",
            "\u00a0This course contested many of things I considered biological facts; we analyzed the process by which social meaning is inscribed into science, even down to the molecular level. I've emerged from this course with an intersectional understanding sexual assault, workplace discrimination, and mothering and fathering. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught basic sociological concepts focusing on areas related to sex and gender. The course also focused heavily on research methods and writing a sociological research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to view different social institutions through an intersectional lens and I think I furthered my awareness of gender's role in our interactions. ",
            "\u00a0This introduction class provided me with a broad understanding of sex and gender and the roles they play in various institutions of life. Through our research paper, I also learned how to collect my own data and turn it into a cohesive argument. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned that gender and sex are not the same thing. There is a variety of factors that affect how a person may be seen and many stereotypical views are actually just social constructs. I learned to think sociologically and apply my knowledge to real-world scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0Even when the course takes on a broad view of how sex and gender and interconnected with society, the knowledge transmitted both in class and section helps one question certain constructs and previous learnings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the field of sociology and a lot of incredibly interesting information about gender, intersectionality, race, and so many interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how sex and gender pervade our society. I learned a lot about how many things in our society that we take for granted are socially constructed. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding concepts through sociological lenses. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me gain a new perspective on sex, gender, and other identifiers by viewing them through a socialogical standpoint. It introduced me to reading and analyzing socialogical books and articles. ",
            "\u00a0This course really rocked my world, I started questioning the way things in my own life worked. It really provided me with a new lens through which I could view the world, and was a great introduction to the subjects of sociology and of sex and gender in all stages of life. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good deal of knowledge about the sociology of sex and gender in the US. I also learned about sociological methods and practices. ",
            "\u00a0Survey of how sex and gender affect our daily lives, throughout our lives (from birth, childhood, work, parenthood, to death). Super interesting stuff!!!! My favorite parts were about how gender affects your role in parenthood and the decisions you make in terms of family and work; research on sex and gender in reproduction (especially the section on sperm, eggs, and donation, much of which was based on Almeling's research, so that was awesome); and the research paper that you could write on whatever topic you wanted as long as it was related to sex/gender. It was also a great intro course because you learned how to conduct your own research and write your own research paper. Doing the readings, though not always necessary, makes the course much more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an engaging introduction to issues like gender, race, and reproduction. It was obvious that a lot of effort went into making it as accessible as possible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that everyone operates on a set of social constructions dictated by the dominant culture. In many ways, men have more opportunities than women. There are many obvious ways this shows like the wage gap between \"sexes.\" A subtle way this shows is through women being held to crazy and unhealthy body expectations in the advertising industry. I also constantly thought about the idea of intersectionality in relations to not only gender but race, ethnicity, class, and others. Therefore, the experience for all men can't be the same and all men do not get the same privileges. A black man will be more scrutinized by a police officer than a white man. However, everything else must be considered, especially class. This class was so thought provoking and I am so glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of information about gender and how to deconstruct my own misconceptions and beliefs. "

        [
            "\u00a0Conducting my own small-scale sociological study was a very valuable learning experience that I felt differentiated this course from others on similar topics. The intersectionality of this course was also critical for me. From the very first day, it was clear that our discussions would not be limited to the experiences of a narrow group of people. Something about this course that could be improved is the amount of direction given on the early stages of the research paper. I felt that it was not until I was working on the final version of it that I understood what I was really being asked to do. ",
            "\u00a0This might be the only course where a majority of the grade is not directly related to the student's ability to remember course material. Though analyzing course concepts was a necessary component of the research project, it was very refreshing to not feel the need to hang on Professor Almeling's every last word. The quizzes weren't explicitly designed to be hard, either. \r\n\r\nI don't recall any obvious weaknesses worth complaining about. ",
            "\u00a0I loved so many things about this class. One thing I thought was super unique is that I didn't feel pressure to memorize everything I heard in lecture due to the two quizzes/paper structure. This made it was easier for me to think about what I was learning rather than just frantically scribbling it all down. I was so engaged in lecture and section. ",
            "\u00a0The readings Professor Almeling selected were often intriguing, provoking interesting discussions in section. Professor Almeling's presentations were engaging and there was never a day that she was unprepared. She also did an excellent job approaching politicized topics (as is inevitable in this class) in as nonpartisan a manner possible. \r\n\r\nWhile the quizzes were not difficult, I felt they were weighted too heavily; if you lose 1 point on the quiz, you're down one percentage point on your overall grade (combined, the quizzes are 30 questions and 30% of your grade). ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were extremely interesting and the concepts they covered were great. A possible weakness was that most lectures ended early and were mostly data dumps. This could change to include more sociological analysis and less presentation of demographic stats. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was a good intro to many gendered issues in society, however someone with previous knowledge of the subject already might find it not difficult enough. I think topics could be covered a bit more deeply, although there was a wide variety of topics. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very detailed and helpful for understanding the material in the readings. However, I wish that a study guide would be provided for quizzes in order to keep better track of what all the readings were about since there are so many. ",
            "\u00a0Its a solid basic gender studies course, but the quizzes are way too harshly graded and the questions are far too broad. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not make the class and topics only American centered. ",
            "\u00a0The course is set up so that lectures are really interesting and necessary to understand the scope of the course. Some of the readings were really dense at times but always interesting information that was really highlighted in lecture. I loved this class and its content, but one weakness I found was the rush of the study at the end of the semester. There is a short turn around from collecting survey data to turning in the final draft of our study, but overall a worthwhile course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the material is definitely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course, well taught and well structured ",
            "\u00a0The readings start out very theoretical and kind of dry, but if you stick with doing the readings they get SO much more interesting. The amount is also incredibly manageable, and lectures discussed the readings enough so that I felt I was really understanding the material. Lectures were also super interesting, with a good mix of media/videos/etc. and also a lot of real work application of the material (such as, for example, applying what we learned about sex and gender in the education system to our lives at Yale) ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course! I loved both the structure and the content. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction to sociology and WGSS ideas. So if you're interested in them and haven't taken much before, it's a good way to get into it. However, if you've already studied them somewhat, then it will seem a bit basic. It also is perhaps a bit too heteronormative in the subjects it covers. ",
            "\u00a0Good class for people with little prior knowledge ln the topic, less so for those who has taken a few classes on sex/gender/LGBT studies. Dana is an awesome TA! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings and lectures were super interesting and engaging. Learned about sex/gender in a wide variety of topics, so you never got bored. Very applicable to your everyday life and to your understanding of the world and the extent to which our lives are constrained by gender norms and expectations. Lectures contained a lot of interesting information (statistics, videos, additional cool books and research papers, etc.) that built on the readings for that day. It was also easy because you only had 2 easy quizzes (as long as you knew the main points of each reading and went to every lecture, they were smooth sailing), and a research paper that was broken up into sections across the semester. I appreciated the ability to dive into one topic of interest.\r\nWeaknesses: if you've had background in sex/gender, sociology, or other WGSS courses, big portions of this course might seem like a repeat or a little too easy, but that was mostly in the beginning of the course. It would've been a great course to take as a first-year. All of it was still super interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0I found that sometimes the lectures were a bit redundant. Other than that, they were quite interesting, but not as in depth as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0The organization of this course made it easy to follow and understand. Often, the first lecture of the week would provide an overview of a particular issue and then the second lecture would delve into a specific topic related to that issue. ",
            "\u00a0This class was poorly structured. It often felt as if we jumped from topic to topic without considering how each was crucial to an introductory understanding of sex and gender. A poor introductory WGSS class, wish Chauncey's U.S Lesbian and Gay History class could be brought back. ",
            "\u00a0More current videos and use of media is always nice. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in gender studies. It introduces many interesting topics under that umbrella, any of which could be explored at great length if you discover you are so inclined. It will certainly change the way you see the world. ",
            "\u00a0I enthusiastically recommend Rene Almeling's \"Sex and Gender in Society.\" And seriously, more men need to take this. Anyways, it's a low-stakes way to do your own empirical research project. Learning how to do qualitative interviews and craft surveys, with it being the majority of your grade, was actually very fun. I appreciated not having to hang on the last word of every lecture, because there was no big exam. The course's two quizzes were only 15% each, and they weren't designed to be hard. They were easy if you went to class, section, and paid any attention to the readings (which taught me a lot and were generally interesting in and of themselves). \r\n\r\nThis course never caused me stress. It was my favorite in a 5-credit semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0YES TAKE THIS COURSE. Honestly, it made me become a sociology major. I really enjoyed writing the research paper and it gave me a little taste of sociological/interview-based research (WHICH I LOVED). I had such a good time in this class and going to it was so fulfilling. wow. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has never before been exposed to some of the core tenets of WGSS -- an understanding of social construction/doing gender in varying milieu is so relevant and crucial. ",
            "\u00a0Yes its super interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. It was a great introduction and wasn't overwhelming so each lecture and assignment was enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- you might be a little bored if you already have a working knowledge of feminist theory, but I found the readings really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to someone without a lot of background knowledge about intersectional feminism, as I think it was a very solid introduction to feminist issues. However someone with a lot of previous experience with the subject might not be challenged enough. ",

However, if you've already studied them somewhat, then it will seem a bit basic. It's very sociologically-oriented and has very little WGSS-theory, so if you're into that, this is not the course for you. It also is perhaps a bit too heteronormative in the subjects it covers. The workload is on the light side. ",

            "\u00a0Would highly recommend if you're interested at all in sex/gender and how it affects people's lives. The course covers a wide array of topics so it's interesting across the whole semester. I definitely look at the world differently now that I have learned about many ways that gender constrains our behavior and life choices. I took the class Credit/D but still found myself doing many of the readings and attending all of the lectures because I was always bound to learn something that changed my perspective or opened my eyes in some way. Take a look at the syllabus to see if you find most of the topics interesting or cool. the course is also pretty easy with minimal work. As long as you understand the main concepts and attend lecture, the quizzes are a breeze. ",

It is obvious that a lot of effort goes into making this class intersectional. It does not just focus on white, straight people, and I really appreciated that. ",
