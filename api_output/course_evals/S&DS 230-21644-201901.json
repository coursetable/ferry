There are plenty of resources to supplement learning, included daily office hours and PDF notes. There are no in class exams, so most of your grade consists of psets. JDRS's lectures, although slightly boring at times, are easy to follow. While the problems sets usually assess the content of the lectures in a pretty straightforward manner, I often felt like I was copying and pasting code from JDRS's notes onto my p-sets and only slightly modifying it. Therefore, I would recommend modifying them so they can be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: thorough introduction to R, great professor/TAs\r\nWeaknesses: the problem sets don't really require too much thinking since you can copy and paste most of the material from the slides. should be less focus on R in class and more on the statistics. ",

The class notes in RStudio were very clear and the statistical theory in the slides were very informative. The homeworks and take-home exams basically involved adjusting code that was presented in class, and not much coding from scratch was required. Overall, the course was straightforward, but I still feel that I learned important data analysis tools. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that JDRS is a legend and facilitated learning to the max. The weaknesses were that the homeworks were too similar to class topics, so it didnt require much thought ",
            "\u00a0it's much easier to say this looking back on the course, but I wish that there was more opportunity to think creatively instead of just basically copying what JDRS did in class. ",

His level of organization and method of sharing all course information was integral in helping me to understand the material; I could re-watch lectures I did not fully grasp the first time around, and I could reference the updated pdf of which functions we used in each class. I definitely think that some additional transparency and consistency in the grading by the separate TAs would be an improvement to the course. ",
            "\u00a0The videotaped lectures made it super flexible in learning the material on your own time and also referring back to anything that needed refreshing. The professor's highly comprehensive lecture notes were also extremely helpful in completing assignments and projects. Overall, the course was well set up for learning on one's own time and independently. ",
            "\u00a0This class was far and away the most well organized STEM class I've taken at Yale.

            "\u00a0I have many issues with the way this course is taught, but I'll probably just bring them directly to the S&DS department rather than the course evaluation system. Here are just some of them: 1) the psets are too easy, and nobody is actually learning from them. 2) it's too easy to not go to lecture and copy the code from lecture to do the psets. 3) the class should have a greater emphasis on dplyr and ggplot2, rather than discussing them during one lecture towards the end of the course. 4) the class is too focused on how to run models in R, and not enough about how to interpret them. 5) we don't get enough experience actually wrangling large datasets. sure, we discuss how to clean text using gsub (which is a great skill to have, don't get me wrong), but the class does not teach what you should do when you are presented with a 3 million row dataset and you have to find some useful insights out of it (and given that there will now be lots of data science certificate students taking this course who will be going into industry, I think this is a useful skill to have.) 6) many other.

It's pretty annoying when the distinguishing factor between an A or A- boils down to whether your title on a graph is too long. Also, the grading isn't quite standardized across TAs. Also the problem with this class being too easy is you walk away feeling as if you learned nothing, and tbh you probably did learn nothing. This class does work well with S&DS 242 though. ",

It's also great that there are many office hours, since coding can be hard at times. Finally, I really enjoyed building on what I learned in AP Statistics, both in that I learned new statistical techniques and that I got to practice using the techniques on real, \"messy\" data rather than the clean data of AP Stats.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is a lack of statistical theory. I think the amount that we learn given the time constraints is perfect, and I love that the professor gives us links that let us learn more theory on our own if we want, but it's hard to replace hardcore, in-the-weeds theory. I say this less as a message to the professor, since I think he already handles this perfectly, and more as a note to students considering this class who strongly prefer theory over practicality. ",

It does seem like you should take intro stats at Yale before attempting this class, or at least get really good at high school/ AP stats. The class size is also a bit too large. ",

            "\u00a0The perfect class to learn R in. Take with JDRS -- he's an incredible educator and professor ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it as a an interesting and useful QR that isnt too much work. ",
            "\u00a0If you're not quantitative at all, yes.\r\n\r\nIf you are, beware, this class is so easy for you that you'll learn nothing. And also it's not necessarily an easy A because it's so easy that the grade boundaries are wack. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is relatively chill and attending lectures is entirely optional. That said, you should watch the lectures because JDRS is an entertaining lecturer and the underlying material is very useful. ",
            "\u00a0If you haven't used R or haven't programmed before, this is a gentle and enjoyable intro class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Though you should take intro stats first. Coding may take some time to get used to, but you do get used to it. The only issue is that you won't get extensive statistical theory training here, but that doesn't necessarily have to be a problem, especially if you're not an S&DS major. In general, this class is a great intro to R and to the usage of stats in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially juniors about to write their senior thesis in the next year ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The workload is manageable and the exams are both take-home. The project is not too bad because you get to work in a group of up to four people. Professor JDRS is amazing! Great lecturer! ",
            "\u00a0Yep! ",
            "\u00a0For sure ",
            "\u00a0Yes to learn R, no if they want to learn how to code ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class to follow intro stats. Gives a great overview of data analysis and using R. Would definitely recommend, especially to students not in the Stats major who are looking to get a better understanding of statistical analysis. GO TO OFFICE HOURS!!!! You will learn a lot if you put in the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent course! I already knew CS but I believe it is accessible to everyone because of JDRS's great teaching. Being able to clean and manipulate data is a skill I think is useful in many fields. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning R and want to take a course to see if you like statistics, I would recommend taking 230! It's super helpful to be able to look back over recorded lectures and I think the psets are challenging enough while still being very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Great class to take if you're not sure if you want to take more classes in the S&DS department. Low workload but you still can learn a lot if you make the effort to do so. Highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, if it is taught in this format and by Professor Reuning-Scherer. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Good way to learn R and basic stats, reasonable amount of work (PSETs are fairly easy, project gives opportunity to apply new skills). ",
            "\u00a0If you already have a solid background in stats and would like to learn a new language from scratch, or if you're looking to jumpstart your data analytics for a project, this class is perfect for you. It might be a little too easy if you already know how to code. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Wonderful class if you want to learn the basics of how to work with data! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to take after high school AP Stats or equivalent non-R course. The class was thorough in explaining how to use R to perform previously learned skills and would be doable for anyone who is coming into this class even after a long break from stats. Very little explanation about coding, so good if you have previous coding experience but perhaps a big of a sharp jump for someone with no coding experience. Lectures are video recorded and lecture R files are available online so don't let the 9am time slot scare you away. JRS is a great instructor for this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so easy and requires no time. The lectures are recorded but you dont even need to watch them  you can just have the posted lecture notes open as you do the pset and its a lot of easy copy and pasting. The take home midterms and the final are of that caliber as well  very easy. You do get exposure to a bunch of statistical analysis methods which is good. Great 5th class option to get introduced to some stats without wanting to put in/having a lot of time to dedicate to it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Most high-end jobs of today will require direct involvement with or at least an understanding of data analysis. This course will give you all the tools you need to dive into that world, and will do so in a way that doesn't put too much burden on your schedule (so long as you don't fall behind in watching the lectures). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a must take regardless of your major. ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you're trying to learn R - very low workload but you come out of it feeling comfortable with the program. Also was very well organized in terms of lectures (live-streamed, files posted), office hours, and resources. Not a great introduction to statistics - take an intro class first if you want to actually understand the tests that you're running. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Incredible introductory class and super important skill to have. ",
            "\u00a0yes! it is a low stress way to learn R; just make sure to keep up with it ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. JDRS is an incredible professor who is very clear and thorough with his teaching. Also, the problem sets and midterms are similar to what is shown in class with a few deviations. The only problem I had was keeping up with the lecture videos as the semester went on, which made the problem sets and midterms more difficult than they needed to be. Take the class if you're willing to go to lecture/keep up with the recordings in order to get the best understanding of the course. ",

            "\u00a0This course is great if you want an intro-level course about statistical coding using R. If you took an stats course before in high school or in college, JDRS does a great job of giving a refresher on statistics through the lectures and assignments. The workload of this class isn't too heavy and I still felt like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a good data analysis class that's fairly easy and leaves with you some important skills. JDRS is also amazing, we love him!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only after taking a course in basic statistical theory. Students who take this course as their first stats class (or who don't remember stats from high school) will not understand the processes behind why we do what we do, and the class will be much harder for them as a result. This class can be almost a gut if you treat it like one, but how much you learn (or remember learning) will be proportionate to how much effort you put in. ",
            "\u00a0yes. Good change to pick up not only the theoretical statistic but also the R programming. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that wants to learn how to program in R. The language is important in data analysis and visualization and would be a valuable asset to any researcher's toolkit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Coding R is very useful for many fields, especially economics which is a very popular major. Again, the course was engaging and overall I found data analysis fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on what you want from data exploration. From what I've heard, if you want more statistical knowledge and understanding of the statistical methods beyond the code, 220 is the home for you. However, if you're more interested in learning code and getting a more in-depth look at R programming, then stat 230 is the right place for you. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to learn some coding through the R language and already have some stats background, then this is a pretty good low-workload class. I learned a good amount of R even though the psets only took maybe 4-5 hours a week on average. ",
