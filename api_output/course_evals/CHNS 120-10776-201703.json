            "\u00a0I have developed a stronger knowledge of chinese, specifically for tones and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0One of the major focuses of this class was tones, and really building on the foundations that we have learned in our previous Chinese classes. ",
            "\u00a0My speaking skills improved drastically by taking this course. All three of the professors are fantastic. A much greater emphasis is placed on tones and accuracy in speaking, and the professors really do an amazing job of working with you to help you show improvement. You will also learn many knew characters and grammatical structures; however, a much greater emphasis is placed on knowing the pinyin than the actual character writing. "

            "\u00a0The intensive structure really does work, if you do in fact put in the effort to meet the teacher's efforts. \r\n\r\nI think the only major weakness is that it's difficult to tell what your grade is in the class - they don't really record anything online so you just have to mentally keep track of how you're doing from test to test. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Level of engagement, level of feedback ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are definitely its ability to drastically improve Chinese speaking. I think it could be improved by changing how it is tested, for example, getting tones wrong on a test has a significant impact on the grade. ",
            "\u00a0It is definitely very rigorous, but the teachers are overall very understanding of whenever another student needs help. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very solid. I don't know exactly how this could occur considering it is already a very time-consuming class, but I think that having students spend more time in tutorials just in conversation would be helpful. Also, I do think that personally students should strive to write characters more, as it is not a strong focus of the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes! But be ready for a lot of work! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great course that greatly improved my Chinese speaking, writing, and character recognition. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think the way that the class is set up is very conducive to learning Chinese, however it does have a large workload. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend that anyone even remotely interested in East Asia or Chinese in general take a langauge course, especially here at Yale. I have learned more about Chinese in one month here at Yale than I did in my three years of studying it in high school. Yes, it's intense (especially given that my section met at 9:25 AM every morning), but so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the language and wanting to improve his or her speaking skills. The professors are so kind, very eager to help, and run and incredible program. If you are willing to be engaged in class and do the work, you will improve drastically. "
