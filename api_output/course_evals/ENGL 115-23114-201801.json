            "\u00a0Other than the basic reading and writing skills that you gain in an intro-English course, this class taught me how to find similarities and differences in things that I would have never expected. It also taught me how to rethink what the environment is and how people engage with it. This was my first course in the environmental humanities and I enjoyed it thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0This course has exposed me to so many incredible pieces of literature--from hallmark environmental texts to poetry to fascinating and unconventional novels. I really enjoyed the selection of readings and the distribution of readings within the class and feel like I have learned how to interact with those texts in new ways. My close-reading skills have been strengthened, and I feel like I have grown as a writer because we had so many opportunities to draft, discuss, revise, and finish our papers. I also have learned a lot about the environmental humanities, especially in regards to its purpose and its history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to develop a specific claim and advance it throughout an essay. I also learned a lot about how the word environment is much more broad than we typically think, and that literature can influence political and social movements. ",
            "\u00a0I got to engage with a variety of texts that all related to a central theme about which I am very passionate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot regarding my writing process and how to improve it.  I learned that making a claim is very important. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely learned lots about close reading and writing! I feel like my writing skills developed a lot throughout the semester. Also the readings were fun for the most part, Professor Nugent did a good job picking out writing that was interesting to read and applicable to the course. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to broadening my knowledge of what scholars have to say about environmental literature, I improved my analytical skills by writing on a genre on which I was unfamiliar. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of confidence in a wide range of academic writing, from the close reading of novels to the critical examination of literature through the lens of theory. The most lasting insight I gained from the course was into the nature of subjectivity. I got to examine how environmentalism interacts with a wide range of political subjectivities, what the space is for agency in environmentalism. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of the existing theory surrounding the intersection of environment and literature, and learned how to analyze novels, poems, and stories through these theories and other lenses. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: It picks up many environmental issues that other environmental studies courses neglect. Rather than learning a single perspective about how one can engage in their environment, this course covers a variety of low-income/PoC/Indigenous perspectives of the environment. This was extremely refreshing. This was the best environmental course that I have taken at Yale so far, and that's saying a lot considering this is an English course.\r\nWeaknesses: None really, the 9 AM meeting time sometimes made it hard to contribute. ",
            "\u00a0The organization, consistency, and overall development of this course was great. For the most part, the instructor stuck to the syllabus, and the class was well-planned out as a result of it. I feel like my classmates and I really got to know our instructor, as he would oftentimes hold conferences in Bass Cafe throughout the semester to discuss our work and to get to know us a little bit better outside of the classroom. He was always very quick to respond to any concerns or questions that I had. Feedback on our writing was also fairly prompt and extensive.\r\n\r\nThe course itself is wonderful--great selection of texts that can really appeal to all sorts of interests, as the class takes \"environment\" to mean so much more than just that of nature. We read an assortment of poetry, essays, novels, criticisms, and photos. I really enjoyed doing the reading for this course, though at times it was a bit overwhelming and felt like we were just jumping from one paper to the next.\r\n\r\nIn regards to the papers, I felt like some of the prompts were a bit too ambiguous and thus left me confused when I tried to write for them. Also, though class was generally engaging and I always felt incredible welcomed to contribute to the conversation, I wish we had done more small group work and perhaps some take-home worksheets so that we could have fleshed out our ideas on these complicated texts before coming to class. Overall, however, I felt like our instructor led the discussion well, and I learned to think about things in many new ways after each class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The syllabus was really interesting and diverse. I enjoyed how the class was structured -- edited drafts of essays, meetings with the professor, class discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: I think the feedback on our essays and overall progress throughout the course could have been more specific and robust. A lot of times the comments on the final draft suggested possibilities never mentioned on the first draft of essays, and I never really knew how I was doing in the class overall. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course, I got great feedback on my essays and I got to partake in great discussions. Theres nothing I would say should be done better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Prof. Nugent was great.  He was very understanding and helpful. \r\n\r\nCons: some of the readings could be condensed ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading list\r\nWeaknesses: also reading list--\r\nMy favorite part of the class was the reading, but even at the end of the semester I am still wondering about the relevance of texts like O'Pioneer and Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl to the environment. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion flowed freely, easily allowing for participation. At the same, I feel it should have focused slightly more on writing mechanics than just the subject. ",
            "\u00a0We read some fantastic texts. I was the first time in a while I had sat down and immersed myself in the world of a novel. Some of the theory we read, however, was pretty esoteric and chock full of references we had little access to. I also feel that classroom discussions could have been more focused and in depth. Many of the questions at hand were so broad that I didn't have much of an access point. "

            "\u00a0I would. This course was my favorite class this semester. I was always excited to learn more about the subject matter and to engage with the texts. It was a nice intro literature course. Furthermore, if you're interested in engaging with the humanities side of the environment, this is your course. ",
            "\u00a0I personally have a large interest in studying the environment, so this course was incredible in introducing me to the wonderful field of environmental humanities. I do believe that even if you aren't an environmentalist, you can still fully appreciate and love this class. The readings are generally great, and you are very well prepared going into any essays that you right. You just have to keep up with all of the reading--there really isn't a way around it. The environmental humanities are really fascinating and help you to think about things differently in everyday life, so I highly recommend engaging with those thoughts and texts through a course like Literature & the Environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A very interesting subject, a good writing credit for people more oriented towards STEM. A lot of reading though. 200+ pages a week sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0100% Professor Nugent made this such a fun and positive learning environment! ",
            "\u00a0Yes- especially if they are interested in the environment and environmental studies. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed our classroom environment so I would recommend this to another student. If you are interested in the environment and the readings on the syllabus, you will get lots out of it! Def recommend skimming the syllabus first because it definitely isn't for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to one who is interested in environmental studies and looking for a writing class that isn't too challenging but enough to improve writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in analyzing literature through multiple aesthetic and theoretical lenses, definitely take this class. What I got out of it was a better sense of literature, not really a better sense of nature. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! The topics we discussed were incredibly interesting and helped me think about the world around me in new ways. "
