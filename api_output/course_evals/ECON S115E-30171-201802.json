            "\u00a0I learned about how the economy works. I learned how to apply math to real life problems. I also learned how to study massive amounts of material in a short period of time, as is the nature of a summer course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course! Valuable information about the stock market and my finances, how to be a smart consumer, and real-life applications in the economy. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the basic framework for thinking about microeconomics, from both geometric/algebraic and verbal angles. ",

            "\u00a0The live lectures twice a week often went over the allotted time. Being realistic about the amount of time needed for each zoom meeting would allow people to plan better, as this is an online course and people are doing other things in addition to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very good course. The weaknesses came from the fact that it is a summer class--we moved every quickly and I don't feel as if I got the same level of depth and connection that I would have been able to get in a semester course. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is unevenly distributed and there is not enough time to absorb nine chapters of material in two weeks. Either take away some chapters or add some to the first three weeks. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses I have taken at Yale! Tolga is absolutely amazing, the lectures are very interesting and informative. There was a lot of reading because the course is only 5 weeks and it moves very quickly. As long as you do the readings and watch the lecture videos you will have no problem doing well in the course. It is nice to take intro microecon over the summer so you have more time to spend really learning it, rather than quickly trying to get the psets done during the year. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Koker is the greatest strength of this course. You can tell how much experience he has making this material approachable for every student. He could not be a more helpful and understanding professor. I always felt that his first priority was setting us all up to learn as much as possible in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good, but even though it is a summer course and it is fast paced, it was sometimes too fast paced so I couldn't retain some of the information. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very well taught course for an online summer study and perhaps the only way it could be improved would be to have more example \"quizzes\" that gives students more questions resembling PSets and then giving answers or explanation electronically so that students can see where they need to improve on their own.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but not during the summer unless absolutely necessary. Taking classes during the summer is exhausting and not as enjoyable as taking them during the semester. But this was a fantastic class and I would recommend it to anyone, whether they are interested in economics or not (I didn't think I was particularly interested in Econ but am now considering majoring in it because this class was so amazing). ",

Intro to Microeconomics is also a very valuable class to take no matter your major, so you have an understanding of the economy. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are not an econ major (Econ majors may be required to take this course anyways) as this course provides a platform for understanding the fundamentals of the economics that play a massive role in our lives. ",
