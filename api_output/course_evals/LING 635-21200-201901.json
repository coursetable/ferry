            "\u00a0In this class, I learned the mechanics of Optimality Theory. This included the history behind it, how linguists have used it to deal with particular phonological problems, as well as how to apply it to our own research. This meant I developed my skills at phonological analysis, as well as learned how to write phonological papers using Optimality Theory. "

            "\u00a0It would have been helpful to receive feedback on assignments earlier on in the semester, that way I could have improved on them before I had decided on an analysis. Each of the assignments, called Language Projects, built on each other. Grading assignments on time rather than weeks and weeks later would also be nice. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt like that we were locked into a language that we didnt know about from the very beginning of the course. I would have liked to been able to work on a language I knew something about, because then I would have felt closer to what I was doing. If grades and feedback were not so late to be returned to us I would have had a better idea of how I was doing and also felt more engaged in general. And also if we hadnt gotten out late every day, because it made me generally have bad feelings about the class since I felt my time wasnt respected. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. If you are into phonology and/or phonological theory this course will no doubt be of interest. If you are not into phonology, this course still covers material that is useful to know about. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Phonology is an integral part of linguistic study, and Optimality Theory is one of the most prominent methods of phonological analysis nowadays.  Furthermore, the professor made this course incredibly engaging and enjoyable. "
