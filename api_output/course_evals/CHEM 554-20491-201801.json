            "\u00a0If this course was given in the first semester, the workload would be fine. However, for a second semester course, I found there were way too much expectations of students: weekly readings, quizzes & discussions, problem sets, a midterm, a final, two proposals. This is just too much if you also have to (and much rather would) spend time on your own research. ",
            "\u00a0Although the attempt was made, there is an extreme focus on the isolated redox chemistry that the metalloenzymes do, with minimal to no discussion of how the enzymes work as a whole to do what it does. I was hoping the class would discuss how metalloenzymes function (i.e. substrate binding/conformational changes/origins of varying rates among proteins of the same family), and not how electrons move around a metal cofactor that just happens to be found in enzymes.It was obvious that the course was taught from a strict inorganic point of view, which is completely fine because I definitely learned a lot from the course, but taking even a small step back to look beyond the metal center of the enzyme would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0I felt there was a bit more outside work than was necessary. The readings for ever class were excessive, especially when the assigned reading was an entire book chapter. It just isnt realistic for us to get done. The proposals were very useful to do, and I wish more classes discussed proposals. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not well organized. I understand pat wanted to put lecture, discussion and presentation all in one course, but it made the whole course very disordered. I don't think the proposal presentations were helpful if we barely learn anything from the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's pretty much ideal. ",
            "\u00a0Detailed explanation of instrumentation was great! Proposal development was awesome. I would have liked to spend more class time on proposal development. ",
