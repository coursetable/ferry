I don't think its necessary given the videos available online but if there are going to be lecture review notes they should be for all of the chapters and not just a few. Or at least the most difficult chapters. ",

His explanations of the concepts were extremely comprehensible and he held multiple office hours, review sessions, and spent extra time on anything we wanted to go over just so we could excel. There are no weaknesses! ",

The weaknesses are many, mainly that this course woos unsuspecting people particularly first years to believe that economics defines life when it in fact is literally fake because you cannot define the human experience with a set of mathematical equations. I did however appreciate how our professor was so available to support us when we were confused. ",
