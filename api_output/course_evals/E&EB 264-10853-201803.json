            "\u00a0This course is great - it will challenge you to be your best. You will learn valuable study skills that will help you in other courses! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fish and how diverse and awesome they are! Fish are so cool and this class has reinstated my childlike interest for them. I also learned how to read phylogenies and how to trace evolutionary lineages. ",
            "\u00a0I actually learned a lot about fish from this class. The four-page final paper is also a great way for me to explore the fish I like. If you are someone who like nature and animals, this is a great class! ",
            "\u00a0I learned just about everything about fish. I can point to just about anywhere on the evolutionary tree and tell you A LOT about that fish, including fun facts and its ecology/evolution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about fish and gained some familiarity with interpreting phylogenetic trees. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about fish! And a lot about how fish fit into the context of evolution, but mostly a lot about fish. ",
            "\u00a0I knew absolutely nothing about fish before I took this class, so I learned a whole lot about fish. Wow. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the major lineages of fishes and about morphologies and other features. I also learned about evolutionary biology as it relates to fishes. I also gained the wonderful insight that humans are fishes. ",
            "\u00a0So much about all the fishes! Seriously this course teaches you so much about Evolutionary Biology in general, and applies that knowledge onto the evolution of fishes and their phylogeny and morphology. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about fish anatomy, morphology, evolution, behavior, and conservation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about all branches of fish from various perspectives: phylogenetically, evolutionary, and conservation. I learned how to take structured lecture notes. My favorite part was learning facts about random fish and also the conservation problems with fish such as the Chinese Paddlefish, salmon and cod. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a ton about fish. First third of the semester was mainly physiology and other broad topics, while the last two thirds were dedicated to fish phylogenies. ",

            "\u00a0We learned about fish biology and went through the phylogeny of fishes, focusing on unique features of the different groups. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about fish!!! Understanding fish anatomy and evolution is crucial to understanding vertebrate origins. It was such a fun class. Even if you don't leave this class a fish expert, you will certainly walk away with a bunch of cool facts about fish to wow anyone at a cocktail party. ",

            "\u00a0This course is just so awesome - I can't think of any weaknesses. Professor Harrington is phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Harrington is clearly really into fish and he makes this very evident in his teaching style. The fish videos are fun to watch and provide good info on the different species. ",
            "\u00a0strengths- I learned so much about fish, and I am now filled with tons of great conversation starters about fish. I can keep going on and on about fun fish facts now, and thats my favorite thing to take away from this class. Also, the fish feeding videos were the best in this class always kept me paying attention\r\nWeakness- I wish sometimes we focused more on certain types of fish and went more in depth with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course is awesome -- Dr. Harrington is an excellent professor. This course could be improved by helping students understand the big picture and umbrella groups that each fish fits into more easily. However, I don't have any other complaints. The lab is highly recommended as well. ",
            "\u00a0Ichthyology is a great course, mostly because Dr. Harrington is a great lecturer and the slides he used included a lot of videos. The structure of the class was nice and simple (basically 3 non-cumulative exams and one final paper). The only weakness was that because there were so many fish to cover towards the end of class, we ended up skipping a lot of interesting ones - the class could be better paced. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly this class is all strengths. I loved how we went over fish in general in the first third of class, and then dove into both extinct and extant fishes for the last two thirds. Professor Harrington was a wonderful lecturer and his addition of videos and his funny comments were definitely a strength of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures were generally fun and interesting. The grading was pretty fair, and there were enough exams that doing badly on one of them wouldn't hurt you too much. Weaknesses: So. Much. Material. I'm not sure if I felt this way just because I'm not in a lot of science classes and I tend to take classes that build upon knowledge throughout the semester or delve into topics deeply rather than throwing a ton of new, generally related information out there, but there was so much material covered that it was overwhelming. I think the course could be better if it had more assessments (like quizzes) that tested us on the material more deeply and more often than the exams did, or if it just delved more deeply into a few types of fish rather than trying to cover so many different groups. ",
            "\u00a0This course is excellently structured. Lectures are well-prepared and well-developed for student review. The format of course-work was also well-structured for student self-learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Richard Harrington III, Material, Lab option, field trips! (Although I wish there were more fishing opportunities).\r\nWeakness: Sometimes 1 hour 15 feels a little too short to cram all the information in for each lecture, but the professor made it work. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class and always looked forward to coming to lectures. Prof. Harrington was fantastic and incredibly knowledgable, and I genuinely enjoyed learning from him. Lecture basically consisted of sitting back and learning a ton of cool facts about fish, which might not be everyone's cup of tea, but was certainly mine. This was one of the least stressful STEM classes I've ever taken, and the workload pretty much consisted of studying for three exams and writing a very doable review paper; the exams were unavoidably memorization-heavy, but were pretty easy if you'd been keeping up. Thoroughly enjoyable, and I'm going to miss learning about fish next semester. ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized, interesting, and fantastic teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrington's passion for the material was contagious and made me excited to learn about fish. The lectures were well planned and easy to learn from. Workload was fairly light and manageable.\r\nMy only gripe was that it was often very difficult to study for the exams as there was a ton of material and things that Professor Harrington would say not to worry about too much would sometimes end up having prominent questions on the exam, but it still wasn't such a big issue as in other science classes. Overall a really fun course IF you're already interested in learning about fish. If you're not then I can see this being a very boring science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrington is a great lecturer and makes you truly interested in the different species of fish discussed. The only weakness is the textbook which wasn't helpful in this course. ",
            "\u00a0A very well balanced course in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: awesome subject, awesome professor, lectures are full of fun fish videos and facts. Weaknesses: it's easy to not be very engaged since the lectures are posted online and the readings are not super relevant/tested on. I wish we hadn't rushed through Acanthomorpha at the end, because there are so many cool fishes we didn't talk about -- maybe fewer chondrichthyan lectures in the future? ",
            "\u00a0It was a lot of memorization but totally manageable and I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0The slides in the lectures were not well organized. Often I had to remind myself of how species we were talking about were related to the species before and after it. The professor was extremely enthusiastic and showed us really interesting videos. ",
            "\u00a0Harrington was great, super fun(ny) and super enthusiastic about the material. Was fun to come to class and learn about fish, but it was always a little bit unclear what had to be studied on the exams (especially the second and third ones). This meant that I memorized lots about fishes, but it also meant that more than necessary was memorized while in other areas I didn't know I had to know some stuff at all. ",
            "\u00a0The material is incredibly interesting and delivered in a way that was easily digestible, especially considering the sheer volume of content. My only minor complaint is that the organization of the material was sometimes confusing (but truly only when studying for tests). ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized, and I liked the spacing of the assessments. ",
            "\u00a0I would love for there to be a slightly better way that we could track the phylogeny as far as the genues and families ",
            "\u00a0A really great class. Lectures were fantastic and the assignments/tests were well written and executed. The only weakness was the room we were assigned for the class often led to technical issues, and the seating organization was not ideal. "

            "\u00a0I am not a STEM major but I have really enjoyed my time in this class. Therefore, I would encourage you to take this course regardless of background. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course without reservation: fish are really cool! ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100% fish was my favorite class this semester by far. I loved it so much and learned so many great facts about fish. the workload is very low, only three tests and a paper, with the last test being during exam week. Rich is a great professor and I appreciate how much he loves fish. Take it if you're E&EB like me, or take it if you are non STEM but need a science credit. ",
            "\u00a0While many people say it's a gut science, it is not true! You still have to go to lectures, study the lecture notes and do a lot of memorizations to prepare for exams. If you just want a effortless gut, this is not for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this to another student, probably above all other classes. I learned SO much and had a blast. I am non-stem, and loved the class. I wish I could take Ichthyology part 2. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - anyone should take this course, whether it's required by their major or for the Sc credit. It's a good, interesting class and Dr. Harrington really wants you to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! But only if you want to learn a lot about fish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who is really into fish or just wants to learn something random. I took this for the Sc credit and thought the lectures were, on the whole, pretty interesting. But do be prepared to memorize a whole lot of information-- the material isn't difficult to grasp, but if you don't put in a lot of study hours, it's difficult to do well on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0It is an excellent science credit. I learned a great deal about fishes without having the pressure of an intense science course. It's not a useless gut. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly! If you have an interest in Marine/aquatic lifeforms I would HIGHLY recommend taking this course with Professor Harrington. The course is set up to where everyone is able to get something out of it, regardless your main field of study. Professor Harrington makes the research accessible to all levels of students of Evolutionary biology. ",
            "\u00a0I'd enthusiastically recommend this course to people who are actually interested in fish. Unlike ornithology, which can make anyone a bird believer, ichthyology is more of a \"for fans only\" kind of course. It's exactly as it's advertised, and if a course consisting of a ton of fish facts sounds like something you want to sign up for, then you will love it, like I did. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harrington is a gem! ",
            "\u00a0Especially if you have interest in fish or marine life, this course is engaging and interesting. The professor is super kind and very passionate, which translates to your engagement in the class. ",
            "\u00a0If they want to learn about fish, this course is perfect. If you're looking for an easy science credit but are not interested in fish, then this might do if you're willing to put in a lot of studying for very dry topics. ",
            "\u00a0Great science credit for humanities majors. Low workload and interesting material. Three exams and one paper are straight-forward. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course is a great way to indulge your inner desire to learn about fish. Take this class if you have the chance, whether it's for your major, for a science credit, or just for fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you like fish!!! If you're an EEB major, it's a great choice; if you're not, it's a fun science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Its a totally doable and interesting science credit. Prof Harrington is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0This is a nice science class. It's not extremely difficult but it's also not a huge gut. There is a good deal of memorization involved but if you listen you will learn a lot of what you need to know. Professor Harrington is always excited and finds so much joy in what he teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fish are very cool and the professor is great ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Harrington is wonderful and you can tell how much he cares about the material. The content of the course itself is also very interesting and I feel like I have a much better understanding of a whole group of organisms that I thought I knew about, but in actuality knew very little about at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was one of the most engaging courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Harrington very passionate about the subject, and lectures are fun to attend. Most of the work outside of class involves studying for the three non-cumulative exams. The grading is fair, and the expectations are clear. If you are interested in fish and like ecology, then you should take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are even slight interested in fish the class is very engaging and Professor Harrington makes the lectures very interesting and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! Professor Harrington is the best, interesting lectures, no busy work, and a well organized course. ",
