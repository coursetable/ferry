            "\u00a0I learned extensively about the New Deal, and its cultural, economic and political underpinnings. The detailed nature of the readings, and the diverse number of topics that the course covered, truly made it one of the richest learning experiences during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history and politics of the New Deal, as well as how to conduct strong primary source research. "

            "\u00a0I think this course could have had a little less reading; we were sometimes swamped, and class discussion suffered for it. That being said, the readings we did do were usually pretty interesting. Prof. Fertik is a great discussion leader and a really great professor. Give this man a full-time job! ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent! It very strongly combined a survey of the secondary literature about the New Deal with exceptional primary sources and research help. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course or any course with Prof. Fertik. First, I think it's crucial to understand this part of American history if you want to understand anything going on in the government today. Fertik does a really good job of picking a wide range of readings, so you get a pretty full scope of the era from a number of different perspectives. And Fertik himself is a great professor - very available during office hours, provided a lot of guidance on the final paper, and leads discussion well. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you're interested in American politics, especially the origins of the American welfare state. I found it extremely worthwhile to learn about a crucial moment in the genesis of our political system and to break down the mythology surrounding the New Deal. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I learned a lot about the course material and about to do excellent historiographical research. "
