I know more people who lie about their experience with Spanish and skate by with their prior knowledge rather than them actually learning and understanding the material. I would recommend anyone take another language. ",
            "\u00a0There is too much going on. I felt it was more important to do all the work than to actually learn Spanish. The grading is too strict and stupid in that way. ",
            "\u00a0There was an insane amount of work, and while I sometimes could see why it would be important, sometimes I really couldn't tell why we were doing it and did not feel it helped with my Spanish speaking abilities. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths included encouraged and constant participation in class and working with classmates often doing practice activities. Weakness was the strictly set system of grading where even correct answers were considered incorrect if they didn't exactly fit the answer key. ",
            "\u00a0The course structure is overly rigid and places too much emphasis on continuing at the expense of mastery. We should have continued to review preterite and imperfect throughout the course but we did not. This left the students in a bad place for the final test which required mastery of all tenses. "
