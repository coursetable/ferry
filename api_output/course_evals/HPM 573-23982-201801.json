            "\u00a0In general, I enjoyed the course. I struggled to understand the coding aspects of python and wished we had a little more instruction in how code was written to understand how to write and troubleshoot code better. ",
            "\u00a0Too much homework composing only 40% of the grade. The homework is difficult. Wish more explanations on homework. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is really helpful and informational. ",
            "\u00a0Great course for Python ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this is a great class with very important topics being addressed. Since the class switched to Python this year, I had some problems learning how to code in that language. I think more time should have been spent on learning how the Python code works before jumping into the meat of the course. ",
            "\u00a0there should have been a better anticipation of the potential needs for technical support with Python. \r\n\r\nTA did the best that she could, but was highly overburdened. ",
            "\u00a0I think students can benefit from having the class twice a week for an hour and half instead of just one day for two hours. The amount of material to cover is substantial and I felt the pace should be slowed down at many parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class, students enrolled are interested in the subject and skills.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement is to figure out how to ramp up the learning curve for object oriented programming in Python. ",
            "\u00a0SO HARD and python is THE WORST.\r\nShould be offered to do it in R or Excel or something else that is more useful than Python. ",
            "\u00a0Good class to learn simulation model to deal with policy related problems ",
            "\u00a0The course was very challenging because it was the professor's first year teaching it in python. Some students were overwhelmed and may have needed more support and resources to help them. I think having a lab session with more TAs and support, like in SAS classes, could be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great and really valuable, probably the only course I actually enjoyed taking at all of YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing class. Must take. I wish I were able to take this class in the first year (couldn't fit into the schedule) before I went on to my internship and before I started my thesis. This course has helped clarify so many concepts I learned in other modeling concentration classes. Having been able to pick up coding with Python was another plus from taking this class. Highly recommended. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Only course in School of Public Health (that I am aware of) to use Python (which should be more widely taught due to its widespread use in industry and the languages flexibility). Provides adequate overview of cost-effectiveness methods.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course does not fully flesh out either topic. Course would be better served being broken into two weekly sessions: one for Python, one for cost-effectiveness theory ",
            "\u00a0This course requires a lot of independent study. Be sure to watch the MIT online courses before the semester gets going and rewatch all lectures before attempting the homework. It was worthwhile to gain a better understanding of modeling concepts and theory but I do not feel confident in my ability to actually create a model independently after this course. I think that if the course had been taught in Excel as in previous years it would have been more intuitive to complete the homework instead of the hours of agonizing over Python code that I didn't quite comprehend. ",

            "\u00a0The programming and stats part was pretty fundamental ",
            "\u00a0generally, it is a very useful class. Using python to solve policy-related questions are very interesting. However, the TA is not helpful and there should be more supportive help such as weekly lab or a more responsible TA ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Help us learn the basic concepts of health-care decision and introduction of python programming. \r\nWeakness: I think lecture+lab/per week is more appropriate for this course. Instructor can focus more on knowledge on health-care decision or theory of simulation model in the lecture. How to code and programming can be taught by TA in the lab session. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was a good combination of concept and practice, and that it provided me with extremely useful skills for my public health education. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assignments were not based on material covered in classes. ",
            "\u00a0I can hardly catch what the instructor says during the course. I have to use the time outside the class to review the slides and watch the recorded video. I feel like I cannot utilize the time during the course because the weakness of instructor in conveying information to us clearly.\r\n\r\nAlso, the course should give more percentage of grades to homework. Every week I have to spend like 10 hours, but the total grades only account for 40%. ",
            "\u00a0I think knowing the language before taking this course would help. It was difficult to troubleshoot. Also people need repetition, so doing something more than once could help us remember. This course seems to need to be VERY applied so perhaps instead of labs with conceptual responses only we  could have short bits of labs to practice syntax and you can only move on if you get the syntax right. Not sure exactly how this would work but it would be helpful to practice in small bits so you know whats wrong or have a code book instead of a whole piece of code to extract from, especially at first. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall, but I think the class could have benefited from more instruction for using python (like bug fixing, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was way too hard for non-comp sci experts. In order to make this class more effective, we should have more assignments on similar techniques so that we can fully grasp them. It was sometimes almost impossible to go from the class to the hw and succeed. We should really have two lectures a week and therefore two examples on the subject. Additionally, the class should either go slower and cover less or count for 2 credits and be more intense- i'm not sure I learned enough other than how to read studies better. I don't think I could do a real one on my own yet.\r\n\r\nI wish we could have learned to do more that would be relevant to hospital administration questions and not only policy questions. \r\n\r\nWhile python is cool, I don't know if people will know it at the hospital I am going to. VBA might have been better in that respect. "

His lectures can be confusing if you do the reading ahead of time and rewatch the lectures while working on homework it can help clarify things. I wish that he would explain the code a little more instead of just doing it on the screen while we follow along. I also wish that he had spent more time teaching us how to de-bug our code in Python.

The professor and TA tried really hard to make it a good experience, and I did learn a lot more about how good models are set up.
