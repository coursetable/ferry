            "\u00a0I was able to sharpen my Spanish skills and improve exponentially in my reading, writing, and speaking skills. This is incredibly significant because I never thought there would be a class that could do these things for me effectively. I also benefited so much from being in an environment with other students who were heritage learners like myself. We learned so much from each other every day. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my grammar, vocabulary, presenting, and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Subjunctive tenses, conditional and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This course (L4 Heritage) helped in developing a more accurate, fine-tuned understanding of the language. You'll learn how to communicate more effectively across speaking, reading, and writing. "

            "\u00a0This course was so well suited to my unique needs as a heritage speaker. I felt that I was given the attention needed to improve the skills that I already had. The variance in activities and assignments definitely increased my comfort with speaking, reading, and writing in Spanish. That diversity of educational outlets was one of the class's biggest strengths. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in how its made for heritage speakers, and Prof. Alexandrov is fantastic. I cant think of a way the course could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nIt is really well engineered for heritage speakers, instead of learning grammar through a book, we learned by translating sentences. I think this was a much better way of learning. In addition, we had interesting topics of discussion to go along with the grammar. This made the classes much more interesting.\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\nThe class could have had a quick overview of all the conjugations just to orient speakers who have no experience with conjugations. ",
            "\u00a0This course is oriented to heritage speakers and our unique challenges/ advantages. The course really integrates material from across different media, genre, and periods of history. I like the mix of audio, visual, oral activities for grammar and general content. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any heritage Spanish speakers out there. You can always improve and I have seen such a wonderful improvement in my language skills because of this class. It was also incredible to be surrounded by students just like me. Especially, coming from a high school where there were very few people with the same experiences and background as me, it was so comforting and empowering to learn and grow with other heritage speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if youre a heritage spanish speaker you should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a heritage student, this is a great course to take, there is a lot less pressure than in normal classes and you will learn about Latin American history along with the language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you can take this course, please, please do! I know some heritage learners are a bit intimated for whatever reason. Don't be! Sybil is the kindest professor and your classmates will be the greatest asset in terms of hearing, speaking with, and learning from other Spanish speakers. "
