            "\u00a0Further developed the Latin grammar skills I learned in 110. By the end of the semester, we were able to read a surprising amount of original Latin writings from authors like Nepos and Cicero. ",
            "\u00a0how to effectively read latin and understand the syntax and grammar ",
            "\u00a0Taking Latin made me more aware of the underlying structures and grammar behind language, and it put narrative and rhetorical structures in a historical context. I also learned how relevant and exciting an ancient language could be through our discussions on interpreting Ovid, Cicero, and Nepos. I learned a lot about the nuance of language use through our studies of these authors. ",
            "\u00a0Latin ",
            "\u00a0In LATN 120, we learned the rest of the Keller & Russell textbook (ch. 11-15), read lots of Latin \"in-the-wild\" (Caesar, Cicero, Ovid, Vergil, etc.), and read \"The Life of Hannibal\" by Cornelius Nepos. My Latin vocabulary and syntax greatly improved, and this class really taught me how much I love Latin. This class really forces you to challenge yourself in learning a language, and really understand the details of sentences (which sounds bad, but I promise it makes understanding other languages, like English, so much easier). ",
            "\u00a0this was the most challenging class ive ever taken in my life. because the class met every day, you had to devote chunk of every day to latin. built great work ethic. can't bs your way through this class, you really have to put in the work. no floating here. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed the skills necessary to navigate classical Latin prose and poetry, as well as some medieval Latin texts. To this end, we honed our abilities to recognize and work with common (and often complex) grammatical constructions and Latin syntax. Ultimately, we were expected to be able to translate passages from Latin to English cleanlywith few major errorsand efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Got a better hold on latin grimaced through reading real latin. ",
            "\u00a0Completion of our Latin grammar textbook and an introduction to reading Latin poetry and prose. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class did develop my skills sufficiently, although the workload was consistently higher than that of my peers in other languages. ",
            "\u00a0strengths:  excellent professor willing to answer any questions; I could tell Dexter was very invested in the class and it really created a great working environment for all the students. \r\n\r\nweaknesses:  moving through the material too fast. I feel like there was a definitive jump between Nepos and the chapters and we weren't necessarily prepared for it. Maybe if we had done more readings separate from the heavily glossed ones in the books, I would've felt more prepared. Also, only going over Nepos in those last few weeks was very monotonous. I enjoyed Latin section much more when we discussed various things in various ways. I think this monotony could have been remedied by changing up how we read Nepos as a class. Maybe assign people passages to translate aloud in a teaching exercise. I liked how Jennifer had us get into groups (this was EXTREMELY helpful in fostering my understanding of the syntax of the passages). \r\n\r\nI also did not like how one of the passages we were assigned to read was Boethius. It was incredibly confusing and disheartening to read something I couldn't understand. I don't think trying to read mathematical texts is good for students in L2 latin; I felt like the content of Boethius was more confusing than the actual Latin, so less confusing intro texts would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include the instruction of most of Latin grammar and morphology, so that any student having completed this course can read many Latin texts with a dictionary. However, much of this course was taught as a memorization of grammatical structures without an explanation of why they function the way they do. Additionally, I wish the course had given me better strategies for learning vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a single weakness with this course.\r\nThere are too many strengths to list here, but here are a few big ones: the structure of the course, studying grammar and syntax then moving to \"real\" Latin (rather than workbook exercises); reading ACTUAL Latin by authors such as Caesar, Cicero, Ovid, Vergil in the Classical period, and Hildegard and Boethius in the later era of Latin (Medieval and such); the engagement of the faculty with the students, the resources available to study, and the overall amazing Classics department all contribute so much to this course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: organized very well, and fostered the learning of a language. you have to come to every class very prepared bc participation in every class required. you see improvement over time bc of this\r\nweaknesses: how there was too much cold calling -- can sometimes be a strength, but too much. it stopped you from thinking until you were called on. i would have prefered open questions and raising hands -- less feeling of pressure, and would have encouraged sustained thoughtfulness ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult to assess the course's strengths and weaknesses, because I get the sense that there is certain content that needs to be covered before Yale College students enter their third semester of Latin. Nonetheless, I want to note that the pace of this course, compared to its Latin 110 companion, is much more reasonable; the first three-quarters of the semester was spent combing through the remaining 5 chapters of the textbooks, and the last quarter of the semester was spent translating Latin prose. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the grammar well but sometimes struggled applying it to real latin text at first. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very well designed and I only have one weakness that I can identify. I wish that we had left poetry to the end of the course and chosen a prose continuous reading to focus on from the textbook. While we all eventually became familiar with the Ovid, the convoluted word order made the already steep learning curve even steeper. Many of us had to resort to writing out translations because of the complexity and could not focus on translating more naturally. It probably would've been easier to start with a large chunk of Cicero and build on our translation skills from there. "

            "\u00a0If you are looking to fulfill your language requirement through Latin or have a considerable interest in Latin writings then I would recommend taking 120. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I feel like I have a better grasp of the English language / roots of many other languages because of my understanding of Latin. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. Taking Latin has helped me understand my own English uses better, and it is a less painful introduction to foreign language for students who are less apt because of its emphasis on translation rather than conversation. Additionally, taking Latin has given me strong historical and rhetorical insights that I would not have gained otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to any student who has taken LATN 110 (which I would recommend to literally anybody because that is also such a good class). This class teaches you so much about not only the syntax and grammar of Latin, but also the syntax of so many other languages! This class has been BY FAR my favorite class at Yale, since it has been so much fun to read Latin and truly understand texts that were written so long ago. It has also been fun to compare and contrast the way we structure sentences in ideas in both English and Latin (not explicitly taught, but comes up a couple times in reading Latin). I cannot recommend this class enough. ",
            "\u00a0if you are someone really hell bent on learning latin, this is the class for you. you will learn an incredible amount here ",
            "\u00a0I would probably recommend this course to another student if she were interested in learning Latin, partially because the workload and the structure of the class ensures that you end the semester with a strong foundation in the language. Yet, the workload precludes this class from being a \"fun\" class, so unless the student was serious about learning Latin, I wouldn't recommend it it is a huge time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the fast pace takes some getting used to but you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. While many people will be locked into this course by needing to fulfill the language requirement, if you're purely interested in Latin I think it's worth taking L2 before dropping it. Learning Latin grammar is tedious and frustrating at times and taking L2 is the only way to begin to reap the rewards. I found it quite satisfying to be able to read actual Latin texts and piece together the meaning. It's a big difference from translating the chapter exercises. "
