            "\u00a0Strength: Taking on real-world challenge through Gates was excellent experience\r\n\r\nWeakness: We should have the opportunity to apply for a Grand Challenge with the midterm and be able to work on it longer in the semester instead of having it at the end for the final. ",
            "\u00a0It covered a broad range of topics, but I felt like it was very high-level and we could have dived deeper. It would have been great to learn more concrete frameworks that we can keep and apply with us moving forward. It also felt we were jumping around on topics rather than having a roadmap for how things connect from unit to unit. "

            "\u00a0Yes it is a great class, particularly for engineers, to think about the repercussions of technology development. "
