            "\u00a0Knowledge: I learned a lot about the early modern period and early modern books. My favorite classes were the last ones on collectors' cabinets, science, and epistemic images. Great readings, and very cool books.\r\n\r\nSkills: How to write gallery labels and give gallery talks. \r\n\r\nInsights: Things were very different in Europe before the eighteenth century. ",
            "\u00a0The course added significantly to my understanding of Early Modern print culture, book production, and theories of knowledge. In addition, we discussed technical elements of the handling of books. ",
            "\u00a0More knowledge of book history, archival work, how to handle books, the relationship between books and the transmission of knowledge in Early Modern Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more profound appreciation for the history of the book and a greater vocabulary for examining books as objects. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting to have the class organized by theme and to be able to explore the types of publications that were circulating in the early modern world. Having each class in Beinecke was especially useful for gaining a better understanding of what the university collection holds. We also read great secondary literature that helped contextualize the books in current scholarship. "

            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. Great readings, great material, great instructor, useful assignments. \r\n\r\nIf this class is taught again, I recommend that there be fewer primary texts so that in class we can spend more time with each book, and more time with the often fascinating secondary readings, which sometimes got short shrift (though this situation improved near the end of the course). \r\n\r\nI think the gallery label and gallery talk assignments were extremely useful, but it would have been nice to have models. For instance, we could have critiqued some gallery labels together before writing our own. Also, it would be helpful to have a grad student from our class come into the next class and give a sample gallery talk on a book so students would know what to prepare. But the gallery talks were really amazing--I was so impressed by how well students perform when they're not hiding behind notes or reading a written presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I loved being able to read an article on a book and then to actually see that object in person at the library. The experiential element of the course was one of my favorite components. I feel that the choice of projects at the conclusion of the class was also a nice feature, as was the group critique of our short wall labels. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: availability of material, instructor's knowlegeability, array of approaches and topics covered\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings do not always seem very relevant to class topics. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was the emphasis on a hands-on approach to investigating books. I found it particularly advantageous to look at the books being treated in each class. The greatest weakness I found was the attempt to crowd as much information as possible about individual books into every session. A more focused approach might have allowed for more dynamic discussion and greater engagement. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if the student wants to learn about the early modern period, or if the student wants to learn what it means to be a seriously professional academic. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly would. The course was interesting and provided a new challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I especially found this course valuable for its thorough use of materials and resources available at the Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class covers a broad range of topics and allowed students to think about the materiality and content of the books. "
