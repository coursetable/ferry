            "\u00a0It should cover more BROADLY what global health is, and not just the typical infectious diseases etc. (there could be less on this and more on NCDs etc.). Also really didn't like the final report because people who had already done a Down's (or other) fellowship application were at an advantage and either already had a report finished/had skills on HOW to write it. A lot of this course (Even the reflections) were very vague and I never knew what I was being asked to do until I got feedback (and didn't do so well marks-wise). ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, well structured and interesting content ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was extremely interesting. I enjoyed hearing from all of the guest speakers and other students in the class about various global efforts, issues, and experiences. I do think, however, that if you're going to \"require\" attendance in class on Friday mornings, you should probably take attendance or something, because a lot of people just didn't show up. Also, maybe not hold the class once a week on a Friday morning. ",
            "\u00a0I like the idea of students presenting on the weekly readings.\r\nThe instructions for the reading responses were unclear, and I had already submitted 3 assignments before one had been graded, so I received points off for all three assignments. \r\nAssignments were not discussed in class, so it was difficult to know what the professor was expecting.\r\nThe course should be titled \"Critical Issues in Global Health Research.\" We essentially only talked about research, and not about global health practice. \r\nI wish there was at least one person (besides the dean) on the panel for the last class who was not in EMD. Not everyone in that class is an EMD student and we could have gained a lot from having someone with a different perspective, background, and focus. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly readings were interesting and they covered a range of significant global health issues, but the readings were dense and the write-ups required too much. If it was just a reading response it would be fine but having to constantly think about challenges, threats to your opinions etc, ruined the readings for me. Additionally, I didn't like that the write-ups were due Tuesday when classes were held on Friday...we basically got 3 days to work on them which was another obstacle for me considering how long/heavy the readings were. I also wish this course was not on a Friday, that definitely caused a strain on students who go away for the weekend/ go to work that day. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course. I thought the the structure of the course (with guest lecturers, drafting a proposal, etc.) was pragmatic and organized. It felt more like a seminar series. Additionally, his TFs were highly organized and responsive to student inquiries. The course did have a somewhat disjunct feel the lectures, while all related to GH, were disjointed in their specific topic area. This is not a fault of the course, but is representative of the scope of the class: in the course of the semester, it tried to introduce students to critical issues in the field of GH (an impossible task) but I feel like it succeeded in addressing the major issues. I also really liked the panelists at the end of the class which, from what I understand, were student organized. I would like to see more of this. Lastly, I felt that the grade expectations of this class were somewhat cryptic, and this could be improved. Kaveh/TFs did not really discuss deadlines in class, so if you weren't paying attention to the syllabus, you were liable to miss something. Otherwise, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the speakers that came were very engaging. I would have preferred for more lectures in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent, very interactive ",
            "\u00a0This course could have used a bit more discussion. The most engaging sessions were the ones where we got to break into smaller groups, but that was rare. There were a wealth of experiences and insights into material that students had, but it was harder to share. Perhaps if the student led lectures were discussion/activity based rather than summarizing the material that we read it would have allowed for more engagement. There were multiple presentations that had discussion questions, but often we did not have enough time to engage with this. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! ",
            "\u00a0Course is good, though the last session (the panel) would've been good to have at the very beginning so that students can learn about the different paths they can take in global health. Class is more of a seminar, but would've like less student presentations (many of them took too long) ",
            "\u00a0Good overall, but I think it should have been a lot more engaging ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course, and particularly enjoyed the diversity of topics covered, the relevance to current events, and the guest speakers who were invited. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very disappointing at times. Overall, the fact that I was basically just taught by my fellow students was the biggest let down. Every class was just students summarizing the readings I already did. What was the point of that? That was a waste of time. Then the guest speaker would talk about their work which was interesting but this course felt no different than the fall seminar. I've been very disappointed by the required global health courses so far and am unhappy I chose to stick with the concentration. I've just been wasting my time in these courses. Also, the massive grant project was rarely if ever discussed in class and that's ridiculous. The TFs would send out random reminders days before assignments were due and never discuss them in class. That's unacceptable. Also they would take forever to grade assignments. I had a reading response from February graded in May, like really? It seemed like none of the instructors took this course seriously and I was forced to waste my time and money. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from my fellow classmates presentation. However, I don't think that the reading reflections were helpful for my overall learning. ",
            "\u00a0. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. The format of small group presentations and a overall research proposal was very conducive to learn about global health. I wish the class size was a little smaller, but otherwise it was fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- touches on a variety of significant themes in global health\r\n- deliverable at the end (i.e. individual project)\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- highly un-engaging lecture format for a majority of the guest lectures; perhaps greater small group discussions would have fostered participation\r\n- perhaps a 5min break in the middle of the 2hour class would be helpful for engagement, especially since students are just \"talked at\" for 2 hours\r\n- while a variety of concepts were touched upon, the final project was essentially individual work with minimal support; it devolved into a copy/paste of a lot of Downs Proposals by students who had created such proposals the prior semester, leaving other students like myself floundering to individually concoct a project with little guidance\r\n- quite delayed feedback on reflections (receiving a grade for the first one after 3-4 had already been written)\r\n- would have LOVED to hear more of Prof Khoshnood's actual work throughout the course, as he mainly functioned as a facilitator inviting guest lecturers and having students conduct presentations ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Excellent conversations and guest speakers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have it scheduled on any day apart from Friday. Making it to class was sometimes difficult with other priorities. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well thought out and the TAs provided excellent feedback. The readings were very relevant to global health issues that we have encountered or may encounter in our research. The week's readings covered a diverse array of topics in global health. It would helpful to have some more background/overview of the topic at the start of the class before the student presentations. We not only discussed how to apply the lessons learned to our research, but the skills needed to work through the problems that may arise. ",
            "\u00a0The overall course was great. It challenged me to think critically about global health and its issues. I learned a lot about health system strengthening, capacity building, specific infectious diseases, and the debate about global health. I believe I am more apt to be a global health practitioner after taking this course, as I have improved my skills to think critically about ethics and reasons for doing research. As well, it gave me tools to think about who is benefiting from studies and the role of larger institutions in promoting inequity. I liked the readings and associated reflections. I think they were useful to synthesize the readings and allowing students to share their own lens. It permitted more thoughtful conversation because students were forced to think about their beliefs. However, I think it would be more beneficial to make the assignments due on Wednesday night or Thursday night as opposed to Tuesday for a Friday class. Each day during the week counts in making it more manageable. With respect to the project proposal, I loved working through it and it made me able to write an effective grant. However, I think there should be a little bit more of a guidance on what to include in each sub-section (even if it is just section breakdowns with a sentence on what to include). ",
            "\u00a0Would have liked more feedback from the professor, rather than just the TFs on assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. I would however suggest not having the reflection due date so much earlier than the class. As well as, I would encourage there be a better explanation of the reflections, because they were graded harder than expected. I think there just needed be clearer expectations about the assignments and the level of detail wanted from the beginning, because it was only later I would understand how much detail was needed. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the diversity of subjects and that theres a new speaker every week.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like this course does not critique global health as much as it could. I feel like it needs to take an even more strict anti-colonialism stance ",

            "\u00a0A good course to gain an idea of the current issues in global health.

This assignment and its associated parts were never actually discussed in class. ",

By listening to his mentees' work, his own work, and his lived experience, I feel more knowledgeable about global health and what it entails.
