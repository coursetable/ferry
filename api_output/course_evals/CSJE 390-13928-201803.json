            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed the tools to understand why people travel and how they do. I have the vocabulary to analyze the discomfort I felt when I studied abroad. After this class, I will never travel the same way I did before, at least not without being aware of what i'm doing and how it's exactly what we had criticized in the class. It's an eye-opening class. ",
            "\u00a0We gained an understanding of the foundational theorists in tourism studies, and a good grasp on how to apply these to primary sources. This could also definitely be a writing credit if taught again. There were enough writing assignments and we got very clear feedback on the writing in general for our papers in addition to content. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about what travel actually is -- from theories to history to contemporary iterations. If you love to travel this class will completely reframe your mindset and make you realize things you've never looked at before. Plus Talya is wonderful!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about not just the modes in which we understand and think about travel, but how that strongly relates to our understanding of others, and the way in which we use both to construct ourselves. This class gives you the skills to critically consider various ontological modes and to really take them apart. ",
            "\u00a0So many. This class was an awesome dive into issues of culture, ethnicity, colonialism, feminism, authenticity, philosophy, economics, relationships, education, and so much more. Literally one of the most diverse and amazing classes I've taken ever. ",
            "\u00a0Over the course of 13 weeks, we analyzed travel and tourism and the ways in which it operates on power structures of knowledge, colonialism, and capitalism. The class moved from the theoretical (a bit of a grind but I really enjoyed it) to the practical with weekly case studies (e.g. historical/environmental tourism and study abroad). ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good understanding of tourism theory and how to apply it. I definitely got better at working through theory and being able to use it new situations and engage with it in useful ways. ",
            "\u00a0-Comprehension of difficult social theory texts \r\n-Analysis and comparison of theories on travel and tourism\r\n-Applying theories to real world examples and personal experiences \r\n-Argumentation and essay writing skills "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it's very engaging after we got past the theory and began to apply them to our experiences, texts, and primary sources. Professor ZB is very good at breaking down the dense theory to help us understand what they mean and how we can use them in our work. \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting and everyone was engaged. The student presentations every week and blog posts added a lot without making it a lot more work too. It was also very well-organized. The only real weakness was that the hardest readings were all concentrated at the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings, assignments, professor, classmates. Weaknesses: sometimes the readings were hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and class discussions were very engaging, and the essays were fun to write. Talya is an amazing teacher and breaks down the material very well as the first few readings can be very dense. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well structured and delivered. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the organization from the theoretical to the practical because it gave us the flexible means to see theory as applicable in many cases. I also really liked the tzb balanced lecturing and student discussion. There could have been a tad more student discussion that allowed everyone to provide input, but tzb really made sure that our discussions were on the right track which was great. ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was really well-organized and used a lot of interesting readings to engage with the topic from various points of view. Professor Zemach-Bersin did a good job of helping us to work through theory and I felt like I really got it by the end. These are important topics to think about and I feel that we were all able to engage critically with them.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do wish is that there was a little more of a practical or 'so what' component. Most of us seemed to take this class because travel is a pretty important part of our identity, and throughout the class we questioned and critiqued that but there was no real sense of what we should do moving forward. We did that a little bit about study abroad particularly, but I didn't find that super helpful because I don't plan on studying abroad and once most people leave college, that's not really a part of their life. I would have appreciated a similar discussion on travel in general - now that we have studied all of these things, how do we become better/more ethical travelers, or is that even possible? I understand that there's probably not a real answer to this question, but I would have appreciated at least a discussion of it - the class ended with me feeling sort of ungrounded. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Organization of the course - I think that beginning with the core theory was very useful and moving to case studies was a good structure\r\n-Selection of the case studies - the topics themselves were fascinating! I was really happy that we got to apply the theory we learnt to such a variety of examples (animal tourism, historical tourism, study abroad, etc.)\r\n-Dynamic of the seminar - I appreciated that the classroom discussion was so honest and serious, I felt that we stayed on topic and we dissected the readings extremely thoroughly "

        [
            "\u00a0yes! if it's offered again. I learned a lot in this class about why people travel and what they're really looking for. It makes me look at my own travel differently. I did not walk away feeling like I \"learned\" how to travel better, but I am now more critical and have the ability to analyze what's problematic about why and how we Americans travel. The first few weeks are dense in theory but professor ZB will help you through it. The rest of the weeks are applied analysis so it's more interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was really interesting and ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is amazing and I hope that it is taught again for other students' sake. Talya is a brilliant mind, so kind and helpful! and she is great at helping you take away the key points of readings as opposed to talking around them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This class was eye-opening in so many ways, and anyone would get something really valuable out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take this class! Even though the title is travel, it's very applicable to many other aspects of your life. The course goes over many themes such as study abroad. We learned many interesting theories about travel, relations between the US and the \"other,\" Orientalism, feminism, etc. You can examine your own life and your actions from a new perspective. The readings were engaging, and in class we would go over them to understand them better. The three essays were also fairly open ended and fun to write. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course 100% if you can. This is an amazing academic experience to deal with super relevant issues to any young person in the world. Talya is an amazing professor, preparing readings, taking into account our reading responses, and our opinions on the course structure for everything. She is also extremely smart and aware of current social and political trends and can analyze in ways that I had never thought of before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! This course was incredible, really changed the way I think of traveling. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if only to be in a class with Talya. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really good course for anyone who travels or is interested in travel - which at this point is almost everyone. It's definitely not a feel-good course; you'll end up questioning a lot of what you think you know and sometimes even your own identity. But it brings up a lot of really important topics and looks critically at something that I think we often take for granted as generally good. Professor Zemach-Bersin is super great, she really helps you work through the theory at the beginning and I felt like by the end I had a really good handle on it - something I haven't often felt in other theory-heavy classes. The readings are really interesting and diverse, and the workload isn't bad - just 3 papers that use the readings from class, and weekly response posts. This is an important class to practice looking at yourself critically. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I think every student at Yale should take this class!! It will challenge you to think in new ways and give you perspective about issues surrounding travel and tourism that are extremely valuable. "
