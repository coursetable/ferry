            "\u00a0How to interpret moral and ethical dilemmas through the lens of various political and philosophical frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you how to think about political issues through a completely different lens, and it really helps us to stir up our beliefs by analyzing them through larger frameworks--an important skill that we don't really realize until the end. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to examine the trade-offs of limiting freedom in exchange for equality - and vice versa. I also learned how to ground these ethics discussions in various political philosophy readings by Mill, Bentham, Rousseau, Rawls, Nozick, etc. I became more aware of how these foundational philosophical ideas can be applied to real-life case studies and legal policies involving freedom of speech, religion, and culture (just to name a few). Professor Rosas also helped me to improve my analytical writing skills. During class, he even pushed me to defend beliefs that I didn't necessarily hold, which helped me to better articulate and debate my ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I read many foundational and some specialized political philosophers. The class is structured in a manner so that instead of just learning the philosophies, your are applying them to interesting topics. I think this class also improved my writing more than my writing credit class. ",
            "\u00a0Law and the Limits of Freedom was an excellent introduction to the world of political philosophy and analytical legal thinking. I had never even touched political philosophers like Mill and Rousseau before, but I left the class more comfortable approaching new political theory courses I'll take in the future. The class forces students to reconsider all their previous thinking on topics like affirmative action, prostitution, obscenity in public and more. As Professor Rosas said the first class, \"If you leave this class more confused than you entered it, you learned something.\" I absolutely agree. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about participating in class discussions, and critically analyzing course materials. I learned a lot about the course material itself, but I learned most about how to approach a certain type of question regarding society, government and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge on political philosophy and the ability to develop a thorough investigation into the underlying issues that arise in various cases. ",
            "\u00a0Laws and Limits of freedom allowed us to test our convictions about the the harm principle, paternalism, freedom of expression, cultural and religious differences, the social contract, affirmative action, privacy, utilitarianism, and discrete and insular minorities. By assigning analytical texts, supreme court cases, and news articles, we were given enough material to have well informed discussions about controversial and morally ambiguous topics. I believe that by taking the class, I am better positioned to tackle questions of political philosophy, politics, and law. ",
            "\u00a0I was equipped with the analytical skills necessary to understand the interrelationship between notions of justice and equality in society. With this came a better understanding of political philosophy and normative theory. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about the law and understand how law tradesoff with individual freedoms and liberties. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of certain theoretical frameworks for the creation of a moral or free society, worked to understand different competing conceptions of freedom, and investigated cases where freedom conflicts with other values. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to read, analyze, and discuss political philosophy -- something that I had little exposure to beforehand. There's a decent amount of reading, but it definitely helps to read and digest the (oftentimes very dense) readings before class. I also improved my writing and argumentative skills dramatically: Professor Rosas leaves extremely detailed and insightful comments on writing assignments, and he challenges you to think thoroughly about moral, legal, and philosophical issues during seminar discussions. Ultimately, I was able to reconsider/reframe my current beliefs regarding law and freedom. ",
            "\u00a0The class taught me political theories by various philosophers, such as Mill, Rousseau, and Rawls. The course covers a broad range of topics, such as sacrificing freedom for the cohesion of community or justice/equality. But more importantly, I think the course really taught me how to think critically about issues concerning freedom and appreciate the \"gray zones\" of the law. It was extremely enlightening to recognize both the benefits and drawbacks of different political theories. The essays were challenging, but they helped me become a more logical thinker and weigh the tradeoffs of different political theories. You'll continuously revise your conception of what freedom means, and under what circumstances (if ever) it would be legitimate to limit it. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how to read, write, and think critically on philosophical and legal issues. ",
            "\u00a0Study of various political philosophers in a way that gives insight as to why the law is the way that it is. \r\n\r\nIts not a course on what the law is, its a course on why. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class is fun, engaging, and challenging. We really get to think through issues differently and apply them to actual events rather than pure frameworks. The class got less fun when the professor stopped using humorous powerpoint slides, but it was still engaging none the less. ",
            "\u00a0This course did an amazing job at engaging students in class discussions. Professor Rosas did a great job of challenging students' comments and helping them to refine their beliefs. The reading load was heavy, but completing the readings was imperative to successfully participating in class. The writing assignments were also very engaging. While Professor Rosas is a tough grader on essays, he gave extremely detailed and helpful feedback and was always willing to meet to discuss essay ideas.\r\n\r\nI think that the case study analysis discussions could have been organized to allow more evenly distributed time discussing each essay. Perhaps giving each student a chance to discuss aspects of his/her case study could have allowed the important points of each essay to surface during the discussions (rather than allowing the discussions to take any direction). ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic. As a first year seminar it really allows the space for people to flesh out their beliefs. We ask one another questions, and question a lot of previously held beliefs. The essays were demanding and made my writing much clearer.\r\n\r\nThat having been said, it seemed as though most people were debating between what kind of left-leaning view they associated with. There was one person at the beginning of the year who had a much more conservative opinion and he dropped the course during shopping period. This may be a result of the general political orientation at Yale. I'm not sure what could be done to make less-liberal people feel more comfortable. Typically \"conservative\" viewpoints were brought up, and many of the students in the class actually changed their opinion on the Supreme Court case relating to the cake shop in Colorado. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths to the course absolutely all come from Professor Rosas' level of engagement with students. He was the best devil's advocate in the course, and really pushed students' thinking. The content was absolutely fascinating, and the structure of the course (reading excerpts of political philosophy, then stretching the boundaries of normative law-making by looking at real-world Case studies and hypothetical scenarios) really maximized students' learning. There are no weaknesses that I can think of, except perhaps making the first seminar dinner earlier on in the course, because the first dinner really helped with me feeling more comfortable speaking and sharing ideas in front of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the discussions, the feedback on assignments, the course material itself, and the clarity of the course's structure. The only weakness is that assignments weren't posted on Canvas, which was a slight hassle. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar discussion are an engaging place to discuss ideas openly and refine them when they are still being thought out. The readings for the course are difficult but can be understood if enough time is given to them. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of Law and Limits of Freedom are that the course challenges what we consider to be fundamental and solidified tenets of our belief systems, offers compelling material and questions that sit with us even when we leave the class, and provides us with the opportunity to effectively engage in productive debate about topics that interest us. The only weakness I can point to is that sometimes the homework assignments did not always align with what was discussed the day those assignments were due, but this may have been an intentional method of giving us time to thoughtfully consider what we had read. ",
            "\u00a0This course benefits from the interesting readings and insightful class discussions. Professor Rosas handles a crowded seminar with ease and helps students to refine their analytical points. More often than not, he'll press you to take your ideas further and though this might be slightly intimidating, you'll come out of the class a more sophisticated thinker. Also, Professor Rosas makes himself available to meet with students and gives incredible feedback on the assigned essays. I felt myself become a better writer with each essay and I really owe it to his detailed feedback. I honestly can't think of any negatives. This class was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The in class discussions sometimes lagged behind the assigned reading. ",
            "\u00a0Dean Rosas is a great professor, and the conversations in class were compelling, engaging, and intellectually rigorous. They were also really, really fun. Everyone was very engaged in class discussions, and there was a greater feeling of community in the classroom than in any other seminar I was in. The greatest weakness of the course was, in my opinion, was the lack of diversity in the material we studiedthere are plenty of African American writers and theorists whose work on freedom could easily have fit into the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course is extremely well organized -- readings are all grouped by topic -- and Professor Rosas brilliantly guides seminar discussions while challenging you to articulate your own arguments more thoughtfully and cogently. Even though it was at a dreaded 9 am, most students were enthusiastic about the course and were found the material engaging and unconventional (I mean ... we watched It's Always Sunny during class). Weaknesses: The reading material could be really dense at times, so it would have been helpful to know exactly which areas to skim or read more thoroughly, especially when this class is taught as a first-year seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Rosas is an extremely engaging and sharp lecturer. He pushes every individual to think more deeply about the reading, and he'll often ask follow-up questions in order to make you think more critically about your answer. Furthermore, he puts a lot of effort into preparing each class so that we can recognize the nuances of different theories. \r\nWeaknesses: Very fewmostly nitpicky things. Class discussion moves very quickly, so sometimes, you might not get a chance to say something that you had in mind. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was in the discussions. The free atmosphere encouraged students to speak up their thoughts about controversial topics and helped students interact with the course material. A potential downside of this course was the pace--because a lot had to be covered, I felt some readings were not discussed sufficiently. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great intro to the philosophy of law but is definitely a lot of work especially in the beginning when the readings are difficult to understand. I think it could be improved if the professor provided a more structured overview of the main topics of the readings. Sometimes the overview was too brief ",
            "\u00a0Very strong overall course, my favorite of my first-year classes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes because it is a fun political science class that tackles some really grotesque issues. Before moving onto any other political-related or any humanities course, the information and skills learned in this class will be extremely useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, most definitely. Law and the Limits of Freedom is a wonderful first-year seminar! Professor Rosas really cares about developing a tight-knit class environment. The discussions were some of the most engaging and stimulating I've experienced at Yale so far. I know that the knowledge about law and philosophy I gained from this class will prove to be relevant in other aspects of my life. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone interested in law, policy making, morality, and ethics will be blown away by this course. This was my favorite class of the semester, and it likely will be hard to beat. I know I learned so much in such a short time, and Professor Rosas is such a kind professor whose feedback really helps improve students' level of engagement and learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, strongly! The course makes you think about interesting issues in interesting ways, and the discussions are fascinating, rigorous, and fun. The assignments are demanding, but always teach a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although the class can be challenging it is without a doubt engaging. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0If this class is available, please take it. It was the highlight of my semester and was a perfect introduction to college-level work and analysis. If you're even slightly interesting in politics and philosophy, this course will absolutely blow you away. You'll discuss the writings of prominent political philosophers such as Mill and Rousseau and apply these teachings in the context of real world examples. It's a class that will change your outlook on politics, the civil state, and the ultimate role of the individual. I cannot recommend it enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I found the class incredibly engaging and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a great way to start the semester. You may not come away with a deep love for political philosophy or feeling that youve changed as a political thinker, but youll have the chance to have fascinating intellectual conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a course that actually challenged me the change my perspectives on law and morality -- I had to consider contradictions between law and freedom that I had never thought of before. I would recommend this class to anyone, even if you're not interested in pre-law. It's extremely engaging and well-taught, and Professor Rosas is an incredible instructor. Although the readings and seminar discussions could be intimidating, it's an intellectually challenging course that will allow you to frame your own opinions regarding law/other ethical issues in a more persuasive and academic way. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This was hands down my favorite course. The class material is difficult, but that's what makes it great. You'll find real-world applications of the topics, develop more nuanced ideas about the meaning of freedom and the limitations of freedom, and learn to think logically and critically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wishes to be introduced to philosophical and legal texts. I would also recommend this to students who wish to learn how to write logically in a college seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you are really interested in law and prepared to do the work to understand the material. If you do, you will learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Challenging but fun and well-taught. "
