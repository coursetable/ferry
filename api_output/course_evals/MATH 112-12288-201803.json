            "\u00a0Good course if my teacher would have actually taught the course well ",
            "\u00a0There are no strengths to this course. Everything about this class is wrong. Instead of teaching us calculus and how to do problems, the entirety of the class is based on how equations were derived 400 years ago. We never learn how to apply anything taught in class. We waste 50 minutes every other day on where these equations came from rather than learning how to do the problems. 90% of my notes were completely useless when it came to studying for tests or doing problem sets. This class is more geared towards math theory rather than application. This makes for quite the challenge when given a question where we learned the very basic first step and the rest you have to figure out on your own. It's like learning addition for the first time by having a teacher explain how the concept of addition was derived for 45 minutes and then having 2+2=4 be written on the board. After learning the most basic version of that problem, you're given the hardest possible version that any could ever come up and are expected to just pull it off on your own. The problem sets are unnecessarily hard only adding to the confusion of this class. I may only be a first year, but I guarantee that this is the worst class offered a Yale University. My name is Andrew Schuler and you can ask me at graduation in 2022 what's the worst class I ever took, and my answer will undoubtedly be Math 112. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course included the great peer tutoring available to help with any questions that were needed. Additionally, there was always a thorough number of practice exams and study sessions to prepare for the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course included limited office hours/ office hours that were not at a good time for most students. Additionally, the material seemed a little rushed at times, especially during the end of the semester. Finally, the first problem set which was about pre-calculus had no explanation for it, so it was very confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was distant; just being lectured to the whole time didnt really help my comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was fairly straightforward. I wish there was more in class interaction with the instructor rather than him just going through his lecture notes. ",
            "\u00a0My teacher was very monotone and I didnt love the actually classes themselves. ",
            "\u00a0The course had very good peer tutoring, but it moved very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were knowing the material and weaknessses are the tests. ",
            "\u00a0Could maybe be improved by more emphasis on problem sets and less on WebAssign. ",
            "\u00a0This course is lacking in so many ways. Three days a week I would waste an hour of my time to go to math lecture and listen to a grad student read off notes and expect 30 students to immediately understand how to apply the concept or theorem he simply wrote on the board to actually conceptually difficult problems. I could never do a problem set on my own and the masses of students who attended peer tutoring to receive answers proves that I was not the only one. There was not enough outside help and asking my instructor for help was useless because he could not wrap his head around the idea that a person could not automatically understand math. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: builds a strong foundation on the theoretical nature of Calculus I.\r\nWeakness: I wish the course involved more computations/problems involving more calculations. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength would be the amount of out of class practice we had. I think a weakness would be the length of assignments sometimes ",
            "\u00a0This course is difficult and can often involve a lot of complicated concepts that are not taught in depth because so many concepts are being taught at once. I think that the exams were also graded harshly. The way that I learned math allows student to explore different ways of solving problems, but I felt like this course forced students to have a formulaic understanding of math where it was that if one did not solve something a specific way, it was wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include peer tutors help with psets and very helpful review sessions. Weaknesses include the ridiculous grading of tests, impossible psets, and challenging webassigns. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the webassigns recapped each class well \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: focus on theories and lack of examples solved in class ",
            "\u00a0Lots to learn but can also be repetitive. Webassign sucked and sometimes answers were wrong just for incorrect format. Lots of time on webassign for small percentage of grade. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it's intensive and provides a good calculus base.\r\nThe weaknesses include the teaching, webassign, problem sets and lack of feedback.\r\nI think this could be improved by moving away from more in-class interaction and feedback from teachers. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who just needs to fulfill a basic QR requirement. This course was not terribly hard, and the workload was reasonable. I do not believe that this is a good course for anyone who wants a deeper understanding of calculus though as this course is just a rough overview. ",

            "\u00a0No. The material, despite not being very difficult, is overcomplicated when it is taught, and there is very little engagement with the students enrolled in the course. Would only recommend if you plan on taking Math 115 and upwards but need a refresher before going into higher classes. ",
