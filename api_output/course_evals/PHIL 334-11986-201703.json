I did build my knowledge and understanding of philosophy, and particularly how to structure a philosophical argument.

But you will learn a lot about philosophy, and how to apply philosophical concepts to modern medical and biomedical issues. ",

Looking at controversial topics from a philosophical standpoint made me question why I had some of the legal stances that I had, and I often found that some of my stances were hard to back by philosophy. ",

It helped me really re-evaluate some previously held stances on biomedical and bioethical issues and examine the moral foundations upon which those stances rested. I enjoyed the lectures a lot, and I feel like Cr/D made it even more enjoyable because it allowed me to engage on a simply abstract level that took away the pressure and left room simply for intellectual growth.

            "\u00a0The class was a mess. Latham's lecture would completely contradict the readings, and the lectures were very hard to follow. I wish he had slides. The readings were also long, boring, and dense. It was hard to discern what was important! I think uploading relevant readings and not just \"UN declaration of human rights\" or \"catholic views on vaccines\" would help. We hardly even discussed that! Clearly outlining what the topic of the week was, who the important people are, and how to apply the topic is crucial. Too many weeks I didn't know what was going on and I never missed a lecture. Make it more clear, concise, and focused. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is interesting to those who are enjoy thinking about the philosophical issues within bioethics.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings are not fully developed and severely lacking in other parts. In addition, there needs to be more structure to the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course has interesting material, but I disliked the emphasis it placed on philosophy. I think that this class would be better as a writing class that discussed issues in bioethics without writing philosophical-style arguments. I also hated that there were timed exams to answer prompts. I don't understand why exams would ever be a good assessment of a class of this nature. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate how this course has a low barrier to entry, with regards to understanding some key philosophers' works. \r\n\r\nHowever, lecture is much less important than section, most notably because the recounting and reviewing of each work is more accurate, there. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were always very interesting as Professor Latham took you through a lot of thought experiments and possible scenarios that make you question what you originally thought, but the second class of the week was always pretty repetitive. He would generally talk about the same issues, just rephrased. That said, the class is still very interesting and the topics are ripe for two days worth of thought. It would be nice if there was something included in the final grade other than three large assignments, i.e. participation, reading responses, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were mostly well-organized and demonstrated clear methodological concepts. However, some lectures seemed a bit off-topic or unnecessary. Instead of devoting 2+ lectures to every topic, the course could have included more philosophical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible professor. Great material. Good readings. Though sometimes the readings can be a little dry... ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor and my TF were both fantastic. Unlike some professors, who would assign 400 pages of reading for a topic that could be covered in 10, Prof. Latham assigned a perfect amount of reading for us to learn about each subject, and his lectures were a great supplement to the material. Weaknesses: I really liked that our TA had us do weekly responses because they helped me clarify my opinions and solidify my understanding, and I think all future sections would benefit from similar assignments, but I think the course needs to have a participation grade. Even if small, it would make the contributions of students to section each week feel a little bit more meaningful and also make grades less intimidating (50% of our grade as the final exam = eek!). Also: in my section, we would often break into small groups to discuss different topics. I thought this format was so effective and so much less intimidating than other sections where I heard it was entirely seminar-style with everyone having to debate philosophy in front of the large group (which ends up being much less of a learning experience and much more of a stressful and performative one). ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class this semester. I was always excited to go to lecture and I think Prof Latham was very engaging and presented different issues in an interesting way. My only complaint would be that grades were based on 3 assignments/exams, the final being worth 50%, so there were not many opportunities to adjust your grade. ",
            "\u00a0Some weaknesses of the course: a relatively low level of effort on the part of the instructors. Latham is amazing, but his lectures were a little drier than Bioethics & Law and very little effort was put in over Canvas or anything like that. The TAs varied WIDELY as well; some TAs gave a lot more measured, thoughtful feedback to their students and were instrumental in developing good ways of thinking about the readings (this is feedback from acquaintances in other sections). Some TAs, however, ran a less helpful section and provided less feedback/response. This will have a big impact on your class experience, choose wisely. \r\nStrengths: Like I said, Latham's lectures are always fairly engaging. He clearly knows the material well and presents it well. It was also nice to get acquainted with some of the more iconic philosophy thought problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor, engaging lectures, intriguing topics, very interesting readings, intellectually engaging ",

            "\u00a0More structured readings and resources for essay writing would help. The content was fascinating but we were examined most stonglybon our essay writing skills rather than understanding ",

The topics discussed in class were very interesting, and I liked how the course was organized so that each week was a new mode of argumentation. Having a discussion section allowed me to explore the topics in-depth within a smaller group, which I really appreciated. ",

There were some weeks where we had one or two short readings that were supposed to cover a giant topic in the philosophy of ethics; more material would've helped me get more out of those weeks. Also the application of some areas of ethics to bioethics could have been made more explicit (e.g. rights) ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the course was the section--I was happy to have a chance to talk about controversial issues in bioethics with students who are willing to listen to different viewpoints on issues such as abortion, surrogacy, etc. ",

The readings regularly contradict/don't relate to the lectures, and the lectures are so disorganized that I hardly know what's going on. It's sad because I love Latham, but this class was a constant headache. Be ready to camp out in office hours, especially if you're not a philosophy major, because it's hardly clear what the material or the point of the class is. The breakdown is midterm, final, and 5-7 page philosophy paper, but he's so disorganized you hardly have any time to do anything. Run away! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Latham is a great professor and the topics covered in the course are all quite interesting. It's not a ton of work, but this was one of the first classes I actually enjoyed (or at least didn't mind) going to section because the discussions were stimulating and worthwhile. There's a decent amount of overlap with Bioethics and Law, but more of a philosophical approach ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed Issues in Bioethics! Professor Latham is an extremely engaging lecturer and did a great job covering all of the topics in class, making the course a great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wants an easier course since there is not much work here but the intellectual challenge is also lacking. The readings are often subpar and section can be dependent on who is your TF. ",

            "\u00a0Maybe, because the workload was quite light and the material was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! But beware, if you are expecting it to be like Bioethics and Law, and to lean on the political science side, it is pretty philosophy-heavy, and some people seemed unpleasantly surprised by this. If you do not enjoy thinking and writing philosophically, it probably isn't the class for you, or you at least should not expect it to be a walk in the park if you don't have some experience with philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to fulfill the political philosophy subfield in the Political Science department, but are scared that philosophy is too hard. Moral Foundations of Politics is a \"better\" class, but Issues in Bioethics is easier. \r\n\r\nThis class might get a bad rep when compared to Latham's Bioethics and Law. That is definitely better, because Latham wasn't very accurate in Issues in Bioethics lectures, when considering how important the readings were in doing well on exams and papers. You do the real learning in section if you have any trouble.\r\n\r\nThe paper was easy. The midterm and final felt very much like Latham in that they were open-ended and probably not that difficult to do well if you put in the behind-the-scenes time. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is remotely interested in bioethics. I feel like I learned a lot about how philosophical arguments can be formed, and also about how they can be used for practical, everyday situations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! This course really makes you think about the types of arguments used in common bioethical dilemmas and forces you to engage with them in a stimulating and interesting way! ",
            "\u00a0This class is an absolute gem. One of my favorite ever at Yale. Probably the only class I have ever taken where every single lecture flew by without me knowing. I wish I could take it again. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Great professor and engaging lectures, light workload with reading assignments that are actually genuinely interesting, really fascinating topics and a great way to dip your toes into philosophy and philosophical thinking without having to jump into the dumb DS Western Cannon stuff. The philosophy in this class is contemporary and extremely relevant/applicable which made it much more interesting (in my opinion). ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class. Latham never prepares for lecture, usually arrives late, and rambles for 50 mins. For instance, hell explain the concept of exploitation in a long-winded fashion for 5 mins, then spend 45 mins applying that definition to different examples. The worst part of the lectures was when he would seem to have run out of things to say and he would ask the lecture hall What do you think?... ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course because it changed my way of thinking and I now feel more equipped to engage in common bioethical debates and better understand all sides and insights. I always left lecture wanting to discuss that day's topic with my friends. ",
            "\u00a0If you've never taken a philosophy course before, I would recommend this for you. You get to learn all about different types of philosophical argument from a bioethics standpoint. Most of the things we discussed in section were based on arguments you've probably heard before (abortion, CRISPR gene editing, etc. with foundations in classic philosophical argument), so you could go into this class having only skimmed the readings just fine. The readings were interesting, though the intellectual challenge of this course wasn't very high. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say consider what you'd like to get out of this class before taking. I went into this after Bioethics & Law, and was expecting/anticipating quite extensive bioethics material. However, this is MUCH more a philosophy class than a poli-sci class. There are occasional mentions of it but honestly this feels like a philosophy class that happens to have bioethics underpinnings--we could occasionally spend an entire lecture talking about a philosophical concept without its actual application to bioethics. So if you're a philosophy person, go for it; if you're looking for bioethics-centric, stick with Bioethics & Law in the spring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! If you've taken Bioethics and law, this is a wonderful follow up where you will discuss the philosophy and morals of similar topics. Even if you haven't, this course will cause you to question your views and consider multiple perspectives. It will challenge your thinking and reasoning, very intellectually engaging! There was a midterm (2 short essays), a short 5-7 paper, and a final. A decent amount of readings but very interesting! ",

            "\u00a0If you like philosophy this is would be a good class to take! If you don't like philosophy, this class is not for you. The class is structured around philosophical topics, with new one each week. Lectures are spent loosely applying these questions to issues in bioethics, but the majority of the class focuses on philosophy in general. I had no major problems with the class, I just don't enjoy philosophical arguments so it wasn't my favorite. It makes a good fifth class though because it's easy to do well with minimal effort. ",

Challenging some of your legal stances with philosophy is very engaging and will make you think critically. Generally an easy course if you pay attention and engage, but also one that you will get a lot out of. Take it!! ",

It was my first philosophy class ever and I enjoyed realizing how applicable ethical philosophy is to everyday life.\r\nThe class has a midterm, a short paper, and a final. The midterm and final were structured the same, and if you went to lecture, did the readings, and went to section, you were totally fine, and I actually enjoyed taking them. The short paper was not hard at all. ",

I think that this course is actually better designed for that role, or for anyone who is not distinctly interested in the relation between law and ethics. This class is an introduction to basic topics in philosophy -- the trolley problem, slippery slope arguments, etc -- that are then applied to bioethics cases. I thought it was a fascinating, and not difficult class and highly recommend it. ",
