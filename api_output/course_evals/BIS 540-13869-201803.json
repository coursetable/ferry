One major weakness of this class was the homework assignments. These were given each week and were on material that hadn't been covered yet. While they were only graded for completion and not accuracy, it was extremely frustrating not having the resources to do the homeworks (the slides for that week weren't even published). ",

However, there were numerous lectures that either weren't completed or weren't even taught, which sometimes made it difficult to follow from week to week. Professor likes to have discussion, but the class size this year was too big for meaningful discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no strengths. It is purely garbage. We learn absolutely nothing, he changes his mind/the assignments constantly, he would only release the homework a day or two prior to the due date, the content on the exams did not at all match what we went over in class.

There was no tutorial sessions to teach how to solve problems or clarifying any doubts regarding lecture materials. I really want to systematically learn about clinical trials, whereas the lecture contents did not connect properly. The information was so scattered, all over the places. The homework was like a \"Let us Google it\" session, because many things were not mentioned in the lectures at all. I cannot say this is the course I enjoy most this semester. ",

I love how flexible this course is, considering that the homeworks are graded on completion and students can correct the answers by themselves. One weakness of this class is that sometimes the homework solutions have mistakes, making the learning process a little confusing, although the mistakes are always corrected several days later. It would be better if the TA or professor could double check the homesork solutions before uploading to canvas. ",
            "\u00a0This course was truly poorly designed and the material that students were assessed on was redundant and irrelevant in the larger scope of implementing skills to conduct clinical trials. The course could be improved with a more attentive TF, and a professor who presents material in a concise and comprehensive manner. The power point materials were virtually useless when reviewed outside of class, so perhaps the class lectures should be recorded. ",

I really did not like the textbook, the language was hard to understand, most of the time I used the web to get the answers that I wanted to learn.

There was no rigor in explaining why we used certain statistical tests. I really wanted to learn about clinical trials but I truly do not feel I learned much about that from this class. The class was so poor it made me question if YSPH was worth it. ",

            "\u00a0This course allowed me to practice and expand previous concepts that I learned in statistics classes at YSPH but did little to build on my knowledge base. Attending the lectures was not helpful to me in learning the concepts, doing the homework assignments, or studying for the exams. The powerpoints themselves were helpful in doing the homework and understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has a lot more potential and lectures could have been more lively/ lecture slides prepared more carefully. Lectures were not useful at all and many people stopped showing up after the first few classes. The lecture slides were also clearly recycled from past years with Chinese even left in one one of the lecture slide decks. While it seemed that Professor Makuch did not put a lot of effort into the course, he did seem to genuinely care for students and want us to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Quite honestly, I regret taking this course, despite having seen the poor reviews from previous years. At first, I was hopeful that it would be enriched with real-world experiences and stories from Dr. Makuch's extensive career in the pharmaceutical industry. However, a few stories he told had extremely offensive elements, such as referring to an investigator as \"the Egyptian guy with a skin condition\" who had been nicknamed \"Spot.\" Dr. Makuch then proceeded to refer to this investigator in the anecdote as \"Spot\" and described how he had committed fraud. Very disappointing. \r\n\r\nThe actual lectures were disorganized eye-sores. They did not always correlate to the textbook. There were two guest lectures as well. The first added zero value to the course but the second by Claude Petit was extremely well-delivered and interesting. \r\n\r\nThe work-load was extremely minimal because of the lack of organization. Theoretically, I could have spent 10 hours per week doing the assigned reading, but mid-way through the course, I was so de-motivated by the lack of proper teaching that I couldn't bring myself to keep up with readings. The exams were very easy and did not challenge us to critically think. ",

I imagine his teaching style would be better suited to a seminar setting. \r\nHe also didn't seem to care much about the logistics of teaching a large course. He did not even reserve rooms for the final exam so ended up making it a take-home final about a week out from the final. ",
