            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Prof. Xiang is a great teacher; she is helpful and nice. Also, you get to read a lot of great American literature. It was one of my favorite classes to come to. The workload is manageableon average, it took me about two hours to do the reading for each class. The most hectic it got was when we were reading Moby Dick and writing a paper at the same time (each reading of Moby Dick was about 80 pages, which, for me, came out to about 4 hours of reading per class). It was still manageable, though, and Moby Dick is so incredibly good that it was completely worth it. ",

            "\u00a0If looking into the English major, yes. It is a great survey of several important and interesting texts. The essays (specifically feedback) are a great learning experience and definitely a manageable workload. ",
