I wish we had gone over midterm questions like we did with the HWs instead of having a class on extra material because I would feel more confident in my understanding upon exiting the course.

However, I felt like there were a few students who asked excessive amount of questions, in a way that did not even further our learning. It seemed like the professor tried to limit those kinds of questions, but in the future, I hope classroom discussions are more thought-provoking.

Dr. Paltiel did give us fair warning about the set up at the beginning of the semester, saying that the course set up has mixed reviews, so I cannot hold it against him since the design was made clear from the start.  However, I benefit more from learning material THEN doing homework rather than learning how to do homework through readings then going back to learn about it.  I ended up having to go through all assignments fully twice for this reason, which wasted more of my time than was helpful to my learning.\r\n\r\nI also felt some exam questions were unfair.  For example, the final exam had questions that were very different from examples we did in class.  We never did an example in these units or that was fully mutually exclusive, and I struggled figuring this out on my own.  I feel as though the exams need to be based more directly on class material. ",

It was nice that the lectures were recorded so it was easy to access resources to do midterms and the final. The material was fun and interesting. The class overall was super fun and interesting. I learned so much about decision making and cost effectiveness analysis, and I thought these skills were helpful in the future. The homework was challenging, but since it was graded past/fail, there was less of a pressure on getting good grades than an effort to learn. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didn't like how late the lecture was. I also think more practice problems would be nice so that students have opportunities to master the skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course overall. The problem sets each week were very well constructed, and I genuinely felt that I was understanding the material. The material was challenging enough for me to think critically about the issues listed. Additionally, there was a good deal of variation in the context of each week's assignment. Some were infectious diseases related, some were orthopedics, and some were amusing scenarios. Overall, the assignments were enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is each session could be found in Media Library on Canvas. Since this course ends really late in a day, for most of the time I just take the online courses and seldom show up in the classroom. I haven't found a weakness yet, but one suggestion is that I really hope the standard solution of each case will be provided after the assignment submission. ",
            "\u00a0Great! ",
            "\u00a0I was not a fan of this course.  While I can acknowledge that Professor Paltiel is personally very supportive and engaging the course lacks a lot of structure.  For example, the class was taken by 120+ students but it only had two TFs who interchanged availability for a single office hour each week.  It's unfair to tell students they have office hours as an option for academic support but then expect 120 students to share a 60 minute time frame.  This strategy also creates an unfair workload for the TFs.  This class easily should have received 4-6 TFs like many of the core courses that also teach 100+ students.  Also, the first few weeks Dr. Paltiel didn't teach the material until after the homework was due.  If we're expected to teach ourselves the material via the readings in order to do the homework then what are students paying YSPH $60,000/year for?  Halfway through the course he changed this strategy and started teaching concepts before introducing them as homework but this should have been consistent all year long.  I also wish the class offered sections to practice the concepts like Microeconomics and Epidemiology.  Math heavy courses at YSPH should provide opportunities for more intimate learning beyond the auditorium lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Required students to think very critically, excellent professor, useful skill\r\nWeaknesses: Large class size, late class time, little feedback in regards to homework, tests returned back rather late\r\nImprovement: Address the weaknesses, perhaps try and fit in more skills (I felt like we really only learned one or two concepts as a whole.) ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this class! I think that this class was not only really great because it taught us the skills to run cost-effectiveness analyses on data that we encounter in the future but it was also really great at explaining what cost-effectiveness research is and how it relates to policy decisions today. I hadn't realized that some countries, e.g. the UK, use cost-effectiveness research to determine which drugs and treatments their national health service covers. The class was really great because it helped show us what small-scale changes could be made and large-scale policy changes could be made due to cost-effectiveness analyses. I also really appreciate that this class used primarily excel when teaching us how to do cost-effectiveness analyses because I think that makes it easier for us to learn the fundamentals and also to use other programming later when we have the foundations now. Overall, I really enjoyed this class and it taught me so many skills that I hope I'll be able to use even in the near future! ",

The exams were honestly pretty fun, and I always finished them feeling like they were good learning opportunities if nothing else.\r\n\r\nMy only recommendation would be to broaden examples to a global scale.

Often questions raised in the exams would ask us questions that were very different from what we learned in class or in assignments. More practice problems with answer keys to prepare would be helpful. Providing examples to cover the different ways calculations can be done would also be helpful. Also, the last 3 weeks of class didn't cover new material. I think it would have been better to spread out some of the concepts a little more over the 12 weeks, perhaps only having one midterm and one final so that we had time to practice and raise questions. By the time we got the first midterm back, the next one was due the following week, giving us one week to reach out to TF's or the professor with questions about the last one. ",

I could grasp a taste of cost-effective analysis learning. \r\nWhile the studying curve might be steeper in the last half of the courses, and we are not required to master some of the lessons. This may be a little bit discouraging. Also, I hope to increase our ability to make cost-effective analysis in real-world, so I would like to be involved in some real projects, instead of calculation in cases of our homework. Also, I would prefer to learn more about any software could support us to conduct a cost-effective analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Paltiel is a phenomenal lecturer. He makes the time fly and is engaging despite the large clsss size. The material became a bit more difficult in the later half of the semester and cases topics varied, keeping things interesting. The exams were all long but extremely fair. This was by far my favorite course of the semester. However, TFs did not play a large role in my learning. Working with others on weekly homework helped solidify my understanding of the content. ",
            "\u00a0The principles taught in this course are incredibly important, but the material was unapproachable at times and I felt that the expectations set for the course were confusing - this was most frustrating to me. \r\n\r\nI took this course on (as one of 6 classes) because I was so interested in the material - I was nervous, but comforted by the first class's reassurances that if you worked hard and put in effort you would get an HP. While this sort of held true on the homeworks (despite having to put in many many hours just to show you had tried!) the grading of the first exam was shocking. While partial credit was promised for explanations, explanations seemed ignored and it turned out that the reality was not as friendly as it was pitched. I get that it was a large class, and adjustments had to be made, and a high standard for coursework must be established, but this mismatch was distressing and for someone completely new to the material (although I am a second year!) it was paralyzing. Paired with an already busy semester and extremely limited office hours by the TAs for informal help (Fridays, in the afternoon - I had a conflict every single week, and was never surveyed about convenient times to hold office hours), this class was incredibly stressful and required a lot of effort to likely only receive a passing grade. I don't mean to be harsh, but I was surprised - I hope this feedback is helpful, and do believe that this is incredibly important subject material and that Prof Paltiel is a great educator! ",

They test us on concepts we learned in the lecture and in our homework. The homework assignments prepared me for the exam, and I liked that the exam focused on testing us on concepts we practiced in the homework assignments. I think the exams were graded fairly, and I liked that they gave us partial credit on our answers. Lastly, I liked that all the exams were take home. I wish the course was at a different time.

Also I sometimes found it difficult to find the continuity between lectures and the information presented. ",

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The amount of homework was exactly right. I have a relevant undergraduate degree, so it may have been easier for me than others. Still, I thought the amount of reading was no more and no less than what you needed to understand the important concepts. Some classes try to include so much that you end up not learning anything. This class did an excellent job of homing in on the most powerful concepts, and then making sure that they were presented clearly and reinforced regularly.\r\n-- Course materials were on Canvas in advance. Although they might be edited closer to the time of the class, they were useful for reference and for getting a head start on assignments in advance of particularly busy weeks. The PowerPoints were well-organized.\r\n-- Weekly homework assignments were relevant to the exams and helpful exercises.\r\n-- The content of the course was illuminating and wide-ranging.\r\n-- All classes at YSPH should be more like this class. It inspired me to think more about the questions raised in class.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- Weekly homework assignments should have been worth slightly more points, maybe 3 points each, to allow for incremental progress.\r\n-- The course could have included 1 in-class quiz worth 15% of the overall grade, instead of 2 take-home quizzes. Homework assignments could be treated as mini-take-home quizzes, and then a single in-class quiz can weed out people who would use CourseHero instead of actually understanding the material.\r\n-- To engage students with the material during class, set aside 5-10 minutes for students to work through simple questions in small groups, before sharing with the full class. This allows students to actively think through problems and then get immediate feedback from the professor on correct methods. The lectures were concise (which was great) so an added 5 minutes will be OK. ",

            "\u00a0This is a provoking course. I like the structure of the course which encouraged me to think more and more. I think the assessment was somewhat unfair. Midterms and Final took up 90 percent of the grade. For each exam, there were only several questions which worth a lot of points. But sometimes the questions were vague. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Professor Paltiel is clearly an expert in the field and has the knowledge to back it up. It's a fun class and the learning doesn't feel onerous. Additionally, I think it's among the most practical and useful classes for the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- not many other than the class was pretty big and sometimes we got bogged down into tedious questions. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the structure of the homework assignments and exams, in that there was less pressure to perform well within a constrained environment (exams were all take-home, assignments were graded based on effort).

            "\u00a0Strengths (so many)\r\n- The cases assigned as homework each week are actually directly relevant to what we learn in lecture and what is in the readings (which, by the way, are totally manageable)\r\n- The professor is a riot (in the best way possible) \r\n- The lectures are well-delivered and actually hilarious at multiple points\r\n- The content difficulty builds up at a comfortable pace\r\n- Take-home exams are very fair and reflective of the homework (cases)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n- The \"flex\" lecture left for the end of the semester is probably just better off decided by Prof. Paltiel instead of left to student suggestions.

            "\u00a0Overall, one of the strongest courses at YSPH. The take-home exams format worked out well.   Also, thank you for recording. It helped to go over lectures multiple times while taking the exams. \r\n\r\nAs for weakness, I did think that the first few homework assignments, which involved us struggling through content and then actually going through it during class, could be given some consideration. That is, could we do a similar problem during class and then have an associated problem set building on that? \r\nThat seemed to be how the later classes were run, but I most definitely appreciated going over the answers and problem-solving in class to help clarify and allow space for questions. To that end, I'm not sure what format is best. I was honestly surprised at how much I learned.  I wish that David taught a  Spring semester course to continue to expand and crystallize  this skill set. ",
