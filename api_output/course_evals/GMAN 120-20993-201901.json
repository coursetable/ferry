            "\u00a0German 120 really took me from having a basic understanding of the language after German 110 to really feeling confident that I've learned a lot of German this year. Specifically, I learned different tenses, how to write more complex sentences, rules for adjective agreement, but really I got a much better sense of how German sentences are laid out and I'm much more confident that I can really learn German. ",
            "\u00a0I continued my study of the German language and am now able to communicate basic expressions and formulations. After going to Germany for a few days, I was able to communicate with the locals, albeit at a basic level. ",
            "\u00a0The L2 German covers different topics such as German Culture, German Speaking Countries, Medicine and Illnesses, etc. Within these topics, we learned various grammatical structures and tenses: conditional sentences (1), subjunctives, present and past passive tense, future simple, past perfect, conjugations, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in German speaking, writing, and reading. ",

            "\u00a0The rhythm of the course is a bit relentless, but I think it really kept me on my toes and forced me to keep learning new things instead of becoming complacent. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, the work you put in is what you get out of it. Much like learning any language, learning German takes effort and dedication towards completing homework and participating in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the teaching quality of this course is extremely high. Professor Schenker is a very talented teacher, whose ability to explain is phenomenal. She is also an extremely passionate teacher, and her passion was clearly shared and then seen in many of my classmates throughout the course, including me. I think that all of the components of the course are very well designed, facilitating the learning of new grammar and vocabulary. Through various in-class activities as well as homework exercises, this course, under the instruction of Professor Schenker, immersed me in the German language, proving to be very beneficial and simply joyful. What I also enjoyed about Professor Schenker is that she is almost always very honest and direct about her expectations and attitudes, which is a very valuable quality that a lot of professors at Yale, unfortunately, don't share.   \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As I said, the overall quality of the course was fantastic, and I am very satisfied with all the learning aspects of the course. There are a few things that I would, however, like to point out. Firstly, I wish that certain details about the attendance and participation policy were more clarified at the beginning. I frankly think that it is a little bit insincere to state that students can take two absences and then suggest to use them in cases of sickness, when in fact those absences, like all absences, negatively impact the participation grade. Yes, two absences keep a student withing an A boundary, but those 5 points are usually crucial for the overall grade, given how high the boundaries are. Virtually all of the seminars I have taken or heard of had the two absence policy, which meant exactly what its name stands for: students can take 2 absences without any repercussions for their attendance grade. Another aspect I wish was communicated better but which also relates to the attendance policy is health issues. Again, I am convinced and want to believe that everyone else too, that absences due to the medical issues should not negatively impact the participation grade since that is something students have no agency over. If the German department believes that not all medical issues should be granted absences, they should consult health services to make specific regulations and rules and include them in the syllabus. On top of that, every student has a different medical context, and the very same common symptoms might mean different conditions and thus courses of action. Moreover, it should be considered that we all live in residences, where the outbreaks of viruses are very common. Sometimes it is much better to let students stay to cure the initial stage of their illness rather than forcing them to come (through the grade repercussions), and this way possibly infecting the entire classroom and making the recovery process for the ill students more difficult. It is always possible to ask the student, who missed the class due to health reasons, to do extra work to cover what he or she had missed.\r\n\r\nFinally, I would also like to consider the following situation, which might happen during the completion of the final project, as well as its implications for the grades: some students can't write the whole script together with other team members, so they finish their parts individually, and they often do so right before the deadline, making it impossible to collectively check all of the mistakes, which negatively influences the overall performance. To make such situations fairer, when such instances occur, I propose to evaluate scripts through two sets of criteria: one that relates to the overall cohesiveness, connection between parts, the overall idea, and another one that specifically relates to the language accuracy of a particular student. I, however, agree that it should be a general rule (clearly emphasized) that all parts of the script should be done together, but I would also like to ask to consider situations when it is not the case.

            "\u00a0Strengths include the material presented to and the teaching staff, while weaknesses include the video project which is fun but may not be too helpful for learning german. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is every day, which means that simply attending the class will bring you to a higher level of German knowledge than a less frequent class. ",
