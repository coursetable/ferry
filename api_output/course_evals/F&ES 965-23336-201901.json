            "\u00a0Deep understanding of social science theories that build upon the works of Foucault, which was enormously helpful for my thesis research and future work. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to critically analyze the structural context in which conservation initiatives and development interventions are implemented - why projects are framed the way they are, how solutions may lie in re-evaluating our structural objectives and goals, and how mistakes that lead to unnecessary human suffering and environmental degradation can be avoided ",
            "\u00a0The most valuable insight I gained was a deep understanding of the theory of Foucault and others that have built on his work. Additionally I gained skills in close reading, analysis and comparison. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, applying theory, understanding theory ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to delve deeply into the texts and authors that inform my field(s) of studypolitical ecology; environmental justice. I gained vocabulary and new approaches to analysis for environmental problems and social science research. I will continue to refer to this class in my future work. ",
            "\u00a0I reinforced the knowledge I gained by taking the first part of this course (social science of conservation and development).  It gave me many analytical tools to understand how ethnography is brought into dialogue with political ecology. \r\nI especially enjoyed discussions during class that attempted to relate the readings to real-world things. Although the examples were sometimes insufficiently related to grasp theoretical concepts, opening the door to discussion made the overall content more available "

            "\u00a0This class exceeded my expectations. One of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. It was one of the best classes Ive taken because we were able to have really deep discussions that delved into complex topics and really broke them down, and to apply our own research and work as well. ",
            "\u00a0It was clear to me from the beginning that the content was heavily based on Foucault's ideas, applied to environment and conservation. Although mastering Foucault's theories proved to be very useful, I felt somewhat the need for a more diverse set of readings, authors and situations. Otherwise, the course turns quickly into a \"monologue-critique\" of the environment, leaving little space to other perhaps more \"moderate\" critiques or stances. "

            "\u00a0Excellent syllabus, assignments, and discussion. The weakness is sometimes Dr. Carpenter's lectures are hard to follow, but this was improved by reading her book chapters beforehand instead of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the reading list and the insight and discussions it inspires. The depth of understanding how these texts apply to your own work is shaped by who is in the class and how they are engaging with the readings, which this year was very strong. ",
            "\u00a0Carol is good at making space for students to have productive conversations so that they really understand the material.  Lectures can be a little weak, too many personal digressions.  Students don't need to hear about her life so much ",
            "\u00a0The small size of this class is definitely a strength. We were able to have deep discussions and also become familiar with and give feedback on each others specific thesis work. \r\nA problem with the class is that Carol, our professor, has a tendency to personally call out students on very personal matters. For example, commenting repeatedly that one student was behind and suggesting he wouldnt be able to catch up, or making very personal comments about parenting to one student who was a father. Her comments were also often directed at the one international student or the one student of color in the class. For example, to the one student of color, she talked about how his eyes would not be bothered by sunlight the way the rest of our (white) eyes would be. To the international student, she kept assuming and stating publicly that he would not be understanding the readings because English is not his first language, even though it was obvious that he was keeping up and participating. All of this behavior is totally unacceptable. Unfortunately, many of the rest of us in the class would feel awkward and unsure of what to do when she said things like this. Sometimes I or another student would change the subject or, especially when she was criticizing the international student as she did often, I would try to say were all doing fine. It would be good if we as students were taught the skills to stand up to this kind of inappropriate treatment of our fellow students. ",
            "\u00a0Related to the question above...  Since the course is heavily centered on Foucault, then the need to use the course materials and ground them to an ongoing research can be somewhat constricting. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you are writing a thesis chapter that could benefit from diving into Foucault! ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to do all the readings. ",
            "\u00a0It's one of the only classes i have taken where the conversations were generative, often student-led.  Most FES classes  don't give you the space to really question underlying epistemologies of environmental work. ",
            "\u00a0Really consider who is taking the class with you. IF you like your fellow students and will be able to have good discussions with them, then it will be a good class. Carol is insightful and very smart, but also totally unfiltered. IF you are a student of color, you may not feel comfortable in her class because she will make personal comments about you. ",
            "\u00a0Make good use of  other spaces outside the classroom to polish your writing and welcome critique from other students. The professor's critique can be somewhat abstract and sometimes not too helpful "
