It was an incredibly valuable course for me. \r\n\r\nThe course also taught me a lot, as a first year, about the value of choosing courses based on the quality of the professor; I found professor Rand incredibly engaging and thought-provoking.

Problem Sets were a great way to apply this new knowledge. \r\nWeaknesses - I wish we incorporated more mathematical analysis into the topics presented in the second half of the course. As we were expected to do so in the final exam (meaning Professor Rand clearly intended for students to come away with the mathematical skills to analyze these topics), more instruction on how to do so would have been very helpful.

The reading was always relevant and laid a foundation for material being covered in the next class. Section always reviewed and solidified material I needed to know for the exam. Finally, although it was the hardest part of the class, the psets were the best resource for learning the material because it forced me to think and work with my classmates which, in turn, solidified it in my head.

            "\u00a0The course covers really interesting material, particularly in the second half. Being able to use theoretical frameworks in the real world - such as how cooperation could have led to religion - was really thought-provoking to consider. That being said, the course was a little more math and theory heavy in the first half than I had expected. I do think that the background was necessary, but I wish it had been more clear how much of the course would be arithmetic before we could apply it to everyday concepts. ",

I also think that the power points and video recordings of lectures were incredibly helpful for review and enabled me to engage more during class rather than freak out about not getting notes on every detail. I also found the exams to be very fair and interesting; they accurately tested our knowledge and allowed us to find new applications and interpretations of the theory we studied.\r\n\r\nI think one weakness was the lack of clarity in the requirements for reading responses. They were pretty free form and we weren't always informed as to which reading(s) we were to respond to. On that note, I found my TF to not always, or really ever, be that helpful. I mostly left more confused from section than anything. Sometimes he offered valuable counterpoints to the material presented in class which challenged me to rethink the validity of our study, but that was often done in pretty unprofessional ways. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the concepts and the material, but I did not like the way the class was organized and taught. The math was oversimplified to the point of not making sense, and it was incredibly frustrating. The class either needs to be more focused on the mathematical concepts so that they can actually be taught and understood, or it just needs to focus on the psychological applications and ignore the math all together.

            "\u00a0The research didn't always seem very credible just because the field was so new. I also wished that there were more cohesive readings or resources outside the powerpoint slides. Section also wasn't very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Rand is an incredible professor. He knows so much about the field and seems to have an honest faith in what he studies. The TA's were also super supportive and knowledgable, and the class was the perfect size to balance small-scale learning and lecture-style teaching. \r\nWeaknesses: I found the mismatch between pset and exam difficulty to be a little frustrating sometimes. While the psets were pretty straightforward, the exams asked us to synthesize and stretch our skills in ways that we didn't have practice with. I think it's reasonable to make exams more a matter of synthesis than psets, but at the very least I wish the exams were realistically finish-able. ",

It's not as much of an evolutionary psych/bio class as I as expecting -- instead, it focuses almost exclusively on game theory topics -- but I found this interesting as well, and a solid introduction to the basic concepts of game theory. If you've ever taken another game theory class, you won't enjoy this class, but if you just want to get your feet wet, definitely give this a shot. Low workload combined with interesting and easy-to-grasp concepts make this a great fifth credit or SO distributional requirement. ",

However, students should know that math will be involved - nothing extensive, but students should know what they are signing up for. Professor Rand is clearly an expert, and he always brings in new research - often work that he has contributed to - and is also an engaging lecturer, keeping every class interesting. ",
