            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of manuscript and book history with regards to the early modern period, greater insight into the various types of works that dominated colonial Latin American literature, and more finely honed close reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0Enrolling in Professor Adornos Polemics of Possession class truly developed my academic perception towards the multifaceted and complex matrices of religious, sociocultural, political, and even scientific frameworks and concepts utilized by many authors of colonial Latin American literature. ",
            "\u00a0Developed understanding and practice of how to read closely in Spanish and interpret Spanish texts, developed critical thinking skills, developed Spanish oral presentation skills, developed understanding of history and fundamental texts of the early Spanish American Narrative. Developed ability to think from the perspective of the instructor in planning how to design a course, that is improved ability to discern which parts of the text are most central or important to the overall meaning. Improved ability to compare author perspectives between texts and to place each text in greater historical perspective. Improved understanding of the disputes and differing perspectives of Spanish sovereignty, how these disputes have impacted the history of the region and enduring traditions, and how these disputes reflect timeless dynamics of culture conflict and possession. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good understanding of the most important examples early Spanish American narrative. I learned the most about the technology of manuscripts and printed books. "

            "\u00a0The great strength of the course was the privilege of having the course in the Beinecke, which allowed us access to primary sources. I also think that the presentations on the books were another strength of the course. I also appreciated the final project, which involved course design, something we are not often called upon to do, but that will be essential to our careers as academics moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0The diversity of the works read and analyzed in class-from Carta de Coln to Sor Juana Ins de la Cruz epistle-showcased the great variety and development within colonial Latin American literature, while simultaneously indicating the fundamental characteristics shared among these works and analyzed in numerous manners. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible! It was an absolute privilege to study in the Beinecke each week, and an even greater privilege to see so many early print versions of the historical texts we were studying. I thoroughly enjoyed the balance between the student presentations and the time Professor Adorno spent providing her own insight. If this course were an undergraduate course it could perhaps have been improved to incorporate more activities to engage students in class, but as it was a graduate course I think the looser, presentation based structure was very effective.

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to other students because it offers an excellent survey of canonical texts from the period, as well as the opportunity to engage with primary sources, given that it takes place in the Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would most definitely recommend this course to my colleagues, since they would be able to acquire a unique, interdisciplinary and intercultural understanding about Colonial Latin American literature. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if they are relatively strong with reading Spanish and/or if they have a real interest in early Spanish American history and literature. Professor Adorno is incredible--very intelligent, kind, and understanding. Creates the type of learning environment to help anyone and everyone thrive as a student. If you are moderately interested in the reading list for this course I would encourage you to at least shop the first class to see what the environment is like. ",
