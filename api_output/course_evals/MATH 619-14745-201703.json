            "\u00a0Algebraic geometry is a brilliant subject.  My least favorite thing about the subject is the huge number of separation axioms involved.  I really don't know the difference between \"quasi-finite\" and \"finite type\" and so forth -- these are like the subtle differences one encounters in point set topology (T3, T3.5, Lindelof, etc.), but more abstract.  This has the consequence that I am not sure what sort of hypotheses I should expect.  Most of the time thinking about examples or the core theory, I spent thinking about projective varieties over an algebraically closed field.  These happen to be the only examples that I tend to encounter when I tried reading other books.  The homework questions that I found difficult seemed to concern the behavior of these separation axioms.  In this class, this part of the theory does not feel motivated yet, while aspects of cohomology and more \"specialized\" topics like algebraic groups and algebraic curves feel more natural. "
