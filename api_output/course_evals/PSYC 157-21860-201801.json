Professor Santos made this class unlike any other class and created a class so revolutionary that I truly think everyone at Yale should be forced to take this class because of how little value can be placed on mental health here at Yale.

I learned about the different ways that my mind sucks and how reference points, hedonic adaptation, and poor affective forecasting can be obstacles to happiness. I learned about how expressing gratitude, meditation, social connection, savoring, benefit finding, sleep, exercise, time affluence, and negative visualization can help me find happiness.\r\n\r\nThe top three insights from this course were that: \r\n1) Time affluence is incredibly powerful and important. The day that Professor Santos gave us an hour of free time was a powerful way to teach the impact of time affluence. The impact of that hour stuck with me and changed how I view the importance of my time, especially in terms of travel.\r\n\r\n2) Happiness is intentional. I consider myself to be a pretty happy person in general and I already used a lot of the strategies and information from this course in my day to day life because that's how I had been raised. But seeing all of these strategies laid out and consciously calling upon them when I was feeling down or upset worked better than I had thought it would. After taking this course, I'm more likely to trace my positive attitude to some great social connection that I just had or attempt some savoring/gratitude when I'm feeling overwhelmed or exhausted. \r\n\r\n3) My phone affects me more than I had realized. Professor Santos mentioned some things about how notifications can decrease enjoyment, how phones steal bottom up attention, and how just the presence of a phone can cause concentration to deteriorate. I started to notice that my phone was doing exactly that. Just seeing my phone on the table while I was trying to write a paper made it more difficult to focus on the paper rather than the possible notifications that I could be getting. Learning about how phones can affect day to day life prompted me to make some changes in my own phone usage patterns.\r\n\r\nAlso a skill! I gained a very clear cut strategy to break habits and strive for goals that I'm excited to try out even more over the summer. ",

Not necessarily grades, but I think I would have engaged more with the rewirements (which I believe are the most important part of the course) if I was held more accountable for them. I think that using the app Prof. Santos mentioned at first would be very good at encouraging more students to do the rewirements. The quizzes and midterm did a good job of testing whether we were learning the psychology science content, but a big part of the draw to the class were the rewirements and potential for self-improvement. Those I did completely really did have an impact on my emotional well-being, but some weeks I slipped into a mindset of ignoring them because it didn't matter to anyone besides myself if I did them.

Sometimes, we were told something caused a \"huge difference\" in happiness or another metric, and it appeared so on a graph, but a closer look showed only a tiny bump and a misleading scale. Overall, the professor seemed unwilling to engage, at least in class, with the barely statistically significant or less than overwhelming evidence she presented as unambiguous. ",

            "\u00a0At a place like Yale, it was very important for Professor Santos to dispel the myths about what actually makes us happy. To then move on to how our brain messes us up and what we can do to not be led astray logically made sense. When talking about how to put new practices into place, the guest lecturers were truly an added bonus. Tamar Gendler's lecture was especially exceptional. \r\n\r\nIt was also impressive to learn the national and international impact of the course in the last lecture. Professor Santos exceeded her goals for the course.\r\n\r\nAttendance faltered late, which was disappointing.

It's also over an interesting topic, and is a well-organized course. She puts all the lecture notes and slides online, and the problem sets are straightforward.\r\n\r\nI think a weakness of the course is that there's too much of an incentive for many students to not come to class. On one hand, the material isn't really in depth, and after the midterm you can do well in the class just by reading the lecture notes and not going to lecture, which defeats the point of the class entirely. There also wasn't any equalizing of grades across TFs. Some of us had psychology TFs, while others had ones from the Forestry school. While grades don't matter according to Professor Santos, some justice across grading would've been nice. ",
            "\u00a0kinda boring ",
            "\u00a0This course had many strengths. It was taught well, and by that I mean it was extremely well-organized, the expectations and aims were very clear, and students were given copious resources to enhance their learning. The teacher genuinely wanted the students to learn and constructed the curriculum and the lesson plans to maximize student learning.  The powerpoint presentations were exceptional. The engagement and accessibility of TFs was also very impressive. It handled the many challenges of an enormous class very well.  On the other hand, this course had many weaknesses.  For one, the professor seemed to have entered the class with personal aims that were not academically oriented.  This class was designed to change the behavior and beliefs of students from position X to position Y.  In general, I believe that is not an effective intellectual tool; other classes examine position X to ask, what is a better position? What is flawed about this position? What is good about it? How should it be changed or improved? This class did not encourage students to ask better questions or try to discover their own new ways of thinking or being. Instead, the teacher \"coached\" us, instructing us to act a certain way, and behave a certain way, because this way, she was certain, would make us \"happier.\" And according to science's definition of happiness, I suppose she is right. But I was hoping this class would present scientific data about strategies that improve aspects of the human condition, and then ask us more seriously what it means to be happy or lead a fulfilling life.  This class was essentially a \"how-to\" manual about improving your positive mood. But as some of our class readings pointed out, a \"good life\" is not merely being in a \"good mood.\" Rather, a good life is a meaningful life. In this class, we rarely discussed how to increase meaning in our lives. We talked little about how to handle setbacks.  And frankly, we were unrealistic about how to implement strategies for happiness in an effective way. Additionally, I did not feel as though I walked away with a great deal more knowledge or understanding. A classmate of mine described this class as, \"everything my mom has been telling me my whole life, plus some science.\" I agree. I can't recall feeling surprised by anything we learned in class. Finally, the strategies that we learned about, if not surprising, certainly should have been useful to students. But the gap between knowing what we should do and actually doing that (while acknowledged repeatedly), was not addressed. For our final project, we were told simply, \"to do it.\" This theme appeared many times. We were told simply to stop caring about our grades. Look, we were told, these studies show that good grades correlate with lower happiness. And yet, the professor lecturing to us about lowering our standards for academic success would not have the opportunity to lecture, would not be standing on stage, would not hold her position as a prominent researcher, professor, and beloved head of college, if she had not gotten \"good grades\" when she attended Harvard. Maybe Laurie Santos did not get good grades in college. But then we should know that! More importantly, I do not believe that we must lower our personal standards of success to be happyand this was not addressed. There was little discussion about nuanced ideas and frustrations like this in the class. ",

At the same time, most of the kids didn't come after the midterm and many who did didn't pay attention which was distracting to me.

I really do think that it this class had a lot of pertinent and interesting things that can help college students live happier lives. I took it with my friends and we often brought up lessons from the class in our daily lives. However, I do know that among some populations in the class engagement was fairly low. I think for me the biggest issue was that sometimes the material felt so dumbed down to reach all the students that I was bored. To use a lesson from the class about flow, I felt like we were in that bottom quadrant where the effort is low and so you're not engaged. Trust your students to get it. I'm a humanities major and the science still interested me :) ",

Yes, it did increase my happiness and decrease my stress, but that is because I needed to take an extra class and this required such little work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I honestly feel bad saying this, but I'm not sure this was the best way to spend my time/money at Yale. I understand the goal of the course (and I support it), but with such little accountability for learning, attending, and \"rewiring\", this class required little effort and didn't teach me much. On another note, as a statistics major, I really wasn't convinced by a lot of the evidence that was shared in lectures from different studies. Providing bar charts with small y-axis ranges to make the effects of change look huge wasn't very convincing to me without more information on statistical significance, and I would have liked to hear more about other confounding variables in each study. Yes, we could have read every study to find this information on our own, but focusing on less studies in lecture and going more in depth for each of those studies would have helped. I stayed skeptical throughout the course, and it is kind of scary to me that a lot of students just accepted what was being said without asking for more explanation or doing more research. ",

The homework assignments, or \"rewirements,\" were extremely interesting to students. The weaknesses of this course included that near the end, the material seemed a little repetitive. Also, because there were so many students in the class, it was sometimes difficult to get feedback on how to improve things like our final essay. ",

I did think that a strength was that it was structured like a traditional psychology course, although sometimes it felt disorganized or repetitive. I thought one weakness was the final paper - a lot of it was designing an experiment, but I felt like we barely talked about the structure of experiments at all throughout the course, even though we covered a lot of experiments. I didn't feel like it adequately assessed what we learned in the class. ",

I think the class was very ambitious in wanting to make a really change in our community and the culture on campus (but also more generally in the world). However, I think a lot of people took the class because they thought it would be easy and not require a lot of work. This attitude was somewhat contagious and kinda ruined the vibe for those of us who actually wanted to be present and learn. This is not a critique of the class but of the behavior of many students who affected my experience in the class. ",

I'm amazed that she pulled off teaching such a large and logistically complicated course. \r\n\r\nI guess one thing I noticed is that the course was pretty slow-moving. I feel like we heard a lot of repeat material things that seem pretty intuitive to me were reiterated many, many times (e.g. money doesn't make you happy, social connection does). I would have loved a little more material packed in. I also feel that the course was a little skewed to a certain population. My background is in clinical psychology pertaining to trauma, and so I have spent my adult life working with populations exposed to life-threatening experiences and conditions of deprivation and threat. I wish there had been more focus on how principles of positive psychology can be applied in situations where someone is experiencing adverse life experiences or their aftermath. Perhaps because of my own background, I felt sometimes like the course wasn't geared for \"people like me\" or like the groups I'll spend my life working with. We touched a little on that, like with the studies on affect among death row inmates and patients with terminal illnesses. But part of me would want to take an entire follow-up course trying to marry these two seemingly disparate fields of clinical psych and positive psych! ",
            "\u00a0It got a bit too popular for its own good. It attracted people who abused it for the credit, and needed to be held down. But on the other hand, it really helped some people out like me and encouraged healthy habits to be developed. ",

            "\u00a0The professor and course material were incredible. I wouldnt change a thing about professor Santos teaching or the material that she presented. A major strength of the course was the idea that professor Santos practiced what she preached. We learned the grades dont matter,  and so Professor Santos made sure that we werent stressing about our grades. There was no final and we were able to drop our two worst quiz grades out of five. Unfortunately, students found a way to hack the course, and use Professor Santos willingness and understanding to their advantage. Many students received perfect scores on the first three quizzes and did well on the midterm. Because of this there was no incentive to go to class after the midterm, because they were not going to be assessed on the material. This just goes to show that some students were in it for the grade rather than understanding, which really goes against the idea of the course. If anything, it proves that we have a lot of work to do. ",

I feel as though a section would have been nice for this class, because the material was extremely engaging (but there was a lot of it!). The TF's also put a lot of effort into the course, so it would have been great to get to know them in a smaller section setting, instead of a 10-15 minute window during office hours. \r\n2. After the midterm, attendance to the class was extremely low. I'm assuming this is because learning the content did not matter for a grade (some habits are hard to break D: ), so many people didn't bother showing up. It was also quite sad to see a mad dash of people leaving Woolsey after a quiz because they did not want to hear the rest of the lecture. If this class was to be taught next time, making a section where attendance is required may also increase the attendance rates towards the lecture, as students who go to lecture will better understand the section//can participate more.

Id have loved a more thorough exploration of what these terms all mean and how they can be applied to the course. How can happiness, for example, be different in the short term versus the long term?

The fact that the end of every quiz created a mass exodus of students, and that easy extra credit \"bribes\" had to be used to get people to show up even for those, means there's a problem.

The class was enjoyable,HOC Santos, was a great lecturer, and I did learn for sure though. It did provide me with perspective on some of the actions I am currently taking. Certainly helpful. ",

So much so that I often checked out when we had a guest lecture, they let down the momentum of the class a bit and were often less interesting. The science of happiness is such a cool topic and I felt like we hit the main topics and research available.

But as the course progressed, I feel like all the attention that the class got really got to her head. She spent a lot of time hyping herself up (she spent over 20 minutes of the last lecture talking about all the companies and conferences she had been invited to attend because of the class). I feel like the initial success of the class made it complacent (the class was moved to Woolsey Hall in order to accommodate the number of students, but by the end of the semester, I think <100 (<10%) of the class showed up. I wish there was more to the content than just: here is a psych phenomenon + here is the study to prove* it. \r\n\r\n* I feel like Prof. Santos bent a lot of the studies in order to fit her agenda. For example, sometimes a study would demonstrate a 5% increase in a variable and she would say, \"see, it increases so much!\" Other times, with a 15% increase in a variable in another study, she would say, \"yeah so it didn't really have much of an effect at all.\" If you actually read the papers she cites, the point she derives from them are often tenuous and not the main point of the paper at all.\r\n\r\nThe true strength of the class is the fact that it considers people to think about happiness at a place like Yale, in which success / hard work is idolized and personal happiness is readily-sacrificed. Some of the psych tips were pretty meaningful (the mindfulness segment), but other tips were pretty empty (just sleep more!! - I think many people would sleep more if they could). ",

            "\u00a0The idea of the course, and the intention behind it, were good. Important, even. I admire the effort to change such a pernicious part of the culture of Yale (prioritizing success over happiness, etc. etc.). I also really appreciated Prof. Santos's lecturing style, kindness and humor throughout the course, as well as her willingness to adapt the course schedule and structure along the way according to the feedback of students. The guest lectures were also really interesting.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, I felt that the course was seriously lacking in its ability to engage students (crazy, I know, considering 1,200 people took the class). The lectures frequently repeated themselves, and what bugged me the most was that instead of talking about one or two studies in depth, including some of the more controversial or interesting/complex aspects of the studies (for example, are the studies disputed [which many are, not that we spoke about that]; is there any evidence for causation rather than just correlation; etc.), Prof. Santos would move VERY QUICKLY through about 7 or 8 studies all showing the same thing; it was much less interesting than it could have been. Furthermore, at times it felt a little bit like an advice seminar, a series of twenty tips that were admittedly meaningful and important to hear, but could have been conveyed in a single lesson or two. It also felt as though Prof. Santos was too dismissive of the other side of the issue: small correlations between wealth and happiness were dismissed as \"meaningless,\" whereas even smaller correlations between faith and happiness were treated as \"small but really important.\" I'm sure there was legitimate reasoning behind this, but it was never explained, and overall it just added to my skepticism (which is unfortunate because I was trying really hard to engage with the material and be open minded!). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: nice syllabus, interesting readings, Professor Santos is great\r\nWeaknesses: way too many quizzes and assessments (especially for a class that allegedly prides itself on not being grade-driven), repetitive lectures, guest speakers were not always relevant, TAs were awful (grades were not standardized, which is understandable given the size of the class) ",

            "\u00a0This course was successful in that it made me more amenable to strategies that claimed to improve subjective well-being. The synthesis of Professor Santos's impassioned lectures with hard evidence from our readings convinced me that my mental health was not monolithic and could in fact be changed for the better (with meaningful effort of course). In terms of improvements, the sheer size of this course made inevitably made it more impersonal, and the somewhat unusual campus attitude towards the class made it hard to engage in serious conversations about the class content. I also began to feel that the course became more reptitive towards the end of the semester, and while there is good reason for that, the initial intrigue towards obstacles to well-being faded as it was continually boiled down to the same set of quirks of the mind.

She faced an incredible challenge (teaching a course to over 1200 students), and handled it incredibly well. I also thought the lectures and assignments were a strength of the class, they were well-thought out and felt very purposeful. \r\n\r\nI thought the only weakness of the class is that it sometimes felt like it was trying to accomplish too much.

The lectures were always interesting and I was never bored. I appreciated that the slides weren't too impacted with information, because it not only put the focus on the actual material but kept me liable for ensuring I was listening during the entire lecture. Overall, I think the class was life changing and necessary; however, others would be skeptical saying there were \"too little assignments to remain engaged\" but I would say FALSE because much of the assignments were dependent on the individual putting in effort outside of the course and not necessarily for a grade, and even the assignments that were graded required you to do weekly reading an problem sets.

Prof Santos could have presented meaningful discussions on the concept of happiness, why we pursuit it, and whether we should pursue it at all. Instead, she presented laundry lists of studies to back up superficially explained psychological phenomena, without even examining caveats or problems with the studies. Further, the pedagogy was terrible. Lectures were repetitive and badly organized, particularly in the first months of the class. The assessments involved useless rote-learning, rather than critical thinking (except for the final project, which was useful). Finally, because she only explored concepts superficially, she often mentioned highly problematic concepts/studies without mentioning their troubling implications. For example, after repeatedly telling us to pursue careers that make us happy/passionate (I.e. not finance), she told us that $75,000 was the base income threshold for happiness. Considering that most non-finance careers (non-profit, creative) have salaries under $75,000, this was a ridiculous study to bring up without exploring its implications. Rather than discussing the real meaning of this study or how we should reconcile it with other things she had taught us, she made the HIGHLY problematic claim that we shouldn't worry about this threshold because the median Yale income is $76,000. Come on, Laurie--you're a psych professor, you should know what median means. Half the people in this room DON'T have families that earn $76,000, and were sitting there feeling terrible. This is just one of the many problematic concepts she mentioned without exploring nuances (e.g. When she brought up the highly controversial Broken Windows Theory). ",

However, the course would benefit from a more intersectional approach to achieving a \"good life.\" Identity is an undercurrent to inequitable stress and hardship - race, class, gender, etc are also likely variables that disrupt the correlations discussed in class. It is simplistic and inaccurate to homogenize outcomes as the course did this year. ",

Finally, the final project could use some tweaking- I think the way it was this semester tried to bridge the gap between personal and scientific, but that is difficult to do. I think it would be better to either make it very scientific or very personal. ",

I also wish there was actual feedback on the final project, since it would have been nice to learn how I could improve my intervention as I continue doing it. The lack of feedback other than a grade seems somewhat antithetical to the course's philosophy that grades don't matter and school should be about learning. ",

I think that as an academic class, PSYC 157 was not rigorous. I didn't learn a lot about psychology, or improve most of my academic skills as a result of practice in the class. But I think that's finethat wasn't the point of the class. As an opportunity to learn and practice strategies for self-improvement and individual happiness, I think that the class was very well designed. The Rewirements provided a great opportunity to try out happiness strategies, and the final project was a really good chance to implement a strategy more intensely. ",

I really feel this class has made me a better friend, son, and citizen. Could not understate how grateful I am for the opportunity to have taken this gem of a class.\r\n\r\nMy only critique would be that there was constant review of concepts to the point that it became overbearing. I understand review helps people remember the material, but it really got out of hand when about 30% of each lecture was just a recap of the previous lecture. ",

That might help make it more personal and hold people accountable as well, find a way to get legal approval for the Rewi app. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its existence. By creating this course, issues were brought to light and to conversation that otherwise would have been ignored. Mental health on campus was discussed a great deal more, and people leaving the class were forced to converse about their thoughts on happiness, self-improvement, the quality of the course, and their own thoughts/beliefs. Professor Santos is a great lecturer in terms of her passion with the material and actual lecture slides. The final paper/project was interesting and a great way to get to engage with the material in real life and actually get to put into practice the ideas we had learned. The retirements similarly were, but the final paper was more interesting because we actually analyzed the data. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think that there were many problems with the structure of the course. One problem was that the course was incredibly easy, to a fault. Professor Santos discussed in class an experiment in which students were given problems (easy or hard) and were either graded or not graded. The students that weren't graded gravitated towards the challenging problems because they enjoyed being intellectually challenged naturally, and this diminished when they were graded. What I took from this was that students naturally enjoy being challenged. I felt that Professor Santos' course contained almost no challenge. I would have gained SO much more from a course in which my mind was stretched intellectually. I'm not sure whether the intention was to make an easy course to \"relieve stress\" (which contradicts her point about finding flow by doing activities that use a person's strength and challenge their ideas and conceptions), or to get more people exposed to this material (a valiant idea and goal, yet ultimately unsuccessful as very few people showed up to the lecture as the class progressed). I think this course would have benefited from more challenge and structure. The quizzes were rote memorization, and there were few other assignments. I also feel as though we were treated as though we had less intellectual capacity than we do. For example, she never explained the psych statistics (to the point that sometimes she would mention a correlation of .2 as significant, while sometimes she would mention a difference of .2 (for example 5 and 5.2) as an insignificant difference. Simply taking the time one day to explain why those values were significant vs. insignificant would have clarified the class and made the material more interesting. Additionally, SO much of the material was repeated over and over again lecture by lecture. I wish she would have trusted us to hear the material or go over it, and instead gone deeper into the material rather than repeat it so often. I think the reason she repeated material so much was that a lot of the material contradicted (as we discussed) the intuition or lies our brains feed us, but I don't think repeating it to the point of boredom was the way to allow us to hear the material more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging ",
            "\u00a0This class was great in the sense that Professor Laurie Santos started much-needed conversations about wellness around campus. However, it was far too easy. The repetitive structure of every single lecture made the class very boring, and if we had gone more in depth into some of these psych topics I feel as though the class would have been far more engaging. In addition, there were some very broad generalizations about happiness that were made. I would have appreciated if some counterarguments were discussed in lecture as well. For example, one of Professor Santos' biggest points was that grades don't matter. However, if you are pre-law or pre-med, they certainly do! Navigating contradictions such as these would have made the class seem more real. ",
            "\u00a0I liked it as is. I think more could have been done to make people pay more attention/show up more after the midterm, but the nature of the course is that it's about personal choices and not grades/expectations, so I think it's fine even if nothing is changed. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the content, the energy of the class, laurie santos lecturing, the rewirements were really meaningful, the fact that i actually genuinely put a lot of these skills into my life practice and feel better. this class changed the way i think about a lot of things: biggest takeaways were deleting/limiting social media, actively practicing gratitude and exerting kindness consciously, and sleeping more. this class was once in a lifetime and i'm really grateful yale cares about wellness. the last class made me really emotional because this class was important to me as i went thru a really rough time this semester. it was everything i needed at this point in my life and genuinely has changed the way i think about lots of things.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some of the later lectures were more boring after the midterm maybe bc i'm a psyc major and knew about habit formation and other things like that. there was one time prof santos gave a trigger warning for sexual assault and i appreciated that but i couldn't really leave at that point in front of all those people so it would have been nice to get that in an email beforehand so i could get a seat further back. not a reflection on her tho and i appreciated the warning. i didn't like how ppl didn't take this class seriously because i really did and got a lot out of it. maybe a way to hold ppl accountable for rewirements would have been nice. sometimes lectures seemed redundant with rephrasing, tho it was helpful. logistics at start of class were often lengthy (like duh, it's a 1k+ sized class) but that's not super avoidable ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- super accessible, lectures were very engaging and fun! Readings were good. Laurie Santos is amazing. This class helped me take a step back and get a big picture view of what is important in my life. I got a lot out of the course, but it was not too much work. \r\n\r\nI think this course would have been better if were smaller, but then fewer people would have the chance to take it, so I say keep it how it is. I also think that the class was a touch to culty. Professor Santos sometimes made broad sweeping claims (well-intentioned, obviously) that were sometimes designed to poke and prod. Sometimes, certain subtleties were lost (for example, \"Grades don't matter\" is different from saying \"Grades do not have as great an effect on one's happiness as we might predict\"). I understand what Prof Santos is trying to do, but in some ways I would have preferred more clean cut facts  as opposed to a mantra. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the weakness of this course was the sheer amount of students that were admitted into the class. It somewhat decreased the ability of gaining a more one-on-one interaction, which made it difficult to pose specific questions in regard to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Kind of repetitive. Grading did not feel fair. The midterms were graded confusingly. For a short response question worth 6 points, you could get 4 points off for something very arbitrary. On certain free response questions, it was a guessing game as to exactly they were looking for. There was no rubric for the final paper, and even when I followed all the instructions, went above and beyond on them, and got a good proposal grade, I did not get the good grade I expected on the essay. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great when viewed from space (or through the international news media) but on a weekly basis it felt quite slow and low-impact. I think it was because the topics covered were just so obviousit felt like we were being read aloud a self-help book. Laurie Santos is a world-class lecturer and she kept her thousand students engaged through studio-quality visuals and her magnetic personality, but the content could not match the performance. The course was very low workload, which meant it didn't have the steel core of real assignments and deadlines to stave off the incursion by other courses. When the semester heats up and other courses demand more, they expand to fill the space that should be occupied by this one. I couldn't justify compromising my \"real\" classes for this one, and once I fell off the train (skipping lectures, not doing rewirements), I just felt guilty and frustrated and didn't want to get back on. Obviously this course is trying to be the antidote to that feeling of being helplessly driven by your academic obligations, but the structure of Yale demands that courses either drive just as hard or be de-prioritized. As much as you hate grades, the only way to get people to actually do the rewirements in this cut-corners-or-die environment would be to collect and grade them. ",

            "\u00a0This class covered a lot of material very efficiently and effectively. The topics for the course were not ones that are covered in many other classes, making it a truly unique course offering at Yale. In addition, the material was of such a nature that it was immediately practically applicable to the students' lives, and inspired considerable personal growth. It was well taught in such a way that the information was engaging, clear, and easy to understand and remember.\r\n\r\nIt would have been helpful to have had the opportunity to have someone associated with the course look over drafts of the final paper.

My favorite exercise was the gratuity exercise, which actually brought a lot of happiness into my life and the person I sent the letter to.

By the end of the course, I felt that the things we were learning were intuitive, and so I fell into the trap of not going to class and taking this as a gut. Regardless, I had a lot of fun with my friends taking the class, and the final project really did push me to do my best to exercise and increase my social connections, which were especially rewarding during the last few weeks of my senior year at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Good points:\r\nThe course does make a lot of good points about what things do and don't matter in pursuing a happy/meaningful life, and it provides some helpful tools for understanding how our minds work and how we can motivate ourselves towards our goals. Some of the psychological biases talked about in the course also figure heavily in fields such as behavioral economics. The course does a lot to highlight how resilient people are to the disappointments of life. Most, if not all, of the major takeaways of the course are already expounded upon in religion, philosophy, literature, and common wisdom (ex: \"Money doesn't make you happy\"), which is good because there are major issues in how the science is presented in this course. I think one great thing that the course did though was make me more grateful about life, and I do believe the gratefulness topic made a difference in the lives of many students.\r\n\r\nBad points:\r\nProfessor Santos had very good intentions in creating this course, but honestly, I trust the integrity of psychology as a science less after taking this course. The findings and takeaways from the studies, though I am sure she had very good reasons for selecting the studies that she did, often were not presented in a robust, scientific manner, but unless you were someone who knew how to read scientific papers and who knew how statistics can be manipulated, this might have not been apparent. She only started putting the p values showing the significance (or not) of differences between experimental and control groups some way into the course, perhaps after people brought up the issue at office hours. The use of r values to show correlations is misleading--adding or subtracting variables will affect how large a correlation is found. Moreover, I found it troubling that some of the takeaways seemed to be presented in a way that does not account for very important nuances, with the biggest example being the \"psychological immune system\" topic; while it's great that in general people do not stay sad about their failures for as long as they think they will, too much indulgence in this frame of mind can lead to a dangerous complacency and not to mention years of regret (if there is a \"psychological immune system\", then \"psychological autoimmune diseases\" should also have been a topic). Another iteration of this course should look at how factors such as intent affect the results of the study. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing!  Only complaints were some grading seemed strangely nitpicky. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in that it addressed a part of psychology that has never really been talked about before in a Yale course. I also think the addition of guest speakers strengthened this course. The lectures were fun and engaging as wel. I think the greatest weakness was actually the size of the course because with so many students, it made it difficult to have one on one relationships between the student and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The rewirements are definitely the central strength of the course. They are enjoyable and, if you do them, allow you to get so much more out of the class. It could maybe be made a little more clear how involved the final project is meant to be. For instance, it is a bit unclear whether you are you supposed to analyze your data using statistics or in a less rigorous manner. But I enjoyed the final project as well and found the assignment overall to be a strength of the course! Lectures were fun, but less repetition might improve the course and make it flow faster. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Santos is an amazing lecturer, felt like a TedTalk during her lessons\r\nWeaknesses- sometimes hard to be motivated to do rewirements when there was not a lot of accountability ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include the attempt to reduce pressure on the students in order for them to be more successful. I liked the set up of each lecture however I felt like the classes were too long or the amount of material covered was not enough. "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend the class! I have come away with a compilation of really incredible readings of all kinds, hearing from some of the leaders and trailblazers in the field of psychology and a set of actionable steps I can take towards making myself happier. The class in and of itself doesn't do that for you. But it gives you all the tools to do so yourself. If you implement them, if you put in the effort to change your behaviors, I think it can help; you can help yourself. And it really is not easy! I did probably about half of the rewirements, but those I did were a really good challenge. ",

Especially if you're young, the strategies from Psychology and the Good Life could flip your time at Yale on its head.\r\n\r\nThe last thing you should worry about in this class is grading. The quizzes were easy if you do the optional problem sets. The final project is a fun challenge that's not hard to write up. ",

            "\u00a0In some ways, I am so glad I took this course. I am incredibly grateful to the people who helped make this course possible, from the people who work in the incredibly beautiful facilities of Woolsey and Battell to the QUEEN Laurie Santos herself, in addition to the administrators and the TFs, and all of the tech people who helped with broadcasting, the students and professionals who helped develop the app and online lectures... and many more behind-the-scenes people!!! I think this course has changed my behavior. I am better at recognizing the real source of my bad mood and am more likely to engage in a behavior that actually helps improve my mood, like meditation, sleep, or exercise. But I was disillusioned by this course. I believe my expectations were too high going in! I did not feel intellectually challenged in the slightest by the course, and I did not look forward to lecture by the end of the semester because it felt repetitive, predictable, and not incredibly useful. Sometimes I wish I had used my schedule space on a different class, one that piqued my curiosity more and challenged me more as a thinker and a person. But I think this course was very positive for my mental health. I feel guilty about this course because I know how much went into making it possible. And the intent of it was so pure and good. I feel guilty for not having loved this course. I want to improve the culture at Yale. But I don't know if culture change can happen by way of a 1000+ person course, by way of reading that social comparisons and high GPAs correlate with low happiness, for example. This doesn't change the realities of our environment or the intense fields that most of us will enter, whether in business, medicine, etc. This doesn't change the realities of the standards we hold for ourselves and that society holds for us. Those forces will never be trumped by reading psychological studies. And to think it might was shortsighted. That is not to say psychology is not powerful; in fact, I think the very opposite. It would have been better to talk about those standards, and to talk about happiness from a more philosophical point of view. This class had so much potential, and I think, ultimately, it fell short.

I believe academics are important but sometimes a hyper focus on academics leads to an incredibly unhealthy culture here. This course was necessary not so much to teach psychological ideas of happiness but because it made people question how they live and what truly matters. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'm sad it won't be taught again because it's so so so so so so so so good. I love Laurie Santos, she's like honestly kind of a prophet? I don't know, the amount that she CARES about her students is shocking given that she has 1200 of them. I emailed her a lot throughout the semester, and she never took more than 12 hours to respond, even though I'm sure she had dozens of emails to go through each day. Really a true star and a wonderful and educational and life changing course. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! If HoC Santos ever teaches this course again, you must take it. I can by far say this is one of the classes I have enjoyed the most in my time at Yale, for several reasons. (1) HoC Santos is *amazing* and really understands her students, how to engage them in the course material, and bring together empirical research and what she is discussing. (2) This class is all about how to actually improve well-being. As the G.I. Joe Fallacy tells us (and HoC Santos constantly reminds) knowing is not half the battle, and this course provides so much information but also provides the tools to make the consistent and rigorous effort required to improve subjective well-being. (3) The particular experience of this course, being the largest is Yale's history, made it truly unique and special to take. It made for some tremendous logistical challenges, but HoC Santos, the TAs, and the Registrar's Office made the course possible and made it so the logistics of a 1200+ person course didn't impede learning. I have loved this class and have found it to be one of those rare Yale courses that perfectly weds the rigorous and intellectual process of evaluating scientific research with discussable topics. I think this course will have an impact on Yale and on you far beyond this year's class. I hope HoC Santos decides to keep teaching this course because I want all Yale students to have the experience of this course. I cannot recommend it enough. ",

I hope Prof. Santos decides to teach this course again in a couple years, because I truly think it affected the way I see certain things (i.e. grades, future job prospects, etc), and the rewirements have positively affected my happiness//subjective well being. While it would be nice to think that future yalies will not be as stressed and unhappy, there seems to be a trend at most all elite universities where stress/anxiety overcomes & drowns students happiness. Hence, even if only 200 out of the 1400 students who took the class this year really got something out of it, that's 200 more happy Yale students than before! ",

Essentially Santos just quotes a bunch of vocab words and studies at you to drive home the point that exercise, time affluence, gratitude, etc. will improve your overall mood. There is little to no discussion of the actual mechanisms happening in the brain that make these phenomenons occur. Also, I feel that the course could have more deeply engaged with the role of mental illness as a barrier to feeling 'happy,' especially since a lot of Yalies struggle with mental illness but tend to be more \"high-functioning\" to the point that we might not even realize that something is wrong. \r\nOverall, this was a fun and relatively easy class to take in my senior year, and I'm so glad i got to be a part of what became a global phenomenon. I learned about techniques that I will use in the long run. However, do I feel that I really learned a lot in an academic or intellectual sense? Not at all. ",

So often, Yale students put enormous amounts of pressure upon themselves and are very hard on themselves, thinking that will lead to greater success later in life. This class teaches you why that is not the case in an academic and thorough capacity, through studies which demonstrate what does work and what does not to improve ones happiness and success. If you struggle with depression, procrastination, poor work habits, social or work anxiety, poor sense of direction, bad personal relationships or feelings of emptiness, this course will teach you how to end those struggles and how to help other people end them. There is nothing more valuable for society than that, as people who strive to impact society should understand how to improve others happiness.

Every student who comes to Yale has worked so hard to get into the school, but Yale manages to challenge you even more, to make you work harder than you have before in your academics. It's difficult feeling like your grades are the only the thing that matter, or that you don't feel like you fit in, or that you're scared for the future because you don't know if you'll make enough money to support your family. It almost seems like worrying and difficulty is central to the college experience. But that's not true. This class taught me so much about the pitfalls we think will make us happier, while showing me the ways we can actually, scientifically, increase subjective well-being. Having the theme of happiness in a college course makes it easier to gain this information and to use it, since most of us have been wired to follow all of our class assignments. It wasn't always easy, though, and there were times when I realized I had to shed beliefs that I had held for so long about salary and grades. But when I emerged from that class, I felt more prepared to make my life one in which I had meaning and happiness. I was equipped with a tool-belt of psychprotips and knowledge on how our minds sucked, and I hope that I will use these tips to increase my happiness and keep it at a high level.

This course even helped me get the most out of my classes that I am/was taking: using the growth mindset to learn instead of the fixed mindset to earn good grades can really make the difference between enjoying a class and hating it. I think the real turning point in this class was when HoC Santos said we were all getting D's: it really showed how much people cared about grades. After that event, I realized that grades aren't as important as they may seem, and although this sounds like some liberal college student making blatant accusations against what determines future success, grades truly only stress students out and make them perform worse rather than better.

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely yes. Anyone who wants to lead a more meaningful, happy existence, to be a better friend or student, and to understand and \"hack\" their own habits and beliefs should take this class if they are so lucky to have the chance. ",

It's just so amazing to be a part of a larger social movement, and even though I didn't learn much substantial information from this class, I learned how better to approach conversations on personal happiness and fulfillment and to take these things more seriously. I also think it was interesting to think about the contents of this course in conjunction with my religion (Christianity) to see what kinds of things actually provide true happiness and what doesn't.

I was not, but I hope that after the feedback given, if the course is offered again it can be changed to be more interesting, engaging and effective (by moving more slowly through less material, delving deeper into the issues and not repeating information, acknowledging that happiness may not be dramatically changed because these things like meditation just simply don't work for some people and everyone kind of works differently, etc.) ",

It's one of those things where if you believe the material and apply it to your own life, it'll help you reassess how you live your life and you will get happier, but if you choose not to believe it, then you can easily get nothing out of the class.

This class is a unique experience, both in terms of the magnitude and subject, and I think anyone would be hard-pressed to find such an usual and effortful attempt to change the well being of students all around the campus. Many of the strategies offered in class do in fact work, but they require concentrated effort and dedication towards one's improvement if one truly wants to extract the most out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to students that have less experience in Psychology, as many materials towards the end were quite familiar for psychology students. ",

Laurie is also a very engaging professor, even though she was lecturing to a class of thousands, it didn't seem like it. I would definitely recommend it, if it ever offered again (or you should take the online version). ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Even though the information she teaches can all be found online and is nothing exactly new, we learn that just knowing something is not half the battle. It is the structure of the class, the deadlines, the repetition of information and setting new goals, the harnessing of a community all working towards the same goal of happiness, the expectations and support from the professor and TFs that make this experience valuable and unforgettable and effective.

            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this class because it gave me the space to reflect on my own bad habits and the bad behaviors that are perpetuated through the stress culture of Yale, and it gave me the tools and motivation to continue working on my own wellness for the rest of my time at Yale and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I think that Professor Santos has the best interest of her students in mind, and she genuinely wants to help us overcome anxiety and depression and make the most of our lives.  I do recommend taking the course credit D. Because it was easy, there was a strict curve in the class. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend auditing it but definitely not taking it. The intellectual challenge of the material is low enough that it could probably be taught to anyone age 10+. You can gain almost as much from reading the lecture notes as going to lecture, and that can be done in a fraction of the time. I think part of the problem was the sheer size of the class - there was just never a time when the whole audience during a lecture was silent, which was incredibly inappropriate on behalf of the students and unfortunately took away from the experience of the class (and was a disincentive to even go to lecture, at least for me). There's also the whole grading problem - sure, yes, we learned that grades shouldn't matter to us as much as they do, but they still matter somewhat for jobs / grad school and the grading for this class felt incredibly arbitrary and heterogeneous between TAs. Yes, we were told to take this class credit D, but given Yale's policy of only allowing us to do 4 of them, it was not an option. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Although the class isn't being taught again so this is pretty irrelevant.  I think it's an incredible meaningful class, and every single Yale student would benefit from hearing the lessons Laurie Santos has to offer. While not everyone will choose with the type of life this class illustrates, it is incredibly meaningful to learn how someone can take small (and big!) steps to find more happiness in their life. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but with a caveat. This class will not automatically make you happier. If you want to be happier, you have to put in the effort. The course won't force you to change your behavior. It will just give you the information you need to go about trying to make cultivate the \"good life.\" I think most trouble students had was with disagreeing with Professor Santos, reducing what she said to pop psychology. I think it would help to keep an open mind. You might not believe what she says, but just try it. Seriously. If you take the class seriously, if you put in the work, you will actually find yourself feeling happier and developing healthier life habits. You have to take 5 quizzes (you get the questions before, and only 3 count), a midterm (this is actually somewhat challenging) and a final paper, which could be challenging if you procrastinate (but if you take the class, you learn how to not do that!) I'd say take it if you have the time, but take it Credit/D. ",

            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you are interested in psychology and want practical tips about how to be less stressed and more efficient with your time at Yale and beyond.

As mentioned before, I feel this course brought up very important topics that simply demonstrate how our minds work against us but how we can make an effort to improve our lives and find the things that truly make us happy rather than going about life decreasing our well-being by putting effort into things that don't matter at all to our happiness. I also would recommend this course because it touches on topics about mental health which I feel needs to be spoken about as equally as physical health to remove the stigma. ",

It's very easy to get caught up in the Yale bubble and I thoroughly enjoyed going to class. ",

If you said reason 1, that's fine. You can take the class. You won't learn a ton, and you won't particularly enjoy the class either, but it'll be easy. You might have a better time in a slightly more interesting gut, but you do you. If you said reason 2, definitely take this class! Getting something out of Psych and the Good Life comes down to committing to take it seriously and to putting time and energy into the Rewirements. ",

However it is also offered on coursera in a shortened version, which is probably just as meaningful because the real class repeated material SO much and almost became boring because of that. I don't think its a valuable class to waste a credit on, and would recommend doing it only if you won't have the motivation to do the coursera on your own. Or wait a few cycles until the course is put together in a way that will actually be intellectually stimulating and challenging and less made just to be easy to the point of boredom. However, it does lead to interesting discussions, and some of the rewirements were helpful and nice to implement for a class. ",

The information can be a little obvious at times, but you are genuinely learning psych concepts and it can be reassuring to hear things like \"you don't need to get a high gpa/grades/salary/etc.\" from a professor with studies to back it up. Even if you don't learn much new info, you could still benefit from the rewirements. All in all a solid course. ",
            "\u00a0this class changed the way i approach life in many ways. i actively practice gratitude in a way i thought i did in the past but do even more now. i limited my social media use in a big way. i sleep more. i feel more generous--i spend money on other people way more than i did. i take time to engage in random acts of kindness. if nothing else, i feel like i think of this class as i go about my life, i think about lessons from this class as i go about my day. the back of my head has laurie santos whispering into my ear as i log onto social media and i'm like damn maybe not right now. maybe i should take a picture for these tourists bc LS says kindness makes me happy. maybe i should be grateful whenever i'm really down. i think about this class at least once a day, which is way more than anything else at yale. laurie santos was a joy to have as a prof in this setting, and i'm so grateful she's getting the buzz she deserves. i feel lucky to have been a part of this revolution.

I think the academic environment of Yale is simply too hardcore to leave room for practicing the happiness techniques Laurie Santos espouses, but you can learn the tricks here (like G.I. Joe, ironically) and then try them over the summer, winter, or after you graduate. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. You'll get way more out of it if you do the non-required elements of the class that make you happier. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it because Laurie Santos is LIFE and put so much work into it, and it really showed! ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course. There is value to what it is trying to teach students, but in the praphrased words of Professor Santos herselfe \"You won't miss too much if you take the Coursera [online course] instead\". There are a lot of good topics covered in the course, and yes, it does use real science to try to understand some of the things that make people happy, but 1) you will have heard almost every major takeaway of the course if you have had exposure to religion (even if you're not religious yourself), philosophy, literature, or common wisdom (i.e. \"A good night's rest is good for you\")  2) this course is not the key to finding a meaningful life (nor does it try to be), and it will not provide a template for how you should live your life--that's still up to you and 3) there are some big problems with how the science is presented in this course. If you do end up taking it, make sure you understand how to read scientific papers beforehand (or learn quickly during the course) as well as have some foundation knowledge about statistics before taking this course. There are a lot of problems with how many of the findings of the studies are presented in this course--this is not to say that the findings and takeaways are all false, but let me clear, R VALUES HAVE VERY LITTLE VALUE IN DETERMINING A CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CORRELATED VARIABLES (I can add many variables as I want to move an r value up or down and make the correlation between two things higher or lower). Professor Santos does stress that correlation does not equal causation, but r values are used throughout the course in a way that puts a little too much emphasis on correlation as a guiding tool for pointing out takeaways. Also, watch out for double standards in what is counted as a high correlation and what is counted as a low correlation (i.e. if r=0.10 is deemed a negligible correlation in one lecture while r=0.12 is deemed as a significant correlation in another). \r\nHowever, there are good points to the course:\r\nThe course does make a lot of good points about what things do and don't matter in pursuing a happy/meaningful life, and it provides some helpful tools for understanding how our minds work and how we can motivate ourselves towards our goals. Some of the psychological biases talked about in the course also figure heavily in fields such as behavioral economics. The course does a lot to highlight how resilient people are to the disappointments of life. Most, if not all, of the major takeaways of the course are already expounded upon in religion, philosophy, literature, and common wisdom (ex: \"Money doesn't make you happy\"), which is good because there are major issues in how the science is presented in this course. I think one great thing that the course did though was make me more grateful about life, and I do believe the gratefulness topic made a difference in the lives of many students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  This course was very unique in that it was much more of a lifestyle change than an academic/intellectual course.  Although I didn't fully complete the rewirements I still benefited immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Will it immediately make you happier? No. Will you learn what does and does not make you happy and try to put it into practice? Yes. The class is a fun, approachable way to reevaluate your life and strive for things that make you a better person. Lecture is interesting and if you take it Cr/D, you will only need to do the reading you want to do. The quizzes aren't hard as you have a study guide in the form of previous problem sets but they are weekly work. The midterm was fair and the final paper is usually something you want to attempt on your own anyway. While the size of the class might be intimidating to some, it really did build a sense of community on Yale's campus at least for a semester. It's low-key group therapy for academics... for credit! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lots of fun and you can get a lot out of it if you actually do the rewirements. It is pretty nice to take quizzes that require you to learn about things that will make you happier. ",

            "\u00a0No, because I have heard that the material covered is covered in other classes which also teach you much more about this area of psychology. I liked the class but I think I might have gained greater intellectual benefits from another class. "
