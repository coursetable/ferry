            "\u00a0Having a personal TF who knows a lot about composition and can honestly tell you what does and doesn't work about your music is invaluable. Their flexibility in jumping from classical to jazz to hip hop makes them great resources. The freeform, project-based nature of the class also gives you a lot of control over what you want to learn. The guest lectures were cool sometimes, but they could also feel tedious. ",
