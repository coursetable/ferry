I am ready to dive deeper into the topic and finish my research process over the winter break. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill to do extensive research on a topic. Moreover, I learned how to concentrate on the main topic and to constraint the scope of my thesis to focus on the more important questions. ",
            "\u00a0Working on the senior essay has given me a better appreciation for the task of the historian than any of my other coursework in the major. Assembling a history on my own, to write at length about, has been an eye-opening experience so far. ",
            "\u00a0I got a really good start on my thesis. Meeting with the librarian was really helpful, and I feel like I am better prepared to form an argument for such a long paper. ",
            "\u00a0This semester I learned how to navigate the national archives and records administration and do proper research there. This is not as easy as it sounds and is a very valuable skill to have learned!  Besides that, the main skill I developed this semester was how to plan and stay on top of a long term project. ",

            "\u00a0The senior essay process is pretty disorganized at the department level and relies very heavily on the advisors to provide organization for students. This works when you have an advisor who invests in their students. I imagine it's tough when you don't. ",
            "\u00a0THERE IS NOT ENOUGH GUIDANCE IN THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT FOR THE MAJOR OR THE THESIS! Literally all we get at the end of junior year and during senior year is one short meeting with 100+ students in the room about our timeline and picking advisors and stuff, but nothing else. We get ONE short packet about the senior essay that isn't even available online and a DUS that has 3 hours of office hours a week for 300+ majors. Honestly it makes no sense. There is no help with picking an advisor, no guidance on how to do a lot of things correctly, and honestly not enough professors to advise students. \r\n\r\nMAKE THE ADMINS MORE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS, especially the DUS and the Senior Essay Advisor, and maybe offer a few options for meetings for the majors or even running meetings throughout the semester where people could drop in to actually learn what they're supposed to do.
