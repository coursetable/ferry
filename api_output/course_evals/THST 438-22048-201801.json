            "\u00a0I learned so so much about political theatre from the readings and my classmates. Had no exposure to academic dramatic work before so this totally changed my life! ",
            "\u00a0It was a beautifully constructed overview of Brecht and his work as well as the question of art itself. At moments, it felt like a philosophy class on the meaning of art, in the best ways. ",
            "\u00a0Production seminar! learned about Brechtian theatre style, how war affects theatre, how the theatre incorporates war and why. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about directing, morale in the rehearsal room, how Yale productions and professional productions work. I learnt about contemporary ideas and issues surrounding theatre. I learnt about representations of war. ",
            "\u00a0This class incorporated a really intense and extensive dramaturgical component to approaching theater that I had not experienced in the past and that I think was very valuable and I'm glad I did it. Toni Dorfman also encouraged us to pursue a style of acting rooted in internal imagination and having an object to focus on that I thought was very powerful. "

        [
            "\u00a0Because production seminars are so demanding and require so much extracurricular time commitment, I sometimes felt it would have been more useful to spend time earlier in the semester in class working on Mother Courage, rather than reading and discussing other plays. I understand the need to produce overtly academic work in the form of papers and discussion, but the course demands in combination with the production's demands sometimes became overwhelming and difficult to juggle. It would be more efficient, in my opinion, to allow more time for production-specific work in order to make the show as good and rehearsed as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic readings that lead to even more thought provoking discussions. No improvements necessary! ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing to read and discuss theory and then move the thought from a theoretical framework into a practical one by performing Mother Courage And Her Children. \r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Professor Dorfman is incredible\r\n- Putting on a play\r\n- Amazing reading list and discussions\r\n- The best feedback on my writing I have received in my time at Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- It would have been nice to have more rehearsal time to become engage further with the play itself ",
            "\u00a0I wish we started rehearsing/blocking the play sooner. But once play went up, it was extremely fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Dorfman is a wonderful, careful, and graceful professor who explains and leads discussion with care. I also loved the performance aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have driven for more specific class feedback. Often, debates ended in discussions of \"what is theatre\" at the expense of more detailed ideas.\r\nI think more historical understanding and research around War itself could have been beneficial to flesh out our awareness in the production.\r\n\r\nStrengths include the instructor, the very fine rehearsal process and the interesting, manageable readings. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the class discussions were a bit slow when run by the students, but that's a bit of an inevitability. "

            "\u00a0I think production seminars are a wonderful thing and a worthwhile use of resources, and any student who has the opportunity to work on one should absolutely do it. The chance to work with such a seasoned, intelligent, and professional director in college is a rare one, and courses like this afford those amazing opportunities to students in a way that only being at Yale can provide. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It will not be offered again but yes! ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you get credit to put on a play! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the readings were interesting, the discussion was stimulating, and the performance was enchanting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to a student who wanted to learn from a professional director and team; to a student who wants to engage with and think about a production at a professional level; to a student who cares about making relevant work; to a student who wants creative independence; to a student who already has a strong sense of theatre. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend taking a production seminar with Toni Dorfman, it's great. "
