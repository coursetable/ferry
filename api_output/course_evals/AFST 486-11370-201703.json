            "\u00a0Developed my skills in primary research and evaluation  of sources, as well as my knowledge about the institution of slave in Africa and the Atlantic slave trade. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an entry point into African histories, and I was able to dig into the institution of slavery as a transhistorical phenomenon. That was definitely interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0You gain a in-depth look into the details of the African slave trade from many different perspectives - individual slaves, forts, companies, kingdoms, locals etc ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing and historical analysis through this class. ",
            "\u00a0I really gained a lot of valuable knowledge regarding the experience of slaves in Africa across different time periods and places. I previously only really knew about the slave trade from the perspective of Southern agricultural slaves in the United States, so learning about the transatlantic slave trade in Africa was extremely interesting. We learned a lot about the political, social, and economic rights of slaves in Africa and I found it so interesting because a lot of times my preconceived notions of slavery were so different from the actual reality.

            "\u00a0The actual scholarship being examined in this course is often excellent, and organizationally, this has the makings of a phenomenal course (in terms of thematic arrangement). Unfortunately, there's not much incentive to do the readings unless you are presenting the readings for that week (and even then, I got by without reading the book for one of those weeks). Professor Harms is kind and generous, and clearly has interesting perspectives, but is unable to revive or even lay the foundation for an interesting discussion. He typically moves from student comment to student comment without posing much in the way of additional questions or providing affirmations/negations. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar was low key but had interesting fundamental takeaways that will not slip your mind after the semester's end. I enjoyed the primary source focus throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course is amazing. I think anyone would love it. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course because the knowledge is important, and it won't be a GPA-killer. I wouldn't recommend it as a pedagogical experience, however. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are specifically interested in the course material and like classes where learning and engagement is up to you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Amazing class and Professor Harms is the best. ",
            "\u00a0This course ended up being one of my favorites at Yale. Professor Harms is flexible and always willing to assist students in any way he can. The material in the course covers a topic that most people have little to no background in, but one that is fascinating. The pace at which you proceed through the topics on the syllabus is more than manageable and the accompanying workload (2 5-7 page discussion papers on the readings for the week and 2 5 page primary source analysis papers) is engaging but not overwhelming. Take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
