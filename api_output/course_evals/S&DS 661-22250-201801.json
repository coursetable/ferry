Before taking the class, I just read an introductory book, \"Hands-on Programming with R\", but I finally became able to create a code to examine a real article. The course is well organized, and the code used in class, piazza, and TAs helped me my learning. Also, I understood how careful we should be when we read empirical studies. The reading material provided in the course was very interesting for me and broadened my perspectives. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the settings in which some of the statistical models (e.g. linear least squares, logistic and probit models) and methods of parameter estimation (e.g. maximum likelihood estimates) that I have studied in other classes are appropriate for certain data sets and experimental designs.  It was helpful to gain a better understanding of when we can or cannot trust parameter estimates and/or estimates of their variability that are given in R.  I also learned about quantile regression, which I had not previously studied. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the quality of the topics instructors chose, the quality of the class, and the well-organized structure that allowed me to develop my programming skill from almost scratch to some level.  I am quite satisfied with the course. If I need to point out any points to improve, the blackboard of the classroom, which was really hard to read, and the long waiting time before the solutions for assignments distributed. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very general course aimed at individuals who did not have much statistics background, so the slower pace made it harder to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think this course examines statistical methods that are covered in other courses, but it is very helpful to review them again and particularly to focus on their applicability to certain datasets. The datasets we discussed were quite interesting, and I especially liked that we had to reproduce some of the numbers (specifically, parameter estimates and measurements of variability) that were reported in research papers - this is a helpful exercise.  Winston Lin and Peter Aronow are also great lecturers and I really appreciated their friendliness and patience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  There were times when I couldn't stay fully engaged with the course, but I am also willing to admit that this is partially my own fault and due to the fact that I was also busy with other coursework. Specifically, it is easy to become slightly disengaged during the lectures, since most of the lectures involved reading from the slides or going through individual lines of code from an R script.  I know that it is quite challenging to teach a course such as this one and to design it in such a way that every student is as engaged as possible.  I also know that this might not be feasible, but perhaps it would be interesting to consider the possibility of making this course more like a seminar (which would probably require offering multiple sections of it in any given semester to accommodate all students) of 15 or so students.  Doing so would encourage more discussion amongst the students and instructors. \r\n\r\nI did learn a lot from the homework assignments and am grateful for them.  They could have been made slightly more challenging, or at least somewhat less similar to the given lecture code. ",
