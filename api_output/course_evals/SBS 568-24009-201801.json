            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. The strengths were the fact that Prof. Bazell through us right into projects where we learned first-hand how to do things like video, podcasts, advertisement posters, and scripts. The weakness was probably the outside organization component, where ours was fairly unresponsive and my group didn't get much out of that aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: working with community organizations to help with their publicity, guest lecturers were amazing!\r\nWeaknesses: some of the class time should be used for groups to work together on their work for community organizations and not just lecturing for 2 hours, blogs sometimes felt like busy work until halfway through the semester when they became relevant to what we would be working on in class\r\n\r\nIf all the classes were like the emergency management/table-top exercise we did during the last 2 weeks, the class would be excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Working with an outside organization was very beneficial if you get paired with a good one. I learned a lot and we actually did community work. \r\nLimitation: I didn't gain any skills even though that was the hope for the class. I think communication is a huge part of public health, but I didn't feel like I learned anything that wasn't already common sense. ",
            "\u00a0I was unfortunately very disappointed in this course. It was incredibly unorganized, and the assignments often seemed like random busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Very disorganized course. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an adequate job of teaching communications, however it failed to teach how to communicate public health messages to the public. The course lacked organization and clear development of course expectations throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs a lot of work. Ironically, the communication from the professor was very confusing and spotty. I often had to email the TF to clarify what homework expectations were each week. The assignments themselves were fine, but we did not receive adequate preparation to produce quality materials and did not receive adequate feedback for improvement. They also did not match well with the types of products our non-profits needed our help with. ",
            "\u00a0I was extremely disappointed with this course. I went in extremely excited about the potential to learn about public health communication as this is the only class offering in this subject area, and is integral to public health practice. Unfortunately the course suffered from an overall lack of organization. There were no set guidelines for any assignments, and there was never any follow through on the set schedule, or any general feedback above and beyond the professor saying \"good or excellent work\" after we submitted. On top of there being a lack of organization, I don't know that I really took anything away from this course. A typical assignment would be the professor telling us to make a video and that he wanted us to use good quality equipment, and then we would make it and he would critique it in the class. We never learned how to communicate messages effectively or ways to frame complex public health problems in digestible manners. Instead we had many guest lecturers from the professors past that would come in and talk to us about things that quite frankly will never apply to my life, such as how to shoot a video, or how to set up lighting so that videos are the best quality. Overall I did not learn anything from this class. Public Health communication is imperative in this field and this class was unfortunately a waste of my time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was nice to work with outside organizations. It gave us the opportunity to understand their needs and provide them with deliverables. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At times it was hard to balance the projects assigned in class (ex. the video, podcast, etc) while also trying to complete the tasks given to us by the outside organization. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class needs more structure. It was difficult to know what was due as the schedule kept changing. It was also hard for our group to do as much for our organization because of communication difficulties and the amount of projects we had for in-class. Additionally, having such a large group made it much more difficult to coordinate meeting.\r\n\r\nOverall, the class needs to be more organized and have materials that are more relevant to the modern age. Materials were also not always posted to canvas which is sad because some of them would have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: ties to local organization, real world experience, great guest lectures\r\nweaknesses: very disorganized, lots of wasted class time\r\n\r\nwe are not realistically going to learn filming/lighting etc. in one class period. Guest lectures focused on technical skills would be better spent giving a background on health communications, what works, and what doesn't. I was surprised we never really studied effective campaigns vs ineffective campaigns in depth and how health communication fields have changed over the years. "

            "\u00a0Great, informative and clearly passionate about communications. ",
            "\u00a0Very experienced in reporting health and communications in general. Sometimes was a little disorganized/unclear about expectations for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think he has a lot of experience and is qualified, but his focus is TV/anchoring/reporting. There is so much more to communication that needed to be learned. ",
            "\u00a0Despite his experience, he was ironically not very skilled at communicating with the class about his expectations. He would frequently make up assignments on the spot, and constantly interrupted students and guest speakers. In fact, he rarely taught the course because there were so many guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The professor would interrupt guest speakers and was very disorganized in his presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Overall good intentions but lacks organization and would often interrupt many of our guest speakers ",
            "\u00a0Pretty horrible communicator. I also just felt his delivery of the learning points was mixed. He very rarely taught himself and brought in several guest speakers who did not understand the point of the course. We spent an entire class period talking about how to light an interview, instead of learning how to effectively conduct an interview! I think the course could benefit from an instructor who has teaching experience as well as experience with more modern forms of communications tools that the non-profits we are working with need help with. ",
            "\u00a0While professor Bazell is very nice, and you can tell he is trying his best, the class and his instruction missed the mark. I think that one problem is that he is not a professor, and therefore did not know how to effectively communicate his experiences. He is not the best communicator in terms of setting expectations, or listening to his students and what we wanted. I think that while he is clearly an expert in the field, just because you are an expert does not mean that you know how to teach. ",
            "\u00a0He was kind and clearly has had a lot of experience in the field of public health communications, but I found the class to be somewhat disorganized. ",

            "\u00a0Great, I enjoyed it and it was interesting. Would certainly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0As the only health communications course offered at Yale, it's okay. Working with the community organizations is nice, but you are not really prepared for what they ask of you since class assignments don't always align with the deliverables you need to create for your organization. If you are considering communications and need an elective, the class has a lot of potential and will continue to improve each semester. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the guest he brings in are amazing and actually teach you something. However, the class is really unstructured which is frustrating. Some of the projects were useless (i.e. making a video or podcast because I wasn't using any skills that I had learned). It was a lot of busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone at YSPH and it's the only Communications course. I really hope this changes. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course as it is now. ",
            "\u00a0No - unless this course changes professors, I felt that it was a waste of my time. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class. It felt like a waste of time to attend, and I wish that I had taken advantage of other courses instead of taking this. I would have rather taken a harder class than to waste my time learning how to film a video or light a set. I dont think that I will be able to use anything I learned in practice. ",
            "\u00a0I think public health communications is extremely important, but I think the class needs to be reformatted. ",
            "\u00a0very dependent on outside organization you are placed with. Class time is not well spent, with the exception of guest lectures. "
