            "\u00a0I have learned so much about early childhood education and developmentally-appropriate curriculum. This course is fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about early childhood education and what makes a good curriculum. The observations were very helpful and it helped to see first hand what we were learning about in class. I learned how important certain techniques are and what is beneficial to children's learning. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about early childhood education, especially the role of the teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the important developmental processes that occur during childhood, and how early childhood education has a formative impact on children's social, intellectual, physical, mental, and emotional development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course; I finally thought critically about the role of education, how we teach children (what language do we use? how do we structure the classroom and the day?), and what children learn in early childhood and how that translates into grander and bigger skills. This was probably single-handedly the best course of my Yale experience; I fail to see anything else that could top this. Granted, I also really love children and so I'm assuming if you hate kids this might not be the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about early childhood education in America, and also get a lot of hands-on experience working with young children. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of the cognitive development of children and how to adapt education methods accordingly to best foster learning. ",
            "\u00a0Systematic approaches to observational studies\r\nexperience in early childhood evaluation\r\ncomparing and contrasting philosophical models according to early childhood development in the educational environment ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about child development and best practices for early childhood education. Interacting with the teacher's at Calvin Hill taught me what an incredibly important and intellectually challenging experience teaching at a preschool can be. Also, learned about the way that policy decisions and social norms have influenced the education industry. "

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course include Professor Horwitz's expertise and the weekly observation ",
            "\u00a0It is very nicely set up! ",
            "\u00a0A big strength was the opportunity to observe in the classroom. But class-time itself was sometimes slow, and it was too easy to get by without reading. Some instructions were kind of messy, particularly the first journal and the final paper/project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: In-person observations at the preschool\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class met only once a week, so it felt like the course was disconnected at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Horwitz is amazing. She's kind, intelligent, and the top of her field. Her lectures are full of interesting anecdotes about her time directing Calvin Hill (for most of its existence!) and is always open to answering and fielding questions that students have about specific experiences. Everything you learn in the classroom is directly applied when observing the daycare for practicum, or can be directly linked to a specific and concrete story that Professor H has from her time as director.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Calvin Hill Daycare is far from campus, and it can be kind of a trek to get there two times a week. But it's worth it, imo. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is all very interesting but the syllabus is a bit messy. ",
            "\u00a0Expectations need to be clarified. Please have class NOT at Calvin Hill--it's incredibly incovenient for all the students, and physically being in the daycare adds no value when we're just listening to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings are a bit outdated, using language that is less appropriate and rather taboo in the modern day, but in small quantities such literature does give insight into how our knowledge of early childhood development has transformed over time.  Sticking with one classroom throughout the term really allows us understand the children on a more profound level and witness their development in motion; however, allowing time to visit other classrooms to see what the settings are like are on the other levels would allow for a bigger picture to truly take focus. ",
            "\u00a0Exciting and useful course structure\r\nengaging  and balanced instruction \r\n\r\nVery packed (could be laid out as two semesters)\r\nThe final project was tough to accomplish in a way that truly honored the course due to time constraints, though expectations were clear and feedback on the deliverable was fair and generous given the understood constraints ",
            "\u00a0Great topic, really engaging and interactive. Also surprisingly accessible for people without extensive experience in education studies or teaching. There are a lot of readings assigned every week, and it would be easier to keep up in the course if there were a few readings that were highlighted as particularly relevant. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Absolutely take this course. It is life-changing. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very enjoyable class. Carla is highly experienced and knowledgeable in the field. The content was interesting, but the highlight was definitely getting to interact with the children at Calvin Hill every week. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone regardless of major who might be interested in the topic. The workload was not bad at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in early childhood eduction, this is a must! Professor Horwitz is very knowledgable and the teachers in the room I observed were very knowledgable and helpful. It is very interesting and engaging material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Observing in the classroom is such a wonderful experience that it makes up for the slog past the Div school twice a week (once for class, once to observe). It eats up your afternoon, but is really low-stress aside from completing the journals (three over the semester) and the final paper. The journals are also pretty interesting to do, because you synthesize and interpret what you've seen in the classroom. Carla is great also. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an amazing course that was very interesting and offered me the opportunity to engage with the material in a realistic setting, right in a child daycare center. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to any student even remotely interested in the idea of children or education. It was super valuable to me. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! The course material is very interesting and the hands-on observation is extremely interesting and revealing. I miss my kids! ",
            "\u00a0Sure, I'd recommend it. It's a great writing credit, although be warned that '5 journal entries' actually means 9 journal entries--you need to do additional observations for set you turn in. Walking up to Calvin Hill twice a week sucks, but the kids are cute. When choosing classrooms to observe, you should know that older children will be more interesting and give you more material to observe. Older kids read and talk and do math, while kids in the Threes classroom (although really cute and cuddly) are in much earlier stages of development since they're younger, so finding things to talk about in your journals can be much tougher ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone passionate about child development, education policy or application, or just looking for a unique journal-style writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely. I would warn about reading and time investment and then I would highly reccomend the course to anybody interested in child development and or psychology. Carla is not just a professor she acts as a partner with students and is very invested and available to students. Truly a gem! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend this course. It's a really interactive way to learn about education policy and child development. Even as someone who wouldn't have described myself as \"great with kids,\" the structure of the class and the incredibly welcoming teachers at Calvin Hill made me feel really comfortable and set a perfect environment for learning. There is a fair amount of writing for the class, though the journal format makes it relatively informal and reflective, rather than deeply analytical or structured. The final paper/project is also a great way to delve deeper into a particular topic. ",
            "\u00a0Final project for this class changed my life! Prof Horwitz is very kind, and a true expert, and super open to feedback. It's so impressive that she's been teaching this course for so long but is still trying to improve it. "
