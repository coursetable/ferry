            "\u00a0I learned in-depth knowledge on how to simulate different biomechanical processes of the human body in matlab and continuity. Specifically, we started from the cellular level and moved up to whole tissue/organ modeling. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of multiscale modeling systems. We were introduced to several types of modeling that I was previously unfamiliar with, and had the opportunity to read literature that used those methods. ",
            "\u00a0great class. learn about building models to represent different biological systems at different scales (atomic, molecular, cellular, inter-cellular, organs, etc.) and learning about good modeling practices. it taught me a lot about how models can be used in the scientific process :) everybody say emergent properties "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0One of the major strengths is the intimate nature of the course. Since there were in class work sessions, we were able to ask Professor Campbell for coding help and questions as we completed the assignments. The lectures were also interactive; we could ask questions whenever and Prof Campbell also checked in with us to see our level of understanding. I've been mulling over how this class can be improved and cannot think of anything at this point in time. I really really enjoyed taking it and felt like i've both achieved and learned a lot throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that I think the modeling project should have had more small update assignments over the semester instead of only a midterm and final paper. For example, maybe have students pick a topic earlier on and come up with an idea, so that as you are learning the different types of modeling, you can think about how this could be used in your project. Maybe even include a short question in the homework like \" if you were to use this type of modeling on your topic, how would it be useful?\". I think this would help people think more about system application, even if they do not use them in their final project. ",
            "\u00a0great modeling, lots of interesting science about cardiovascular systems, and good opportunities for students to get their hands dirty in the modeling process. honestly i can't think of a way it could be improved. "

            "\u00a0YES! 1) Professor Campbell is absolutely amazing. He goes above and beyond to work with students and improve their understanding of the material. He also makes himself available if students need additional help. Prof Campbell has a heart. He will extend deadlines if he knows that students have a rough week or cannot finish an assignment to the best of their ability. However, he still expects student's best work and will offer feedback so they can improve. 2) the class covers a wide range of coding systems that are extremely useful for biomedical engineers. 3) the grading is fair and the workload is relatively light. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! I think I gained useful skills from this course, and Professor Campbell is an excellent teacher ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take this at all if you're interested in modeling, in bio systems, or learning how to read papers, this is a great class to take. Campbell is also a great reason to take this class. chill guy, smart dude, and loves teaching. "
