            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Andre Bazin, and I learned how to \"close-watch\" films like you close-read books. I really learned how to pick out the themes of a film and connect them to other art forms, and I think reading the Bazin essays were very helpful in learning how to do that. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about film history, analysis, and terminology, as well as its connectikns with art, music, and literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about films and film history, as well as other artforms. ",
            "\u00a0Ideas, culture, art and literature, all connected to film ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to criticize art of all kinds of art. ",
            "\u00a0I developed ability to closely analyze multiple mediums of art including film, painting, sculpture, and literature. Additionally learned a lot about the work of Andre Bazin. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an appreciation for arthouse cinema and film out of the mainstream. I learned a basic history of film criticism surrounding the figure of Bazin and his influences. I thought I was a movie buff before, but now I really appreciate everything that makes a film ring from the choice of unprofessional actors to Welles' use of long shots to the economy of natural sound. I've joined the YFS to continue intellectual discussion of films in an organized group setting. \r\n\r\nOf course, this is film AND the arts. I appreciated how we learned to link the arts to each other from novels to paintings to sculpture to film. This understanding of adaptation helped me better grasp the aim of art: to evoke a human message by appealing to the senses. This understanding was especially noticeable in The Mystery of Picasso. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I absolutely loved learning about Bazin. I looked forward to all of his essays by the end of the year. I also loved watching and discussing the films. It takes some time to get used to the in-depth way we pick these films apart, but once you do, it's so much fun, and I learned so much about how to discuss films and write about them. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I felt like we didn't have enough time to complete our essays. I also felt like the class was a bit disorganized at times. I wish our discussions hadn't been so disorganized. I also wish we had watched/read more things by women and people of color. Sometimes, the professor started lecturing instead of letting us discuss. ",
            "\u00a0The material was entertaining, however Professor Andrew's tangents were not always relevant. ",
            "\u00a0No problems, it was a fun, engaging, interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course but I wish the syllabus was a bit clearer as to what exactly was going to be studied in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Monday night movie nights were a hit, most of the films were either beautiful, intriguing, dramatic, etc. (all positives), the discussion in class was very open-ended and exploratory and allowed for interesting ideas to go around, the Bazin readings were fascinating (I love that writing style)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some of the movies were ehh (Chimes at Midnight) but were probably good for us like Brussel sprouts, there could have been more background materials given out to inform and contextualize our discussions (terms and definitions of common film lingo, brief historical overview of technology coinciding with a history of films from the silent movie era onwards), assignments could be better explained (Native Son essay)\r\n\r\nSuggestions: allow students to vote and choose a film from a group you wish to cover at that screening, maybe one or two modern films so we don't burn out from black and white exhaustion (Gleaners and I was fun though), maybe put L'etranger and more existentialist essays in the curriculum, substitute one of the books for a film/novel adaptation that we could write about in an essay (I wish we read Othello, then saw the film and perhaps a theatrical production), ADD MORE TYPES OF ARTS (MUSIC, DANCE, POETRY, THEATER) "

            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you are really passionate about film. We watch a lot of films, some of which are very strange. Also, before taking this class, I would recommend looking over a Bazin essay to see if you like his style. We mostly read Bazin essays the entire year, which I really enjoyed because I think Bazin is a fantastic writer, but if you aren't a fan of his work or aren't a fan of focusing on one writer for a whole semester, I would recommend looking at another class. But if you're passionate about the material, this is an amazing class to take. I loved the people in my class, and Professor Andrew is so knowledgeable about all types of film, and he loves it when the students are passionate about the work too. We also read a few novels, so if you aren't a fan of a moderate reading load, I wouldn't recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is as eye-opening as it is enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it expands ur perspective of analysis of different arts beyond just film. Youll learn different ideas about art analysis and be exposed to different criticisms. The course\r\nmaterial was definetly intriguing and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in exploring the arts, or those who enjoy classic film. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's fairly easy, but very fun. I learned a lot about art of all kinds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if the student has a strong interest in any of the arts. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a course worth taking if you want to get an introduction into the arts. It will fascinate you and make you want MORE.\r\n\r\nAlso good for those with an existentialist mindset as much of the art covered is of the mid 20th century. "
