Professors could encourage students more to discuss between themselves.\r\n\r\nFrequently canvas notifications were not sent out when reading for classes was uploaded, leading to many classes where students did not know there was set reading and therefore came unprepared. Please always notify us via canvas or email when there is reading to do.\r\n\r\nFinal paper seems like a pointless exercise given that the students are not debating the topics of the papers after they are written.
