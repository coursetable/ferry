            "\u00a0- Ability to read and analyze a variety of sources, with legal documents perhaps being the most novel based on past realm of experience \r\n- Gained a more critical awareness of the language I use to discuss gender and sexuality, how inclusive/exclusive that language can be, and how to adjust that language accordingly to be more sensitive to the groups of individuals that may be implicated (intersex section was the most illuminating) ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the mess and complicated nature of human rights claims when it comes to issues surrounding gender and sexuality. I really appreciated the way assumptions and things I took for granted as \"givens\" were deconstructed, particularly around definitions and understandings of sex and gender. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Wide array of topics that were covered \r\n- Readings played an important role in providing depth to the topics that we focused on \r\n- Each class began with a very good theoretical foundation that allowed us to delve into the different discussions we had.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- While the course was engaging, the large class size made it difficult to participate in the class discussions/conversations ",
            "\u00a0Ali Miller is a brilliant and exciting instructor. The syllabus was phenomenal -- timely, exciting, relevant, challenging, unusual. I loved having a mix of students from the graduate and professional schools, and undergraduates as well.\r\n\r\nProf. Miller could do a better job facilitating class discussion. I did the readings carefully and enthusiastically every week, but participated only a handful of times over the course of the semester. Students should be encouraged to participate more, and should be given a largely portion of the class time to do so. Small group discussions were helpful -- much less intimidating -- and could be introduced earlier in the term and utilized more frequently. \r\n\r\nI found the op-ed and final paper assignments extremely challenging and would have appreciated if Pro. Miller had provided more guidance and made herself more available outside of class hours. I appreciated getting feedback on the assignments I turned in. \r\n\r\nProf. Miller thinks in twelve layers of complexity and a hundred miles a minute -- this was an exciting environment to learn in, but also extremely challenging and I often felt like I was running to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0I do not have any suggestions for improvement. I really appreciated the class discussions and the breadth and depth of the assigned readings. The written assignments challenged me to think more critically and in ways I am unaccustomed to, which I also really appreciated. This class was very challenging for me because I am not in a discipline that was prominently featured, but I really appreciated the challenge. I also appreciate Prof. Miller making space in discussions for people from different disciplines and backgrounds. The classroom dynamic felt both supportive and challenging, which I think is the ideal classroom environment. I was encouraged to think critically and more expansively about things I assumed or believed, but it was also a safe space to express different views, to disagree, and to hold positions that others did not necessarily espouse. The respect and kindness that my classmates and Prof. Miller offered made this course my favorite this semester. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that students are coming from different schools. \r\nOne weakness I found was that I was sometimes unclear what to gain from the readings and where should I place my focus. ",
            "\u00a0The course content and readings were great. Prof Miller is also a strength of the course. However, I wished readings weremorecontemporary and that class discussions were more discussion based than lecture based. "
