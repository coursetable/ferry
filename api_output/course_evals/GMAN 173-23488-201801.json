            "\u00a0This course offered incredible insight into the world of German nature poetry from 1400 to the modern day. ",

            "\u00a0Literally none, the course was terrible! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze poetry both on the surface and in historical context. Writing and speaking also improved. I really feel like the course boosted my vocabulary as well. "

            "\u00a0strengths: \r\n--interesting spread of poems, from early 1700's all the way to the 2000's! It's really fun to see how the language evolves over time \r\n--the focus on nature, though it feels a little bit forced at times, really guides and gives structure to the course \r\n--good balance of papers and presentations\r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n--we had to do a lot of analytical writing but were not really taught how \r\n--feedback on essays was minimal ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: none\r\nWeaknesses: poems are boring and far too hard, too much homework, grading is quite harsh ",
            "\u00a0Cant really think of many negative things to say about it. A definite strength though is Florian and his ability to lead an effective discussion. "

            "\u00a0Definitely take this if you have an interest in German and poetry. It's a small, intimate class where German is exclusively spoken and the discussions are best when students participate. If you are quiet and don't often participate in seminars, the course can still be rewarding as long as you do the reading and enjoy it, but class itself may be a little awkward. ",
            "\u00a0YES! The workload and reading is quite a bit, but the practice you get reading, writing and speaking the language is very helpful. Also a good balance of totally fluent people who lived in Germany and people who had learned it throughout their time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0NO - do not take this course! Far too much work! Also the poems are boring and way too hard. "
