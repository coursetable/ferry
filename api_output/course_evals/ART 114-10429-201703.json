            "\u00a0This class strengthens your ability to see form and value and to recreate them through drawing. Even though the course is named Basic Drawing, you might find it helpful even if you have plenty of drawing experience. Anahita did a great job of determining which skills each student needed to work on, and she worked with each of us to improve upon them. I personally developed my understanding of value shifts, composition, content and narrative the most. ",
            "\u00a0You will ACTUALLY LEARN HOW TO DRAW. It's crazy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic elements of drawing and how to execute them correctly but also provocatively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to capture form by drawing but also different ways of seeing both art and the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0Basic drawing techniques, working in traditional black and white mediums. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to draw by using line and value.  I also practiced working in different materials, such as graphite, charcoal, chalk, collage, animation, and VR. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to draw using graphite and charcoal. I also developed an increased attention to light and shadow, and to composition. "

        [
            "\u00a0One really important aspect of this course is that our class sessions and assignments were determined each week in response to how we were all doing. I saw this as a strength of the course, because it meant that Anahita was customizing our semester based on the individuals in the class and the areas she believed we all needed to improve upon. To people who are looking for a stricter, more pre-determined syllabus, this might be a weakness in the course. The course is also designed to give you plenty of practice with drawing. If you do the work in class and you spent significant time on the assignments, you will absolutely see a huge improvement in your drawing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class is mostly enjoyable - it's fun to be in the studio drawing with music on for a few hours. However, be warned: the homework is TEDIOUS. Spending 6 hours drawing on the weekend probably sounds fun right now, but I can promise you that it is not. It is hard and frustrating work. The first half of the semester was especially strong, and I felt that we were given lots of 'tools' with learning how to draw. However, once you get into value in the second half of the semester, you are given less guidance which can feel frustrating. Overall, an enjoyable in-class experience with awful out-of-class assignments! But you learn to draw so... ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that we almost always had just one drawing assignment per week although we had class twice. It really made life easier. It'd be too time consuming to produce two good drawings in one week. \r\nAnahita was extremely nice and understanding. It was great learning to draw from her. ",
            "\u00a0Good foundational education, helpful basic introduction.  Organization/structure was a little poorly designed - there were several sections on the syllabus that we did not get to, and several assignments that had unrealistic practical expectations for students in dorm rooms.  There was only one opportunity for one on one feedback and actual evaluation of standing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course brings up issues of accessibility. In addition to the class fee, I had to spend around $100 for supplies and materials. Everyone may not have access to these kinds of funds, so this is something to keep in mind moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well run.  In class we learned and practiced new skills.  The each still-life that we drew in class was specifically arranged to help us practice a new skill (such as drawing shadows, reflective surfaces, faces, etc.).  Homework assignments were also specifically created so that we would practice a skill, and our in-class critiques were very informative. ",
            "\u00a0The course expected a lot from the students, and I appreciated being pushed to work hard on my projects.\r\n\r\nI wish we had been better acquainted with each other before we started critiques, and that we had set guidelines and intentions for that process. Sometimes the crits dragged on, or felt not that useful. "

            "\u00a0Yes, and take this course with Anahita! She will critique your work honestly and considerately, and she makes sure that you learn a range of drawing media over the course of the semester (pencil, charcoal, ink, collage, some digital work in final classes). Furthermore, she made sure this class wasn't only about drawing on a basic level, but about considering the content, themes and narrative we display in our work. She also familiarized us with the crit process which is crucial if you are considering taking more art courses/majoring in art! ",
            "\u00a0\"I spend my days reading and writing, doesn't it sound fun to do some art?!\" Don't be a fool. This class will take up more of your time than most of your other classes. Sure, it's \"just drawing,\" but the homework is massively time-consuming and frankly, not very enjoyable unless you come into the class with inherent artistic talent or previous drawing experience. ",
            "\u00a0Take it with Anahita! It was fun and enjoyable, but it's really how much you put into it. Be prepared to spend 4+ hours on your drawing if you want to make it good. Anahita is one of the nicest professors, no, PEOPLE, you will ever meet, so that'll make your experience a lot more awesome. ",
            "\u00a0You should definitely take this classits as much work as you put in, and if you really dedicate yourself you can improve a huge amount. The assignments were interesting and you spend a lot of class drawing or critiquing, both of which help you improve a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very time consuming, and not too easy. A lot is expected from you, which can be stressful if you don't already have a background in drawing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class.  It was a nice break from lectures and reading where I could take a break to create things with my hands and be more creative.  However, I also learned a lot and realized that there is much more to drawing than just technical skill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was hard and I didn't learn to sketch as much as I'd hoped I would, but working with charcoal was fun and really changed the way I look at light and drawing. "
