            "\u00a0Critical thinking, reading, and writing ",
            "\u00a0I developed many skills in terms of critically reading literature and improving my writing. I think my writing got much better as I was able to more concisely articulate myself and jump more logically from one conclusion to the next. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent way to improve my writing. I became more comfortable with doing research and contributing to discussions as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course helped me become a better writer. I struggled with analysis greatly in the beginning and now I feel as though I am slightly better. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting intro college writing class because it changed the way that I saw analyses and the flow of my paragraphs. I learned how to write longer papers. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely improved my writing and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly developed the skill of crafting a collegiate-level paper, focusing closely on how to craft an argument that is compelling to an audience. I learned how to take a paper from an observation that I had made, to an argument that is important to the reader. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much: how to write a nuanced analytical essay, how to write a literary research paper, techniques for close reading, the list goes on... "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: great texts read in class, fantastic mix of grammar/reading skills/writing workshops, and great feedback on writing. Weaknesses: essay prompts were very specific and there was not a ton of room for creativity. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the format of this course and it was just the right workload. However, I think it might be a bit underwhelming for someone seriously interested in pursuing English. ",
            "\u00a0You don't need to do the readings to be able to participate in class which really sucks because then you don't really have a drive to read. The annotation assignments were fantastic though, and I really enjoyed being able to insert my ideas alongside my classmates'. ",
            "\u00a0There could be more direct discussion of the readings done by the students. Talking through the readings, from student to student helped to make the text come alive and helped it make more sense. I would have appreciated early distribution of the essay prompts so as to aid in the preparation for the essay, so that I could complete the readings with the prompt in mind. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: High engagement from Ryan (he's willing to meet and help with anything!), constructive class discussion, constant feedback, lots of practice with specific writing skills\r\nWeakness: The only one I can think of is that class discussion could be more fluid "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for those who, like me, want to strenthen their reading and writing skills. Its been a wonderful semester! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It was very challenging and it forced me to think outside of my existing paradigm, but I learned so much. The more I put into the course, the more I got out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think it will be instrumental in many of my courses to come. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I believe that this is a great introductory writing course. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not, I feel like you can learn to write in a lot of different settings and the readings for this course were kind of messy. I didn't always see the connections between them and they don't flow together well. If you aren't ready to fully immerse yourself in everything in this class you won't get too much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Excellent course, professor Wepler is an incredible teacher and makes the class so interesting. Great way to get a writing credit and just read good books. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course engaged my imagination while pushing me to seek other's perspectives and develop my own thoughts and writing. I loved the texts we covered. We read a variety of texts, and looked at them individually and as a whole. Professor Wepler was fantastic as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Whether or not you're a prospective English major, you should take this class. Ryan gives in-depth instruction on different writing techniques using engaging material. I would highly recommend it! "
