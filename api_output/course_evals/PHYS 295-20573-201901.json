            "\u00a0Not only do you get a broad introduction to Astrophysics with this course, but you also acquire some in-depth knowledge on how to code in Python for Astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to significantly improve my Python programming skills, as well as receive a thorough introduction to the entire process of astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Coming in with no Python or any coding experience I feel much more equipped to pursue research using Python. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how large telescopes work, how data is acquired (imaging and spectroscopy), how data is processed, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use python to carry out astronomical data reduction. I also learned about the different ways astronomy research is conducted. ",
            "\u00a0True to the promised goal of this class, I now feel much more prepared to undertake research in astrophysics. In fact, I met with a professor earlier today to discuss the work I'll be doing with him this summer, and quite a few of the topics I learned about in ASTR 255 came up in our conversation, including right ascension and declination, CCDs and the process by which they convert electrons to values in a FITS file, taking spectra and making light curves of supernovae, and more. In addition to the astrophysical knowledge I gained from this course, I now also feel much more prepared to use Python in astrophysics research. ",
            "\u00a0This was an absolutely wonderful class! It really helped me strengthen my understanding of the basics of astronomy research and methods. I learned a lot about how telescope works, what happens to light before it hits the telescope, about radio astronomy and general research practices! If you had no experience coding coming into this course, then you would definitely learn a lot! I personally was pretty proficient and so just got more practice with python, which was great! Professor Geha is awesome and her personal insights and comments really make this class interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Lots. I learned a lot about practical python programming, and about methods used in astronomy research. Also in the process of the research project I learned a lot about scientific writing and presenting. ",
            "\u00a0Python programming for astronomy research ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Python programming, particularly in an astrophysics context. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well organized -- probably one of the most organized courses I've taken at Yale. The Professor Geha's instruction is superb, and having a grad student to help out, especially with Python, was all the more beneficial. The only way I believe the course could be improved would be by adding more out of class Python workshops for those students who have never been exposed to it or any other types of coding. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in the instructor, Prof. Geha is not only a world-class astronomer but also a fantastic teacher, who genuinely cares about student progress. I think the course could be improved however by giving a much more thorough introduction to Python, as the class was more difficult for students who had had no programming experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: plenty of support and outside help was available if you reached out\r\n\r\nWeakness: maybe having an office hour dedicated to the pset wouldve been extremely helpful (similar to the style of office hours of PHYS 180/181 ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized, the professor and TA are helpful, the material is interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was quite nice, especially the final project at the end; it seemed like a much more relevant way to demonstrate our progress than an exam would have been. That said, the midterm exam we had seemed fair as well, since, true to Professor Geha's word, it didn't do much more than make sure we knew what had been going on in the course until that point. Furthermore, the problem sets were interesting and engaging enough that I would almost go so far as to describe them as entertaining. All except problem set 5, that is -- that one seemed quite a bit too long. On a more positive note, the class we spent talking with astronomy graduate students and learning what graduate school was like was one of the most helpful classes I can remember having gone to at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really unique course in the way that it is structured. The first half of the course is lecture based (with fun interactive activities on Fridays) and the second half is mostly focused on the research project. I really liked the set up because you get the skills and knowledge in the first half and then you have a chance to apply them in the second half. I would have liked to have had a little bit more time for the project. It would have been nice if we could have started the assignment a little bit earlier in the semester, but other than that I have no complaints about the structure of the class! ",
            "\u00a0It was amazing, a great focus on collaboration but also individual work. Lecture was generally engaging, and what we learned was very quickly applied in psets. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are also kind of its weakness. Prof Geha says she will teach you how to be useful for astrophysics research, and she does that very well. However, I feel like I didn't learn enough programming to be able to do much on my own if it wasn't one of the specific areas we covered in class. That's not to say I didn't find the class useful, because I really did learn a lot, but I think it would benefit from a more general lens towards programming. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who has any interest in Astrophysics, Computer Science, or Statistics. Some of the problem sets are quite time consuming, so don't take this course if your schedule does not allow you to prioritize it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ive been recommending this course to all of my friends. I have felt myself grow so much in this class. I find myself much more prepared to pursue research projects. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if youre interested in astrophysics or even amateur astrophotography. Its also a good science credit for non-majors. Dont expect to learn a lot of new material, but you will have better understanding of how astronomy research works (and future challenges, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This is probably the best class I've taken at Yale. The material is super interesting, you actually learn how to code, and the TA/prof are really helpful and friendly. Take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone mildly interested in astrophysics, or anyone interested in learning Python for simple data processing. In fact, I already have recommended it to quite a few other students, and I took the course at the recommendation of another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! Obviously, if you're an astro major you have to take it, but for other students it's a super fun class full of interesting content and fun assignments! Professor Geha is a true gem. She clearly cares so much about her students and really wants to make sure that everyone is understanding the content and getting the most out of the course. I would take this class if you are at all interested in astronomy. If you have any coding experience at all, you will totally be able to handle it no problem. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was super fun and a great way to learn some astronomy and coding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! Especially if you have no programming experience, it is not prohibitively difficult to understand the class, and there is a lot of guidance. "
