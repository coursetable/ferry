            "\u00a0Strength, great professor and class. Weakness, no concrete grading. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really strong in the sense that it allowed students to get a grasp of a wide variety of areas inside visual arts. I also really enjoyed the visits we did to studios, museums and libraries throughout the course. Those made the concepts we were learning in class really concrete. I would like to see more of these visits. ",
            "\u00a0Having a more precise syllabus and more timely grading would be nice. Aside from that, I enjoyed the content in the class and how it was presented. I especially liked our visits to different art galleries on campus. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a more hands on approach to the class would allow the final project to collect more weight. Also we only had one week to go from the conception of an idea to a final product, meaning we were not able to revise or improve our work. ",
            "\u00a0Course is very cursory, and you dont really get a chance to get comfortable in any medium, as with most survey courses ",
            "\u00a0shallow but broad ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a decent overview of major concepts in visual art, such as composition and color, through the use of examples, film, and other media. However, the lectures were dry and could be made more engaging. In addition, there was very little feedback given on class assignments, if any at all. Students were often left unsure of how to improve. The final critique was more comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0I especially enjoyed going to the art school and hearing about different students' projects. However, I felt that the class was not hands on enough in the sense that we did not have many projects to work on nor did we have adequate feedback on our work. I felt a constant disconnect from the course material itself. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in exploring art who don't know where to start. By getting introduced to every art discipline at Yale, I developed skills in various disciplines and figured out which ones I liked and disliked. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good class for those with an art background since all of the students taking the class are art majors (since it's a prerequisite). However, perhaps it would better serve those with less of an art background. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great class as an introduction to learning about art and various approaches to art. ",

            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants a less time-consuming class but still wants to learn broadly about art. However, I would not recommend this to someone who wants to be fully engaged in art projects. "
