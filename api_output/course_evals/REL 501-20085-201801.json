            "\u00a0Danny was always well-prepared for section, and would regularly give us helpful handouts to prompt conversation. However, Danny could have been a better facilitating/mediating presence throughout the semester. Biblical studies sections tend to be a little fraught to begin with because students come to them with many pre-conceived notions and inclinations. So, in order to keep these sections from getting tense/off track, the TF needs to be a skillful facilitator. Danny had more of a laid back style, which meant that section would often get derailed without ever getting back to the central questions being discussed. ",
            "\u00a0He put us in the perfect position for discussion based learning which allowed us to get a lot more out of our section. ",
            "\u00a0Kind, organized, professional. Best TF that I have had at YDS. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - Great process for getting students into the material and well facilitated by him. \r\nAppreciated the feedback on questions and assignments. \r\nWeakness - not his weakness so much but using CANVAS to interact with the assignments was cumbersome. ",
            "\u00a0We didn't have many section meetings because of the way the spring schedule worked out. So we didn't have much time to create a good environment for in-depth discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Danny is very pleasant, knows the material, and punctual (i.e., not late nor did he miss any sections).\r\n\r\nIt is challenging in this class, given the brief section time, as there seems to be a grand or ambitious plan that never quite got traction (i.e., the discussion or seminar went other directions---not a a \"free for all\" but based on thoughtful, intuitive perspectives by those who did the reading versus the questions posed online). ",
            "\u00a0Danny did an admirable job in our class. However, I object on principle to having peers 'teach' other peers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: thoughtful, well-prepared, gracious, earnestly concerned to do a good job.\r\nWeaknesses: Danny could be more forceful in organizing and directing discussion to ensure that the points he wants covered are covered and to prevent uninformed participants from railroading the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Danny is available for conversation re our papers. He made sure (around mid-term) to check with the section group what was working and what was not. The organization of the section (members of the group being assigned readings to present each week) was good. His comments and further teaching elements were often challenging pre-conceptions, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Danny was pretty good. He maybe needs to with on reining in students who went off on tangents. ",
            "\u00a0Section with Danny was a bit tense. People didn't seem to have much to say. He assigned weekly discussion leaders but we didn't really have a sense of what the expectations were. I wish he had provided more guidance and led discussion more actively. ",
            "\u00a0Danny was a good TF to meet in person with regarding writing assignments. He provided helpful guidelines on written assignments and was approachable. In the section setting, however, he needs some more guidance on how to lead sections and be an effective facilitator, especially when contentious topics are on the table. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Danny's administrative competence. He was always prompt in responding to emails and in sending weekly updates for section. ",
            "\u00a0Very well prepared for section. Actually taught us new and important information rather than just facilitate discussion. It was a good balance of both. A weakness is sometimes missing opportunities to engage meaningfully with student comments and questions during discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter did a great job of supplementing our reading materials with important historical information and texts. It added to our discussions. Since it took some effort to get students to participate in discussion, it may be good to have students read passages aloud instead of the TF. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter did well as a TF for first time.  He grew as the semester went on, moving away from too much preliminary and non-section reading based discussion to devoting the section time to section discussion and relevant comparative material on the weekly section subject.  Whatever weaknesses were shown for a first time teaching fellow were remedied with his alteration of style and engagement from student feedback.  A very good TF. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly appreciated Dexter's enthusiasm on certain matters pertaining to the reading materials (such as one which addressed the topic of Greek philosophical understandings of the soul), though for the most part he seems daunted by his students and it was really unusual for an actual discussion to take place in section. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter is a really great guy who's very enthusiastic about his work with Greek literature and NT scholarship. He could get a little sidetracked sometimes, though, explaining the details of his own research during discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were fine.  Written feedback was fine. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter did an excellent job of facilitating section discussion, helping to synthesize information, and offer additional perspectives and information that was very helpful. I also found paper and exam feedback helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter was prepared and knowledgeable, both about the assigned texts and about other relevant texts from the ancient world. I appreciated that. I wish he had given us a clearer plan at the beginning of each section for that day's discussion, and then marched us through it, because sometimes I didn't know what was coming next. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter was a competent TF. He was clearly interested in the material and interested in his students. One of the most frustrating aspects of section was that many people did not come, so if anything could have been improved by the TF, perhaps better communication of expectations would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Great guy! ",
            "\u00a0clearly knowledgeable, seemed a little nervous and out of his element leading a section; but he clearly knew his stuff and I admired him greatly ",
            "\u00a0Dexter is an excellent facilitation leader, shares helpful literary and historical background material for the sections interpretive work, gives generous and insightful comments on written work, is open and available for discussion outside section and offers great suggestions for further study. ",
            "\u00a0Dexter Brown's strength lies in his preparation. He does not take his work lightly. Each section, he prepared some fundamental questions and prepared supplementary hand-outs for us to engage his interests and insights into the key text.  \r\n\r\nDexter Brown's weakness as a teacher was perhaps his unawareness of the overall program of the course. Sometimes he did not know when something was due, and he likewise couldn't tell us very much about the expectations for an assignment in advance of its due date. "
