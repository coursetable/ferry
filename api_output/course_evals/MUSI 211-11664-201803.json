            "\u00a0I learned about classical harmony as well as some of its applications in modern music. Topics included borrowed chords, chromaticism, and rhythmic dissonance. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more knowledge of theoretical concepts in music theory, including the analysis of songs, songwriting techniques, and an introduction to the vocabulary used across within music theory. ",
            "\u00a0Skills in music theory and analysis, some composition skills ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of music theory on the topics of meter, chromaticism, and more thorough explorations of tonal frameworks in music. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply more complex metrical and harmonic techniques from the western classical music to all of my listening and all of my music-writing. Bruschi taught every device in its context, aurally, notationally, and analytically. "

        [
            "\u00a0It covered a lot of material very quickly at times, but also some units were long and drawn out. A more even spacing of topics and homework assignments would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Generally a very well-structured and well-paced course! I loved that Michael Bruschi included a variety of musical genres in our analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very thorough in its approach and provides ample opportunity to use topics that were previously covered in the class later on. My main suggestion for improvement would be more focus on model composition. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the flexibility that professors have in choosing how and which material to cover. It allows them to tailor the course towards their strongest understandings and strongest teaching techniques, and thus allows students to benefit from their professors' specific expertise. The seminar size of the course allows for students to work 1 on 1 with their professors to ensure that their understandings and work are more than up to par. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course for someone interested in music at an analytical level. If you are just an every day musician with little classical experience, the learning curve will be steep, but you can succeed if you try hard. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in music theory, yes. I only took it so that I could get lessons for credit, and didn't have that much interest in the subjectbut I still found it relatively enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any music student or anyone looking to gain a greater understanding of the more technical side of music theory. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student who wanted to take a course that would challenge them to understand new musical theory concepts in their composition. Anyone who wants to better understand the techniques and structure behind what they are listening to and what they could be composing would benefit from taking this course. "
