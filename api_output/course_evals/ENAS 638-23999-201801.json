            "\u00a0This was a great course. I learned a lot and Desiree was one of the best professors I have ever had.\r\n\r\nHowever, this course was so much work. My hand would be tired after every class from writing so many notes so quickly. Also, I have never had a course that had a Final exam, Final Project AND Final Presentation. The homework was also really hard, but I learned a lot from them. ",
