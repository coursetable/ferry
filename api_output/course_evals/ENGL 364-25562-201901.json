            "\u00a0Became a far more adept, informed writer of journalistic style pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a little better, mostly because I was forced to write a lot. Same with conducting interviews. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton of useful reporting techniques, read many great journalistic articles, and thought more about journalistic ethics. The last was particularly useful. ",
            "\u00a0We met many accomplished journalists and got the chance to discuss their works and to hear about their experiences. I gained a lot of insight into journalism as a career. One of the topics we discussed in depth was the process of interviewing people for articles - whom to approach, how to approach them, and what kinds of questions to ask. Even though Im not going to go into journalism myself, it was really enlightening and changed the way I think about conversations with strangers. ",
            "\u00a0Packer taught so much about the mechanics and inner workings of reporting. Importantly, he didn't just make it strictly about how to write, but he also gave insight into what doing journalism really is like and answering deeper questions about journalism  whether they be ethical or more about looking at journalism as a whole. He brought a lot of amazing guest speakers including Larissa MacFarquar and Dexter Filkins  which was really amazing because they brought so much insight. We did our final piece as a journalistic reported piece, which was a fun way to end the year and tie everything we learned together. "

            "\u00a0Strength- George Packer and his incredible friends/coworkers/peers who visit class and speak candidly. Con-- only one meeting per week? Great class. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: George Packer has a lot of connections within journalism and so we were able to hear from a lot of influential speakers. He gave good feedback on assignments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Packer is sometimes too busy to really offer the one-on-one time seminars thrive on. Seemed like he was grading everyone on a very low scale relative to typical YC standards. Maybe a function of his attending Yale a while back. If the grades aren't pulled up at the end, they'll really hurt anyone who decided to take this class. If they are pulled up, it'll seem somewhat arbitrary -- as if he gave everyone low grades throughout so he could just decide at the end who he liked enough as a person to give an A. It will not seem like it's about the merit of the work, especially as we only got two grades during the semester and weren't given guidance on re-writes. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength was the guest speakers and the excellent selection of weekly readings. Both of these were great. The workshops of student pieces were also enjoyable and productive. I wish that we had spent more time talking about specific reporting techniques and talking about the structure/craft of the weekly readings on a sentence level (e.g., I wish that we had spent 10 minutes talking about just the first paragraph of Hiroshima). We did both these things in the first few weeks, then gradually moved more into big-picture discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Packer is really cool and experienced and gave great feedback during our in-class essay workshops. The guest speakers he invited were also incredibly interesting and I feel really lucky to have met them.\r\nWeaknesses: None really! This was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I was really engaged with the class. The readings were so interesting and class discussions were really well led by Packer. He made sure that the conversation flowed naturally and was never forced. He always brought good insight. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecturers every week were ridiculous. Cream of the crop of journalists who you get all to you and 15 other students. However, wish there had been more structure to how to best take advantage of these journalists and advice for writing. Wish there had been more discussion of how a piece was good and their approach towards good writing. Discussions were a bit unstructured was has its pros and cons. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! What an honor and joy it was to study with Professor Packer, really incredible amount of knowledge and ability that he was more than happy to share. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably moot because he'll be leaving. Packer is great. The class makes you write which is great. The in-class discussion probably varies with the students. The learning aspect is nothing incredible -- you could teach yourself everything by committing to reading/writing journalism for three months and getting some decent writers to read your work. The grades are not great. They're semi-random, you will not know what you get until the end and he seems to use the range of [B-, B+/A-] If you're planning on applying to anything that requires a good GPA, it's not worth it. All in all, do CR/D the class or audit it if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Taking Professor Packer's course is one of the best experiences I've had at Yale University. He is a truly special mentor, educator, and thinker, and I could not more highly recommend his class. You'll not only drastically improve your writing skills (Professor Packer takes the time to read through and line edit ALL of your assignments), but you'll also gain profound insights into the world of journalism, writing, art, and life. The class has deeply affected my worldview and my understanding of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ENGL 364 may not be on the level of 469 or 480, but its still a fantastic journalism course, particularly because of the guest speakers. A fair amount of work, but would definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If Professor Packer comes back to Yale and teaches this again, I would absolutely recommend the course - he has so much experience in the field. (My one regret is not going to his office hours because I was intimidated.) The assignments were also great and encouraged us to write about things we were passionate about - they were a hometown sketch and a long-form piece on any topic. After taking mostly lecture courses in previous semesters, I felt very lucky to get into this seminar and enjoyed it immensely. ",
            "\u00a0I'd really recommend this course. It's not everyday that you get to hear from such an insightful and prolific writer (and his writer friends). It is a writing and global course that is filled with accessible information. Packer makes himself available as a mentor and every class you come out with new information and ideas to mull over and think about in your free time and when you are writing. He is such a talented reporter and I was impressed with how much effort and care he put into the class every day. "
