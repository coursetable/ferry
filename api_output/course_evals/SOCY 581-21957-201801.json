            "\u00a0It was nice to get a review of the various methods, and I understand the benefits of being able to choose Stata or R to work with. However, because we could choose, and the expectation was on the TA's to teach the program specifics, we only had 40 minutes each week to learn the commands, which is just not enough time. I was often told by my TA to \"google it\" and after awhile, I got pretty frustrated because I felt like Google was teaching me Stata. I had to rely on the StatLab a lot, but they often refuse to help with homework, so it would be awkward and difficult to get help from them. Sometimes it was pointless to even go. Also, the homeworks were often vague and written in a disorganized, difficult to understand way where I wasn't quite sure what the questions were asking and if the answers I gave were correct. There were times where I would put in 10-15 hours into a homework assignment, and then I'd get a meaningless \"check mark\" as a score, and then times where I'd only put in 2-5 hours, and I'd still get the same \"check mark.\" That was really defeating. The lectures were helpful, but I wish that we went over the specific program commands in depth more and practiced how to do the various models in lecture so that we could get some introduction before the lab sections.
