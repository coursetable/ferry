            "\u00a0Strengths: Clearly organized, concise, clean, covers a lot of ground\r\nWeaknesses: Some discrepancies between what is taught in class vs what is taught in the book, doesn't dive into anything too heavily ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jason is a fun lecturer and clearly knows his stuff. Very interactive. Loved jason, didnt love the course >\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: course felt disorganized, very little cohesion between modules. Little to no focus on cognitive linguistics or history of languages. Guest lecturer came and presented an extremely complicated semantic theory while providing no empirical evidence of it being true ",
            "\u00a0The broad scope of the course works well in my opinion, and it's a very compelling introduction to the field. There are no glaring weaknesses I can think of. ",
            "\u00a0This course has the potential to be an interesting/fulfilling class. But it ultimately was not.\r\n\r\nLectures didn't appear to be connected and relate to readings in meaningful ways. There was no clear overarching goal or objective besides learning individual parts of linguistics (that we didn't connect and seemed fragmented/scattered). Could've focused on one language and spent the entire term analyzing it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shaw's engaging teaching style was a definite strength of this course. Even though our class was considered a lecture, it had the intimacy of a discussion section because of how Prof. Shaw encouraged everyone to participate. Each class was interesting and funny, and the energy was always high.\r\n\r\nA weakness of this course was conflicting sources of information, either from the assigned reading or given by the professor, which were never clarified or pointed out. As I and some other students were reviewing for the final exam, we became confused when we each had conflicting information, from different sources. It would be helpful if the professor could point out parts of the textbook reading which are \"under debate\" so we could consider those various perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a very good job of introducing the topics of morphology, phonology, and syntax. However, I found the section on semantics rather rushed, and I could not find many outside resources for the Lexico-Conceptual Structures we talked about in class. ",
            "\u00a0A major weakness (for me) to this course was that it just assumed everyone would be interested in the science in an academic sense, and did very little explain the applications of it to the modern world (for example, in AI language development). Sometimes the readings and the powerpoint disagreed, as there are many points that linguistics don't agree on and it is difficult to find internet resources. Also, the readings are mostly unnecessary (at least later in the semester) so that lightens the workload at least, and they're good review for quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were a little boring but thats more because of the material; Prof. Shaw was a very engaging professor and made even the more boring lectures as interesting as possible! ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting but could have been made more accessible for an introductory course. There was also a good amount of depth in the individual modules but not a great amount of connection between the modules (i.e. between the different sections of the course). I think using one textbook would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting, but the lectures, sections, and homework did not always connect and I was not alway sure what I was supposed to know or take away from each part of the course. ",
            "\u00a0strengths is that it is engaging ",
            "\u00a0The grading structure makes it so that individual assignments and exams arent worth so much, which is great, but take note: the homeworks are HARD. I wish theyd been a little bit more digestible at times and that the intructions were clearer. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thorough and provided a good overview of the material. The only room for improvement was the lack of challenge in most cases, although there was a strange difficulty spike towards the center that fell again. ",
            "\u00a0It was awesome. The environment in class was super relaxed, prof. Shaw made an effort to know us by name and it felt like a real learning environment with lots of questions and interest. I like the pace of the class being a little slow as it was to allow room for exploration and questions--I think the workload was perfect. This class will tell you whether you like linguistics or not, but you will enjoy it either way. Can't go wrong.\r\n\r\nSection was a bit useless and I stopped going, but its there for more questions and HW review I guess. "

            "\u00a0I took this course because I thought I might be interested in linguistics, but I would not recommend it to another student who is in the same position. The course doesn't really connect with other disciplines, and I found most of the knowledge gained to be fairly specific to linguistics. However, if you know that's what you're into, then power to you. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! For anyone who's enjoyed studying a language before, take this class! It will broaden your understanding of language as a whole, and you'll get to interact with the words and grammars of all sorts of languages in very interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and had so much fun taking the class with Jason Shaw. I would definitely recommend the course to anyone interested in languages but with little background in formal Linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course for anyone interested in learning about a scientific approach to language, and obviously a great intro class for prospective linguistics majors. The first unit was the most interesting to me when we discussed how language is a human instinct and global/cultural trends, and I enjoyed learning the international phonetic alphabet. After that, it gets more nitty-gritty in a way that was not super exciting to me. ",
            "\u00a0Sure! Its helpful to watch review videos on your own to have material explained multiple ways. ",

            "\u00a0only if needed ",
            "\u00a0Certainly an interesting subject matter; can be hard to grasp at times. Often rather abstract subjects. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. If you have any inkling of interest in language, just take it. "
