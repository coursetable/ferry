            "\u00a0Though I have taken a few QM/QFT courses while undergrad, this course has refreshed me on a lot of the concepts and topics about quantum mechanics; There are quite a few topics in which Prof. Appelquist used a totally different approach and gave another way of understanding things. ",
            "\u00a0The course solidified several concepts from undergrad qm. It also covered some new topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot. ",

            "\u00a0Weakness: another typical undergraduate course. Unnecessary in a graduate program. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps connect the material to experiments more often. I know that it is a theory course, but not all of us are theoretical CM/AMO physicists. I'm a cosmologist and am already annoyed at having to take two semesters of quantum mechanics, so I would really enjoy learning more of how QM is studied experimentally rather than talking about nothing other than Hilbert space. ",
            "\u00a0This course seems to lack coherent structure and goals. The lectures and homework sometimes went together but frequently did not have clear connections to each other, and neither the lectures nor the homework had clear connections to the material tested on the exams. Clearer connections between what is important in the lectures and what is important on exams and homework would definitely improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would appreciate a more historical/experimental focus.  If the material could be presented along with the historical experiments that inform our understanding of quantum, I think the overall understanding would improve (we would understand \"why\" we have to represent things in such an alien and abstract way). ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course is very good and every topic was arranged in a logic way. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very clear, and really well organized. You can clearly follow the instructor as long as you pay enough attention. The only improvement I can think of is that more material should be covered; The amount and level of the course kind of falls below (my personal) impression of graduate level QM. Especially, the first chapter can be speeded up a little, to allow more time for later topics. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very dry and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The material flowed very coherently and the problem sets, while not too challenging, required the students to understand the concepts. ",

Some topics that are not covered at the undergraduate level are investigated such as the Feynman Path Integral and hydrogen atom symmetries.  I would recommend this course to any student who would like to receive a formal introduction to quantum mechanics. ",
