            "\u00a0This course was extremely helpful for developing basic communication skills in Russian. Within just a semester, we were able to cover five of the six cases in Russian and build a significant vocabulary base. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned the basics of Russian reading, speaking, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned more confidence beginning a new language. I learned about russian culture and history in addition to the language, and gained my first exposure to russian poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak russian at an elementary level and learned a few russian poems. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty great introductory course in Russian and a good understanding of the first five cases of Russian language and basic Russian grammar. A native Russian speaker who looked over some of my writing said he was \"amazed\" by how much we covered for an L1 course. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Russian language learning ",
            "\u00a0A basic understanding of the modern Russian language structure. A foundation for a future of Russian studies. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a beginners understanding and knowledge of Russian grammar, vocabulary and basic cultural ideas. Also was interesting to see how different languages can be constructed, because Russian is very different to English. ",
            "\u00a0My russian language skills improved immensely, and I furthered my interest in studying russian culture and history as well. ",
            "\u00a0By taking RUSS 110 have I not only learnt the basics in the Russian language, but I was also greatly immersed in the Russian culture. ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to Russian and basic reading and speaking skills. "

        [
            "\u00a0The fact that the course meets daily is a strength in that it allows students to develop speaking skills at a rapid pace. The homework is also really helpful for getting feedback on writing skills.\r\nIt might be helpful to integrate more of the vocabulary into class. We often worked with the same vocabulary words throughout the semester and learned the new vocabulary for each unit on our own, which is still effective, but using a higher proportion of the new vocabulary more in class could make absorbing it easier. ",
            "\u00a0Russian L1 is terrific. Julia and the TAs are always willing to help students learn and challenge you without trying to trick you. It's hard to think of ways to improve the course, but I think I would have benefited from more practice resources on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0This course uses a very helpful textbook, and the amount of homework was manageable but still enough to ensure regular practice and real understanding. Class was engaging and a wonderful start to every day. ",
            "\u00a0Very good teaching and good resources however more reading out loud would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Julia is amazing. The class bonds a lot and classtime can be really fun as she is eccentric and fun, and some of the weird stuff she says brings the class together. Everything is generally well planned out and the TAs are very fun and approachable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Russian is just very tough so there can be some points of extreme confusion and it could take a few days to get used to the material. Also if you're a very sensitive person you may not be used to getting roasted by Julia at times (all in good spirit). ",
            "\u00a0Maybe less time on the first two cases and more time on the last two, Dative and Instrumental ",
            "\u00a0S: consistent homework, regular review of past materials, engaging professor/TA\r\nW: few, if any ",
            "\u00a0Julia is very dedicated and very understanding. I loved attending class every day and wouldn't change anything. ",
            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed the high level of engagement in the class. It was never boring and I was excited to go to class every day. \r\nI really cannot think of any weaknesses. RUSS 110 was definitely my most favorite class this semester. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Russian is a challenging language, but this makes learning it all the more fulfilling. Yale also has a great community for Russian-learners, so there are lots of Russian cultural activities on campus. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Russian is not only a valuable language to learn, but Yale's department is really strong and conducive to learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it. The program is a fantastic way to begin studying a language you may be initially intimidated by. In addition, it was really fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes and I really liked the instructors and was excited by reading russian so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, if they are at all considering Russian . ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's the only class I enjoyed this semester ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I have studied many languages in the past, and comparatively RUSS110 provided the most engaging environment with the most knowledgable teaching staff. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in Russian, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Julia is the best, and I regret not strtin russian earlier. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. Russian is a very interesting and beautiful language, but also difficult to learn. However, the approach Julia and the teaching fellows used made it really easy/efficient to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to take russian. "
