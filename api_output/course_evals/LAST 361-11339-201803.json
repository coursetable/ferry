            "\u00a0I came into this class knowing very little about Brazil. Throughout this course I've learned so much about the politics, culture, and history of Brazil, precolonial to present.

            "\u00a0Stuart Schwartz's History of Brazil is one of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. A double major in European history and economics, this class kept me spellbound. The 75 minutes fly by with some of the most intriguing stories of a nation every compiled. You'll learn about a country forged through imperialism, monarchy, republican ferment, military dictators, and socialist governments. You'll consider some of the most intriguing social dynamics of any course: the relationships between the developing and those left behind, the European and the indigenous, the unparalleled racial diversity, and popular intellectual tumult shared by all Brazilians. This class is a credit to Yale and to Professor Schwartz. Take it, you'll be glad you did. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Brazil's history from colonial times to the modern day and themes such as informal power structures and misguided executive decisions regarding governing, economics, and development that have held Brazil back ",

I learned about the products that have shaped not only Brazil's economy - such as coffee, sugar, or gold - but also how those products have influenced social and political structures. Finally, I now understand the importance of the military in Brazil. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great TFs and Professor Schwartz is an incredibly engaging lecturer!\r\nWeaknesses: Although most of the readings are interesting, the Fausto text is difficult to understand. It's very dense and not all that well organized. I would have appreciated it had the readings been slightly shorter or more evenly spread out throughout the semester. While at the beginning of the course the reading was manageable, we were assigned two full books (the Vargas text and Samba) and a large portion of the Fausto text over the Thanksgiving break. It was difficult to manage. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schwartz is extremely knowledgeable and his work was cited in many of the other texts we read and in many of the sources that I used for my paper, which was cool. As with many lecture classes, the TFs are the ones who do more of the teaching (in section and with research papers), and my TF, Hannah, was excellent. Because we covered such a vast time period and spent much of it on colonial Brazil, it sometimes felt like the course lacked depth. Many of the names and figures blended together, though exams tended to be easy and I still felt I gained a very solid working knowledge of Brazilian history. Lectures were typically pretty interesting, and although our primary textbook was dense and dry, the other books are articles were usually good. ",
            "\u00a0The earlier lectures about colonial Brazil were a strength of this course as that seemed to be the stuff that Professor Schwartz was most passionate about. I felt as though the class got less engaging and organized as we got closer to the modern day, but the information was still pretty interesting. The class also had some pretty good readings. ",
            "\u00a0History of Brazil is an incredibly enjoyable course. While the lectures are long, Stuart Schwartz keeps them interesting with lots of wonderful anecdotes and photos he has taken himself. Moreover, the course material is fascinating - it is so rewarding to trace a country's history over the course of hundreds of years. \r\n\r\nThe one weakness of the course was the quality of the assigned readings. Besides a few highlights (such Alma Guillermoprieto's Samba), I found most of the course readings to be dull and/or poorly written and confusing. Such sharply contrasted with the interesting and informative lectures. While you definitely don't have to do all the reading for the course, it would have been nice to have more stimulating texts. ",
            "\u00a0Stuart Schwartz is incredible. He's one of the most devoted and earnest professors I have ever studied under. His relationship to Brazil is so precise, informed and personal that you'll leave the course sharing in the sentiments of Brazilians. I have never understood a nation, including my own, quite like Professor Schwartz describes Brazil. He's a Yale treasure. ",
            "\u00a0having section plus two 75 minute classes per week was beyond excessive, given that a ton of info was repeated every lecture. He said he wouldn't keep us for the whole period every time, but there were maybe 2 instances all semester when we got out before 12:50. It was too much. ",
            "\u00a0It is honestly perfectly organized, I have no complaints; lectures were at a good time, well structured and paced, and fascinating, and section helped reinforce the topics not only from lecture but also from the readings ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schwartz was an amazing lecturer and provided fascinating accounts of life in Brazil. Extremely knowledgable about the subject and the TFs were very dedicated in learning the material alongside the students. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great synopsis of reading material. I think Professor Schwartz had a great selection of books to read from, as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very broad scope and thorough coverage of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are great, can't think of too much to improve ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include an enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor, interesting and engrossing lectures, and good book choices. Given that the course spans a long time period, it is understandable that some points of the lecture are more cursory. However, the final essay is a good opportunity for students to delve into topics that are not given as much attention or detail during lecture time. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is amazing, so lecture is a great portion of the class to attend. While section doesnt do the class justice. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we connected different themes more, but I enjoyed how relevant the books were to the course. I wish we couldve learned more about present day Brazil. ",

            "\u00a0Great lectures, well organized tests. Section can be improved by offering more of a lecture style review ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a very broad overview of Brazilian history from 1500 (colonization) to the early 2000s. It was a good class overall - lectures were engaging and interesting, the TAs were excellent, and the assignments were very reasonable.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not well organized - the lecture slides were not useful at all and were very disorganized. The readings changed from the original syllabus, and the reading for section was quite imbalanced, with two books one week, and just one short essay in another. This made it difficult to keep up sometimes. I was also disappointed that the class started in 1500, with the colonial history of Brazil. There was a long history of the region before European arrival, and this was, for the most part, ignored. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture and the readings provided a great foundation for learning, and section allowed us to delve deeper. Great course setup. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the structure of the course was very good, the whole semester was supposed to cover 500 years of Brazilian history which can be difficult but I thought it was well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Schwartz is by far this classes biggest win. He made the history of Brazil relatable and emphasized the bigger picture within all the themes. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely incredible. Professor Schwartz tells the history of Brazil as one long story, constantly bringing you back to themes that continue to influence and shape Brazil over time. His lectures were fascinating and clear. I loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0The level of engagement was low. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schwartz is the main strength of this course. His lectures are so detailed and interesting. Additionally, the TA's are great. Although, I wish the material we discussed in section also related to the material we were discussing in lecture that week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong in covering colonial Brazil and the First Republic. The course material tends to be weaker in covering the last few decades, from the 80s and onwards. ",
            "\u00a0Expansive coverage of the topics though I wish the modern day (2000-onwards) would have had a greater focus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is engaging, with interesting readings and a balanced workload. Being able to write the paper on any period of Brazilian history and getting to research it was pretty cool. Only slight criticism is that lectures sometimes drifted towards the end due to the 75 minute run time, but this was pretty minor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Schwartz's lectures, TA's, breadth of material\r\nWeaknesses- Too heavy on the reading, class lecture is also too long and can be condensed to 50 minutes, as Professor Schwartz oftentimes spent the first 20-30 mins recapping what we learned last week, if the class persisted in being 1.5 hours, then there shouldn't be a section "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you're looking to take a Latin American history class or you're just interested in learning more about Brazil, this class is perfect. Facilitated for student learning, not all that hard to manage, engaging but not too difficult, even for non-majors. ",
            "\u00a0Though I liked this course during shopping period, I probably would not have taken it except for the fact that Professor Schwartz told me I could get a pre-industrial credit if my research paper focused on a pre-industrial topic. It was pretty easy, which was kind of nice - just 2 lectures each week (plus section), a midterm, a 4-6 page research paper, and a final. I think it provided a good foundation of Brazilian history, but it wasn't the most fascinating course ever. I'd recommended it if you're looking for an easy history lecture and have interest in Brazil. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I would say take it. Professor Schwartz is a really nice guy and you probably wouldn't learn any of this material in another class. There's a ton of readings assigned so if you do them all the workload will be high. Overall a solid, traditional history lecture ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Schwartz is a joy to listen to - he is genuinely so excited about Brazil and wants everyone in the class to be, too. The course also stresses the differences and similarities between Brazil and the United States - which is really fascinating, as most Americans do not realize how much our country's history has in common with that of Brazil (colonialism, slavery, European immigration, industrialization, multi-racial societies, etc). The workload is very, very light, and the midterm and one required 4-6 page paper are quite easy. Everyone at Yale looking to learn more about a fascinating country from a wonderful professor (or for a 5th class with a light workload) should take this course! ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredible, a testament to Yale, the history department, and Professor Schwartz. There are so few classes out there where the level of teaching is so personal and expressive, so meaningful and resonant, that you become interested in something that you never thought you'd find so curious. Professor Schwartz is one of the best professors at Yale, he's a gem. Don't take a gut, don't take just another prerequisite, take History of Brazil and find out what Yale academics is all about. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, interesting to learn about South America and Brazil's place within this context. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. This is a great look into world politics and development since 1500, not just Brazil. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it if you know nothing about Brazil (like I did) and want to know more about it. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. One of my favorite classes at Yale so far. Not too hard, but still so interesting and engaging. ",
