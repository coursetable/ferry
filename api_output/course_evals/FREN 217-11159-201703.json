            "\u00a0An incredible class. I learned so much from Professor Duval, who is truly an expert in this subject. I not only increased my familiarity with a literary canon that I had no prior experience with, I developed my french speaking, writing, and analytical skills, although I still have a long way to go. ",
            "\u00a0General historical understanding of key tenets of the French literary renaissance as well as improved literary analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0Since most people have not read the authors on the syllabus, this course provides a great introduction to the most important of their works. Covered here are the big names of the Renaissance: Rabelais, Scve, Du Bellay, Ronsard, Marguerite de Navarre, Louise Lab, D'Aubingn, Montaigne, Corneille. And not only are they intellectually worth reading, but they're actually interesting, entertaining, and great as works of literature. (No wonder they're still being read.) Because it is the Renaissance, after all, it definitely helps to have some background in classical literature (DS helps), but it's not necessary. You'll cover works of drama, prose, and poetry, with a range of topics and styles. All are great. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the French Renaissance and how the political/social/religious climate influenced literature. I feel I really developed my way of thinking about literature and making connections between writers and the contexts in which they worked. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class is extraordinary in almost every way. Professor Duval is kind and caring, the syllabus is engaging, and the required reading is not at all overwhelming. The grading scheme is a little harsh, but Professor Duval is exceedingly fair and is willing to give you a better grade if you apply his comments to your next paper. However, don't expect to be able to get an A-range grade in this class easily, if at all; it is a very challenging grading scale. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic. The works selected are diverse and thoughtful, and professor Duval is an amazing professor-just listening to him speak is a privilege. It would be nice to have the opportunity to go over essays with him; he gives very good written feedback but without being able to present drafts it can be difficult to see how you can improve an essay before handing in the finished product. ",
            "\u00a0If there are weaknesses, it's that we move fairly quickly between authors, but that's of course to be expected with a survey course. And even at this pace, I felt like I at least got a god grasp on what we did read from each author and in most cases was encouraged to read more from each. \r\n\r\nThe strengths are above all how it's taught, because Professor Duval is an expert not only on several of the authors we study but also at directing a seminar. He makes sure everyone is engaged and always left us with a better understanding of the texts. \r\n\r\nThe class is structured as a small seminar. Ours was six people, so everyone had to speak. Professor Duval made sure of this, as he will cold-call people who haven't volunteered. More than trying to trip you up, he wants to see that you've read and have some thoughts about the text. Professor Duval tries to ask answerable questions that will eventually build toward a broader, more high-stakes culmination. These epiphany moments are always great. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were all amazing and discussions were illuminating. I might have appreciated a bit more specificity in essay topics just so I had something to work with. Since essay topics were always on passages we had NOT read or discussed, sometimes I didn't feel the need to engage as fully in discussions about passages that wouldn't come up, and I would have to either do a lot of extra reading to pick a passage I wanted to write on, or I would just pick the first extra passage suggested because the extra passages hadn't been on the syllabus so I hadn't read all of them. Finally, I wish we had been able to read a bit more of some of the longer works like Gargantua and Heptameron. The parts we read were wonderful and I wish we had been assigned more to read and discuss in the syllabus rather than just reading extra parts on our own for papers. "

            "\u00a0Pas facile, mais j'aime M. Duval et sa slection de littrature! Bien entendu, PAS FACILE! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! I took the course Credit-D, which made a world of difference, but it was still an engaging and challenging class that I put a lot of work into. I would recommend this course only if you are confident in your french speaking ability. While there is certainly room to improve on your writing and reading, the class is small and the seminar style demands that all students be able to participate. Long story short, you will have to speak in french every class, and Professor Duval will make sure to ask you questions if your comment is not precise. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Too bad this class probably won't be offered again since Prof. Duval is phasing into retirement. While readings weren't too heavy in terms of quantity, they were often dense and rather difficult to follow at times. That said, I always left class feeling that I had gained a meaningful understanding of the texts thanks to Prof. Duval's enlightening readings and explications. As for the texts themselves, you ought\r\nto study themespecially in dialogue with each other, as the syllabus aptly encouragesif you love literature, and especially if you're a French major. The class requires quite a bit of writing, and this may seem irritating in the moment, but it will vastly improve your written French. Prof. Duval is also supremely thoughtful in his comments on papers, and he's one of the top two most caring professors I've encountered at Yale. Needless to say, I will sorely miss this class, especially seeing as the French department seems to be cutting the number of classes conducted in French... ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The material and professor are fantastic; just note that the reading load can be heavy at times, but is not unbearable. Doing all the readings in one night may be difficult at times, so try to spread them out. ",
            "\u00a0YES! There is no reason not to take it. It is one of the best undergraduate French classes (in French!) offered with one of the (if not THE) best professor in the department (his French is impeccable, and yours will definitely improve). You will read great works, have fruitful discussions, improve your writing and speaking, and learn a lot. TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The readings are tough at first but you get so much better and Prof. Duval makes everything better. Sometimes it seems like he expects too much and you might feel like you know nothing but you'll find that actually you learn a lot and all the assignments and exam are challenging in a good way. It's such an interesting course and I loved it so much. "
