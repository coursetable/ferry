            "\u00a0I learned how to apply psychological research to philosophical questions in order to think about them from a different angle. I got good at analyzing and critiquing arguments and at forming my own opinions about all these foundational philosophical issues such as the self, free will, and the mind-body debate. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me the resources to explore the interesting field that is Experimental Philosophy. The various studies and texts we discussed in class showed me that philosophy can be more than what it currently is. This class gave me the confidence to think big about the intersection of cogsci and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the background and history on a broad range of prominent philosophical ideas. Furthermore, I learned how to analyze philosophy papers and synthesize arguments and counterexamples in many different topics of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned rigorous philosophical frameworks that help me ask more interesting questions about how the mind thinks about abstract concepts, gained an opinion on these frameworks, and learned to evaluate philosophy-related psychology research. ",
            "\u00a0Did readings in and had class discussions about the mind-body problem, definitions of morality, self-identity, and other philosophical topics relevant to psychological questions. ",
            "\u00a0A good overview of philosophy and its psychological underpinnings. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of both historical and modern arguments in the philosophy of morality, mind and body, free will, the self, and causation. Having never taken a philosophy course before, I nonetheless found this course interesting and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned how to integrate philosophical reasoning and empirical data.  I learned about experimental design and data analysis, and I also gained an understanding of the long-standing philosophical debates about free will, the mind-body problem, the source of moral authority, and the nature of causation. I held some unpopular opinions in this class, and am very glad I did; the discussion format really helped me test and refine me ideas. ",

            "\u00a0The course is well-taught and I found all the readings really interesting. Discussion was a bit unequal with several people dominating most classes. I really liked writing the papers for this class as I got to apply the material differently than I have in previous classes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was very interesting and engaging. I think the weekly reading responses were a good way make students accountable for the readings, and the freedom of discussion in every class allowed me to learn just as much from the readings as from the ideas proposed by my classmates. The only critique I have for this class is that I wish we engaged a little more directly with the readings at times; when it came to final exam preparations, I felt a little underprepared to recognize specific arguments and passages by specific authors. Otherwise, the class was incredibly interesting and stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0The test and papers were very reasonable and tested for understanding, rather than just memorization. \r\n\r\nDiscussions were well-facilitated and so the discussion always stayed on track. ",
            "\u00a0Topics were thoroughly covered, but the readings weren't the most interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly interesting and was an amazing introduction to philosophy--it made me want to take a lot more philosophy classes! Seminar discussions were very structured, which I loved. The class syllabus was also very well organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent, and I'm not sure how I would improve it. Perhaps there should be three short papers instead of two long ones, but even the current arrangement was fine. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I felt that productive lines of discussion where ended prematurely to ensure that we touched on all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion section format was really interesting ",
            "\u00a0Very open but as a result is very structurally loose. "

I found the issues to be really interesting and complex but also felt that I was able to come to some conclusions for myself based on what I thought about in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably my favorite course ever at Yale. Prof. Knobe is brilliant in his fluid explanations of difficult subject matter, and has an amazing command over a sometimes chaotic classroom discussion. The papers are challenging in their vast openness, but rewarding. The subject material is fascinating and a great balance between analytic rigor and intuitively gripping stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course. The subject matter discussed in every class is engaging and interesting, and students are challenged to think very deeply about issues. At the same time, the workload is reasonable and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course if you are interested in how the mind thinks about the self, free will, the mind-body problem and morality. You'll learn under the best in the field and come out being more articulate in philosophical concepts and better-prepared to apply them in psychological experiments or evaluating them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you read the syllabus and know that you're specifically interested in those topics. ",
            "\u00a0I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the intersection between psychology and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any psychologist or cognitive scientist looking to learn about philosophy, or really anyone looking for a fun and thought-provoking introduction to the subject with minimal history and maximal application to science. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any student who is interested in philosophy, psychology, or both. Professor Knobe is excellent, and he does a great job selecting readings and leading discussions during class. I would highly recommend going to his office hours if you don't understand some of the (sometimes very complicated) concepts we discuss in class; he is really good at clearing up misconceptions. ",
            "\u00a0A great introductory course to philosophy (as someone who never really took any courses in the subject) "
