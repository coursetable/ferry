            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone interested in American voters in politics, rather than say, the presidents, parties or governments, should take this. And the literatures transfer well to considering voting in other democratic countries too. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Take this class. The syllabus is wonderful, and there are extra readings beyond what is required. John is incredibly supportive, so start your final paper early and you'll have a great time working on it! "
