            "\u00a0I think the syllabus is very strong and Entel is obviously very well read and knowledgable. The only issue, particularly at the beginning of the course, was that there were way too many readings assigned and it was impossible to get them done since many were so dense. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was great and the readings were all super interesting. I learned a lot in class and especially doing individual research for papers. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you're really into political philosophy and/or 20th century philosophy. Entel is a capable seminar leader and very knowledgable about the subject matter, but at times the discussions are slow and a little boring. Most importantly though, the class is mainly for people who are serious about studying political thought since most of the discussions are about the nitty-gritty of the readings and, fittingly, many of these readings are dense and will require time to digest and understand. Still though, the readings were consistently interesting and very manageable in terms of page length. Also, there are only two major papers (8-10 pages) and short weekly reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a great way to dive into modern day philosophical arguments, while also being introduced to some of the pre-modern theories as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone that is interested in political philosophy, but wants to familiarize themselves more with the direction of the field in response to the World Wars, and before the work of Rawls and the like. ",
            "\u00a0Only if the student is well versed in introductory political philosophy. But Lucas is very patient and allows for good understanding. "
