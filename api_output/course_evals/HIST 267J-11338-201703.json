            "\u00a0I learned a bit about how to write a proper research paper. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to read a LOT of history ",
            "\u00a0This class accomplished everything that a seminar is supposed to accomplish and made it enjoyable. I feel like I've learned a lot about engaging primary and secondary sources and entering historiographical debates. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that through this course I gained a much stronger foundation in research methodologies. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned what it means to:\r\n\r\n1) be a historian. I've never actually done historical research, so this class was really eye opening for me in terms of actually learning what it means to engage in the art of history and the principles and rules that govern the field. I took up a pretty tough final paper topic in terms of their not being a lot of source material out there, and with Dr. Wilson's help I took a pretty solid shot at writing something original. ",
            "\u00a0I'd never written a historiography before, so I learned how to analyze other people's works and look at them in a different way. I also learned more about maritime history than I ever thought I'd know - I don't really want to major in anything related to history, but it was interesting to learn about a field that I otherwise wouldn't have. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Wilson's class provides valuable insight into a period of maritime, naval, and military history and is quite unique in the undergraduate curriculum. The readings, lectures, and class discussions contribute to greater understanding of sailing warships and naval warfare between 1492 and the 1830s (when steamships were introduced). However, the class essentially ends with discussions about the Napoleonic wars so one could argue that the period covered only stretches from 1492 and 1815. The subject material covered not only touches on favourite topics like piracy, ships of the line, and large battles, but also looks at ship life, gender roles, concepts of total war, and the fiscal military state. I think that this class can offer interesting lessons to anyone who enjoys learning about early modern history and Napoleonic history. If you're looking for a class that confirms your childhood stereotypes from the incredibly accurate Pirate of the Caribbean films, this class is not for you. That is a good thing.\r\n\r\nThe final research paper gives you an opportunity to thoroughly research and write about a topic you would never have dreamed about at the beginning of the semester. Because this class is targeted at sophomores and juniors, the essay is excellent practice for a senior thesis. "

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nrather robust seminar discussions, despite a 9:25 start\r\nProf. Wilson\r\nyou learn a lot about writing a research paper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImprovements:\r\n\r\nI personally wish that this class focused a little bit more on battles, tactics, and admirals, but hey- that's history at Yale for ya\r\n\r\nI would have preferred if the historiography essay was due a week earlier, and then a rough draft of the final essay would be due a week before the final draft is due. I think this would enhance the quality of the final paper, and would also give people a better idea of where they stand grade-wise in the class.\r\n\r\nMaybe one fewer reading per week would encourage people to actually do all the readings? Towards the end, I increasingly either skimmed, or skipped the occasional reading, although in the beginning of the semester I did most of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness - As was made clear early on, we sometimes read things and never discussed them in class. I personally am not  fan of this as it can discourage participation in reading assignments etc.\r\n\r\nStrength - The course was structured so that you get out what you put in, which made it an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed all of our class discussions. The sources that we read were all well selected and informative, and Professor Wilson's structure of the discussions were very well planned and helped us engage with the reading. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed Dr. Wilson's teaching style and how he used dynamic exercises in order to bring everyone in the close into the discussion. I do wish, however, that there had been a bit more critical discussion of the works or more guiding comments from Dr. Wilson, who obviously is an authority on this topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Wilson is great. Keeps class engaging, picks interesting topics, and manages to build each individual module into a broader class narrative. Also the class was cool in that it let you explore whatever topic within the course you wanted, and really dig deep into it after he gave you the tools to go after it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A little more help with the primary research. It was hard to find new, unique material to write about, and while Dr. Wilson definitely did a lot to help, at some points it seemed very difficult to actually find enough material for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that the class wasn't a lecture - I think sitting and listening to someone talk for two hours would've made it hard to focus and learn. I also liked that we did a new topic every week. \r\n\r\nI didn't like the way we learned how to cite in Chicago style. I think it would've been a little easier to just tell us how to cite our sources in the footnotes and in the bibliography, or to give us a link to a website that would do that. ",
            "\u00a0It is clear that Dr. Wilson is an expert in the field. While I enjoyed some of the topics better than others, each week class was interesting and the seminar flew by. During class, I particularly enjoyed the group activities, which helped to clarify the main ideas of the readings and provide further insight. Overall, I would say that this is one of the top 3 classes I have taken at Yale so far. I have only two complaints about this course. First, while class discussions were often engaging, sometimes they turned into a dialogue between Dr. Wilson and one or two other students. It would be a good idea to minimize this kind of interaction in the future in order to keep the entire class involved in the conversation. Second, I was a little disappointed by the lack of guest speakers. Last year, many of the reviews cited the guest speakers as the best part of the course. In fact, many of the guest speakers from last year were actually authors of the sources we read. Maybe these speakers will return when the class runs in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class could be improved by adding greater emphasis on the readings during discussions. Sometimes I found my prior knowledge on topics could substitute some of the readings. Sometimes I think my classmates and I could justify blowing through the course material without closely analyzing it because not a lot of effort was required to participate in the discussion "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A very good course!\r\n\r\nTake it if you:\r\n-care a lot about robust, interesting seminar discussion\r\n-like having a great professor\r\n-want to learn how to write a real history research paper\r\n-want to learn about ALL elements of naval warfare (from sociology to tactics)\r\n\r\nThis might not be for you if:\r\n-all you care about is a 4.0 (Wilson is a firm but fair grader)\r\n-you want the class to be about one specific thing, instead of a survey ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class. It's great that Professor Wilson is young and has been in the shoes of a Yale undergrad, and he is killing it despite this being a relatively new class. Its already great, but I feel like this class will also get better with every year of experience. ",
            "\u00a0Such an incredible seminar! If you do the reading, coming to class will be fun and Professor Wilson was excellent at leading discussions and giving us feedback on our semester-long research projects. If you can get in, TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Dr. Wilson is a brilliant mind, but also as a relatively recent Yale College graduate understands the realities of student involvement and works to keep everyone engaged. Also a great way to practice writing a long original research/thesis paper before the senior thesis. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. Professor Wilson is one of the best professors I have met at Yale. He is clearly passionate about both the topic and the students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you want to be a history major, and have even a passing interest in maritime history or European history, this is a must take class. It's fascinating, Dr. Wilson is a goddamn rockstar (and also very funny), and it's a great way to get directed help dipping your toes into what it means to engage with the discipline of history. \r\n\r\nOne downside is sometimes the readings are brutally boring. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who was interested in maritime history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to any student who is interested in military history or learning about the formation of the modern states. I also think that every student (no matter how unique they are) could take something away from this class, even if the most fun he or she had was learning about pirates. "
