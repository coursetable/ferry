This class was truly fascinating and was basically split into three types of technologies, each in accordance with a different type of physics - electricity and magnetism, optics, and quantum mechanics.

There are weekly psets based on what was taught in class, though many questions on them (each pset has an average of 4 multi-part questions) push you to extrapolate from these concepts and apply them in a more advanced way. For this, you should attempt the problems then go to office hours to think through them with other students and Professor Miller, who is really kind and willing to take time explaining things if you show you're making an effort. You're allowed one page of your own notes for the exams, but that does not mean they're easy. In fact, the exams are fairly challenging if you don't have a strong science background, especially in physics. It's not the most fun science/QR, but it's also pretty useful if you want to know (basically) how things work. ",

The professor is the most caring and charismatic of any I've had at Yale, the assignments are fair (1-2 hours a week for most problem sets), the exams are doable, and the lectures are gripping. I would have liked for the class to be a bit more mathematically rigorous, but given that this is a no prerequisite QR course, that's to be expected. Exams are a bit long but fair. For me, this was a very enjoyable SC credit taken in addition to a heavy course load, and it was never too stressful. ",
            "\u00a0for a class targeted at non-STEM majors, it relied heavily on previous exposure to a lot of complex STEM concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lay in TA's helping with problem sets; however, they were unable to help with understanding the larger trends of the course (not their own fault, but because of how they course was designed. They were unable to participate or give much input). \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were many. While the instructor was not inherently terrible, the way he designed the course made his lectures extremely unhelpful nor insightful. The main weakness was that there was no consistent source from which topics could be studied and learned. For a course that is essentially a college physics course (though I would not put it at that level, because those courses are much more organized and have much more resources), this course had little to no consistent source of information. Material would be introduced in lecture, but problem sets would be exponentially more difficult and complex. While this would be fine in any other course, the issue was that there was no where to turn to learn more, other than \"google\" as we were constantly referred to. This led to long searches through obscure websites for answers to specific questions that did nothing to further our understanding of the topic at whole. There was no textbook, which would have been extremely helpful to turn to for an understanding of what the heck was going on. Again, the instructor would probably have been able to teach sufficiently well from a textbook, but given the course structure, he was of little to no help. It was frustrating, especially considering that many students were struggling and dissatisfied, and very little was done to remediate the larger underlying issues (though the mid semester review did yield some positive results, like a slower pace). However, a slower pace with more of the same just gave us more time to slog through fewer subjects that were still poorly taught. ",
            "\u00a0Good course, interesting topics ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was its excellent syllabus, which related a lot of distinct concepts and gave an overview of a lot of modern technologies. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this course is the lack of a textbook and assumed knowledge of higher level math (lots of trig, natural log, and more that isn't covered in class). ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated when we started with a tangible product, such as MRI, and then learned the underlying concepts, as opposed to learning the underlying concepts abstractly and applying them later. ",
            "\u00a0This course is deceptively difficult. I think it would be better if it were MORE math intensive and less descriptive. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning, the course was much more difficult and the slides were less comprehensive. There is definitely a huge disconnect between the difficulty of material presented in lecture and the psets. However, the professor was receptive to feedback, made the material easier and gave students more resources for help. The TAs weren't very helpful and present. There should be additional resources and support, especially for students who don't come from a STEM background. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Miller is a really great professor and was very helpful in listening to the general consensus about the pace of the course. In addition, there were a lot of opportunities for office hours and the graded material felt very representative of what we were supposed to be learning in this course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets could definitely have been tougher and pushed our understanding of the material to a greater extent, especially since the exams were very difficult. It often felt like I'd breeze through the problem sets smoothly, but then be stuck on an exam question because I didn't understand the material to a sufficient depth. ",
            "\u00a0done well ",
            "\u00a0Prof Miller already knows this, but the first part of the course (the EM stuff) was significantly more difficult than the rest of the course. I think maybe we should have taken it more slowly. ",
            "\u00a0The course is truly accessible to someone without much of a physics background (e.g. me). I really appreciated the class notes that Professor Miller posts for every class. That said, some of the problem sets were very challenging, and I had to resort to Google to try to answer them. I wish he had gone over problem set problems in class as he did later in the course much earlier. I also wish we went over the math more because though equations can be intimidating, I believe they can really be used to explain more abstract concepts that are hard to grasp. ",
            "\u00a0The program of the course is exciting and engaging. I feel that I learned about many things which effect me on a daily basis. In terms of pacing, I thought the first unit of the course moved a little too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-designed and well-taught. By the middle of the semester, Professor Miller had established a good pace for the lectures and a fair  structure for the exams. The psets were manageable and instructive, though many questions would be difficult to do without outside guidance, I think. More in-class demonstrations, if possible, could be helpful to visualize/see the processes we discuss in action. ",
            "\u00a0I don't see any ways to improve this course. It is extremely organized, comprehensive, clear and helpful. The course materials, including lectures, Canvas pages and Piazza posts were helpful every time, and professor Miller was attentive to every signle request. His midterm survey to the students helped alleviate any (remember, small) concerns from the students. Overall a fantastically well organized class that I would not change in any way, ",
            "\u00a0This class, for m, was terrible. The content was haphazard and seemed not to follow any real path; rather it seemed to be various incongruent ideas heaped on top of each other. I think this class could certainly be improved by developing a curriculum that builds upon itself rather than being a mishmosh of ideas and technology. ",
            "\u00a0The course was advertised for non-STEM people who didn't have much science background. However, a lot of those type of people got buried early in the course because even the \"basic\" physics was too much for them. It's hard to really offer a full experience of what this course was meant for without doing that... but if it's going to be advertised as such, maybe make it more of a survey and breadth class rather than sciences. ",
            "\u00a0The course was marketed as being for non-STEM majors, yet focused very intensely on specific formulas and physics properties. The topics were very interesting, but some topics seemed to go too in depth for non-STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0second half was taught much better after more lecture slides, piazza, reviews. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the second half of the course was a big improvement from the first. Professor Miller took our suggestions from the mid-term evaluations and after that, the work was far more manageable and easy to follow along with. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured well, with topics that Professor Miller found personally interesting and using a series of smaller ideas to explain a larger phenomenon (ie. learning optics and how LCD displays work first to later explain the basics of virtual reality) The homework was much more focused on calculations than the exams were and could be better aligned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of interesting topics and information. \r\nWeaknesses: it started off unstructured and it wasn't clear what the course required. ",
            "\u00a0The course does teach you about different technologies which is a plus and all of the material after the first midterm did not assume too much previous physics knowledge. The changes that were implemented after the first midterm were helpful and should be kept. One other area it could be improved is the tests were very specific and did not seem to evaluate the broader concepts but specifics of certain concepts that were not stressed as much in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course was very very rough--it felt like the professor was presuming a much higher level of knowledge than we had going into it, and a lot of the stuff in lecture/on the problem sets was very challenging. The second half of the course was better (but it almost slowed down too much...). I think a HUGE improvement would be making tfs/office hours a little more of an accessible resource, especially because a lot of people that take the class are going into it with really really rudimentary background knowledge. Also having comprehensive lecture notes to look at outside of class would be wonderful (by the end the \"pages\" he would post after lecture kind of filled that role, but they still weren't comprehensive...). ",
            "\u00a0Could be structured better ",
            "\u00a0The course started out a little more difficult than anticipated but the professor was surprisingly willing to adjust as needed based on the class. The strength of the course is really Prof Miller; he was super willing to explain anything about the problem sets or exams during office hours or schedule another time if you couldn't make office hours, and took surveys during the course and actually adapted the material/level of difficulty for the class. I just wish I had gone to talk to him sooner he really wants students to understand what's going on and will go out of his way so that everyone at least has a basic understanding. If I had another Sc or QR requirement to finish I would definitely try to take one of his classes to fulfill it. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest problem I had with this course was that it tried to cover ~a lot ~ of material very quickly - spending less than a lecture on quantum, etc. If the class focused on a few central technologies and went very in depth, I think it would have worked a lot better. Prof. Miller, to his credit, did a great job responding to student feedback, but I think there were larger structural issues with the course that couldn't be fixed with cosmetic changes. Also - maybe this isn't the best forum for this, but I'm really frustrated by the lack of QR seminars. I learned long ago that lectures are not a good way for me to learn unless I'm already fascinated in the material, and considering courses like this are supposed to be designed for non-STEM majors with limited background in the material, a wider range of types of QR/science courses is something Yale should aim for. For people who deliberately chose not to do STEM because of the large technical lectures but would still like to engage in the material, finding that the only QR credits available are large technical lectures is really, really frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The Course was a very interesting, slightly challenging options for non-applied science/engineers to get a good depth of insight into the complexities and intricacies of the subject area without requiring them to sacrifice too much focus to their primary area of study. ",
            "\u00a0The course is definitely not a gut (even though it might first appear to be that way), and shouldn't be advertised like that. Some prior exposure to physics (even AP Physics) is definitely very helpful and assumed for some topics. Apart from that, this is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was often taught at a much higher level than it was marketed, and as a science credit for non-STEM majors often touched on complex subjects with little fundamental explanation. I was often frustrated by the complexity of the p-sets compared to the relatively simple level of physics taught in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This class was the worst academic experience of my time at Yale. As someone who is not in a stem major but still has taken four QR credits, I was not expecting a walk in the park for this SC/QR, but I also was not expecting to find the work impossible. The level of conceptual work expected in this class makes it difficult for anyone who does not already have an intuition for physics/technology. I really would not recommend if you are just \"interested\" in the material (as I was) and not already experienced in it. ",

Prof. Miller did improve the course as the semester went on but it's still frustrating less in a wow-I'm-learning-things way and more in a 'this would be really interesting if we had more time to spend on it but instead we spent 5 minutes on it in lecture and now I just need to finish this pset' way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good class to add to an already full schedule without stretching one's self too thin. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely a very good introductory/overview course in applied physics, if you're prepared to spend a few extra hours doing work. ",
            "\u00a0No, especially not if you're a non-STEM major looking for a science credit. The grading curve is unfair (i.e. almost nonexistent) because there are a lot of STEM majors looking for an \"easy\" class, which throws the curve. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course if you do not have intermediate (AP+), recent experience with physics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Very interesting course material. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class.  It is an idiotic class that is both uninteresting, tedious, confusing, frustrating, and too much work.  I would have learned more watching Khan academy (which I did way too much in order to complete the PSets) ",
            "\u00a0Really good introductory science and engineering course. covered a wide span of phenomena and  devices. the professor had good slides and even better presentaion. He always tried to keep us engaged in class. He even brought a parabolic reflector when we were learning about them. If you have no love for science dont take this course. But even if you love science a little take it "
