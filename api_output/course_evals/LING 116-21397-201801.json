            "\u00a0I learned about language acquisition and processing in the brain. It was really quite interesting and I enjoyed it more than I think I would've enjoyed a pure Linguistics class or a pure Cognitive Science class. ",
            "\u00a0Whirlwind tour of language in cognitive science. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how languages affect one's mind. I gained insight into how algorithmic our brains can be and how people learn languages. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about language and the mind! What it means to have language, how language does/does not shape your view of the world, etc. I am a linguistics major, and many things I learned in this class fundamentally changed the way I think about language. The course also pushes you to understand what specific studies tell us about language and the brain - such is a very interesting and rewarding way to learn how to think about real-life data. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a wide range of topics pertaining to linguistics through the lens of cognitive science.  The first third of the course was dedicated to linguistic concepts such as phonology and syntax; however, they were discussed purely from a cognitive science angle (so the information did not get very technical).  The middle third was more abstract, and was mainly cognitive science (but in regards to children's acquisition of language, how our vocabulary may or may not effect our thoughts, etc.).  The final third was about computational linguistics (neural networks, statistics), and got quite technical.\r\nFor anyone wondering, there is minimal overlap with LING 110. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting material with a passionate professor. Explained clearly and thoroughly.\r\nWeaknesses: Not very much if any feedback on homework assignments. Exams not distributed back to the class and instead have to be sought after in office hours even though our class size is not that large. ",
            "\u00a0Good exploration into various parts of language and cognitive science. I discovered which aspects I liked and disliked. Of course, I wasn't comfortable with some aspects I didn't like and was hoping for more depth in parts I enjoyed. But I guess you can't have your cake and eat it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are how well organized it is and how engaged the professor is with the topic. I wish we had more instruction and feedback on the homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was certainly Bob Frank, a very dynamic, knowledgable, kind, and impassioned lecturer. He really made you want to pay attention for the entire class period. Moreover, the material was fascinating! The three exams were very reasonable - engaging, but not too hard. It is very nice that there is no cumulative final. A definite weakness of the course were how disorganized it was - there were supposed to be weekly reading responses and five homeworks, but we only ever had three of each. The homeworks were also incredibly intensive, taking SO many hours. They also were due at the  absolute worst possible times - often right after the exams, thus rendering them much less useful. One was even due the first Monday of spring break. In the future, homeworks should be due a bit before the exams so students can practice the material before they are tested on it. Moreover, the syllabus did not include dates or assignments, so it was often hard to plan ahead or understand the outline of the course. The lack of section also made it harder to be held accountable for doing the work - ultimately, you never really needed to engage as a students, besides showing up to take the three exams. The course had a very strong instructor and very engaging but not too demanding material - the lack of organization made things much more confusing and stressful than they needed to be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: covers very interesting concepts, engaging lectures, all concepts are explained thoroughly, extensive study guides and review sessions are provided for exams ",
            "\u00a0Really cool content, really great professor. The cognitive science side of the class typically felt a little repetitive (\"what happens in children\" was an extremely common theme and usually had similar or predictable answers). ",
            "\u00a0The course material was interesting, although the speed was perhaps a bit too slow so I sometimes lost interest. Perhaps spending less time going into depth on case studies would allow a greater variety of topics to be discussed to keep things moving. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Frank went too fast in class and homework didn't relate to what we did in class ",
            "\u00a0The material was very dry and there wasn't much variety in class day to day. The homework assignments were not very engaging and did not really represent what was taught in class that well. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Frank did his best to accommodate, but the material's inherently technical. I'd suggest having some linguistics background (don't be like me) ",
            "\u00a0This course is structured very well, but I think that in class, we could have more student-instructor interaction rather than just lecture. The class size does not seem to be too large, which is also nice. ",
            "\u00a0It involves a lot of regurgitation of information and there seems to be only a vague train of thought that guides the material -- it is a fairly easy course in that readings aren't necessary and assignments are few and far between, but at the same time the material can be nuanced and often deserves more engagement than it is given (and the deeper understanding that might come with this engagement is what the exams are often looking for). Prof. Frank is very enthusiastic and this is a positive (without that some of the material would be hopelessly dull), but the nature of the material is such that you never really reach a satisfying conclusion in any direction, and extrapolation upon the material is hardly ever possible. ",
            "\u00a0I couldnt quite tell how I was doing in the class throughout the semestergrading was super slow for homework but quick for tests. Maybe having more assignments would have been better as well. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are great. Unrelated to the course content, but the projected slides were always really hard to see because of the lighting of the room, which distracted me from the lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments are sometimes ill timed as in there is very little work for a period and then a very high amount of work all at once. ",
            "\u00a0Very clear structure, amazing lectures, well-written assignments. Expectations could maybe be a bit clearer, some more abstract topics were pretty hand-wavy. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures, but they were a bit too dense in material. ",
            "\u00a0It was difficult to get a solid basis at the beginning of the course. I felt that I didn't have the knowledge to build on some of the concepts in the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course and the lectures; however, I feel like a conclusion was missing from most lectures. I think it will be very helpful to students if the lectures end with a brief summary of how what was discussed in lecture relates to the general domain of linguistics and its function in language and cognitive science. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Frank's passion is amazing, and the assignments are engaging. The lectures can be a little hard to follow as they move very fast, speaking as someone who's never taken an Intro Linguistics class. "

            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. The material is very interesting and Bob Frank is both a passionate and talented lecturer. You can tell he really enjoys this stuff and it really makes the whole learning process more enjoyable. I had a very good time in this class, far better than I had expected going in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I found the content fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who had NOT already taken LING 110. I had already taken Intro to Linguistics, thus making it a mistake to take this course - there was too much overlap in the material. I consequently would zone out and then miss the more interesting parts I did not already know. Aside from that, the course will really change the way you think about language and the mind, and Bob Frank is a great lecturer. I think everyone should take a linguistics course at some point in their Yale career, and this one would be a great choice. It is also not a lot of work, but probably not a true gut. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but be prepared that:\r\n1. It does not get nearly as detailed in linguistics as LING 110 - it is more of a cogsci class (this could be a good or bad thing for you)\r\n2. It gets quite involved towards the end in lecture regarding neural networks and statistics; however, don't be worried, because it does not contribute very much to the grade (not really on the test or homework) ",
            "\u00a0This class is super cool - you learn some legitimate linguistics and some cool stuff about language processing and cognition. Bob Frank is great and I'd guess anything he teaches is worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fun, interesting, and not too demanding. It's a great way to get to know some of the cooler parts of linguistics and Professor Frank is very passionate about the subject! ",
            "\u00a0Only if you like linguistics, didn't get much in way of cog sci ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Looking at language from an interdisciplinary perspective, looking at anything from an interdisciplinary perspective really, helps you understand more about our minds and how they work. And, I feel like this would be a good course for students who are interested in linguistics to figure out what area in linguistics they are most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this if you were very interested in nitty-gritty and awfully specific linguistic material. The material is not very relatable, and the course doesn't come to any satisfying conclusions. It was often boring and a lot of note taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was very interesting and straightforward for a non-major to learn about this subject. ",
            "\u00a0The information can be a lot and can be pretty difficult but the effort and accessibility of the professor and TAs made it both possible and fun to learn ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was a wonderful course, my favorite that I have taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only if you have a strong interest in Cognitive Science or mathematical Linguistics. I came in with a background in sociolinguistics and wanted something out of the course that it did not end up offering. ",
            "\u00a0This is a super interesting class. Be warned, though, that this class seems designed more for linguists than for cognitive scientistsit focuses more on how the language is affected by the brain with an extreme emphasis on language rather than how the brain works through the lens of language. Aka its language with a dash of brain rather than brain with a dash of language. That also means that this class can have a lot of technical linguistics terms that might be difficult to initially grasp, but if you have any prior experience with linguistics youll be totally fine, and if not you will also probably be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it's cool to study language, something that's so taken for granted, and see just how related it is to basically every part of our lives. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly probably my favorite course at Yale. Content was so interesting an Bob Frank is an awesome lecturer: super smart, animated, and engaged. You'll learn a ton about language and how it's interpreted/developed in the mind. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you are interested in learning about language from different angles. If you took intro cogsci and enjoyed the part about language, this is a great course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes completely. It takes on language as a computational and cognitive being and prompts you to think about communication and consciousness in novel ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The material presented here was interesting and gave me new insight into not only how people process language, but also how people use those same language-processing capacities to solve other types of problems. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a CogSci breadth requirement, and I would not recommend it to any other student who is thinking of doing the same thing. The class is for people really interested in linguistics, and not people interested in Cognitive Science. Because I was not interested in linguistics the class was extremely boring, thought the instructor tried his hardest to be engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course! Amazing fun professor, great material, not too hard to keep up with if you pay attention in class. ",
            "\u00a0It's good to fulfill a requirement or if you're looking to fill a gap in linguistics knowledge that you want for something else. Probably wouldn't recommend just taking it for fun, even though it's well-taught ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in Cognitive Science or Linguistics, absolutely. If not, it may be a little hard to follow and hard to pay attention if you don't find the material naturally engaging. "
