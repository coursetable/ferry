Section is optional, but the teaching staff create worksheets that go over tricky concepts we've learned the past week in class that really help. There are ample practice exams posted so we can get a sense of what to expect, and homework is based on completion rather than accuracy, which truly facilitates learning. But, even if this seems easy, the course itself is not easy, especially toward the end. No matter how much Ellman warns us of this, people get destroyed because they trick themselves, so don't fool yourself too early on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Ellman is amazing! He is extremely knowledgeable and engaging in lecture. His notes are very organized and succinct, and if you take good notes in class and review them for the exams, you already have a good foundation of the knowledge. I also found going to section helpful, as it reinforced the concepts in class that I didn't understand and I had the opportunity to ask the TA questions. \r\nWeaknesses: Not really any major weaknesses in the teaching style. However, we moved quite slowly at first and then learned a LOT of material in the last 2 weeks of class,  that will likely be covered a lot on the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The grading is incredibly harsh. If you make one mistake on a problem worth a lot of points, you can sometimes get 0/12 credit and it can ruin your grade. ",

",
            "\u00a0Was taught very well ",
            "\u00a0Ellman is a great teacher, begins very slowly so that no one felt lost. Last few weeks were definitely pretty fast, but I think most people were able to keep up, so it's not bad. Definitely the best chem professor I've had at Yale so far. Also just a very friendly person. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course. The strengths of this course include professor Ellman is the best STEM professor Ive had at Yale. He is very organized and willing to answer questions, and he seems to truly enjoy teaching students and helping them understand. This is hard to do in a huge lecture, but he does a good job at it! ",
            "\u00a0I wish the TAs were more helpful. I feel like the chemistry department's TA's are not the best. ",
            "\u00a0One huge strength is that Professor Ellman is a great professor. However, no one I knew had a particularly good TA. To get help, we all had to go to Peer Tutoring.\r\nAdditionally, the practice exams were released only 4 days before the exams, making it hard to be able to get help.\r\nThe course could be improved by being recorded, so we can go back and look at what we were confused about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nPerhaps the greatest strength of this course is the teacher, Professor Ellman. Ellman is extremely explicit about what is important material, what is going to be on tests, and what is just supplemental material we do not need to study for. Since he writes down on the chalkboard everything he teaches, his teaching is clear and organized. He is also very humble--whenever a student catches his mistake, he is always more than willing to correct and acknowledge it. In regards to the course materials, I found the graded Sapling assignments (not graded on number of attempts!) to be helpful for studying and learning the material. Plus, Ellman's exams are fair in that he provides three practice exams per test, helping you focus on studying the concepts and not fruitlessly predicting the way in which the concepts are going to be tested. Overall, the workload of this class is not high (max 2-3 hrs a week on Sapling), and most of the work comes in studying for the midterms. \r\nWeaknesses: \r\nAs many of my classmates have mentioned, a lot of the final exam deals with material that is presented in the last FOUR classes of the semester. I recognize that everything tested does hinge on a solid foundation of concepts covered throughout the rest of the semester, but I do feel there is a way to expedite the first part of the course so that the last part is less packed. ",
            "\u00a0I think we moved exponentially quickly, so a more steady pace would be better. I would have also preferred if we didn't drop a midterm and instead didn't have such a weighted final. The biggest strength was definitely Prof. Ellman, he is extremely friendly and a really good lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Too heavy at the end. Final was hard. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: ungraded sapling, layout of material, grading system, practice tests (I honestly probably would've failed without those)\r\n\r\nWeakenesses: was slow at the beginning and then VERY fast at the end, might've been nice to even out the pace more ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the course are the way in which it proceeds. The information is logically organized. I also liked that Professor Ellman provided three practice exams for each test. This allowed me to have a good understanding of what to expect for each exam. A weakness was that there was a lot of memorization, but that is expected for an organic chemistry class. Another thing is that the class meets very early all the way up on Science Hill. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well-organized and clearly taught. In general, concepts in lecture were explained in a way that helped students understand the underlying chemistry behind reactions rather than just memorizing. The exams were very fair compared to homework questions. Since so many practice exams were provided with the exact format of the actual exam, they seemed formulaic, so it was possible to study by learning how to answer the specific format of the exam questions rather than actually understanding concepts at a deeper level. I think the pacing of the class could be changed slightly: the beginning of the course felt slow, whereas the last few weeks introduced most of the reactions we needed to know. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: does a good job focusing on applications and not just memorizing\r\nweakneses: kind of unbalanced in that the first third is a joke, the seocnd is average, and the third is more difficult ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very well-structured and taught. The supplementary help was great and Professor Ellman does a great job of explaining difficult concepts. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course is the pacing: it is quite slow in the beginning, and then picks up very quickly in the last couple days of lectures. This may be improved by spreading out the material a little more throughout the semester, and maybe covering stereochemistry with the reactions instead of doing stereochemistry separately. ",
            "\u00a0Orgo is difficult but the course is very well taught and the exams are very fair. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was Professor Ellman no doubt. He was so clear in lecture that the textbook was almost unnecessary. A class like this could in theory be learned from a textbook, but because of the mastery of Ellman this was the first relatively intro level science class at Yale that I felt was worthwhile going to the lecture. One weakness is that the pace of material accelerates quite rapidly towards the end of the course and maybe this could be ameliorated by covering some of the basics in the first few lectures more quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ellman often taught the material in a very simplistic, yet thorough way that made everything clear in my notes. However, one problem with the class was with the pacing. While the easier elementary material reviewing general material was taught quite slowly, the ending, more difficult material about alcohol and ester reactions were taught at a much faster pace, making it such that much more time was needed outside of class to review. ",
            "\u00a0strength: love that the practice tests mirror the actual exams \r\nweakness: did not find sapling or textbook questions to be helpful, felt more like busy work, \r\nbecause did not find them to be representative of test material ",
            "\u00a0This class is very well taught and supremely fair. Professor Ellman would give us three practice tests before each exam, which were identical in format and similar in content to the actual exams. The material was presented in a clear, straightforward way such that no one really had to read the book. It's a great class, the only weakness would be that section was not very useful  I never really learned anything during the sections and as a result, stopped attending. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Elman is a good professor with fair tests ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is the flexible workload. it is really up to the student how much time they want to put into the class, since there is limited work outside of exams. \r\none weakness is the pacing of the class. We covered topics steadily throughout the first 10 weeks of the semester. Then, in the last month, everything ramped up crazy fast as we tried to fit everything we hadn't learned but was supposed to, into just a few days of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well taught, and pretty well structures. I believe more practice problems could be helpful, but the combination of Loudon problems and Sapling was pretty good practice.

            "\u00a0Professor Ellman is a great lecturer, and you do learn chemistry well.\r\n\r\nThere are two weaknesses of this class associated with grading. First, everyone gets a dropped midterm, but if you are sick, you must use that midterm as your drop, even if you have a Dean's excuse. This is incredibly unfair to students who get sick, for everyone else can drop a midterm they do poorly on (for whatever reason), but students who get sick do not get the flexibility to do poorly on one.\r\n\r\nSecond, the class is graded on a point system, and this proves problematic for the dropped midterm system. You drop your lowest percent grade, NOT your lowest percentile. Take the current year's rough numbers for example. Say you got an 83% on the first midterm, where the average was about an 85%, and an 82% on the third midterm, where the average was about a 75%. In Professor Ellman's system, you'd drop the 82%, even though it was an above average score on the third midterm, and keep the below average 83%. This system advantages people who do well (relative to the class) on midterms with high averages. ",

Exams GREATLY resemble the practice exams, so you know exactly what to expect and what to focus on when studying. Sapling also provided good practice for the fundamentals.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course seemed to move more slowly at the beginning, and the pace was more than manageable. At the end of the course though, we crammed a whole bunch of reaction mechanisms into maybe four lessons (while other universities usually spend weeks on these), and so it was a little difficult to memorize so much in such a short time, BUT because we had spent so much time on learning /why/ we were supposed to use certain mechanisms over others, memorizing these reaction mechanisms was not too hard since we could technically reason them out. The only problems were reactions whose entire mechanisms weren't provided, and so it was harder to reason those out and we had to just rely on straight memorization. ",

            "\u00a0I thought this class was very well taught. I liked Ellmans teaching style in starting each class reviewing the material from the past lecture and building onto it. He provided us a strong foundation for the reactions we saw near the end of the semester. However, the final mostly pertained off of the last four lectures material (which, granted, built off of the material from before), and wish we had more time to familiarize ourselves with it and get more practice and explanations in discussion section. I also wish, honestly, that we had more homework besides the Sapling, as I wish I had been forced to get more practice with the material rather than work and study hard close to the midterms. ",

Prof. Ellman is generally very good at giving clear and engaging lectures and the practice tests are in the same format as the exams so you know about what to expect.

There are sapling problems for each chapter, but they are due the week of the exam, so you can do them on your own schedule instead of working with a hard deadline. In addition, I dont see sapling as homework, but rather as a way to study, so I like to do them closer to the exam to see if I know the stuff. Otherwise, this class has pretty much no work, and it is a nice change for a STEM class. Professor Ellman is a clear strength in this class. He is the most organized professor I have ever had. Everything he says in class is clear and has a purpose, and he is always prepared for class. He does follow the textbook quite closely, but I really recommend going to class and hearing Prof. Ellman explain it. Then you will know what aspects of the chapter are being emphasized. I cannot stress this enough: GO TO CLASS. It's the only realistic way that you're gonna keep up with the material (you know you're not gonna be doing those sapling problems and textbook readings until the week of the exam), especially with all you premeds out there with a million other things to do. Another strength is that the exams were extremely fair. You always know what to expect on the exam because there are three practice exams to prepare you for each exam. Also, you get to drop one exam. The exams are pretty straightforward, but beware because Ellman is good at making the exams seem easy but puts little tricks in there to try to get you. The more you practice, the faster you will find these tricks. Although I was already super engaged in the content presented, I wish the class was harder. The exams didn't really test the majority of the reactions mechanistically. I wish we had to do retroactive synthesis where we are given a product that is the result of a multi step synthesis and figure out which steps were required to get the product and provide the mechanism for the formation too! I want the mechanisms on the test to be harder to including ozonolysis, hydroboration oxidation, oxymercuration reduction, etc. We mostly just had to memorize the reagents and net products for the majority of the reactions. Having more integrated mechanisms would emphasize more application of the material learned rather than just memorization. Especially on the final, I wish there was a question that synthesized much of what we learned in a single problem. ",
            "\u00a0This was, overall, a very good course. I liked the structure of the class for the most part, and I enjoyed Professor Ellman's teaching style. The homework style also made the course much less stressful, as we could do the homework whenever was most convenient for us before the due date. The downside of this course is definitely the last few weeks. There are many, many reactions covered over the last two weeks compared to earlier in the semester, and while it was certainly doable, it also felt very unbalanced. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good at making sure you know lots of specific facts about reactions but not much else ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is the lecturer and style of lecture. I think it presented material very well.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is the organization of the material and making different concepts connect together. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized and I felt like there was a lot of practice material in order to help students review topics and fully cement the ideas. One weakness was that since it covers such a large amount of material, classes have to go very fast. The content is also very challenging, so it is difficult to understand them the first time. I think it would be helpful if the class were videotaped so that students could go back to specific points in a lecture and review how the professor taught the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is Ellman. I'm so amazed by his teaching style and he truly made me love organic chemistry--and I'm not even a chemistry major! The class is SO organized, and sections this year were so useful. I heard from last year that sections never did worksheets, and so I'm glad that this year, section did have worksheets because it was so useful. I felt all the TA's were on top of their game, and my TA especially made sure he was available to help us, especially when exam dates came closer. \r\n\r\nIn terms of exams, I think a strength of the course was having the 3 midterms (one could be dropped) + 1 final exam. It made sure we all stayed on top of the material, and also lessened the pressure of knowing that we couldn't afford to mess up on one test. Being able to drop an exam made me less worried about my grade, and it's a great structure especially because most students have a lot of other exams going on and so studying for orgo can be really rough when you have 2-3 other exams and papers to write too. \r\n\r\nI can't think of any improvements in terms of structure, but I did feel the last 2-3 weeks of Orgo felt rushed, and because we were in what I thought was the most challenging content of the course (SN1/SN2/E1/E2) I found the pace to be fast. Maybe Ellman could try to pace this out more? ",
            "\u00a0The lecture style was clear but difficult to stay engaged with. It would be great if applications of the material were more integrated into every day lectures so it didnt feel like we were just memorizing equations. Also, it would be cool if homework problems brought in some more application too. I also would have preferred if Sapling were do every week, as I could have used the support to keep me on top of it.

By following the suggested reading and textbook problems, I was able to stay with the material even during challenging reaction units towards the end. The course builds on itself, applying concepts learned in the two months to content in later parts of the semester. In terms of weaknesses, I did feel surprised that the last two weeks between the midterm and the final exam weighed disproportionately on the final. I understand that it's an important unit, but I do feel that it demands more time--one extra week would be perfect. ",

This made studying for his exams so much easier and I feel that I learned so much more because of the organization. More professors in the chemistry department should adopt this way of teaching.

I found this class to be my favorite and honestly enjoyed taking the exams. If you like puzzles, this class is for you! It was so entertaining to take what I learned in class about a mechanism and be able to look at another problem and identify how to solve it. Even if you don't need to take this class, I honestly didn't find the content to be overwhelming. Also, the class is so well structured and I never felt like help wasn't available. This year, a section was offered at 7 pm in WLH, which I thought was so generous since most of the time they are in SCL during the day time. Take this course! ",

This is a course menat for everyone, and though it presents a fair challenge I did not feel like it was daunting. I felt that the resources provided through the textbook reading, Sapling online, and suggested problem sets were adequate preparation for both upcoming lectures and midterm exams.
