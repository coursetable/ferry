            "\u00a0You learn the fundamentals of music theory, from reading notes all the way to building harmonies and harmonic analysis. You also build fluency in doing these things, like building triads in your head or reciting scales, which is amazing for people like me who have never had any formal music experience. As a lover of music, I feel like I will remember these skills and cherish them for life! ",
            "\u00a0I grew much more comfortable with the logic behind harmony. I now have the requisite vocabulary for talking about music. Additionally, I was able to focus on ear training. ",
            "\u00a0Basic introduction to music theory. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how to reliably identify pitch intervals, and also how to identify and construct basic harmonies, which will be really useful for writing my own future arrangements ",
            "\u00a0I went from being a singer with no ability to read sheet music to being able to form seventh chords, identify cadences, and hear the difference between various intervals. I really learned how to be okay with starting from scratch and that will stay with me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many important skills about music theory from the basics of notes on the clefs to scales and keys to chords and harmonic analysis. If you are at all interested in learning music theory this is a great introduction course that will take you beyond the basics but teach you everything that you need to know to become proficient in music even if you aren't fluent. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding in the basics of music theory. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I loved this class! Anyone can take it, whether or not you have prior music experience. I will say, I feel like for people who have played piano or have had some formal training, the class may be slow at times. However, I love how small the classes are and Professor Lalli really tailors the content to fit the needs of the class as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is definitely its small size. In my section, there were about ten of us total, and we all got a ton of individual attention from Professor Lalli. Additionally, the weekly quizzes and homework were hugely helpful in reinforcing the material. I could see myself improving over the course of the semester. The midterm and final were challenging, but fair. ",
            "\u00a0This course moves at quite a fast pace, and if you do not keep up, you will suffer. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the class gives a solid basis for future musical writing and an understanding of the conventions behind much of modern music ",
            "\u00a0I think it is usually geared towards students who have a background in music and just need a refresher on music theory, even though it is the lowest level intro course for music. This makes the learning environment difficult for everyone because those of us that are starting from nothing need to ask a lot of questions, which the other students quickly answer in order to move on to more complicated things, and then we are still unsure and it is so important to understand the basics in order to build on that for more complicated concepts. I would consider splitting sections into beginners and non-beginners if you can not create another course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really logically organized. It was relaxed but also maintained an urgent learning pace. I really liked the practices we did and the one on one office hour sessions were extremely helpful. I think the textbook we used was very confusing and I wouldn't recommend using it again. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the pace of the class and the professors ability to address confusions and challenges we had. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have ever been interested in music theory, take this class! It's taught in a seminar setting, which is sometimes hard to find at Yale but definitely worth it. Many people in the class are singers who have never been taught music theory. You train your ear and your music reading abilities, which is helpful for anything music-related you may want to do down the road. It's also very little work and a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! If you want a rigorous, but very rewarding introduction to music theory, do not hesitate to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I ultimately dropped this course, so I would not recommend it if you have a busy schedule or are having difficulty making time to work on music theory every day. I found myself unable to devote time to this class each day, and I became very behind as a result. Do not take it if you cannot make it a priority. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's not really a \"gut course\" but it isn't too hard if you go to every class and make sure you understand everything. There is very little memorization involved and you get to create some tunes yourself. It's a somewhat relaxing and fun class whilst also being incredibly informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would (and have) enthusiastically recommend this class to everyone! Music interests everyone, and this class helps one understand why certain conventions arent used or why they sound pleasing ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to do anything related to music in your life you should have a basic understanding of music theory, which this course gives you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. I learned so much and I feel like I improved significantly in my ability to process and analyze music. Even if you aren't specifically interested in music theory but you are in a singing group, this is a great class to take. Professor Lalli is an incredible and caring professor and you will grow a lot in your ability to read music. "
