            "\u00a0I developed a great knowledge of the sky and the universe. I originally took this course to simply complete a course requirement and keep my mind sharp while focusing on the humanities, but the course provided my desire for physics and math while also piquing my interest on stars and their formation/evolution. While it is also nice to be able to spout facts about the sky to my friends and family, I genuinely learned so much ranging from the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram to the lifetime of the Crab Nebula. ",

            "\u00a0I gained plenty of insight about our solar system and the underlying mechanisms that govern the physicality of our universe! It was truly amazing to visit the planetarium during this class and see planets and stars through telescopes to apply what we have been learning in class. I have developed a great appreciation for astronomy and have developed my knowledge of physics and a bit of chemistry. ",

            "\u00a0One major weakness was that the homework took so long. The way the questions were worded made it nearly impossible to figure out which formulas to use. I planned on taking this class purely for my love of space, however it turned me off of any future astronomy classes because of how much time it took. I had two other problems sets to do each week and this one took up precious time I needed for those. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very easy to get help from the TA/Professor on homework problems! Content is very interesting. Doesn't require profound knowledge of physics to understand the mathematical aspect of the course. Reasonable homework load.\r\nWeaknesses: Class can be a bit slow at times.\r\nImprovements: I would be nice to watch more videos and/or documentaries on the aspects discussed during the course to really understand what is being discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0I just was not very interested in the subject as it turns out. The class was a good pace, but it was just sometimes hard to understand the material and knowing when to apply what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the knowledge of the Professor and the clear passion he had for the subject. One problem was that the class is for non-STEM majors, meaning it's by definition a class to fulfill a science credit. This is necessary, but leads to low interest and engagement on the part of the students. I do not believe this should reflect on the professor, Prof. Zinn, who made every effort to engage and interest the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor was obviously very interested in the material that he was teaching which made the lectures feel more genuine. The professor also included historical  background alongside the scientific information necessary for the course which helped to contextualize all the the equations, theorems, and laws. The professor was also very willing to work with students, especially if they had questions about grades they received.\r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures just seemed too long to keep the students engaged, but that is more likely due to the meeting times of the course.
