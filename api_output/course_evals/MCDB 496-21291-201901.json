            "\u00a0Each individual's experience with the B.S. senior thesis for MCDB is totally dependent upon how willing their PI and primary mentors (postdocs, research scientists) are to guide their students' work. Some mentors are very hands-on and invested, while others just aren't. It's hard to determine before getting into the research work whether your PI will be helpful, so it's important to know going into the thesis that you're not going to have the same research experience as your peers. ",
            "\u00a0I had absolutely no interaction with course instructors this term - not even an email was sent out to remind us to prepare a poster for the end of semester presentation. I do wish a little more camaraderie had been built through the formal structure of the class. But I do understand the nature of the thesis is that our PIs are the most important figure. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have some introduction to the professors who grade our presentations earlier in the semester or had some seminars about making presentations or writing the paper to have some engagement with the class and professors through the year. "

            "\u00a0For anyone planning to take the non-intensive research course, I'd urge you to consider this one. Chances are you'll end up working 15+ hours most weeks, so you might as well do 5 more and get another credit out of it. As long as you show up to lab and put some effort into the assignments, it's basically 4 credits of free GPA boost. ",
            "\u00a0If you think you'll spend ~15 hrs/week in lab, I'd strongly recommend going for the intensive major. The extra credit you receive is really helpful because it frees up your schedule to either take other classes you're interested in as Credit/D, or to just have less academic work on your plate during senior year. If you think you want to go into research for the rest of your life, doing the intensive major will definitely help you figure out if you can actually handle being in the lab 24/7. ",
