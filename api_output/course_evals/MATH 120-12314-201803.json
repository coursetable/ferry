The main part of the course focused on how to find scalar line integrals, vector line integrals, and surface integrals. Since there are multiple ways to solve these, we learned how to identify the type of question that was being asked and the best/most viable way to solve the integral. Such theorems that we learned included Green's Theorem, Stoke's Theorem, the Divergence Theorem, and the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals. ",

            "\u00a0The course is pretty well organized and well taught; it's just that the material can be very challenging. I wish we could have spent more time on each topic and did more practice problems because the course felt very rushed. There was not a lot of time to fully explain the concepts and also do questions. I really liked the Ximera website provided. It was very helpful in explaining the concepts and providing problems. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- well taught \r\nWeaknesses- everyone starts at a different point with math skills ",
            "\u00a0The only strength was my teacher. She was very involved with the students and was always trying to get to know us. The glaring weakness was that the math department seemed to structure the class to weed out students by making so much of our grade on the exams dependent on our problem solving speeds, and algebraic proficiency. I would have liked to see more focus on the explanations of theorms and the proofs more than just a few lines. I dont blame my teacher for this because she had no choice but to cover all the topics we had to cover, and there was not a lot of time to do that. ",
            "\u00a0This course is weak in that it emphasizes manual computation and unnecessary single-variable integrals instead of multivariable concepts. The course directors and lecturers should avoid requiring so much meaningless computation and instead focus more on helping students understand the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - a lot of material is covered\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes it seems that the aim of this course is to learn how to compute and solve certain problems rather than understand the underlying concepts and theories ",
            "\u00a0It is ridiculous that this class is divided into 12 sections, with only two of them being taught by Sudesh. The class was very poorly laid out, and poorly taught as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course presents a lot of material and covers it thoroughly. It is a bit fast paced, but that allows the class to go into depth on many topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nGreat teacher very engaging and not too hard\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNone it is an unstoppable force ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that the class sizes are small (around 30 is the max). This allows your professor to get to know you and give you more individualized attention. This also makes it easier for the class to do group work, which was a major help in learning the material for the course. \r\nThe main issue I had with the course was that there was one professor who was much better than the rest, which allowed those students to be more prepared for the exam. The professor gave printed out notes with practice problems on them and introduced them to Ximera earlier in the course, so these students had more problems at their fingertips. In the last week or so before the final exam, all of these notes were published online so that everyone had access, but it would have been beneficial if we had been given these notes and extra practice problems with their corresponding lectures and homework so that we could have used them to study for the midterms as well. The imbalance of the distribution of how well the course is taught is an element of the course that should be addressed. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: class was very organized and you knew what material was going to be covered every day. Flor is clear at explaining concepts, and she's very enthusiastic to teach the material. \r\nWeakness: sometimes, we would run out of time to cover all the topics and we would rush in order to finish everything. Other times, topics would roll over into the next class. That made things feel a bit discombobulated at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Many resources like office hours and practice problems\r\nWeakness: A lot of material to cover in a short amount of time, makes it impossible to go into depth with many topics "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who's interested in math and wants to further their knowledge. The course itself id demanding and the topics learned can be difficult to visualize. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah probably. For people who've done this material before, I don't think it will be hard, but it is definitely useful. ",

            "\u00a0I think this class is a good way to figure out whether or not you might be interested in taking more STEM classes or would rather move in a humanities direction. However, the class was harder than expected and there were a lot of really annoying overachieving freshmen in the class who had already taken multivariable calc. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because the amount of meaningless computation I had to do was sort of ridiculous. It prevents you from actually getting an intuitive understanding of the Calc 3 concepts because you're too worried about avoiding numerical mistakes. And this isn't a property of a Calc 3 class in general. I've taken it before, and the conceptual approach the teacher used was much better. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. This class is horrible. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student if they are interested in math. While the course is difficult and takes a fair bit of time, I believe it is worth it because it covers so many topics and you come out with a firm grasp of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is a challenging classes that won't destroy your gpa ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend the course to another student unless they were interested in the material and willing to put in a lot of effort into the course. This is because the course is very taxing and requires a lot of attention and, depending on the professor, may not be taught very well. Thus, if they don't find the material to be something that they want to learn more about, then I would tell them to find a different course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. I felt that the class built on what I had learned previously in calculus and multivar. It also serves as a prereq for a lot of other courses/majors, and I think it's a solid class to take. However, I do think it depends on the professor you get, as I've heard complaints about other sections of the class. ",
