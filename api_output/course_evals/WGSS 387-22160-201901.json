            "\u00a0This course helped me reconceptualise the way that I view vague, often heavily oversimplified notions like 'culture', 'rights', 'faith', 'modernity', 'tradition', and 'sexual orientation'. I feel like the course was my first step towards reframing my preconceptions of the world through a WGSS lens, and it was an excellent introduction to these concepts. I improved my ability to thoroughly & carefully break down complex academic concepts, and gained confidence when it came to taking a stab at something I wasn't certain about, or admitting that I was out of my depth.

            "\u00a0The course has an incredibly strong and well-oriented syllabus, which in my opinion could only have been improved by the expansion of readings and literature around gender identity and/or transgender/nonbinary existence. A lot of the weaknesses of the course were only due to the small size of the class, which was completely out of all of our control! I really enjoyed the 'blog post' approach, as it encouraged us to be more informal and focus on our personal interests when it came to engaging with the readings. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. The readings are varied and interesting but get you to think seriously about a lot of different questions, and Evren is incredibly clear and will hold you accountable for doing the readings but is also extremely kind and a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I learned so much in a very stimulating, if sometimes intimidating, academic & interpersonal environment. "
