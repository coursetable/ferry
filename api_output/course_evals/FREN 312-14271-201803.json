            "\u00a0As the title of this course suggests, I learned about scandals in the Court of Louis XIV.  In general, I learned so much about life in 17th century France.  I was exposed to incredible literature and Professor Schuwey always offered insight remarks in class about how to analyze media landscapes and relate classical texts to the present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the style, language, and themes of 17th century French literature, but most importantly, I learned how to thoroughly research archival texts. This class taught me how to look at literature in a different light; instead of keeping our analyses within the bounds of the book covers, we explored the world around the books, the historical and social contexts within which they were read, and the scandals they caused. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I learned an incredible amount of information not only about the topic, which was Scandals in the seventeenth century, but about literature analysis as a whole. Analyzing specific books from the seventeenth century allowed me to develop my analytic skills of literature analysis. I also learned more about researching historical background, symbols, and the significance of small details. \r\nThrough the course, I was able to develop my ability to do critical analysis of texts and scandals in a time period that I previously did not know about. But more than the specific topic at hand, I learned how to apply analysis methods from the class to real world scandals and literature, videos, and culture. ",
            "\u00a0This course, more than anything, introduced students to the tools offered by the digital humanities. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a fascinating overview of French literature in the second half of the 17th century, giving me a much deeper insight into the development of political and social scandals at that time. It also allowed me to practice my spoken French in a comfortable but rigorous environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to closely analyze texts, more specifically French 17th century literature. I learned how to read closely and look for connections between books. I also learned how to critically question documents and their purpose rather than taking them at face value. ",
            "\u00a0My reading in French was significantly improved through the course, as was my ability to write, develop a thesis, and conduct research in French. I also felt that the course's historiographical approach to the literary works discussed was fantastic and relatively new to me; I learned a lot about how to take into account the historical and cultural context of literary oeuvres.

            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent and varied readings; very animated and passionate professor\r\nWeaknesses: the syllabus was confusing and did not list all assignments (they were posted on Canvas week by week instead, but it would have been nice to know beforehand how much work to expect for the semester), expectations for assignments were unclear at first but became clearer as the semester went on, unclear what to focus on in the reading (especially when there are hundreds of pages assigned, it would be nice to know what is most important) ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course from a source material point-of-view. We went to the Beinecke on one of our first days of class to read and touch original 17th century manuscripts, and over the course of the semester we read a lot of very interesting (and important) texts while learning unique ways of relating the material to fully understand the true network of scandals in 17th century France. This course has two major weaknesses: (1) the discussions tend to get repetitive, and (2) there is no enforced engagement. (1) For a few weeks, we kind of just talked about why each text was scandalous, and how mocking the king or religious leaders would have offended people in France. There's only so much you can say about that, and a lot of it is pretty obvious through intuition. I would suggest instead to focus even more heavily on the historical context, some interesting stories unique to the source material, and move on from general truisms about scandalous behavior after the first couple classes. (2) Over time, people became less and less engaged in the course. Part of this is because of criticism #1, but it is also because we never really had to use the source material to contribute to the conversation. Perhaps making participation 20% of the final grade was an attempt at preventing this, but not a single student at Yale is motivated by their participation score. Partly because they know it is extremely subjective and mostly depends on the instructor both liking and remembering them, but also because it doesn't really correspond to any concrete value that they can see move up and down. If the conversations are going to remain abstract and largely removed from the details of the source material, then give small (perhaps peer-graded) quizzes to reinforce engagement with the assignments, or make the discussion questions on canvas mandatory (I would strongly recommend this one, as I have seen it in previous courses and it works). \r\nOverall, Professor Schuwey is clearly very excited by what he's teaching. However, he needs to find ways to keep his students on track so they can engage in the conversations that he looks for in his lessons. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include: the extremely knowledgeable and passionate professor, the thematic and stylistic variety in the chosen texts, and the small seminar size. The biggest weakness of the course was the length of some of the readings we were assigned: some days we would only have 20-30 pages, but others, we were assigned to read 300-400-page books. When I was assigned to read a 300-400 page book, I found it worthless to even try to read all of it because I knew I had no time. Instead, I think the professor should have assigned excerpts or specific chapters to read from the long books, that way the conversation in class could be more focused and streamlined. I think the main reason why class discussion sometimes lacked was because many of us didn't even bother to try to read a text that was so long and difficult to understand. This could also be improved if the Professor gave us clear and distinct discussion questions the night before class--this would provide us a way to prepare for the in-class discussion more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Schuwey was incredibly engaging. He was a terrific professor that made learning about scandals in seventeenth century French literature, a topic I otherwise would have never appreciated, a fascinating topic. His energy and his charisma really engaged the entire class and motivated us to keep up with readings, work hard on research, and stay enthusiastic about the topic all semester. \r\nThe number of readings expected for the course is overly high. Besides reading approximately a book of French literature a week, there are supplemental readings. It was nearly impossible to keep up with all the expected work, which the professor was very understanding about. However, classes would have been more productive had we been able to read all the information before hand, and class discussion would have been more extensive.\r\nOverall, this was a terrific class with a fairly large workload. ",
            "\u00a0This course has virtually no weaknesses. It was a wonderful experience. The texts we read are fascinating, the class is well-structured, and Professor Schuwey is fantastic. I couldn't have asked for a better class. ",
            "\u00a0While this course focuses on 17th century French literature, the skills used can be applied to any other work of literature. Additionally, the three research papers taught me how to better research, analyze, and incorporate primary evidence in my papers. ",
            "\u00a0Christophe's enthusiasm and engagement and the combined breadth and depth of the syllabus were my two favorite aspects of the course. Every day, we covered some new fascinating aspect of 17th century France and Christophe's love of the field was absolutely contagious. The greatest weakness of the course was the length of the readings; there were multiple class discussions for which we were expected to have read approximately 600 pages of dense 17th century text on difficult to navigate websites such as the Gallica site. Because the reading expectation was intimidating and sometimes impossible to meet, we often had discussions at which it was clear no one had completed the assignment for a given day and therefore no one felt comfortable participating in discussing. I think honing the syllabus and assigning selections from the chosen works rather than each work in its entirety would drastically improve students' comfort and the quality of discussion. "

            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting and engaging. It is clear that Professor Schuwey really cares about this class and his students.  Note that this class is less about close reading and more about analyzing the circumstances of / reactions to scandals. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to someone who is interested in 17th century culture and society. If you don't like reading these kinds of subjects, I wouldn't suggest it. Overall, I enjoyed the class, but it might not be for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend!!! This class was great not only for the topic, but for the professor and the skills that I learned. While I'm not the biggest fan of seventeenth century French literature, I was able to have a terrific time analyzing scandals of the epoch and using those analytic skills to look into modern day scandals that are a reality in the world of today. \r\nProfessor Schuwey makes learning about Molire and Madame de Lafayette very entertaining and engaging, and teaches skills that are not only useful in the domain of French literature, but in analyzing current events, policy, and historical documents, and other texts. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. This course will give you an excellent overview of French literature in the late 17th century; it will also give you a great opportunity to practice your spoken French, all with the help of a kind, hilarious, and brilliant professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As long as the student has a high level of French I would highly recommend this course! Was one of my favorite courses at Yale, I left each class just amazed at the connections Professor Schuwey helped us reach! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Christophe is an amazing professor; I learned so much from him and his enthusiasm for teaching and for the topics discussed was absolutely contagious. His feedback on papers was detailed and helpful and I always felt that he wanted each and every student in the course to succeed. I had a great experience in this course. He was always available for meetings, happy to answer questions via email (and even via FaceTime when he had to leave the country shortly before our final papers were due) and was always available and happy to meet.
