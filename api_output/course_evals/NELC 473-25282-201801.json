            "\u00a0I have developed skills of analyzing paleoclimate data, of better understanding archaeological and multidisciplinary papers, and of better understanding historical events and their connections to climate. ",
            "\u00a0A better, more systematic understanding of the schools of thoughts revolving around ancient civilizations. Thinking in terms of resilience and the fact that large-scale natural catastrophes could overwhelm even the most \"complex\" or \"advanced\" societies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal in this class about the factors and causes of societal collapse, as well as the ways in which we can study collapse. Having never taken an archaeology class before, this course was a great introduction to the topic. I gained much insight into the intersection of archaeology and environmental studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how archeological sites are excavated, how things are dated, and a lot about the factors that contribute to societal collapse. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of scientific research methods used in fields like archaeology, paleoclimatology\r\nAbility to evaluate and notice flaws with scientific theories and reasoning "

        [
            "\u00a0The course really allows the student to develop their own point of view and then redevelop it again and again. Every successive book we read was somewhat a critique of the first, which made was eye-opening. The course had a small number of students, and it was all in all great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the reading assignments provided a great survey of the topics and publications of pioneering ideas. Professor Weiss was very willing to listen to his students and showed enthusiasm for students' ideas when students did get to speak.\r\nWeakness: Professor Weiss is rather strongly opinionated, and the chance for students to discuss was slim to none. He mostly just talked and talked. ",
            "\u00a0The assigned readings were definitely a strength of this course. We read many fascinating books that each had a different perspective on the causes of societal collapse. It was great to read so many different opinions. One weakness was that the class itself felt a little disorganized at times. We didn't seem follow a strict plan as to what we would discuss each class period, and sometimes it felt as though what was talked about in class did not fully relate to what was read for homework. ",
            "\u00a0I think that course could be a little more structured, at times it seemed to get a little off topic, but overall the way that it is taught makes sense considering it is kind of a large overview of archeological history of past societies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - comprehensive, covers an interesting, broad, and difficult topic with very knowledgeable instructor\r\nWeaknesses/improvements - strong focus on instructor's point of view, more charitable consideration of alternatives in discussion possible "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in environmental studies, archaeology, climate, or history. I would also recommend it to anyone who might be too afraid to delve into the field otherwise: this course provided a secure space for learning, requiring no prerequisites. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in the rise and fall of ancient civilizations without too much burden of a history class, take it! Professor Weiss was a big name in the field (and he is not shy about this), and you will learn a ton by following up with the readings (which could be a little overwhelming when you have other reading-heavy classes). This class is not a difficult one, as the assessment is only made up of a big paper towards the end of the semester, and a presentation that goes with the class throughout the term. Prof. Weiss will not check on your reading either.\r\n\r\nHowever, he does tend to keep talking nonstop and it could be disorienting if you don't have the background knowledge. Some people may find his teaching style less than favorable. When you do get used to it, though, this class will probably make an awesome semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and introduced me to a field of work that I had never before explored. I really enjoyed all of the texts we read for this course, which is not something I can say about every class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course; I thought it was interesting and very informative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Societal collapse is a topic that many people have put forward theories about, often without scientific evidence. This class focuses on evaluating said theories with a scientific basis. Many of the theories have serious flaws, which Prof. Weiss is very good at pointing out in a systematic and reasoned manner. He also has his own theory regarding societal collapse, which is that collapse is caused by large droughts. He presents the evidence for this theory convincingly, although most of the discussions are quite predictably focused on presenting the evidence for this theory and against alternatives. In fairness, this is probably no worse than what other \"experts\" on societal collapse would do, and at least Weiss has qualifications and experience in this field. Lot of reading. "
