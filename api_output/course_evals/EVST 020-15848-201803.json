            "\u00a0It is a lot of just writing and talking, maybe some more engaging activities. Overall great course, though! ",
            "\u00a0The readings were all very interesting and the topic was engaging, but the discussions were painful since it seemed that no one did the readings so there was no meaningful discussion about them. Having students lead the discussions was okay to a point, but it made it difficult to have meaningful discussions since many times the students were just reading from their notes instead of trying to facilitate discussion. Maybe having classes be split so that students lead the discussion for half the class and then the professor leads for the remainder would be a better balance. ",
