            "\u00a0Class sessions could be more productive. Sometimes I felt as though the times we were actually in class were not all that related to our projects and the presentations were simply used to fill time. I would suggest dedicating more time during class sessions to group meetings, especially in the second half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great learning experience (as you'll read in my personal reflection essay), but I think the workload was too high, especially considering the fact that we had to do fieldwork for 8 days during spring break from 9am to 6pm. The team was very burned out after the break and that affected both our morale and the quality of work in the second half of the semester. Granted, we were told that the expectation was 10 hours of contribution a week, but taking up the entire spring break meant that students had no time to recharge for the second half, especially for the other courses that picked up intensity then. \r\n\r\nI think making this course stretch into two semesters (e.g. AY 2018-19 Semester 2 and AY 2019-2020 Semester 1) would not only protect student welfare, but also improve the quantity and quality of deliverables that we can produce. The first semester could be used for theory research, literature review, etc, and students would take a few days in early/late summer to conduct fieldwork, and then would use the second semester to analyze data and write a proper report. Right now, everything feels very rushed at any given step. If any contingency comes up, there was barely any buffer to deal with them. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a good opportunity for us to put public health knowledge&skills into practice. However, I think some of the projects need to be better planned. The workload of different projects is not even. Also, I hope the projects&content would be more related to climate change and sustainability, but less focused on environmental justice. ",
            "\u00a0I would rate this course very poorly. While there were many frustrating aspects of this course, I will highlight three. As part of the class, I traveled to Alabama for spring break to conduct fieldwork. We had planned to conduct extensive door-to-door canvassing to administer health surveys. However, community members on the ground advised our team not to go alone because of safety concerns. We were a team of three females. When we informed our professor, I was appalled that she suggested we go anyway; and our team had to describe multiple times the safety concerns community members had/explain why we were not going canvassing. Students should never have to explain/justify multiple times why they are not doing something if they believe it would place their safety at risk, and a professor should certainly not encourage students to do something if they and community members they are working with believe it may place them in harm's way.\r\n\r\nI also find it unfortunate that we traveled without petty cash. We incurred many expenses throughout the trip (e.g., for fuel and food), and it took well over a month to receive reimbursements. As a student without an income, that posed financial hardship; and had I known it would have taken so long to receive the reimbursement, I likely would not have gone on the trip. Third, our professor constantly compared our team to another team in the course in front of that other team. She often made it seem like they were doing a better job or glorifying them at our expense, which made the experience quite frustrating. While such comparisons can provide learning opportunities in certain contexts, in this case, the comparisons that were made left us feeling like our work was \"less than\" or not good enough, and, most often, they were inappropriate.\r\n\r\nWith that said, the community we were working in was amazing, and having the opportunity to serve there made this experience worthwhile. I would also like to clarify that there are multiple professors for this course, and I did not work with Professor Dubrow, the primary instructor, on this project. ",
            "\u00a0I think the fact that the class is project-oriented is its strength, but sometimes this underlying structure didn't mesh well with the lectures. I felt like we oftentimes spent whole classes focused on one or two topics that were specific just to a single group, and therefore were a little bit of a waste of others' time. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this was an incredible course. I'm not so sure as to how it could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that most of the course was based on the projects we had chosen and was focused on producing practical output. I would have preferred the lecture half of the class be shortened to give more time with the project groups. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. I loved getting field experience and working with local and state partners outside of the academic environment. I think the class was well structured and I liked hearing about everyone elses projects, as well as about their challenges(so that we could think through how to solve them).  I also liked the presenters/guest lectures for the first half of class and then team meetings in the second half. It gave us just enough time to check in and feel very supported by Professors Dubrow and Engelman-Lado. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes Ive taken at Yale. Rob and Marianne are both amazing professors in terms of giving engaging lectures relevant to the overall learning objectives of the course, and in their availability/engagement with the student team.\r\n\r\nStrengths: \r\n-Great balance of seminar class and time for project teams to meet. Seminars used to workshop individual team projects were really helpful and also interesting to hear what other teams were working on. \r\n-Field component over spring break.\r\n-the Professor team\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Limited interaction with Rob because Marianne was the advisor for the project I was working on. Would have loved more of his feedback and input on our project to provide an additional perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the course and having a regular meeting time where both Rob and Marianne presented to the class. I think it was also good to hear from other groups on their projects and have the class time to help groups. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Dubrow is very knowledgeable about the subject of the class and consistently shows his knowledge. His feedback on project materials was helpful and timely. His teaching/could could have been improved by tailoring class sessions to what students want to learn. ",

I appreciated Professor Dubrows support and guidance throughout the whole project and felt guided but also like we were an independent team making our own decisions. ",
