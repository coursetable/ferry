",
            "\u00a0The professor was very engaging and clear.  He managed to make even quite dry topics interesting to learn.\r\nI felt like I didn't get very much out of section, however, and the way the problem sets were graded wasn't very clear. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the semester was extremely easy, but in my opinion the second half was fairly difficult. If it is possible to go faster at the beginning then allow for a slightly slower second half, I believe it would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0the biggest strength is amazingly fun professor. The only weakness is I wish the formal P set solutions were posted at some point. (instead of relying on the psets handed back) ",
            "\u00a0The professor is absolutely incredible. The P-Sets are doable and great preparation for the exams. No weaknesses that I can think of, other than maybe section shouldn't be only STATA (and PSET prep)? Honestly it was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Material is very well taught - but there wasn't much of it..we spent a whole semester on significance tests and regression analysis which I guess is just to ensure that Global majors are 100% on top of it. Tests and sets were too easy and so points were taken off for very petty things - bit of a lottery. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-structured, going through concepts step-by-step and making sure everyone had a firm grasp on the theoretical aspects. The emphasis on evaluating given statistical analysis was very helpful as well. Sometimes the problem sets felt repetitive, but they ultimately were helpful in that it really made sure that we understood the content. ",

            "\u00a0The strongest part of this course is Justine Thomas. He is a good teacher. The lecture was well-designed. It was interactive. The presentations were well-prepared. They can be counted as good sources. I believe that I can use them later. The problem sets were also well-designed and they all helped me to understand the topic of each week. Stata sessions also covered main syntax that were useful in statistical analysis.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI did not see any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Thomas is SO, so engaging! He tries so hard to make sure that everyone understands the material and his constant reassurance that \"no question is stupid\" is really heartening. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lack of opportunities to meet with TA's before PSETS were due. This probably isn't true for everyone, but I had class during every single office-hour that TA's held. Though I was able to make individual appointments with my TA, it would have been really, really helpful if the class employed some sort of Piazza platform. Also, for the midterm/final, there were a lot of theory questions. There was a lot of conversation during lecture about some of the theory topics, but they were not so in-depth that I felt super prepared to answer those questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Definitely Professor Thomas. He presented the possibly very dull material with vigour and passion that mesmerised all students. He is always willing to answer any and all questions from students, both during the lecture and during office hours. Weakness: More office hours with TF's can be scheduled during more convenient times for students. The demand for office hours was high (especially for questions on Problem Sets), but they were often scheduled during very inconvenient times for many students (e.g. Tuesday morning and afternoon, when most students have other classes). Also, fair warning: problem sets tend to take quite long. Get an early start on those Psets. ",
            "\u00a0While I absolutely enjoyed this course and believe it is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale thus far, my one critique would be that the sample final was not designed necessarily for this course. While I probably shouldn't even be complaining (I mean, we have a sample final), I just wish that final was truly reflective of the course like the sample midterm was. ",
            "\u00a0JT is a very engaging and thorough lecturer. He is also very accessible and helpful (and patient) during office hours. The class moves at a good pace for students who haven't done much / any statistics before and the problem sets and midterm were graded in such a way was to give clear feedback for future work / the concepts. The textbook was especially good because it had lots of practice problems - with the resources JT posted on Canvas, this made reviewing / exam preparation very straightforward. The TFs varied, but mine was really great and I really enjoyed that they taught us to use Stata. Perhaps most importantly, the material feels very relevant / interesting if you're thinking of majoring in the social sciences (particularly if you're interested in the developing world). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Thomas is the best part of the course. Without him, going to lecture would have been very dull. However, the biggest weaknesses are two things. First, sometimes the problem sets were a bit tedious and repetitive, meaning that they felt like rote work. Second, the TF's were quite weak. They did not understand the material that well, which was very evident in the final review session. Additionally, on the practice final the answers of \"see notes\" were incredibly unhelpful, and left me, and many other students, confused. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how much detail Professor Thomas went into with regards to the most important statistical methods. In comparison to a different intro stats course I have taken, I found that having an understanding of the theory and why the methods work really bettered my ability of solving and approaching problems. I no longer simply memorized the type of problems that require certain methods - I was much more able to adapt to different types of problems. The class really excels at driving into your brain the foundations of stats. I see no real weaknesses with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Section time felt like it could be more widely used to practice course material rather than Stata. Psets did not really help with practicing writing about the theoretical questions that were on the exam. Exams did feel fair and straightforward. It would have been helpful to have answers to the psets posted after they were returned so that they could be used to practice for exams. We were told to visit TFs if we had questions, but because they all took turns grading, it was difficult to get straight feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Using the textbook more or please just get rid of it. ",
            "\u00a0This class ran perfectly. The professor made it really easy to learn and it was a fun experience! ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, the classes were educational and engaging and the PSETs were hard enough so that you actually learned. They were a tad long, though. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing professor, and material was very well taught. A bit more of a practical focus on stata from JT would have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0I wish the class moved a little faster at some points ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the class could have focused less on the use of the stata platform, which, while beneficial for some students, took up almost the entirety of section, and therefore took away from time that could have been spent on other facets of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were more ways to get help. There is section, and the professor has office hours (but those are only 15 minutes long, by appointment, and fill up within minutes of being posted), and the TAs will stay late to answer questions, but other than that, you're on your own. To get a tutor took me weeks, and she was great, but it was too late to bail out a sinking ship at that point. For other classes, such as physics, chem, math, etc. , there are drop-in hours, res college tutors, extra tutors set up, etc., but this class was so specific that none of those could apply. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was taught really well. The material was ordered in a logical fashion, such that each concept built upon the preceding material without being too overwhelming at once while also challenging us to incorporate all of our skillset and advancing it further. There was a lot of support regarding the problem sets and overall just understanding the more conceptual material, both on the part of the professor and the TFs. ",
            "\u00a0Not very many weaknesses. I do wish I could have learned even more skills I could apply to research, but that's not a fault of the class. We already learned so much in such a short period of time. Statistics can be kind of dry, but JT makes it fun, and not only is he great at explaining things, but he also shows you how the statistics concepts can be applied to social science research. Great class! ",
            "\u00a0This class moved so slowly that it was difficult to pay attention during lecture and the level of the Teaching Assistants varied drastically. JT is a really engaging person, but the course itself is pretty boring. I would have preferred more research \"applied\" examples using stata in class. ",
            "\u00a0Outside of the lecture, students were given freedom to connect with and get help from the professors and professional students. However, I think a lot of the learning, however, was independent. If you did well on the problem sets, you can keep up... if not it is hard to configure yourself in the flow of the course. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, this course only had strengths. The material was very interesting and the skills we learned very applicable. I enjoyed going to class and looked forward to completing the problem sets, something that does not always occur. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is great and delivers the information in a concise and easy to understand way, the only thing I would recommend is there being an official day of class dedicated to review of the material. "

If you are a prospective global affairs major, you should wait until admitted to the major before you take this class. Otherwise, it is a waste of time and does not provide adequate instruction in the material. ",

Straightforward and not overwhelming PSETS. JT is amazing. The bulk of the material is in the second half of the class though, post-midterm, so watch out for that.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. This is a GREAT intro to statistics course. Professor Thomas is INCREDIBLY engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, great for non STEM students ",
            "\u00a0Its a relatively easy class for Global affairs. ",
            "\u00a0i would recommend this course to any student who wants a basic understanding of statistics and has not taken statistics before colleges. ",
            "\u00a0Professor JT is great. He really is. He explains things clearly and using general English instead of \"Math\" and technical jargon. He's funny and really great with all of us in the class. That definitely helped. If you are able to keep up, then you'll do great and learn a lot, and it will be an amazing class. Get behind, and it's just about impossible for you to come back. ",
            "\u00a0I can honestly say that this class has made statistics interesting, and even enjoyable. From Justin Thomas, who is an incredible professor that made lectures fun and engaging, to the awesome TFs that helped out with this course, I felt like I learned so much through this course and learned a lot of analytical skills that have definitely helped me out in other classes I have taken as well. It is pretty awesome to do readings of scholarly articles for other classes and realize that I can understand their statistical methodologies--and even critique them in some areas! The work was manageable and the problem sets really helped set you up for success on the tests; everything was definitely very fair, and if you had a good grasp of the problem sets and the concepts discussed in class (go to lecture!!), then you will be just fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes of course! JT is great, and statistics is really important for anyone going into the social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for Global majors and is a reasonable quant class to fulfill distributional requirements--don't take this class for fun or for intellectual stimulation. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good QR. It allows students to think about how math and sciences are actually useful beyond college. However, it isnt necessarily interesting if you are looking for a class that makes you think critically beyond understanding some mthemaical theory and formulas. JT and the TAs are great and will help if you seek it. This is one of the best possible lecture math classes you can take. The exams are okay- the math is easy, but sometimes the theory came as a surprise. It was never hard, but unclear what possible questions and scopes would be asked and in what depth. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student that wants to learn the skills of statistics and how to evaluate research. I would also recommend this course to anyone looking for a QR credit, since its interesting and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in statistics and statistical methods this is a great introductory course. "
