            "\u00a0Learnt about how leaders in different organizations are dealing with change in the development world. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a wonderful addition to my graduate education. I loved the mix of practitioners perspective as well as academic perspective. I feel that I really gained an understanding of how the development world is changing and how i can be a better manager and leader moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered a foundation of knowledge leading change in global development. Students gained skills in strategic thinking, writing consulting memos, working with others. The guest speakers wonderfully supplemented Professor MacCormack's teaching style in a way to prepare us all to enter the field of global development as young professionals. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a good overview of the current challenges facing development organizations and particularly the need for transformation in response to these changing challenges. The approaches taken to change management within organizations has been really useful. ",
            "\u00a0A really nice introduction and overview of the field of global development - ranging from the types of organizations that exist in the system, different roles/jobs that people can have, how organizations are funded, etc. Additionally, introductions to the types of \"disruptive forces\" that are impacting organizations to change how they go about their mission. \r\n\r\nA nice focus on personal leadership and career goals. That practical level of discussion and advice is often absent from Yale courses, in my experiences, and it was refreshing to have conversations with other students, as well as seasoned professionals, about what is necessary (outside of issue-based knowledge alone) to advance and grow in a career over time. ",

            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about the field of international development as a whole, but also from the guest speakers, I learned what it means to be a professional in different types of organizations. "

Consistent feedback on assignments, class, and being continually asked for feedback on the class\r\n4. Small class size\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Not everyone in the class was engaged which occasionally led to one sided monologues during the discussion section ",

Professor MacCormack routinely asked for feedback and adjusted the course accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers were of great value to class discussions. The readings however were excessive and often repetitive and were often not discussed during class sessions. \r\n\r\nIt would also be useful to think about some current case studies of development organizations undergoing change management.

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Guest speakers - some were really strong, and it was a great opportunity to hear directly from leaders in their field! Charlie did a great job pulling in speakers that represented different parts of the system.\r\n- Charlie was a fantastic teacher and clearly has a wealth of knowledge and experience in this field! \r\n- A good overview of different issues facing global development, different roles played within the system\r\n- Diversity of student experiences and expertise - what an amazing room of people! (SOM, Jackson, Forestry, Public Health)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Guest speakers don't always tie directly to the readings\r\n- There can be little incentive to do the readings if they aren't discussed in class. Perhaps more frequent reading responses, or other in-class activities could more directly reference and draw upon the readings.\r\n- Some guest speakers were less dynamic than others\r\n- Some speakers/discussions stayed more at the surface level and didn't dive deeply into disruptive changes they were facing, how to tackle them, etc.\r\n- Consulting Memos and Change Management Plans - might make sense to line up organizations ahead of time as partners/case-studies so students can pair up and have real-world organizations to examine throughout the course of the semester.\r\n- More time for discussions in-class! While guest speakers are so valuable, there was also a lot of student expertise in the room from people's careers and experiences before Yale. I wish I would've heard more from my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately we did not rely on the readings. The lectures focused on conversations with guests. As a result not everyone got to ask questions. With time it became very boring ",
            "\u00a0The guest lectures were amazing and Charlie was a wonderful support and mentor and clearly loves teaching. I felt that there could have been more structured lecture time, or even just more class time in general. "
