            "\u00a0Close reading, ability to connect history to theory ",
            "\u00a0Social Governance in Early America used a combination of primary materials from early America (mostly focused in New England) and secondary sources (a lot of theory by Foucault and Agamben) to teach us about key concepts in biopolitics. Although early America is the topic, the course teaches you how to apply biopolitical theory to the things you're interested in; we were encouraged to write final papers about biopolitics in early America but didn't have to. ",
            "\u00a0Totally new kind of class for me - heavy engagement with theory (and primary sources) lead by the genius that is Greta. Such a cool and original class. Take it take it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read \"social theory.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course challenged me to think about history and culture through a biopolitical lens, which was a completely new perspective for me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the syllabus. I thought pairing primary sources and secondary theoretical material was very successful. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job mixing abstract concepts and historical background. Every topic was open for discussion, but the conversation was still kept well focused. The only potential weakness might have been that, on a couple of occasions, I felt like the discussion stuck to details in the readings at the cost of looking at the big picture. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of feedback we got in this course was a huge strength! Professor LaFleur and Camille gave us helpful feedback on every reading response (every other week) that were to check in on our understanding of the theoretical assertions in the week's reading. Both of them made themselves available for meetings about material or about the final paper, which we were able to get feedback on through the midterm assignment, which was an annotated bibliography for the final. Discussions were interesting and really fun! Small classes tend to be kind of awkward at times with long silences, but the reading responses are helpful to remind you of what you found interesting in the readings and Professor LaFleur and Camille do a good job of making sure everyone's on the same page by either opening up with a short lecture or doing an activity to facilitate a conversation about what the main points of the secondary materials were. ",
            "\u00a0Greta is the perfect professor to guide you through the hard readings. I think sometime some of the primary source readings were a bit arduous. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't feel like I learned that much about early America.  I mainly learned about some social theorists, and read some wacky primary sources from the 18th and 19th centuries.  I think the title of the course is a bit of a misnomer.  Given my experience of the course, it should be \"A Situated Introduction to Biopolitics\" (with some stuff by Bentham). ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the discussion-based classes, but would have appreciated some historical context for certain pieces before we approached them. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend this to anyone interested, especially to anyone interested in early America, Foucault, or biopolitics ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in theory and willing to do the readings. I was not particularly interested in learning about governance in early America, but Professor LaFleur is a really fun lecturer/discussion facilitator and I found the general concepts/theories really fascinated. The theory is pretty complicated and a little bit hard to grasp, but discussions are great for parsing things out and finding examples both in early America and more broadly throughout history to illustrate them with. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Intellectual challenge but you are never left in the dark. Really rewarding because a lot of the content feels very relevant. Greta is a genius!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Very empowering to learn to dissect thinkers that we have all pretended we've read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a great introduction to biopolitical theory, grounded in a specific historical moment ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student is interested in a blend of history and philosophy. "
