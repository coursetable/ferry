            "\u00a0My knowledge of Russian grew tremendously in this course. Now, I finally feel comfortable expressing myself in Russian! ",
            "\u00a0Best course I have had this year. I reached a B1 level within 10 months and I can say that it helps you properly talk in Russian for daily life purposes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course, including the final case and just generally improved my ability to read, speak, and write Russian. "

            "\u00a0In general, this was a great course. A lot of material is introduced in a short amount of time, but Tatiana was fantastic, so she was able to make sure we were keeping up. I think it would be very difficult to take RUSS 220 with a teacher who was not engaged as Tatiana. One weakness is that the units are a bit rushed towards the end, but this was not major. Overall, really nothing to improve. Just know, this course is a LOT harder than RUSS 110, which I found pretty easy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super efficient in delivering all what is needed to learn this complicated language. Many resources, exercises and exams to improve quickly. \r\nNo weaknesses !! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A pretty well-structured course. For the most part, it felt like each unit built on the previous ones. I feel like I've made great progress in just two semesters of Russian at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--Pretty much everything. TATIANA WAS AMAZING! She's probably the best teacher I've ever had and truly cares about her students. Weaknesses--Sometime there was a little too much work, but it's not an easy language and the only way to excel is to practice as much as possible. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who was willing to make Russian a top priority in their life. If you want to learn Russian, there is no better way to do it than by taking this course. If you just want to fill your language requirement, do NOT take RUSS 220. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course which is one of the most amazing I have had. Tatiana's section was the best and I enjoyed it so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I most definitely would recommend this course to another student. Russian is a beautiful language and you will take a deep dive into it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Tatiana Sergeevna is a wonderful teacher and gives you an authentic classroom experience. Learning Russian gives you a job opportunity no matter what happens to you. "
