            "\u00a0Read some cool anthropological texts, got a little bit closer to figuring out what an \"ethnography\" is ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to think anthropologically. It clearly addressed the problems with the field of anthropology in the past and acknowledged them in the texts we read, which was refreshing. I learned a ton about anthropology of outer space specifically and how to think about situations in ways I wouldn't have previously. I also learned to acknowledge context in everything I read or wrote. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the core concepts and themes of anthropology and how anthropology can be implemented in a subject that is inherently inhuman. I learned about how anthropology is studied, how it is useful, and obtained a non-technical perspective on space and space exploration. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write academic papers. I also learned how to conduct research. ",
            "\u00a0It was a  mostly intro anthro class despite being higher level in number, and it gave a good survey of sociocultural anthropology with a specific example of outer space ",
            "\u00a0A really cool class, especially for STEM majors since it gives you a new and valuable way of looking at the sciences. You learn anthropological skills while studying the interesting material of outer space. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of anthropological texts, how to bring the anthropological approach to topics related to outer space, essay written and argumentative writing. "

            "\u00a0I actually liked that this class was taught as a cross between a lecture and a seminar. It was nice to have guidance and direction, but most classes turned into great discussions between the students. In the future I think it should be listed as a seminar and not a lecture, though. I don't think it would work with more students than about 15. Most of the readings were really interesting, and weren't too long or dense. I learned a lot through this course! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the structure of the class; we had to write a reading response for each of the four units in the class, and had a midterm and final paper. I really appreciated how the reading responses and class were designed based on student interest and how the class wasn't assessment focused. Although the class is designed as lecture style, it quickly became like a seminar, discussing extremely interesting readings and concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Just the right amount of work, could be a writing credit though, helped me develop writing skills ",
            "\u00a0This course would've been cooler with a more diverse representation of different majors to get different points of view on the topics we discussed, but I get why it's a great course for science majors to take! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good structure and division of topics, assignments are well spread out and reading load is fair. Readings go together in a way that furthers knowledge of the topics. \r\n\r\nWays to improve: Assign background readings instead of doing background sections in lecture so more time can be spent going through readings.

            "\u00a0This was a great course! I would definitely recommend it. It consists of interesting readings (not too much theory), 4 short reading responses, and a midterm and final paper. Classes consisted of power-point presentations that facilitated discussions instead of simply being lectures. The readings were used to support ideas discussed in class, and although occasionally the discussions got a little too existential, overall they were very intellectually stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. This was my first anthropology class, and I absolutely loved the structure and concepts that were discussed. Questions like \"Why ARE we so interested in exploring Mars?\", \"Are humans the only intelligent species in space?\", \"How does science fiction depict human nature?\" and so many more were thoroughly asked and discussed. I also have a solid understanding in what anthropology is and the field of anthropology as a whole. It was great because it was a perfect blend of something that is so technically discussed in society, and putting a humanistic lens was refreshing and fascinating. After this course I definitely want to take another class in anthropology, and as an engineering major I have a new perspective of the sciences, which is remarkable and something I am very grateful for. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Professor Messeri did a great job of providing feedback and explaining topics. ",
            "\u00a0A pretty unique class, would recommend to both STEM and humanities majors! ",
            "\u00a0It was a nice introduction to anthropology. If you have the chance to take it, I would, but it may not be the same without Prof. Messeri. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The reading load is very manageable and the texts themselves are extremely diverse and interesting to read. Although there are some more challenging anthropology texts, they are explained and easy to comprehend in the context of the course. "
