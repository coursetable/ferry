            "\u00a0Proof-writing was the fundamental takeaway from this course, but Pat offers so much more than that. Its a course that encourages exploration, mistakes, growth, and engagement with math in any of its forms. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that math is not a set of predetermined skills and knowledge but rather an exploration and an approach to problem-solving and thinking creatively. ",
            "\u00a0Cool intro to problem solving ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different areas of math and about what mathematicians actually do. I learned that math can be fun and artistic. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater appreciation of math and what mathematicians do, and I broadened the scope of what my perception of math is. ",
            "\u00a0This course enables me to begin thinking of math in a completely different, more creative, more positive way. It helped me feel empowered to tackle math. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, we got to work and play with a lot of analytical, critical-thinking puzzles and problems. We learned how to think about math in a new way; it's not about turning in long problem sets that are monotonous and repetitive, it's about collaboration, playing without being afraid to fail. Topics included topography, subtraction games, Cantor's diagonalization, infinity, how to write proofs, and so on. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater understanding of the joy of mathematics, and the passion of mathematicians. I learned about the history and philosophy of math, as well as various practical problem solving techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a wonderful confidence-booster for people who think they are bad at math, not because the course isn't challenging, but rather because it creates a new definition of math. I had a wonderful time in this course, especially at the beginning. This course will make you love math, no matter who you are! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are too many to name, from the interesting assignments to each class being themed around a question. The class was a creative environment and I really liked that. I think that pacing-wise it could be slowed down a bit, but overall fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: field trips, collaboration with other students in class, writing on the glass walls in the CTL, stuffed Angry Birds, Pat's sense of humor and commitment to teaching.\r\nAreas for Improvement: In the second half of the class it felt like we were doing less math than the first half. I loved doing problem sets with tricky puzzles and games, and when we had a lot of classes in a row with guests or field trips, it felt less like a math class. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing prof, super engaging\r\n\r\nNot a lot of directly applicable content ",
            "\u00a0This course was very fun. It was a great course because each week was sort of an introduction to a new subfield of math. We played games, went on field trips and just had a good time exploring what high level math actually is. ",
            "\u00a0I could have participated more in class and attended more office hours ",
            "\u00a0I thought the math was really fun; there is a good balance between problem sets and readings.\r\n\r\nI love reflecting on my work and thoughts, but sometimes writing long reflections can become monotonous. ",
            "\u00a0This course took sort of a dramatic downhill plunge at the end of the semester, when we had several guest facilitators in a row. It felt like Pat was running out of ideas. I was disappointed because the course had started off giving us challenging math puzzles every day and difficult problem sets. As it went on, problem sets became more writing and reflection-based.  While this made them much, much easier, it also made them more boring! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you think you arent good at math, take this course. If you think you are good at math, take this course. Literally take this course if you want to think about math in new, fun, constructive, creative ways. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student, STEM or otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, and I think that it's a great choice for anyone who thinks they're \"bad at math.\" Pat makes the class fun and engaging, and it's so rare to take a college math class that's a small seminar with so much collaboration! Pat is definitely a professor who cares about his students, about diversity in STEM, and just generally a fun and accessible person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolute, Pat completely changed the way I see math. The course was fun and enlightening, Pat is a great facilitator of student discussion, and he made excellent use of Yale resources (the Babylonian Collection and the Peabody) to connect with course material. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student. Im a potential math major who has been sort of worn down by all the strict and difficult math courses Ive taken over the years so this was a good reminder of why math is fun and why I enjoyed it when I was younger. Its a great course for anyone, even those with a lot of math experience just looking to have fun with the subject again. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is interested in math but has had bad experiences with it in the past ",
            "\u00a0It made me truly appreciate math, so yes... immensely. Lots of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think everyone should learn about how to look at math in a new light; it's not just about learning calculus, but about working with others to solve things that feel unsolvable. It's very creative and thought-provoking, and altogether an incredible intellectual challenge to play with. It's very on-your-feet, very contemplative, and very welcoming (with my class, I didn't feel afraid to fail). Even if you think math should be more about calculus or stats, you should take this course, as it will open up a door to a new outlook on math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they were not STEM students. I think this course does a great job of making math accessible to someone with little to no experience or interest. The instructor is encouraging, the problems are fun, and the classroom is an inclusive collaborative environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but with the caveat that the class gets less exciting as it goes on. Maybe this is harsh--it was just the last two or so weeks when the class wasn't totally excellent. When we had the succession of the diversity in STEM discussion (important but was done in a way that felt very high-school and a little condescending), the professor who had the theory about music being similar to proofs (but didn't really have anything useful to say about it), and the origami club (felt like the whole visit could have been one slide in a lecture rather than an entire class!)
