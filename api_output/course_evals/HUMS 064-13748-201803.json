",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot anout how to remember a patients humanity and be empathetic in clinical situations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the humanistic aspect of being a physician: how to approach patients, how to empathize with patients, how to deal with failure, how to deal with death, and more. I learned that being a doctor is so much more than studying in isolation.\r\n\r\nI developed many skills, particularly in regards to letting go of what I deemed how I should learn. I also was exposed to writing a paper, where I learned much about citing sources (Endnote), developing searches, and more.\r\n\r\nI gained many insights into medicine outside of the textbook mantra. I learned how to look at things more objectively without personal biases, especially through the trip to the art gallery and the visit by the music professor. ",

            "\u00a0In taking this course I learned to think critically about many systematic problems in medicine today and how I, as a pre-medical student, can work to combat them in the future. I also learned the importance of other fields in medicine and different perspectives on many different issues, such as lack of access to healthcare and lack of empathy. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging readings, deep class discussions ",
            "\u00a0The class was a little unorganized. There were always changes being made to the syllabus and the professor was not always clear about due dates. Also, the submission for our weekly reflections was through email instead of canvas, and I would not always get a grade returned on my papers. ",
            "\u00a0the course was very helpful but I however wish there was a platform on canvas for submitting and keeping track of our weekly reflections. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the insightful readings we had. Weakness was the lack of engagement in the class among classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a very strong course with interesting material and an appropriate work load. I feel that maybe one or two more classes with the interactive aspects, such as the heart sound music or the museum, would perhaps further increase engagement. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are incredibly interesting and the discussions are great to be a part of. I do wish that the reflections were a little more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the course was very well designed in terms of curriculum. The professor did a good job of organizing readings by topic, which really facilitated the discussions and built on top of each other.\r\n\r\nI thought the course was graded a bit subjectively, which is understandable, but a bit stressful at times.\r\n\r\nI thought the course could be improved with more feedback and timely responses from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are generally very interesting and discussion is enjoyable to be a part of. The field trip and guest speaker session was unique and valuable, and the course really felt like it had purpose and direction. It could be improved organizationally, perhaps with the involvement of a TA or use of Canvas for reflections. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the range of sources we read from, and getting to know and discuss with the students in general. A better way to submit reflections would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good readings, insightful discussion. Weaknesses: Some classes had too much assigned reading for a thorough discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The method of submitting the weekly reflections could be refined, either through in a more organized system on Canvas or simply on paper. A more even distribution of the readings would have been nice, but not essential. Dr. Sledge is a fantastic instructor and leads a great class that, if you pay attention, will help to develop you as a person and a caregiver. Given the amount of writing involved, I feel that this course should have been a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material and the discussions were fantastically well thought out, however the organization of the course itself was a bit difficult to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the class discussions were often too scattered in terms of ideas and topics brought up by each student. Most of the discussions progressed with each student simply stating what he or she thought was \"interesting\" about the reading, and we did not go into as much depth as possible. ",
            "\u00a0A very big strength in the class was the readings chosen; many of them were very interesting and gave me a new perspective on the medical community as a whole and gave me much to consider. I also enjoyed writing the reflections because it gave me a chance to write down points I may not have gotten across in class. Something that could be improved was the grading method, but I believe that was a consequence of not having conducted this type of grading before. Another aspect that could be improved was class discussions. They were very interesting, but since it was such a large group, I feel many people's voices got lost, especially if you sat at the back. Maybe talking in smaller groups and then sharing with the class, while also encouraging people to respond to others would fix such a problem. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was a very engaging course, and I learned so much about the humanistic side of medicine. This course deepened my interest in pursuing a pre-med path in college. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student. I feel like you could get just as much out of this class by reading 2-3 of the selected books on your own time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in becoming premed. ",
            "\u00a0yes. it's z great seminar to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a very interesting and life-changing seminar that helped me affirm my aspiration to become a doctor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially other pre-Med students because it was extremely helpful and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a fantastic course that teaches you a lot about something that is often forgotten in medicine but that is important! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is considering becoming a physician, as you get introduced to a lot of different perspectives. However, I would also caution students as the course may not be as easy to parse as you think. It requires a lot of thought, especially in the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend it to premeds interested in the humanities and the roles and responsibilities of doctors. Keep in mind that most students will be interested in becoming a physician but it is by no means exclusive to that population and there are varying degrees of interest in the profession. As long as you are engaged and contribute to conversation, it is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting inside look on medicine and the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0If they were interested in going into medicine, yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any pre-med, especially one with an interest in humanities and the doctor's and patient's experience in the medical system. It will still be an interesting course for students who are not pre-med, but the instruction and structure basically assume that you are pre-med, so I'm not sure what the experience would be like for non-pre-meds. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about medicine on a whole new level, this is the course for you! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in reading literature about humanities in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you are pre-med and am interested in learning more about the doctor-patient relationship and the history behind modern medicine. However, even if you do not plan to become a healthcare professional in the future, this course will provide valuable insight on how incredibly connected the science of medicine is to the abstract humanities, as well as foster a deeper appreciation for physicians, nurses, and healthcare staff. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is even thinking about becoming a physician because it exposes you to so many systematic issues that doctors should know before graduating medical school. I believe it is a great way to teach students about these issues before they transform from patient to doctor and it brings up many issues one should keep in mind for many years to come. It also exposes you to many different areas of interest and ways of thinking that will be useful in a career as a physician or anyone who works within the medical sphere, whether it be as a nurse practitioner, as a scientist or as an administrator. In addition, the people you meet are just as committed to solving these problems as you are. "
