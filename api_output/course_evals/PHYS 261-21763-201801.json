            "\u00a0This course introduces the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, the latter culminating in a study of physical cosmology. These are the things that I learned. The course began with a historical review of the experimental motivation for quantum mechanics and the original development of quantum relations (such as those of Planck, Einstein and DeBroglie). The relationship between experiment and theory is discussed. Experimental quantum uncertainty (Heisenberg's uncertainty principle) is introduced as a fundamental feature of nature at the Planck scale, and uncertainty is explored through the mathematical lens of Fourier analysis, which is developed as necessary. Then, you will learn about the nature of wavefunctions and their relation to physical phenomena via probability amplitudes. Ultimately, Schrdinger's equation is introduced and justified. The simple implications of the equation and its various forms are then explored.  Basic and canonical quantum mechanical problems such as potential wells and the Hydrogen atom are considered. Then, the course pivots. Special relativity, which is introduced in PHYS 260, is revisited in the context of electrodynamics. Classical electromagnetism, manifest in Coulomb's law, is made Lorentz covariant, thus generating a relativistic theory of electrodynamics which implies Maxwell's equations. To accomplish this task, tensor analysis and calculus will be developed in class. Having done this, the course moves on to create a relativistic theory of gravity, which, recognizing the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass, is in fact a general theory of relativity for accelerating bodies.  The resulting theory that you'll come to learn (or, at least, understand the underlying concept of), is often said to be the most beautiful scientific theory, period. The course is ambitious and how much you learn is really up to you. If you follow along with Prof. Baltay's arguments, and invest the requisite time, you really can learn all of this. The math at times is challenging, but is taught well. This course is a fantastic introduction to modern physics. ",

Prof. Baltay won't be teaching this course next year, so the content may change. This semester is mainly about introducing you to cool things in physics and having you understand the concepts behind them / derivations, and to get you excited about physics. It won't give you enough depth to cover all of GR or quantum -- each of those is a class in and of itself. ",

I had the chance to breifly explore Quantum Mechanics, General Relativity, and Cosmology, and I got a much better sense for where physics is today. I discovered that Cosmology interested me very much, particularly the question of how the universe behaved near or at its birth. I may end up pursuing further research in this area as a result. It is a rare oppotunity to have access to these topics as early as freshman year, and I'm very thankful for it. This course throws convoluted material at students at a rapid pace with little time for the conceptual side to sink in. This was in some ways a difficult experience, but in others I believe in was extremely beneficial. I truly feel that I learned better how to learn this semester largely as a result of this class. I had to get used to plunging into a topic and absorbing everything as quickly as possible, and that made me more adaptable in general. ",

            "\u00a0The course is intentionally designed as a survey course: this is what is great about it. You'll get a taste of everything, and in this way, be able to decide what your interests in physics really are. Are you a quantum field theorist, doing string theory calculations or predicting particle trajectories? Or are you a general relativist or cosmologist, trying to understand the evolution of large scale structures? The course, at times, feels like you are missing a part of the picture. And of course, you are! This course doesn't pretend to teach you everything there is to know about quantum mechanics or general relativity. In fact, you should be wary of anyone who tells you both subjects can be completely covered in a single-semester course. That being said, you still learn quite a bit. You will learn a lot of quantum mechanics and general relativity, but be prepared to leave with more questions than answers. And that's the point. That's a true strength of the course.  The fact that, after taking PHYS 261, you have more questions about the subject material than you did before, means that you've learned enough to begin asking and phrasing those questions. Having taken the course, you're in: Welcome to the wonderful world of physics! There's a long and wide, winding road ahead. There's a lot of virtue in having broad survey courses such as this one. There is no need to hurry to get to advanced physics courses in college, earlier. Slow down and enjoy the walk through the park. It's better you learn something well than learn it too early or too quickly. This course gives you a first view of quantum mechanics and general relativity. When you see it next time, it'll be like an old friend. You'll be more comfortable with those equations when you see them for the second time. And as you see things again and again, you'll learn and understand them better. By taking PHYS 261, you're getting the opportunity to explore and begin to understand these concepts in friendly, low-pressure way. There are low costs for failure and high benefits for having seen these ideas, in this context. Think of it as an investment. ",
            "\u00a0Quantum mechanics as taught well, but general relativity was very hard to understand because of the math (tensor analysis) required. I felt like I was able to understand the conceptual parts, the technicalities of some of the derivations were well above most students' heads. This being said, I do not regret taking it even though it was a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Baltay is a very good lecturer - he explains concepts clearly, gives analogies to real-life processes, and also throws in a bit of history! We also got course note packets for all the quantum and relativity units, which were immensely helpful for reviewing, doing homework, and following on the lecture. Without the note packets, however, the lectures would have been way way too fast - it was basically impossible to take notes from scratch (like on a notebook instead annotating the packets) because the speed at which the slides were presented. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like we tried to do too much. It felt too superficial a lot of the time. So I don't feel like I really UNDERSTAND the material. I feel like making this a more rigorous course (as in do more quantum mechanics in depth etc) would've been better. \r\n\r\nAlso the problem sets were not intellectually challenging at all. So maybe that couldn't been improved. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers very interesting material, and the professor is certainly very knowledgeable in the topic. However, much of the class consisted of teaching from PowerPoint slides, which I do not find super effective. I wish the professor had done more problems in class. I also wish that we had not moved as quickly through general relativity and cosmology, because we covered a lot of content and it was hard to tell which of the topics we actually needed to know. I think more time should have been spent on tensor analysis, because the confusing notation often made future topics more difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0A better instructor! ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, but the general relativity unit is confusing. There are errors in the note packet, and tensor analysis is not well explained. ",
            "\u00a0It covered way too much material in a way that was not conducive to learning. Honestly I would just remove this course in a perfect world, and just have 260 as a full introductory course (equivalent to both 180 and 181 or 200 and 201), then take the next level of physics in the second semester (i.e. advanced classical mechanics (410) or E&M, or quantum). The course just covers too much material and gives you no depth of understanding. Additionally, the level of math in the course is prohibitive- we had to learn all of Fourier transforms and Tensor Analysis in a half hour chunk of lecture each. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course -- I enjoyed getting a better intuition for hard concepts in physics. It doesn't go in to as much depth as you might want, but that's impossible in such a broad course. ",
            "\u00a0not very fun ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I like how much material we cover. Im quite happy with how many different kinds of physics we saw over the course of the year, and how interesting it all was. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures for this class, especially towards the end, were damn near incomprehensible. This is not a function of how hard the material is, but how it was presented. There were next to no review sessions for anything, section was scheduled at a time when it conflicted with lab for half of the class, and the expectation for what we needed to know for the exams was wildly unclear. The lecture notes are literally filled with errors, and are impossible to learn from. I spent more time reading textbooks not used in the course to understand what was going on. The Modern Physics by Krane textbook is a joke, something that belongs in a high school course rather than in an intensive college course, which is baffling since Shankar, who wrote THE BOOK on undergrad quantum mechanics is a professor here. Lectures were given off of PowerPoint slides instead of writing on a board, and consisted of the professor literally just reading his own error-filled notes, so attending lecture was a moot point. The requisite mathematics is explained poorly, and I got more help in the math department than in the physics department. Canvas is not utilized at all. \r\n\r\nPlease, hire peer tutors and more than one graduate TF. Have a professor who works s willing to devote significant time to helping us learn teach the course. Use eithe Griffiths or Shankar for the Quantum textbook, and use Carroll for GR. Do NOT make the course cover less material, just use better resources to teach the material better (I am super happy I got to take a course that touched on GR). ",
            "\u00a0This course is quite bad. First, there's not much reason for it to exist. It mostly acts as a filler course; a time waster for highly qualified first-years interested in physics. First year students that are qualified to take this course should be in 410 and 440 in their first-year. But, if we operate under the assumption that it has reason to exist, it is still a bad course. It is mostly the professor discussing topics he is interested in, with no clear purpose or direction. The problem sets are not difficult and don't represent the exam material in the least. The exams are frustrating because the questions are either derivations that we are expected to memorize from the professor's notes, or questions that require a specific formula, yet we don't get a formula sheet (so it's just a lot of memorization). This course has some serious flaws, it needs to be reworked considering that it made me (someone who absolutely loved physics in high school) debate whether I still liked the topic and liked the department at Yale (that's another discussion, but I've found the physics department to be very unwelcoming and uncommunicative). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the materials that it covers and the access that it gives students to new topics of study. The weaknesses are that it is, as a result, largely a survey course and perhaps not at the level of depth that a class in, say, mechanics could be. That said, I believe that this is inevitable because the topics introduced are brand new, and I don't think that the wide range of content should be sacrificed for a more intense understanding of a more specified area. ",
            "\u00a0The ambition of Physics 261 was both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness. The course covered topics of modern physics usually reserved for students much older than freshman. Sometimes Professor Baltay's approach was very successful and sometimes it wasn't as with attempting to teach us the entirety of tensor analysis in half a lectures. I wished we had gone a little slower and more in depth on a handful of topics, rather than attempt to span the entirety of modern physics in a single semester. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not terribly engaging, but interesting. ",

            "\u00a0There are very few grades in this course, so a lot of weight is placed on a midterm and final that are composed of very few questions. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was uninteresting and hard to follow. The material covered was interesting and rarely covered in a first year physics course, though, and I really appreciated that. ",
            "\u00a0One of the course's strengths is the structure of its curriculum -- each new topic clearly built on the last, especially during general relativity, where comparing the derivations and concepts to analogous ones in relativistic electrodynamics was super helpful for learning.\r\n\r\nEvery student got a custom-printed book of Prof Baltay's general relativity notes, which was a super helpful reference, but had a lot of typos, which made working from this book kind of difficult.

            "\u00a0Yes, certainly; if you're interested in physics, then this is the course for you (after taking PHYS 260 or similar). This course is an excellent prelude to higher-level, serious undergraduate and graduate physical science courses. It teaches you to appreciate physics from a different perspective. It brings in two of the most important theories in the history of physics and explains their essential features. I feel like a basic understanding of general relativity and quantum mechanics is quite important for any aspiring physicist, and this course provides just that. ",

            "\u00a0Would highly recommend for anyone getting an introduction to physics beyond E&M! The content of the course is super super interesting - you delve into quantum mechanics and general relativity, while not super rigorously, but with enough rigor to appreciate the underlying structure of the ideas. Now, I can much better say I understand general statements like the Uncertainty Principle and \"Matter curves space.\" We also did a bit of cosmology, trying to understand the fate of the universe from a mathematically-grounded perspective which was super fun! \r\n\r\nProblem sets are not too bad (only a few hours a week), but not representative of the exam questions, at least for quantum mechanics. Exams are almost completely based on the note packets and often involve derivations, which force you to try to understand the fundamental ideas behind the physics. Grading seems pretty generous. ",

But many classes will consist of you understanding very little of what is happening (especially for cosmology). The tests were hard but reasonable. Take the class if you are interested in the topics and willing to put in the work, or if it is required for your major. ",

Skip straight to PHYS 4XX if you want to do the major and feel comfortable with calculus, or take 200/201 if you want more review. Those courses are better taught and have more help for students. If Baltay is not teaching, go for it. The topics covered and the pace of this course are better than 200/201, and with a good teacher you could go very far and learn a lot from it. ",

First-year physics students, if you are well-prepared (which you are if you are interested in this course) then know that you can take physics 410 and 440 in your first year and still pursue a physics major. Other students, Physics 200 and 201 will surely be more interesting and fulfilling than this course, take those courses instead. This course has a highly qualified professor that doesn't know how to teach. The textbooks are very weak and don't line up with what is taught in class (yet problem sets are assigned from them). The TA was nice but wasn't very clear on what was being covered in class and what the exams would look like. ",

If their goal is to satisfy the requirements of the physics major as quickly as possible, this probably would not be the course for them. However, if they want to be challenged intellectually and work to understand some of the most expectation-defying material that they have been exposed to, this is a good option. I'm very glad that I took the chance to expand my horizons in this way, but at the same time, this is not necessarily a practical course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very difficult conceptually, though the workload was never unmanageable. Professor Baltay is not particularly gifted at explaining difficult concepts in a way that makes sense, and doesn't have a good sense of the pace he needs to go at to help students understand the material, nor does he provide extra resources or help outside of his lecture notes. But the material is incredibly interesting, and if you are self-motivated to learn it, you will be totally blown away. ",
