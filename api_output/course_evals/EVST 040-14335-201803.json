            "\u00a0This class basically hands academic research to you on a plate in the first semester of your first year. I learned how environmental scientists conduct research, present findings, and write about their findings. I also learned a lot about the Peabody Museum and its promising future. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to conduct real research and how to write about it in a brief period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Proposing and manifesting a scientific research project ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the scientific method and actually working with professors on research. My personal project taught me a lot about drawing conclusions from imprecise methods and a lot about mammal anatomy. ",
            "\u00a0I never imagined that I would learn so much about such complex fields. It was never something I had imagined studying, however, it was thoroughly enriching. It was also helpful to learning to structure and right a term project. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper insight into the scientific method, along with research and presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work effectively in creating a scientific paper and presentation that represent the methods and analyses carries out in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Since everyone's project was different, I specifically learned a lot about basic skull anatomy, characterizing mammal skulls, reading scholarly text, writing a small research paper, and time management. I also got an insight into how large the collections at the Peabody are through my peers' projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course facilitates self-teaching and research in an area where one may have no prior knowledge. There is a loose structural framework, but it is upon each student to take their project from a three-sentence description to a 10-20 page scientific report. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to work independently as well as work with a mentor outside of regular class time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strength: You get out of this class entirely what you put in to it. I was able to conduct a full bodied research project and came away with great relationships with my project advisor, a collections manager of the Peabody. I learned statistics and a bit of R. Others did not really get anything out of the course. They were not able to design their project as much as I was, and in the end, did not present their findings in any sort of passionate way. Thus, while a strength of this course is how independent it allows you to be, a weakness is that not all students are lucky enough to have project advisors who support this independence. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great for a freshman who wants to get started in research right away with biology and the sciences. Weaknesses: one semester is a short period of time to conduct research and report on it in a paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: every student was working in a different departments within the Peabody, and so, everyone was able to learn basic information about various topics, while focusing on one department.\r\nWeaknesses: as most class time was spent working on projects, student to student and student to professor (outside of feedback) was limited. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that classroom discussions could be more involving, and maybe more feedback for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Only thing that stands out to me is that the class turns into more of a one-on-one session after the first couple weeks. This may be regarded as a strength for some people, but for others who are expecting a seminar-style class every week, it is not like this. After being paired with a personal mentor, you work with them on your project typically every week (or whenever they are available), usually during class time. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the facts that it's a first-year seminar. This course allows first-years to be fully immersed into the resources here at Yale. The weakness of this course is that the individual projects didn't allow every student to interact with one another as much as a regular seminar would. ",
            "\u00a0The first three weeks of the class involved discussions and readings around the nature of scientific exploration. The discussions were not very fulfilling and the foundation wasn't built upon, rather treated as an initial tangent/introduction before diving into the core of the class, the actual research. I very much enjoyed working with my mentor who was very enthusiastic to teach me about my project. The course lacks much structure, with deadlines ensuring students are doing work, but nearly every person scrambled in the last weeks to make sure everything made sense since the guidelines of the final paper and project were not made clear until a week or days before the due date. ",
            "\u00a0When mentors are not able to meet during class time, we conducted independent work within the classroom with little interaction with each other (students) which was disappointing for a first-year seminar. This course was, however, an excellent insight into research at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Yes and no. If you are curious about the Peabody and plan on doing research there in the future, I highly recommend this course. I feel as though now I am in the \"Peabody Family\" and plan on returning to do research or be a tour guide for my next three years here. If you're not interested in natural history or conducting self-driven research in your first year, I do not recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it helped me decide what direction I wanted to go in major-wise, and helped me get a bunch of connections for the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to others. Especially for students who have an interest in the Peabody Museum, I think this class is great for getting a peek into some of the collections and is a way to indulge that interest in a very engaging and fun manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a unique course. You would not have the chance to experience something like this unless you wanted to make a career of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in a semester-long research project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  I had no idea going into this course exactly what would be involved of me, but needless to say, I came out of the course satisfied and surprised by what I accomplished. Having the whole semester to complete a project (including a paper and presentation) may not seem too daunting at first, and it shouldnt. It is only after completing the scientific process with your mentor, after carrying out all the analyses and procedures, that it becomes apparent how much work is involved in every scientific project. For someone interested in science, definitely take this course. You will find a project that will spark some interest in you. For anyone not interested in science, STILL take this course. I was one of the few people in the class who was not geared towards STEM majors, and yet I took away a great deal from the course that I could not have conceived of originally. \r\n\r\nThe Peabody Museum itself is a fascinating place and to have class near and inside it and its Collections is a huge privilege of this course. I highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fun course to take and is a decent amount of work. It's able to be balanced with other classes well if you manage your time. I'd especially recommend this for those in STEM or even out of STEM because it's an opportunity to have access to Peabody collections and form connections with professors there that you may never get again at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course to explore a new area with little intention of pursuing science as a major or career. This course gives students expertise on a niche area of the school, a piece of the Peabody, with the opportunity to continue research beyond the semester. It doesn't work terrifically as a first-year seminar: students in the class rarely talked to each other until the final weeks, if ever. I would recommend the course to someone interested in scientific research, the Peabody, and prepared to work alone on an unfamiliar subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; for anyone wanting to get involved in research at Yale, this is a nice introduction. "
