            "\u00a0I gained new insight into how even the most quotidian family photo album bears traces of the state and learned new methods for approaching family photography and photography in general that allows me to see through the photographs and beyond the physical document, understanding the process of photo-taking as an event that is predicated on an encounter between people of various power relations. ",
            "\u00a0I now feel confident that I have the theoretical background to critically engage with different types of family photography. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught us not only how to look at a photograph, but how to listen to it, observe it, and read it beyond its borders. We were able to draw connections between complex theories and vernacular family photographs, understanding the nuances behind the album's pages and its function within a family. ",
            "\u00a0The course opened my mined to the dialectics of family albums, of which I never thought before. "

            "\u00a0The strength of this class was in acknowledging family photography - something quotidian and vernacular - as a powerful source of understanding various political and social dynamics. Class discussions were excellent, readings were valuable, and visiting artists and guests really enriched the class. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was in its slight disorganization in terms of projects. We had two final projects, an exhibition and a paper, and neither were particularly well-explained until much later in the semester, leaving a lot of doubts, questions, and an inability to get a head start. \r\n\r\nI also at times felt uncomfortable with the course's emphasis on trauma and the family photograph. It sometimes felt that there was a need to see trauma and secrets in everything, when some family photographs might give insight into political events and social dynamics that are removed from trauma. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all of the guest speakers we had, but at the same time, because there were a number of them, I feel like the class did not have as much time to get to know each other. Each time we had a class discussion it was plentiful, so creating the space to foster more of those conversations would be much appreciated. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student as I believe it offers great insight into an area of study that might otherwise be overlooked. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to students interested in exploring our everyday practices and the hidden motivations behind them "
