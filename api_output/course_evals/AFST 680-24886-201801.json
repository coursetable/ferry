            "\u00a0Strengths: friendly classroom atmosphere, teacher had a good relationship with students, material was clear and easy to understand, I liked that the class took seriously cultural and popular elements often overlooked in other classes, such as music, fashion, food,\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have a liked a little more input from the students as opposed to lecture. The professor did make an effort to encourage this later in the class, based on feedback but I think by that point we'd all got used to the usual set up and it was harder to curb. Would have been great to have seen this input at the start. "

            "\u00a0I would if they wanted to find out more about Nigerian culture but not if they wanted to develop a really strong research paper out of it. I think it's pitched more to early year undergraduates. I really enjoyed learning about Nigeria and for that reason this class is valuable. If someone is only in college for the professional/academics accolades then I'd say this class wasn't for them simply because it's geared towards giving you a broad overview of the country, as opposed to honing in on specific research/philosophical questions. The class atmosphere was great and diversity was really impressive and encouraged. "
