            "\u00a0Tons of knowledge about the ancient world - Judaism (duh), history, classical civilization, Hellenistic culture, Roman Empire. Great class, lots of different time periods. Also never taken class involving Bible before, great introduction. Prof Fraade is great - been teaching the class for 40 years, very nice guy. ",

            "\u00a0Yes - great professor, fair workload, learn a lot but not overwhelming ",
