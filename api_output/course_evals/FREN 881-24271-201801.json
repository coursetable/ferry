            "\u00a0I learned more about Baudelaire himself, an important thinker in nineteenth-century European cultural production. I also improved my ability to read French. Carol's strong facility for associative thinking and visual analysis also helped to hone some of my more particular methodological tools. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was able to read a huge chunk of Baudelaires writings  illuminating the span of his oeuvre and his thought on an array of aesthetic topics. Each week, new figures brought varying perspectives to the material. The transdisciplinary nature of the course was not only exciting, but encouraged new ways of thinking about this material and this era. "

            "\u00a0The breadth of materials coveredespecially the clear ties highlighted between Baudelaire and other nineteenth-century European and American themesmade it an engaging and useful course. It would have been nice to have more opportunities to work specifically and solely with the Baudelaire texts, but then again, there was already little time to cover a lot of material, all of which I'd be loathe to loseso perhaps it's best as it is.

            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's an impressively far-reaching approach to an influential nineteenth-century thinker. A lot of useful material condensed into an impressively short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend the course. The material covered is fascinating and Professor Armstrong is wonderful! "
