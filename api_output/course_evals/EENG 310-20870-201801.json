            "\u00a0Time management (but seriously, there are some heavy assignments due in this course).  I also learned great techniques to analyze systems and understand the basics of how they operate.  I also became fluent in Simulink. ",
            "\u00a0Mathematics behind Signals and Systems, Fourier Transform, Z-transform, Laplace Transform etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Laplace transforms and Z-transforms. I also learned lots about stability theory and analyzing systems. "

            "\u00a0I like how this course was based around a very heavy final project -- it gave us a sense of what senior year will feel like.  Additionally, the psets were very large, but they were (mostly) due every other week, so they were definitely manageable.  We were also learning from a legend himself, which was amazing!!  Narendra had an open-office policy, which was truly amazing to have as an undergrad.  The weaknesses are minor, but some of the content explained in lectures was definitely worth repeating or covering from multiple angles to more fully understand it (I'm specifically thinking of the Nyquist criterion and Root Locus methods, which I still don't fully understand).  Additionally, some of the pset questions were only tangentially related to class content, so I would've liked to see more of a direct translation between lectures and psets. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very theoretical but the professor is great ",
            "\u00a0There can be a more organized TA tutoring/help session ",
            "\u00a0Professor Narendra really cares about his students and he made the class enjoyable. Because he really cares about us learning and our dedication to the class, it allowed me to care less about my grade in the class and to instead enjoy it more which allowed me to learn the material more easily. Yale should really assign a TA to the class however, as the TA's this semester were volunteering as a favor to the professor and had to take time out of their work to help us without payment at all. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!  Especially with Professor Narendra, and definitely because this class is project-based and not exam-based.  He's incredibly accommodating and is willing to devote SO MUCH TIME to his undergrads.  Be warned, though, that this is a small class -- you are under the microscope consistently, and with the IMMENSE amount of time the projects/psets take, it's noticeable if you're struggling or falling behind.  Stay on top of your work -- ESPECIALLY the project. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you have to or you are really interested in signals and systems ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Narendra is extremely supportive and knowledgable, and the content learned in this course can be applied to any field, even though it is regarded as an electrical engineering course. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of the course, it is applicable to not just EE, but data science and finance sometimes use these skills too. But I would recommend any non-EE students, like myself, identify how certain techniques can be applied to your field prior to the course. Also, it is very math intensive, so be advised. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. Because the professor really cares about you learning, you don't have to worry as much about your grade and instead can enjoy what you are learning, leading you to learn even more and have a really cool final project. "
