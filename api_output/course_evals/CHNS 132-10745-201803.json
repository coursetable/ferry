            "\u00a0By taking this course, I had developed more professional Chinese speaking skills and better writing to articulate my thoughts clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Learn more advanced Chinese phrases, improve understanding of characters. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my speaking, writing, listening, and reading abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak Chinese! I am so proud of myself and the friends that I made through this class. I feel more connected with my culture, my parents, and even the waiter at my favorite Chinese restaurant! ",
            "\u00a0Before taking this course, I knew barely any Chinese characters (from elementary school/chinese school). While I still can't read well, I've learned so much material this semester and my language ability has improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Developed much better speaking, reading, and writing skills. Gained a more \"natural\" sense of the Chinese language, and learned a lot of useful everyday vocabularly. ",
            "\u00a0I started off mediocre at speaking and poor at writing, and have developed both skills significantly. Discussions in class helped make my speaking much more understandable and fluent, while assignments have helped me learn a significant amount of Chinese characters. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese has definitely improved after taking this course as well as my comfort in taking risks in class. The small class size pushed me to speak up and offer my thoughts even if my pronunciation wasn't as proficient as others', which I really appreciated. The conversations we had in class were interesting as well as the mini-lessons about the background of Chinese. Sometimes, Liu Laoshi would give us a little bit of insight as to why a certain character was written a certain way and it fascinated me. This class has made me appreciate my culture so much more and has made me realize my passion for Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Better chinese! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT of useful (not obscure) characters and grammar structures! Also, I felt like we had just the right amount of culture discussion and integration into our class time. "

            "\u00a0The course is well structured but sometimes it can be dry. Including Chinese popular songs or shows in the class will help maintain students' interest of Chinese and move the course of Chinese learning along. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- engaging class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- moves a little fast after half-way point of semester ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the professor, the text, the classmates, the discussions\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes there was too much homework ",
            "\u00a0Liu Laoshi is definitely a huge strength in this course for me. Although in general, she really did not do very much \"teaching\", she was fantastic at facilitating conversation and keeping us on track through the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very organized which I appreciated a lot. There's a schedule of assignments (due every day), essays, and tests, so everything is planned out in advance. Homework was consistently around 1/2-1 hour every day. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. I think the pace was a little fast at times but Prof Liu did a great job of adjusting the class to make us feel comfortable with the pace. ",
            "\u00a0The class does a good job of training important skills. Essays must be hand written to help our writing skills which is very useful. Class discussions are always engaging and helps you feel more comfortable with the language. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was the small class size. It made the class much more engaging and allowed everyone to speak up more easily, especially me. The constant class discussions were interesting and they pushed everyone to speak, which is crucial to learning a language. Another strength was the  essay writing because it pushed me to utilize everything that I was learning in class.\r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved is if the teacher writes characters on the board that might be unfamiliar to us and not just verbally tell us what the translation is. It would help us learn more words and actually see how they are written. Another improvement would be having more time to go over our tests in order to see our errors. ",
            "\u00a0It is AMAZING. Liu laoshi is so funny, compassionate, awesome, good teaching, really fantastic. Makes learning a language so much fun. Maybe sometimes could encourage more student discussion rather than repetition? But I see the importance of repetition too, ah really the course is pretty perfect ",
            "\u00a0The textbook could be updated for suresome of it is outdated. I also wish we had more time in class to discuss and practice our speaking skills, rather than only having back-and-forth with the teacher. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, Chinese 132, especially when taught by Liu Laoshi is the best! Would recommend and should take if given time. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended if you're interested in improving basic Chinese language ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, because the professor is amazing and you improve a lot. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing course if you want to fulfill a language requirement and connect with your Chinese-ness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is great for any heritage learners whose language abilities are lacking in some way. There's a mix of language ability coming in but the course is able to accommodate students of all levels. Liu Laoshi is an amazing instructor as well - she's very understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. Your handle on Chinese will get exponentially better throughout the semester - my parents were shocked when I spoke Chinese for the first time when I got home at the end of the semester. The workload of this class is high (daily quizzes and homework), but I would say it's very manageable if you have any kind of experience with Chinese classes (the material will come back to you quickly). Don't let reviews about the high workload deter you! It's very manageable and you'll learn an incredible amount. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it a lot. It is very enjoyable, but still very informative at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It has helped me improve my Chinese skills significantly and has given me a greater appreciation for Chinese. If a student is willing to put in a little bit more effort than usual, they will get so much out of this course. And Liu Laoshi is such an understanding, funny, caring, and hardworking professor it's hard to hate this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! All teachers who teach it are phenomenal, youll learn a lot, it will not be too stressful and its really not much work. Like compared to say the bio sequence its less work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great way to build reading and writing fundamentals (which I sorely needed!). "
