            "\u00a0I gained some new understandings of world religions that I had not been previously too familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics about religions: Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. ",
            "\u00a0This class has changed my life. I learned a very comprehensive overview of the four main world religions. Please take this course if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Brief overview of major world religions. I learned the fundamental theology and early history of Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, and Christianity. We also briefly learned about Judaism and Zoroastrianism. I wanted to take this class in order to understand more about the world and myself. I was hoping to take away something I can apply to better my understanding of what I want to value in my life and how I should live my life. I believe that through this class, I did gain not only insights to help me better understand myself, but knowledge that allow me to understand other cultures in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a broad view of many of the major religions, including Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism. ",
            "\u00a0This course seriously opened my eyes to the diversity of religions in the world as a reflection of culture and ways of thinking. I am very grateful to have taken it my senior Spring, before I embark on my own adventure into the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about major world religions. "

            "\u00a0This course has some interesting subject matter at times and presents a lot of information. It does however seem to just rush through topics without truly \"teaching\" them. I feel as though some more structure to the course could help. There was a lot of very specific information that asked about on tests that was only briefly mentioned in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that he tells very informative notes that guarantees anyone to understand the material. He doesnt make it too hard to understand for beginners, so I found it very enlightening and stress free. He also did office hours on his own after class just so we could ask any questions or to show us movies to reinforce concepts. The work was not aggressive, but you do have to study for exams. However, the exams are not terribly tough and really just require you to know the fundamental concepts and vocabulary. If youre looking for a nonstressful humanity credit or just want to learn about religion, I highly recommend this class. The only weakness is that he doesnt write any notes on a board, but it stopped being a problem after a few classes. ",
            "\u00a0Very systematic and well-thought out and comprehensive lectures. Individualized attention. Extremely knowledgeable professor. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the professor's priority of teaching the course in a way conducive to learning. Bowering holds reasonable expectations and makes sure he emphasizes the main ideas he believes is important to understanding the religions, especially in today's politically and culturally hyper-connected globe. However, this class will be a dull one if you are not genuinely interested in learning about religions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures could have been a bit more interesting, and not just based on Professor Bowering lecturing at the class. However, it was also very informative, and we were able to fit a lot of information into one class. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the small class size as it led to a more intimate relationship with the professor. Section meetings with the professor were definitely a highlight, and I would advise not having TAs if possible. ",
            "\u00a0It would've been helpful to have visual aids during lecture, rather than just listening to the professor talk for an hour. "

            "\u00a0I probably wouldn't recommend this course to another student unless they are extremely passionate about the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The class was so well taught that I didnt have trouble keeping up. Hed set up times to answer any questions we had. There was a very minimal workload since he gives all the information in class, which helps make the reading easier. He also gives a vocab sheet for the exam and goes over all the information that will be on the exams. Its a very good class, even if it seems a little slow. ",
            "\u00a0YES, a thousand times over. Knowledge that everyone should have in their lives, taught by a wonderful professor. Only downside is final paper & final presentation, although I learned so much from writing my paper. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a interesting Humanities gut, this course is for you. There are only 2 exams and 1 term paper. However, if you are not genuinely interested in learning about world religions, this class will be extremely dull. I highly respect and recommend professor Bowering and I believe that this class can help you understand more about yourself and the world. As a wandering college student, this course has allowed me to gain the understanding of the purpose of religion, why it's so popular, and the meaning of faith. I certaintly have applied my understanding of the basic theology of different religions into parts of how I want to live my life. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great class for anyone who wants to gain a broad view of the major religions. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think it is necessary for undergraduates to understand the religious history of the world as future global citizens. "
