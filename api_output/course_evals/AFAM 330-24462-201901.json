            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the most effective and ethical ways to write trauma.  My writing improved as did my understanding of trauma in the media. ",
            "\u00a0In all honesty, nothing I hadnt learned and developed in other  better  Yale college writing classes. The readings were good and had a therapeutic qualities but the course material itself failed to strongly develop my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was unlike any writing course I've taken at Yale. Writing about trauma is something I've thought about for a whilehow to do it ethically, with nuance, to build characters with complexity. I developed ways to think about writing trauma in this course through the novels and memoirs we read and our discussions in class of each other's work. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this was the best writing workshop I have ever taken. I feel like it was so good I can't even point out specific things I learned since I grew in so many directions. I feel like I am just such a better writer now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class. Our discussions about trauma never felt repetitive. Our readings were phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about myself as a writer and someone who engages with craft. I learned more about creative writing, how I can show more than tell in my writing, and how to think about writing trauma in respectful ways. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were excellent reading material, interesting assignments, a wonderful TA, and a brilliant professor who provided very useful feedback in workshop. However, I felt that having the professor skype in for half the lessons was not the most effective way to learn.  While I am grateful I was able to take a class with Dr. Gay and I understand that she is busy it would have been wonderful to have more in-person classes.  We also did not receive written feedback for most of our work which was disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the assigned reading. Always insightful and interesting. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses. Having the teacher with whom every student signed up to take the class, most of us being huge fans of Dr. gays, only come to class every two weeks was really disappointing and stunted the rhythm and general learning of the classroom. \r\n\r\nI received almost no feedback. When I did, it was not timely. The best and most comments I got were from fellow students during in-class workshopping, and insight from our TA. Dr. Gay didnt even send me feedback on two out of my three essays, despite the fact that our final grade was dependent on revisions of said essays. \r\n\r\nDr. Gay was passive aggressive and left a lot of students feeling uncertain after she sent out some tweets admonishing us for requesting excused absences (two of which are fully allowed, as said in the syllabus) while failing to respond to and approve said absences. Knowing your teacher might tweet about you instead of just talking to you was super uncomfortable. \r\n\r\nThe syllabus was totally unclear about due dates, and when multiple emails were sent to Dr. Gay asking to know what things were do and when, I received no response. Instead, two weeks later, she made fun of us in class for wanting to know when our assignments were due. I cannot imagine another teacher and certainly not a student getting away with that kind of flippant attitude towards due dates and coursework. \r\n\r\nOverall, this course was such a profound letdown. It was poorly organized, failed to deliver on what it had promised, and left students feeling disappointed, frustrated, and attacked. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how open our discussions felt in class. I think we were really able to build a community in the class through reading and commenting on each other's work. Our course reading list included diverse voices and authors and I really grew as a writer from reading all the books for the course. Sometimes, I wish we discussed more the difficulty of commenting on each other's work and hearing about the trauma they experienced. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, the only downside was that Roxane wasn't able to be there every time, but that wasn't anybody's fault. And Cera did a fantastic job when she wasn't there! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic syllabus, great discussion \r\nWeaknesses: 3 hours was definitely too long for a seminar and I wish Professor Gay was present at every class. The class was also way too big so workshopping everyone's essays was tough and sometimes felt insufficient. \r\n\r\n(I don't see anywhere that I can evaluate Cera but WOW SHE IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST AND SAVING GRACE OF THIS CLASS FEEDBACK WISE)I T ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dedicated TA, very understanding professor, super comfortable and respectful class environment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes expected assignments were not said ahead of time, readings were disorganized, and feedback came back pretty late. ",
            "\u00a0we read some great books! roxane and cera were wonderful in their own ways! it was really emotionally difficult to do so much reading and writing about trauma and to have that demand on all of us to produce that kind of content. also there was a lot of work and roxane only gave us comments on 1/3 essays "

            "\u00a0I am glad I took this course. This course is a lot of work, but if you engage with it fully you will learn a lot about trauma writing and your own writing will improve.  It is also very exciting to be able to take a class with a genius like Dr. Gay. Her feedback during workshop was very insightful and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Not only was it a disheartening experience to have such a poor class experience with a teacher that Id otherwise worshipped, but the workload and material was burdensome. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student! It's such a privilege to be able to study with Professor Gay and to learn from her. She has some really amazing and valuable insights not just about writing trauma but about the writing and publishing world in general. I think that a student should be aware that this class does demand a lot not just intellectually, but also emotionally, so if this is not a commitment one is willing or able to take, it might not be the best course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like you don't even need my recommendation to want to take a course with Roxane Gay ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. A chance to work with Professor Gay is one you can't pass up. The readings are great and assignemnts are fun and don't feel like busy work. But if you are looking for heavy handed guidance on your creative writing, this isn't it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because I think what I enjoyed most were the people in my class. I loved having the chance to expose myself and learn from one another. "
