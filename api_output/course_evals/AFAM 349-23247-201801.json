            "\u00a0I have a better understanding of the nuances of the black womens liberation movement and have felt like this class is a really great learning experience! ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the truths of the Civil Rights Movement as well as a deeper understanding of the relationship between the Civil Rights Movement and the Womens movement. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely made me re-evaluate the past courses I have taken on the topics of the civil rights movement and the women's liberation movement. The readings and class discussions forced me to think more critically about the two movements and the ways in which they were deeply intertwined. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about historical methodologies and greater critical and analytical skills. I also developed greater insight about the intersections between two major social movements of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great kind of revisionist survey of the long civil rights movement to the present.  Civil rights through a feminist lens was truly mind-expanding. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think more books and fewer individual chapters would be useful in the reading! ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0This was easily my favorite class I have taken at Yale thus far. Professor Meyer assigned the most engaging texts. Every single week the readings expanded my mind on whichever topic we were reading. Beyond learning about historical narratives, she pushed us to think about feminism in our own worlds. Our paper assignments on feminism at Yale allowed us to have a more hands-on take with the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized and bring together important material from and about the time period. It has a strong history focus but also includes multidisciplinary perspectives as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to see more primary sources, or a diversity of secondary sources.  I like comparing historical methodologies/how tings are remembered.  I think there would be a different angle/more lenses/levels to the discussion if we had different perspectives some weeks. "

            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I think if someone is looking for a course that centers around women and discusses movements in a gendered way, this is a great class. Things are examined through the lens of race, class, and gender and force you to think about the pros and cons of everything discussed as well the reliability of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Meyer and the students in the class are incredible. This course completely changed my entire Yale experience and has made me want to take more classes similar to it. I would retake this class over and over again! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the material is interesting and while there is a heavy reading load, the conversations and assignments really help you sharpen your perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend LTM as a professor to anyone.  She is so passionate and cares so much and has a lot of knowledge about her field.  However, I would recommend making the sources on the syllabus more diverse/pushing the discussion away from personal experience to make it more academic or different from normal conversation. "
