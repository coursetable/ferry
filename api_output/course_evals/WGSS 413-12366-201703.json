            "\u00a0I think the weakness of this course was trying to cover too much material. Which perhaps is also its strength. We often didn't have time to cover everything we read in class, but perhaps that is better than being exposed to less theory/work. "

            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course. I am a better artist because of it. I am also a better person. Feminist theory is tricky/impossible to grasp when reading alone. There are many, many different strands of feminism in conversation with each other. This course made me more articulate about what feminism is, what it does, and where it comes from - in art and in life. Professor Morrison is also thoughtful and cares deeply about the material. ",
            "\u00a0This is an awesome seminar, the material is good to learn and Professor Morrison is great at facilitating discussion and helping us to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend.\r\n\r\nProfessor Morrison is top-notch; thoughtful, engaging, flexible, and intelligent. \r\n\r\nNo matter what your field of study, you will probably walk away from this course with meaningful new perspectives on a multitude of topics. "
