            "\u00a0By taking this course, I have better learned how to communicate my ideas in Spanish as well as comprehend the ideas that my professor and classmates communicate to me in Spanish. My Spanish vocabulary has been enriched with new words and phrases; consequently, my writing skills have also improved. ",

            "\u00a0This class goes extremely fast and the professors take a while to get used to with their accents and how fast they speak.  Although I came in understanding a fair amount of spanish, it was definitely a large leap forward with how fast I had to catch on. ",
            "\u00a0Overall good class can't really complain. Maybe we could have done a little more presentations because those were definitely the most challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I think a particular strength is that the entire course was talk in Spanish at all times. I thought that the curriculum was particularly fast in the middle of the semester and wonder if there is a way to even that out a bit. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very successful in its intent of being an immersion environment for students. As a result, it really helped with listening comprehension. Additionally, the course was very successful with going over the grammar learned in previous years of study without spending too much time on the information so that students could feel confident in their base. I found the course to be well organized and cannot think of any major improvements that are needed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the incorporation of short films and daily homework that serves as constant practice of the language. However, I feel as though there should have been more time dedicated to speaking among me and my peers so I could strengthen my casual conversation skills even more. ",

            "\u00a0This is a great course talk really well. It is challenging but also really interesting. Everyone was really engaged in class. This class was so good that I don't have any real ideas on how to make it better except to maybe grade a little more leniently. "

However, one must always dedicate some time to the assignments for the course because while they are not super intellectually challenging, they do require some time on the part of the student. ",
