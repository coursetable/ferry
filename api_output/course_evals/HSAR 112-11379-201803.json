            "\u00a0Art historical build-up that influences each other as the history goes on. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a great deal of art and taught to formal vocabulary needed to describe it. I think I gained a great understanding of how visual methods are used to convey meaning to different audiences. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about Gothic architecture especially, but essentially the history of art through the medieval times. Something I knew essentially nothing about and feel like I came out a more well rounded member of society. Learning how to do formal analysis was cool too since now I feel as if I can look at art even from contexts outside the ones we studied and formulate a few intelligent thoughts about it. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting material. Well-lectured by Professor Jung. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to look at an artwork more deeply, analyzing details such as the object's medium and motifs within its historical context. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a huge amount about art and what it says about the culture in which it is produced, across a huge time frame. This depth and breadth allowed me to appreciate the relevance of art in cultural contexts and also the themes and trajectories spanning millenia that art has followed ",
            "\u00a0From this course I received a good overview of art history from prehistory to the Renaissance, primarily in terms of the content. Some familiarity with major works and monuments in art over such a broad period of time will be useful for my further studies in art history. The course also acquainted me with important art historical methods, such as formal analysis and the relationship between art works and society. ",
            "\u00a0Feel so much more confident describing/writing work of art and deconstructing their visual elements. Super broad survey from 43,000 BCE to 1300, so I also learned a lot of history along the way. ",
            "\u00a0As a senior HSAR major, I had already developed a lot of the visual analysis skills emphasized in this course, but it was good practice to return to the basics and continue to improve. Additionally, having taken mostly more time- or location-specific art history courses beforehand, I really gained knowledge of the broader scope of the history of (mostly) Western art. I also appreciated that the course included a good amount of historical context and thus obtained greater insight into both themes of particular periods as well as themes across time. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class will stay with me for the rest of my life because I will never look at a museum the same way again. I now what to look for in many ancient arts - what should draw my attention, what might be of significance. I really learned to have a deeper appreciation of art in its many forms. ",
            "\u00a0History of the western canon of art from ancient times up until the early Renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about art, history, and visual analysis in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a really large time period from prehistory all the the way to the renaissance. We looked at many mediums including sculpture, painting, architecture and relics. ",
            "\u00a0We covered the most important parts of Art History up until the renaissance. We learned to analyse art works and connect them to the different time periods. We also learned how to thoroughly describe the intricate details of works of art. ",
            "\u00a0This class made me into a better human being. I learned about the world of art, a non-insignificant part of the world in which we live. I could not recommend this course highly enough. You're making a mistake if you're looking at this evaluation right now and not adding it to your worksheet. "

            "\u00a0I think that Prof. Jung is a great and engaging lecturer. I think she set really clear expectations for what needed to be known for the exams, and the TAs were great about helping with papers. Overall I think this class was one of the best I had this semester in making expectations clear and helping me to meet them. \r\n\r\nOne thing I didn't like about this course was that each lecture was rushed. Some pieces were barely spoken about due to time constraints. I felt that having images broken up into sets by themes was really useful, but often some pieces weren't spoken about and so the efficacy of having them divided by themes was sometimes lessened. In general I didn't really understand why the lecture always had to be so rushed when it was only 50 minutes--extending it to an hour would have easily addressed the lack of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Jung is a phenomenal teacher, TAs are all pretty good it seemed. The material can seem like it's all the same, but it's really not, and Prof Jung did a great job at helping me understand that medieval art is more than just pictures of Mary holding Jesus, Greek and Roman art are very different etc.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Time management could sometimes be poor - Prof. Jung would often run out of time to finish the slide list, and then run a few minutes. Normally, this is fine, but because the class ended at 2:20, and many classes at Yale start in the 2:30 block and Loria is kind of away from the center of campus. Because of this, it was always stressful knowing I'd either be late to my next class or have to miss some of Prof Jung's awesome teaching (it's really great) ",
            "\u00a0This class was really enjoyable, and the lectures were a treat! Professor Jung did an amazing job in conducting the flow of this course and tying the different artworks together. I also loved listening to her analyses of the artworks - the lights were always dimmed so it was almost like a performance. It was also nice that she read our essays and that she and the teaching fellows graded our tests as a team, solving the issue of different grading styles among TFs that pops up in other humanities courses.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the course would be the accessibility of the images she used in class as I ended up never able to get access to the .prs files that Professor Jung posted. I also had some trouble spelling some of the terms used in class, so the slightest bit of textual aids would've been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the class itself is engaging and memorable. Weaknesses are that the paper assignments can be worded misleadingly. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Professor Jung's lecture style, as it was very engaging. I also enjoyed the teaching methods used during the TA sections. During sections, my peers and I were usually put into smaller groups and asked to make educated observations about works in the YUAG--observations we would later share with the larger group. However, I struggled with the exam format. Although I know that memorization is necessary for an introductory Art History class, I wish that we had been told more specifically what we should study. For both the midterm and the final, I memorized details for about 140 objects (each, not altogether), only to be tested on about 10 works per exam. While I understand how important memorization is, I would have appreciated being able to study the themes, motifs, and respective contexts of the works more, instead of being consumed with simply memorizing dates. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a huge number of works, which gives a complete picture of art at the time and across many time periods. However, the number of works covered (400+) made a great part of the course a matter of memorisation, but I recognise that this the nature of the subject of art history ",
            "\u00a0It covers a broad span of time in just the right amount of detail, I think. I also enjoyed the opportunity to use objects in the Art Gallery. The pace and volume of readings is good. ",
            "\u00a0I think a review session, at least for the first part of the course, would be very helpful. The midterm tests so, so much content, so a bit more guidance would have been appreciated. I wish the readings/syllabus were more creative? Perhaps using a textbook is standard for art history classes, but usually my professors bring in diverse sources...As far as this course's strengths, it was an absolute joy being in the gallery every week, dissecting ancient art up close and in person. The essay prompts were also interesting, though I wish we could use outside materials (especially for the essay about church architecture). Professor Jung is a great orator, but sometimes moves through the material very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think the course is very strong and there's very little I would change about it. My only suggestion for improvement would be to minimize the level of memorization necessary for the exams. As a HSAR major, I have never had to memorize information for as many objects as in this class, which is very time-consuming and I think ultimately not that effective for student learning (as I know most students quickly forget most of what they memorized for the exams). I would recommend instead picking a certain number of highlights from the objects covered in class to require for memorization to create a more balanced approach to exam studying and student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the structure of the class was one of the main strengths. Having a shorter lecture period, 50 minutes, and a follow up section, normally in the YUAG, was perfect for understanding the material as you were not bombarded by overwhelming amounts of information in a long time span. I could keep my focus very well during the classes - something that I can not say for my other classes. Additionally, I believe that Professor Jung was one of the best professors I have encountered at Yale. She cared so deeply about the material that you couldn't help but also find the material fascinating. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that I think should be improved is how the midterm/final are conducted. Having to memorize 160 works of art for the midterm and an additional 140 works for the final was very daunting - especially because a lot of your grade depended on these exams. Only 10 works would appear on the midterm and another 10 on the final. I almost wish like there was more opportunity to show how much I memorized. Perhaps a quick ID section or a multiple choice section would help? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Jung is an excellent and eloquent speaker-- I loved all of her lectures and she did a wonderful job explaining through the pieces of art. The sections make a great use of the encyclopedic collections of the Art Gallery; if you are interested in learning about a diverse range of art, it is the best to do it at Yale! Weaknesses: kind of a time commitment and the tests are almost purely memorization, which is not the most fun but a good way to make sure you know the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are relatively entertaining and my TA was great. I also received great feedback throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: A LOT of information was covered so I am definitely much more informed about early art. I think it will provide as a good base for other art history classes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: BEWARE this class is not as easy as you may think. It requires you to memories way more than other art history classes I have taken. The information presented in class was not that easy to follow at times, which made revision quite daunting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very strong intro course. A weakness of the course was that sometimes we covered so many works in class that it was difficult to truly spend a lot of time focusing on one piece, as there were so many others. However, it was an intro course so it is to be expected that we wouldn't go into a lot of detail. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the material of the course, but found the actual work to be extremely overwhelming. Professor Jung is a talented lecturer and I enjoyed her teaching immensely. That being said, the amount of information that we had to memorize was far higher than any other art history survey course that I have taken (most specifically it's companion course - HSAR 115). There were simply too many pieces for me to understand at the level to which I was expected. "

            "\u00a0Highly. ",
            "\u00a0I would but I would say they should be sure that this is the period of time they are interested in. I think it's a good class if you're interested in the subject/ ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good intro to art history ",
            "\u00a0Yes I'd definitely recommend it. It might seem dull compared to more modern art, but ancient and medieval art really has so much going on beneath the surface that I finally understand because of this course. It tied in super well with my knowledge of history and the course really hits its stride during the units on Greece, Rome and Byzantine art, when I was genuinely excited to take the 15 minute walk to Loria every time.\r\n\r\nWorkload: Not too bad, a couple papers a midterm and a final. A lot of people don't go to class, so if you actually regularly attend lecture and send your TAs a draft/outline of your paper before submitting (which they all let you do) it's a pretty straightforward A for relatively little week-to-week effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Happy to have a working knowledge of these chapters of art history. ",
            "\u00a0Although I would mention how memorization-heavy the course is, I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it helped change the way I analyze and value historical art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it's an excellent overview of art spanning millenia and gives a full picture of the development of art and also culture ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who desires a foundation in art history. I think it will serve as good preparation for any study in art history from prehistory to the Renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0Paired with the second part of the survey, absolutely. You'll learn so much about art and will come to know the gallery very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. Prof. Jung is very knowledgeable and passionate and her lectures are well-organized, interesting and insightful. You will really learn a lot about art across a great expanse of time and location. The workload is not bad, but the memorization for the exams is a bit painful (and ultimately pretty useless), so be prepared to spend some time on that. Otherwise, the class is really great and a good way to learn or practice visual analysis. Also, if you can, join Sarah's section! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that all students should at some point take an art history class and this class was an exceptional way to delve into the material. This was my favorite class of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!!! This course made me add HSAR as a major. ",
            "\u00a0This course will provide a good base going forward, however I probably would not recommend it. There was a lot of information to cover, and it was hard to follow in class sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! I would recommend this course to any other student who does not know a lot about art history, but wants to get a first glance into the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class if you don't know anything about art. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course Credit/D but not for a grade. While the material is interesting, the sheer amount of memorization is absurd. "
