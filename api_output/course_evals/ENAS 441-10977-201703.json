            "\u00a0This course teaches various methods for solving ODEs and PDEs. The organization of the class was clear and logical, and the knowledge builds on itself throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to numerically solve a wide range of differential equations. ",
            "\u00a0The title of the course says it all: numerical methods: a lot of logic and Matlab. I don't think anyone in the planet could come close to teaching this material as well as Professor Bennett can. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a very solid understanding of a number of numerical methods in this class. Not only did I learn how to do them; I also learned the logic behind them, the limitations and computational costs of their use, and other inherent properties of the method that were both interesting and useful to know! I feel I've gained an invaluable set of skills in taking this class that I'm sure I will use in grad school and a future research career. I also became stronger in MatLab through this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to derive, implement and analyze numerical methods to solve differential equations.  I also fortified my math and programming skills especially in MATLAB. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me methods to approximate differential equations numerically and importantly to program those methods efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a variety of numerical methods for ordinary and partial differential equations, and you learn how they work, how to implement them yourself, about the associated errors and the computational cost. You get a thorough education by an absolutely incredible and dedicated professor. "

            "\u00a0Honestly, this course was so great I am having a struggle finding something wrong. Maybe make the problem sets less time consuming? ",
            "\u00a0Can't think of any weaknesses! The handouts were very helpful and I really liked the balance of programming and theory problems on the homework. ",
            "\u00a0This is a tough course, and it's very high paced. I don't care how smart you are, you can't miss a lecture without talking to people/going to office hours afterwards. That being said, it was really well organized and was extremely rewarding. I wouldn't change anything ",
            "\u00a0Beth takes a TON of information and transmits it clearly, quickly, and effectively. She is the class's greatest strength - I don't think I could at all care about the course material if she wasn't the one teaching it. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the class is that it's material is just not thrilling. ",
            "\u00a0This is a tough course. Lots and lots of hours spent on it this semester, but an incredible experience. Nothing can be improved. This course is near-perfect. Well-organized, detailed, consistent, incredibly tough but also rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well thought out and expectations are clear but grading can be harsh at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Bennett has this course down-pat. It is well-organized, her lectures are exceptionally clear, and every single homework assignment was relevant - not just busy work - and significantly contributed to my understanding of the material (almost as much as her lectures did!). Prof. Bennett is exceptionally kind and approachable, and I feel she cares about our learning more than any other professor I've had at Yale. Other strengths of the course include: a very nice balance of both breadth between different methods as well as depth in each one, plenty of office hours, a high weight on homework (which is always good in a difficult class - your hard work and hours put in really can make a difference in your grade), and having handouts instead of a textbook (they are clear, well-written, complement the lectures very well, and eliminate the drudgery of trying to determine the relevant topics of a textbook, and translate them from the author's understanding to what the professor wants you to understand). Weaknesses: I really can't think of any! There's a lot of work, but that's not necessarily a weakness. I suppose the TAs could have been more helpful - for example, Prof. Bennett was very good about letting you know if you were heading in the wrong direction and was also very good about helping you reach the correct conclusion on something through your own thinking, but I felt that the TAs were often unnecessarily suspicious or hesitant in giving out such help. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the teaching and structure of the course.  Dr. Bennett is a fantastic professor and she is very organized and methodical in how she approaches the class.  The weakness is the grading standards and expectations.  The TAs were very subjective in the grading of assignments which made understanding mistakes difficult. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale. The lectures were organized. The problem sets were doable based on the lectures, and the exams were fair. You always got clear feedback on your work. It was a difficult class, but I've learnt more in this class than almost any other class I've taken at Yale. "

            "\u00a0YES! Beth Anne Bennet is the best STEM Professor at Yale! The material is a little bit of a drag but Beth Anne Bennet makes it all worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Homework is reasonable, usually half programming and half pen and paper problems, with a lot of emphasis on computational cost and efficiency. Professor Bennett is an extremely clear lecturer and is very helpful in office hours. Rather than using a textbook she gave us daily handouts on the material which made it easy to know what was important to study. Exams are very fair. The material is useful across all scientific disciplines and you will walk away with a ton of new knowledge and programming skills - take it if you can! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if it's taught by Dr Bennett. She's the best teacher I've had at yale, engineering or not. The course is tough, but the psets really make you feel god once you've finished them. Absolutely take it, but only if Dr Bennett is teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Take any class with Beth that's offered - as an elective, for fun, etc. It's worth it. You'll learn a lot of material that you might not care that much about, but she's so orderly and helpful and caring that you are motivated to do well. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very time consuming class, but is well taught and organized.  You learn and get familiar with a lot of material- it's pretty interesting, and has value to a diversity of majors.  Dr. Bennett really cares about the students, and really is the greatest.  Again though, this class is a lot of work! ",
            "\u00a0If you're wondering if you should take this course but are conflicted between the near-perfect reviews and the fact that you hate every word on the course title, I can see where you're coming from. The explanation for this is Professor Bennett. I am confident no one in the world could teach you this material as well as Professor Bennett can. The course is incredibly tough. There is a ton of material to cover and it can get confusing. Also, the problem sets are intense, so be ready to start working on them pretty much the day they come out and still pull an all nighter the day before they're due. Having said that, this is the most rewarding class I've taken at Yale. Professor Bennett is extremely organized, has an engaging lecture that is easy to follow, and communicates information better than anyone I've ever seen. It's one of those classes that can be brutal when you're in it but you will feel extremely accomplished every week and when you finish the course. I would recommend this to anyone who has been ambivalent about many classes they've taken and wants a seriously tough but awesome class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this course it's likely because you need to for your major. This is a fine choice for this purpose. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course highly enough. If you have any interest in the material (it will be very helpful for research - senior thesis, grad school, or an academic career - or computing careers), you should definitely take it. Prof. Bennett is a rare gem that in the clown-show that is teaching STEM at Yale, and she is hands-down the best professor I've ever had - in her lecturing, her passion for the material, and her demeanor and relationship with her students. It would be a shame to miss out on her crystal-clear, fun, and engaging teaching. Her class offers both a wide breadth of different numerical methods as well as depth within each one. You will not simply learn how to use these methods, you will gain an inherent understanding of their inner workings, applications, and limitations that will leave you with a deeper understanding of how and when to use these methods. The workload is in upper percentile of Yale STEM classes (comparable to ENAS194, ENAS151) but the work is exceptionally more enjoyable and relevant - I actually learned the material all that much better from the psets whereas psets in other STEM classes have been tedious if not painful and so miserably convoluted that they contributed nothing to my understanding of the material. Take this class - given how poorly STEM classes are usually taught at Yale, you cannot pass up an opportunity to learn such a useful and marketable skill from such an amazing teacher! ",
            "\u00a0Outside of the grading, this is a fantastic course.  As a senior taking this class for a mechanical engineering elective, this was the second hardest class I have ever taken.  But it is a great class, it teaches you a lot of useful material and helps you reinforce math and programming skills.  Beware though, the material is hard, it is a lot of work (I pulled all nighters twice to finish problem sets) and the grading is harsh.  However, Professor Bennett is an amazing professor, she literally sat down with me and helped me through every problem set.  So if Beth is teaching this class, take it, you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course unless you have to take it or you're very good at understanding complex math. It's a good class, but it's a lot of work no matter how well you understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was an incredible class. I would recommend balancing your schedule with at least one easier class because it does take a lot of time. However, I think it is completely worth all of the work. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are a lot of work, but this was the best course I have taken at Yale and Professor Bennett is the best professor I have ever seen. It was an incredible opportunity. "
