            "\u00a0Stata was by far the most valuable part of this course. Statistical coding is difficult, but Lloyd helps us develop that throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course starts with a quick overview of calc 1, which is extremely helpful if you haven't taken any higher-level math since high school. Professor Grieger was fantastic at always explaining the theoretical concepts behind what we learned, which help when we got into the \"stats\" portion of the class. I gained a working understanding of how to use Stata, and am comfortable with it after never having used a similar program. I also learned some basic statistical writing through our psets and final project, even though we weren't necessarily graded on this. ",
            "\u00a0Reviewed calculus and algebra, and learned how to use STATA to a certain extent--summaries, tabulations, bivariate and multivariate regressions, including with controls and interactions. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a basic survey of calculus and very basic statistical concepts, as well as how to do quantitative analysis of data sets using Stata. We learned calculus up to partial derivatives and statistics up until significance tests/confidence intervals, and worked with data sets like the PSID, NIDS, and GSS. The basic Stata commands are very useful and I can apply them to future projects. Also learned how data translates from numbers and calculations into interpretations. ",

            "\u00a0I was able to find out how Calculus and Statistics can be applied to gauge social behavior, I learned how to conduct statistical analysis from scratch using Stata (by far one of the most useful programs I have learned how to use), and I learned how to better interpret and communicate statistical figures to others as opposed to simply regurgitating the numbers that the program calculates. ",

            "\u00a0I gained knowledge on introductory calculus and multivariate calculus, how to think about studying populations, and how to run basic regressions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained various skills from this course.  In particular, the opportunity to expand my understanding of how to interpret statistics and where statistics are coming from.  Not only did it afford me the opportunity to examine statistical relationships in which I am interested through the sociological nature of the course, but also to think deeply about where and how statistical data are coming from.  In addition to this, I gained an understanding of how to use Stata to interpret and answer these questions, and build my skills in calculus so that it was easier to interpret data. ",

However, as Prof. Grieger pointed out, it is not a course in research design or theory. Those need to be learned in other courses. "

            "\u00a0I really appreciated this course in allowing me to engage with quantitative material in a manageable way. This class was challenging and the work was grueling at times, but paid off. ",
            "\u00a0It is overall a very strong course. The time spent at the begginng of the course on basic calculous was helpful and necessary, but I wish we had one more week to go over the end material (multivariate analysis and interactions). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very step-by-step building up to using STATA. Lloyd is an engaging professor who really makes sure you understand how STATA is used in real life to analyze sociological problems. \r\nWeaknesses: I feel like the math fundamentals portion of the class could have been condensed and had less drilling. I would have liked to learn more with STATA--perhaps that part could even just be made a prerequisite for the class, so the entire class would be STATA focused. ",
            "\u00a0This course is organized in a way that makes it easy to follow, and then apply the knowledge from class directly through weekly psets. There are lots of opportunities to get help and to talk with the professor/TAs. The final project gives you a lot of options to do something you feel comfortable with but also demonstrate your knowledge and competence with the material. I thought at some points, especially having taken AP Calculus, that class went a little slowly, but I appreciate that we built a strong foundation before going into more foreign material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: content was very accessible and taught well so you could understand easily. Lloyd is an engaging, funny, and cool prof. Final project was pretty interesting. The data sets we used were real and recent, so that made the data analytics fun and interesting because you learned cool things about Americans' attitudes and opinions, and other current data and stats. The course was also super well organized. Lloyd posted class notes which were great to follow along with and to review with. There was also an abundance of office hours. Oh, and section is optional! Huge buzz.\r\nWeaknesses: spent about half of the course doing a review of pre-calc and calculus. Some of it was a little much. For instance, on the first day, we went over how to graph straight lines (y=mx+b). Some of the review of multivariate calc and partial derivatives was helpful, but the rest of the review was unnecessary. Perhaps he reviewed so much because this is also a grad sociology course. The course could be improved by cutting the first two weeks of calc review and spending more time on the actual stats and data analytics portion at the end, since that portion felt really rushed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was by far the most well structured QR I have taken at Yale. The professor, the TAs and the course material all help to facilitate student learning. There is a lot of support for the Psets and there is opportunity to reach out to either TAs or the professor everyday of the week which is extremely useful. ",
            "\u00a0There are absolutely no weaknesses in this course. The course covers the very basics in Calculus and Statistics, gradually increasing the level of difficulty all the way through until both subjects are combined and seamlessly applied to conduct a legitimate statistical analysis of social behavior. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really well-organized and well-planned!! Explained very clearly, with explicit criteria for the final project and tests given with ample warning and disclaimers. Really went into foundations such that even people with no calculus background felt knowledgeable about it!\r\nWeaknesses: While it was great to feel really confident about the calculus foundation, I felt like the latter half of the course was so rushed that we couldn't apply all of it to the statistics (i.e. the chain, product, and quotient rules?). I would have loved a hair less calculus or repetition so that I could feel just as confident in the new statistics material as in the old calculus material. ",
            "\u00a0The whole teaching staff is great, but Lloyd is truly one of the best professors I've had in my time at Yale. He is clearly SO excited about the work he does and he seems to genuinely enjoy teaching. He challenged us quite a bit, but he always made sure to provide ample support- he wanted nothing more than for us to understand the material and succeed in his class. \r\n\r\nI thought the first month or so of the class would be boring because I had already taken calculus, but he presented the content in such a novel and engaging way that it actually strengthened my understanding of calculus. Lloyd is extraordinarily helpful at office hours and all around just a really nice guy!\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that students have to pay for Stata if they want it on their personal computers. I know this isn't under Lloyd's control, but students shouldn't be confined to computer labs if they want to use a software that is required for a class. Especially for Stata, which is so widely used, I am surprised the university doesn't pay for student licenses. ",
            "\u00a0I agree with earlier reviewers that the first half of lecture definitely seemed slow after having taken multivariable calculus last semester. However, weekly problem sets were definitely manageable and I LOVED the freedom we were given with the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course is that it takes students step from understanding the calculus behind running the regressions we later run to actually running one oneself. The homework sets were always helpful for practicing what one learned in class. I don't necessarily see this as a weakness, but just something to keep in mind, being that since students enter with different math backgrounds, the first semester can definitely feel more/less useful to students depending on whether they've already done advanced calculus. A huge strength of the course are the lectures which were always clear and informative. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very good course taught by a great professor.  I am not a confident student in mathematics, but Professor Grieger is a great teacher, and really helped explain things clearly and fairly.  The course went fast and we learned a lot, but I never felt overwhelmed, and felt like I learned everything that we undertook in the course very completely.  Overall, it raised my confidence in engaging in questions of mathematics and statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Definitely reduce the amount of introductory calculus in the beginning. It isn't necessary and can instead be taught in tandem with the STATA stuff. Good introductory statistics class if you've NEVER touched statistics before. Lloyd is great at \"dumbing down\" some of the harder statistics concepts. Lloyd and all the TFs are also very accessible if you need help.\r\n\r\nWeakness: All around this is a great, light course to take as a fifth course or QR. One thing is that it IS a lot of work, but the work itself is not very hard. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teaching, TA's, Professor\r\nWeaknesses: preparation for the final project ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the workload was fair. I also appreciate that we had the entire finals period to complete the final project. All in all, I wouldn't change anything. ",
            "\u00a0The availability of the TFs was a huge strength. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were how well the class was organized. The material for every class lesson was clearly delineated and Prof. Grieger did an excellent job of always keeping that material in perspective of the larger goals of the class. This made it so that I never lost sight of why we were fighting our way through Calculus or Statistics because he always made clear explicit references to how these skills were going to be useful in Sociology.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the class is how fast classes moved especially towards the end of the semester. Sometimes, very important concepts would get left for the last five minutes of class which made them nearly impossible to fully grasp. In classes like these, it seemed like Prof. Grieger could afford to spend a little less time recapping the lessons of the past (though generally these were incredibly helpful and a feature of the class that I loved) in order to make sure there was sufficient time to cover new material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Grieger was a truly incredible professor. He was one of the nicest professors that I have had, and it's immediately clear how much he cares about his students and their success. He was great at explaining the course concepts in a clear/engaging way that enables understanding. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I thought the first few weeks moved slowly and were slightly unnessecary. I think maybe basic one variable calculus could have been made a prerequisite, and the course could have started with multivariable concepts. I think it could have been more effective to have had more time dedicated to going further into the statistical part of the class and less to the mathematical preliminaries. Also, I felt like there were some grading disparities between TAs (some were harder than others), so it would have been nice for that to have been more consistent. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Grieger is very engaging at lectures. He is also very understanding of students' positions and learning. It was perhaps the most encouraging course I had ever taken at Yale. If you want to build a background in statistics, this course was very strong. I did feel that the grading was slightly arbitrary (for example, being punished for a simple mistake over-and-over) and that the first half of the course was not as interesting, but overall, the course was really taught well. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student if they are willing to put in the work. You will feel very confident in your abilities having taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone who wants to be able to do basic data analysis or read stats in studies, especially in the social sciences. I think my data literacy grew enormously, now I'm able to at least get through the data and methods portions of most articles that before I would struggle a lot with. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking at past years' reviews and looking for a gut, this is not the class for you--the workload is pretty intense in some portions of the class. This is, however, a good substitute for prospective EPE/global majors for the stats requirement. Also probably a good class for sociology majors, or anyone interested in general with tinkering with datasets, though classes in R or other languages may be more appropriate for that. It's definitely a good way to start getting into statistical programming if you've had no experience with statistics or programming before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in taking an intro social science stats course. The math is fairly simple for anyone with a calculus background (and even for those without), and he lectures in a way that's very clear and easy to follow. There are lots of opportunities for office hours and help on the psets, and the workload is very reasonable - weekly pset, in-class midterm, and take home final. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course if you are interested in gaining data analytics skills but don't want to take one of the more intimidating stats/econometrics courses at Yale. It's a great introduction to data analytics and statistics. Lloyd is a great prof, and the class isn't too hard as long as you work hard on the problem sets and pay attention in class. Sometimes lectures could get a little long due to the nature of the content, but Lloyd tried his best to throw in some jokes to keep us attentive. Midterm isn't too hard, and the final is take-home, and you can choose out of a number of topics that you want to investigate and write a statistical report on. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It is a challenging QR credit but definitely worth taking. You will learn valuable skills even if you are only taking it to satisfy major/distributional requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I already recommend this course to every single student I have mentioned it to. It is the best QR class I have taken because of the wide range of material it covers and its consistent focus on real-world applications. ",
            "\u00a0A great refresher course for calculus, with some statistics at the end--Prof. Grieger really cares about fundamentals. If that sounds up your alley, take it! My issue is I'm not sure how prepared I am for higher statistics that doesn't use Stata, but if that's not a problem for you, this class is a great choice! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of the best-taught and most well-organized classes I have taken at Yale. Lloyd is far and away the most energetic and engaging instructor I have ever experienced. He loves the work he does and clearly loves teaching it, too. The course material is at times challenging, but he wants nothing more than for his students to succeed, so he makes sure that there is ample support. \r\n\r\nAnother great thing about this course is the amount of intellectual freedom it offers. The majority of students come from sociology/global affairs/education studies, but there were a wide range of skill levels and disciplines in the class which made for some really rich discussions. The final project allowed you to choose from about 20 different prompts across 4 different datasets, so you could do something that was relevant to you and your studies.\r\n\r\nI'm not a huge fan of Stata, but Lloyd does a great job teaching it and this class does a pretty good job getting you started with what is a very widely-used and practical software. ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take any stats course, take this! Professor Grieger is absolutely incredible--he's one of the most patient, clear, and thoughtful instructors I've ever had. He's set up the course so about the first half is calc review while the second half is more on coding. If you haven't done any calculus, the first half of the semester is essentially a crash course. If you have, it's pretty basic. I'm definitely someone who is wary of anything coding related, but the lectures in this course were always pretty closely aligned with what the psets were. Be warned -- they do take up some time, but I think that's to be expected because it's a QR class. The TFs were all really helpful, so go to their office hours! I think this is one of those classes where the more you put in, the more you get out. Definitely really helpful, and has actually inspired me to maybe consider more stats courses in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great intro statistics course to take to fulfill a QR requirement for people who aren't as familiar with statistics.  While it is not an easy course, neither is it so challenging as to feel impossible.  If you do the work and follow the lecture, you will not feel overwhelmed or out of place, and you will learn a lot even though the course moves quickly.  You will learn a lot and professor Grieger is a great professor and good lecturer who explains everything very clearly, while allowing you to examine statistical questions and challenges related to sociological issues. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend! As a history major, this course was an excellent way for me to fulfill my QR requirement. The workload is manageable and Lloyd does an amazing job of explaining the material if you are stuck. The team of TAs were also extremely knowledgeable and explained concepts well! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Easy QR, very easy if you've taken AP Stats and/or AP Calc before. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic intro statistics course, good if you are not particularly quantitatively inclined ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If someone is looking for a QR credit that will actually give them tangible skills they can use beyond the classroom, this is the class for them. Also Lloyd is an amazing instructor and the TAs were not only helpful but also really dedicated to our success. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The course is very conducive to the development of analytical skills for not just sociology majors but for students with majors in other social sciences. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was incredibly useful and well worth my time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great math course for Sociology majors. You really do learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great QR for social science majors-- really interesting, accessible, and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It won't necessarily be that hard if you've had AP Statistics/AP Calculus prior to this course. Yet, I think it is still worthwhile to take for the last few weeks of material (which expand upon the material from those courses as well as teach Stata). It would definitely be helpful if the course omitted/went faster through some of the preliminary material though in order to make it even more worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was a joy to take this course with Prof. Grieger. You learn how to conduct statistical analysis which is quite important in today's world for sure. I do wish though that there is less of math in the beginning and more of the social science aspects which was covered in the second half of the class. Overall, though, it was a very nicely run class with some interesting materials! "
