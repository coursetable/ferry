            "\u00a0I was allowed to follow specific interests in this course for my research assignment which was extremely valuable to me.  It allowed me to dive in-depth to a topic of extreme importance to me. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, not much except that Janine has a lot of amazing connections. \r\nThis was supposed to be a deep dive into each conflict, and I really hoped we would look into these conflicts with a human rights or an intersectional lens. But instead, Janine brought a guest speaker to each seminar, leaving no room for us to have discussions, and while interacting with these speakers was very interesting on its own, we didn't have any actual seminar style discussions. Even hearing from Janine about her own experiences as a war reporter would have been interesting, but unfortunately, time was just spent asking guest speakers questions, or Janine telling us about a timeline of events in the conflict. ",
            "\u00a0Looked below the surface level and examined the dynamics of different conflicts -- sectarianism, counterinsurgency, violence as a tool of war. Class was also graced by a number of important figures in the realm of conflict/diplomacy, each carrying with them insightful and controversial perspectives (e.g. MSF founder who questioned the premise of a humanitarian war) ",
            "\u00a0Incredible insights from all four wars ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the origins and unfolding of conflict in four Middle East conflicts (Syria, Iraq, Yemen & Afghanistan) ",
            "\u00a0writing and reporting ",
            "\u00a0I met multiple interesting figures in the humanitarian profession and learned about their perspectives, along with getting a briefing on the four major Middle Eastern conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0We were able to talk to many different people, including the in depth perspective of professor Di Giovanni, which allowed us to approach the conflicts from many different viewpoints. "

            "\u00a0It was a great course.  The professor brought in amazing speaker who complimented the readings and discussion well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that Janine has a lot of amazing connections, and the people that she brought to class had unique insights to share. Janine is also very nice and cares about her students.\r\nWeaknesses are that time was spent very unproductively. I didn't feel like I learnt much, despite these conflicts being some of the most interesting ones to me. Readings were either by Janine herself, or the guest speaker for that week, and the feedback we received for the blog posts was also not too helpful. I haven't received a single grade back for this class this entire semester, and even though seminars can sometimes be like that, I would've really appreciated some kind of feedback. Also, even though the final project gives us a lot of flexibility in that we can choose any topic we want, I wish there had been some more guidance with regards to the project. Nothing was due till the last 2 weeks of school, when presentations were rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The great strength of this class is the network of fascinating diplomats, politicians, journalists, survivors of war and more that Janine was able to draw upon. We had fascinating conversations, as Janine would structure our classes sort of like group interviews in which we would each have an opportunity to speak with the daily guest in our class. The greatest weakness was probably the syllabus, as it basically comprised a long list of news articles with a few novels. Janine said we could read as much or as little as we liked, but more guidance and organization were necessary as I often felt that the readings I was selecting weren't giving me a comprehensive understanding of some of the conflicts. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: everything\r\nweaknesses: nona ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are: Professor Janine Di Giovanni has experience on the field, has a very wide network of connections and invites relevant speakers. \r\nOpportunity for improvement: More class readings that address the conflicts from a high-level perspective, and that focus on their key issues and moments. ",
            "\u00a0strength lecture combined with excellent guest speakers\r\n\r\nweakness: the professor did not hold an office hour ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be improved with more direct feedback on student work from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n+ very interesting material, and Di Giovanni had a lot to tell about the conflicts \r\n+ immensely interesting guest speakers throughout the course!\r\n+ positive interaction with the professor, who is always eager to engage with her students\r\n+ assignments help to interact with conflicts\r\n\r\nPossible improvements:\r\n- sometimes very spontaneous (re-)scheduling, but it worked out overall.

            "\u00a0Yes, the topics very extremely interesting (and timely).  Also the professor is such an amazing wealth of knowledge that just listening to hear experiences and insights is of great value. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not. It just was not intellectually challenging at all. If you're looking for a global affairs gut, maybe take this class. But unless the class is fundamentally restructured so every week there isn't just another guest speaker, and there are actual seminar style discussions about readings, I would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended if you are interested in the topic; speakers were incredible ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who seek a first approach to conflict dynamics in the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a class where you meet many other interesting students and have the chance to meet and speak to people you would never get the chance to engage with otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a very interesting course, the professor is very open and the class evolves with the people that are in it - there is a lot of space to discuss ideas and viewpoints, which made it a unique experience to me. "
