            "\u00a0This course was very helpful for gaining in depth knowledge on some of the rarer, more cutting edge aspects of chemical biology. Not only that, but by having the students lead the majority of the course, it required us to be very familiar with a specific subfield and practice our lecturing skills. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who is self-motivated, has taken the first chem bio course, and really like chemical biology/is planning on a career in chemical biology. This course gets you up to speed on a lot of the main on-going research areas in the field which is really good if you want to work in this field one day. ",
