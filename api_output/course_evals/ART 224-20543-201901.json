            "\u00a0This main insight this course gave me was the ability to stop overthinking my drawing and searching for the \"correct\" outcome. This course really made me challenge myself to be ok with creating something I wasn't immediately happy with, knowing that the process would help me improve in the future. ",

            "\u00a0I learned to better draw the human figure. ",
            "\u00a0I have significantly improved how I approach drawing figures in comparison to how I started this semester thanks to the wide variety of styles approaching figure drawings as well as the unconventional methods to understand the human body. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to view the figure in the context of its surroundings, some basic drawing and inking techniques. ",

            "\u00a0This course was really fun and engaging. I feel like I learned a lot. I liked that we used a lot of different mediums and had a wide range of tasks. I might have liked to receive more feedback from the professor/TA. ",

            "\u00a0It was pretty chill, and we had lots of practice. The middle of the semester was a bit tough though because we didn't have any models for a while. I enjoyed it, but I wish I could have figured out how to improve more. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and the freedom of students to work with different mediums and styles. I hope to receive even more critiques on my drawings during the drawing process. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing from models was always a plus, especially in the wide variety of materials that were available. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in the in-class practice we had every class. There was never a class in which we were not working on a figure, with the exception of the final, two classes. This model allowed me to practice capturing the essence of the human body in my art given incredibly small time constraints. I would not say there is a significant weakness to this course. "

            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course. Since Basic Drawing is a pre-requisite, this class is definitely not for everyone, but it was much less intimidating than I expected during the first week because the students in the class brought a mixture of styles and art backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. You will enjoy it, learn a lot, and the workload is low (almost no assignments outside of class). ",

This course challenges techniques that you've already developed, to push you to leave your comfort zone and explore how to represent the human form in your work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in drawing figures. The course has implications for students who might be interested in character design or animation, as I often had to draw the same figure in different positions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Amazing, youre given a lot of freedom to determine your subjectivity and how you want to tackle the projects. Also, the TA for the class, Phoebe, was amazing! "
