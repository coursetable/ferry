            "\u00a0I gained a solid understanding of western philosophy, especially Aristotle and Aristotelian philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a lot about how to approach Philosophy, and I acquired a better understanding of how to formulate responses to philosophical arguments. In addition, I feel like I was able to really engage with the text more and understand how a certain philosopher would respond to some counterargument. ",
            "\u00a0I loved DS Philosophy. I have never taken a class that has pushed me to think about things in the ways that this class has. Specifically, Philosophy helped me hone in my analytical thinking skills. Often times people will criticize philosophy (especially DS philosophy) because they see it as being either a) inapplicable, or b) surface deep and not super fulfilling. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, Philosophy has been the most applicable of the three DS courses I took as a first semester freshman. In everyday life I've applied a lot of the analytical thinking skills that I learned in philosophy to arguments with friends and family. DS Philosophy was one  of those classes where one feels like he or she is becoming tangibly smarter throughout the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nIn terms of insights, the western canon of philosophy has turned me on to questions about free will, objective morality, and the cause of wrongdoing. Reading about how the ancients have justified their assertions and applying the same methodology to the papers we write is thrilling and fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the variety of philosophy schools of thought, and also about several early perspectives on the relationship between religion and philosophy. Being unfamiliar with studying philosophy, I learned how to have a good debate surrounding different texts, and how to write a philosophy-focused essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think. This course completely revamped the way my brain works in a very positive way- I learned how to form and understand arguments. I also learned how to express those arguments in a philosophical essay. I am confident these skills will help me immensely in my other classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The art of crafting philosophical arguments and evaluating them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about things one at a time, and this course allowed me to approach questions with less bias than before. I had to think about every question from every angle, and I felt like my mind was being challenged in new ways. ",
            "\u00a0Given that I have never properly studied philosophy before, the amount of philosophy I learnt to do in this course is truly phenomenal. I think I have a better idea of the history of philosophy as well as basic philosophical tools in logic and ethics. ",
            "\u00a0Every day in this course, I felt like I was learning an incredible amount. I had never really delved into philosophy before, and I have come out of this course feeling like I know how to attack philosophy questions, write a philosophy essay, and explain the basics of each thinker's argument. I am very grateful to have been a part of this course. ",
            "\u00a0This class really goes as a great introduction to ancient philosophy. The pieces are all very enlightening, and the questions that arise are all thought-provoking. \r\nIn this class, I learned what kind of questions one must be asking when searching for answers to explain the unexplainable. I learned how to move closer to an answer, even when the answer can never be reached. I also learned the value of asking these questions, and how a person embodies their philosophical nature through their soul and character. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a framework and method for thinking about philosophical problems as well as a grounding in the beginnings of the western philosophic tradition. "

            "\u00a0The seminar discussions were very enlightening and engaging; I learned as much from our conversation as I did from the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I am not sure if this is planned or if individual section professors plan out what they will go over on their own, but I feel that sometimes there are instances where the different DS sections go over different things in the text, and this can make it hard for students in DS to work together because they lack familiarity with certain aspects of the reading. I do appreciate how DS shortens the reading in order to make it more manageable. I think that finding appropriate sections in the reading to assign is essential for Philosophy especially because otherwise students would be too overwhelmed and possibly unable to finish the assignment. The current assigned reading seems to be a manageable amount, and I think it usually captures the heart of the content.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what can be improved, I feel that DS Philosophy hits a bump when it comes to expanding beyond the text. Since the arguments are small and sometimes require an analogy to be better understood, I feel that Philosophy allows a lot of leeway for the discussion to expand beyond simply what the philosopher argued in the text. Although I think that discourse in the section is great for students to go beyond the text to formulate their own opinions and ideas, I think that a shortcoming of this would be that it can sometimes cater to students who do not complete the homework. In other words, I know of students who would not complete the reading assignment, yet they would still talk a significant amount during section by taking the argument and bringing it away from the text. Although this is helpful sometimes, I think that it can also be detrimental in allowing students to gain a full understanding of the philosopher's ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: We read a lot. It is at times very difficult to stay on top of the weekly reading, and that can be discouraging. Also, due to the relatively short amount of time we end up spending on every text post aristotle, the work can occasionally feel rushed and superficial. \r\n\r\nStrengths: This course will literally revolutionize the way you think. The pure exposure to the differing philosophical premises and ideas was invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the Directed Studies program is structured efficiently and that all of the classes fit together well. I enjoy the lectures as well as the small seminars, and think that they facilitate great conversation between students and professors and allow for many different readings of texts to come together. There is a good balance between professors teaching the students about aspects of the texts and their histories and the students being able to discuss their own views and how they interpret different aspects of the literature that allows for more open and interesting learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I got to see various different philosophies throughout time and that was really cool. I loved going in-depth with some of the arguments and theories and trying to see how that would affect real life. Aristotle was awesome and I love that we got to spend a lot of time on him. And again, the course was excellent in teaching me how to think.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Selection of a few of the authors. For example, we read Ibn Tufayl, which didn't even seem like philosophy and who nobody has ever heard of, and we didn't read people like Avicenna, Cicero, or Justin, who come up a lot later on. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of depth, but often at the expense of rigorously analyzing various philosophers arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were almost always wonderful and gave extremely helpful insights. I always felt like I understood the text better after lecture. Any questions I had would generally be answered in section. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this course is the small amount of time we spend on everything, quite characteristic of DS. Sometimes I felt like before I truly understood something, we were on to the next. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. It covers lots of philosophical topics very quickly. Classes are always interesting but sometimes rushed. It would be helpful if professors went over paper writing style for philosophy earlier in the year. ",
            "\u00a0As with any Directed Studies course, the level of detail always suffers. I probably would have liked to understand logic a little better before beginning. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very stronggreat teacher, great material, a great class dynamic, and I felt like as a class we made a lot of progress. There were no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was all strengths. I love David Charles; I think all of our inclass discussions made a difference on my outlook of specific philosophers premises. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course  is the discussions generated by the material we read. The weakness is the lack of time we get to dedicate to each work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Having a grasp of western philosophy is a crucial foundation for any discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I think DS Philosophy is great in providing an introductory understanding of philosophy as a whole, and it gives students an opportunity to see how Philosophy papers and texts are written. It definitely is a challenging course (with DS as a whole), but the reading is manageable if you are dedicated to actually doing it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you value learning how past thinkers have shaped the way we see issues today, I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the assigned workload (weekly readings and five-page papers) is manageable, and allows for students to become more familiar with the books of the classic western canon, as well as develop their paper writing skills. The small seminars keep the class engaging, while the weekly lectures allow for new insight on specific portions of a text that a seminar doesn't typically discuss/delve into. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course because of the reasons I have mentioned above. It is essential for having a grasp of philosophy, and I have found that philosophy is essential for having a grasp of your own life and beliefs as well as understanding different subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learnt a lot and was guided by Prof Charles well though I had no prior experience with philosphy. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a great break from the other classes in DS, which require reading and thinking of a more similar kind to each other than philosophy. The philosophy experience is definitely different based on the professor, but all the lectures are solid. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great class. The material is interesting and the professors are great. Class discussions are always interesting and the essay prompts are pretty straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, depending on what the student wants out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. David is wonderful, and I had so much fun and learned so much. This course is unique because I would recommend it both to someone who has never done philosophy, and to someone who is a seasoned philosophy expert. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is curious about how we reached the religious doctrines we have today and where the ideas of eternity come from. I think that one needs the interest factor, because sitting through seminars if you dont really care about whether or not the soul is eternal wouldnt be helpful for anybody. \r\nAs far as DS classes, this one has been my favorite. For someone who has never take. Philosophy, I think my mind has really grown and I have so many questions Id like to pursue in the next semester of DS philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would reccomend this course to any student interested in gaining an introduction to philosophic thinking "
