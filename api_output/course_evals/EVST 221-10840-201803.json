            "\u00a0In Field Ecology, I learned multiple techniques that real ecologists use out in the field. We used transects, observations, animal observations, tree ID techniques, and we learned how to think. Which, learning how to think sounds like a strange way to put it, but as Linda teaches you, it forces you to think (with some helpful guidance). I also learned how to hike, row a canoe, and tranquility. I say tranquility because there is a field trip every week, and honestly this places are peaceful, beautiful, and amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained critical thinking skills, ability to problem solve, and how to work well in groups ",
            "\u00a0I honestly learned more from this class than any other STEM class I have taken at Yale (and as a junior E&EB major, I have taken a lot of STEM classes). Professor Puth focuses on explaining the research process. The class teaches you how to approach designing an interesting research question that can be answered with limited time and resources. In addition, every Thursday we were able to explore a different ecosystem near New Haven so I learned a lot about the ecology of the local area. ",
            "\u00a0Fieldwork skills, writing scientific reports, and FRIENDSHIP!!! ",
            "\u00a0Learned a huge amount about ecology and field work. Incredibly beneficial and engaging class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it is able to apply concepts usually only taught out of a book to the real world. You learn how to think like an ecologist and not regurgitate textbook information. It baffles me more people don't take it. Another strength is that Linda really cares about her students deeply, and wants us to do well. the only weakness is that we didn't have more than 4 hours for the field trips. ",
            "\u00a0AWESOME COURSE DONT CHANGE IT ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about the research process and fieldwork. The E&EB department does not offer nearly enough field courses and I really appreciated the chance to take a class like this one. It is also a great way to get to know other students interested in ecology, due to the small class size and the large number of field trips. The classwork doesn't feel like busy work; unlike with most lab reports, I actually learned a lot about current scientific debates through completing the work for this class. \r\n\r\nI think it could be improved with a little more formal instruction on how to carry out the statistical analysis for the final project, although I also learned a lot about how to make better graphs just by talking informally to Linda and Matt. ",
            "\u00a0Great course on field ecology! A lot of hands-on experiences to make us realize the true nature of field research.\r\n\r\nMaybe can cover more paper discussion and analysis on Tuesday discussion sessions? ",
            "\u00a0Field work was outstanding piece of learning and engaging. One of best courses I've taken, can't think of any weaknesses. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0IF YOU MANAGE TO STUMBLE UPON THIS CLASS IN COURSE SEARCH, TAKE IT. Even if you aren't in the major. She teaches the material beautifully and I've honestly never learned more in a course at Yale. If you are in the major, you absolutely need to take this, because these are the skills that will get you a job in the future.  Knowing the book stuff won't help you get actually ecologist positions, this class? It definitely will. You come up with your own project at the end of the term, and honestly it is liberating. ",
            "\u00a0yes yes yes yes it was life changing ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You should especially take it if you are an E&EB major who wants to learn how the research you learn about in other classes is actually carried out in the field. This class really increased my appreciation for how difficult it is to carry out a sound research project. Through reading important papers in the field, I got a better sense of the some important current theoretical debates in the field. The final research project was a way to learn about how to conduct a research project with great support from the professor and TA. \r\n\r\nPlus, this class was so much fun. We spent every Thursday afternoon outside, conducting fieldwork at different sites around New Haven. This was definitely among my favorite classes in college because it was extremely interesting, rewarding and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend! There are not a lot of field courses at Yale and taking this course with Linda, Matt and my fellow classmates has been the most amazing academic experience I had this semester!!! \r\n\r\nWe visited a lot of different ecosystems near New Haven ranging from upland forest, salt marsh to lakes and islands. Each field day is set into exploring a small research topic, and while most would not give us a clear answer, it is really helpful to get the experience of fieldwork and understand the unpredictable nature of it. \r\n\r\nThis course should be continued at Yale and more field courses should exist in EEB department! It's so important for us to understand all the ecology concepts that we learnt in BIOL104 as well as General Ecology!\r\n\r\nAnd not to mention that we received great friendship as a whole group that we eventually felt like a family (bonded by Linda's cookies)!!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Incredible and engaging lessons, and the field component was crucial in my learning. Absolutely wonderful professor and TA. "
