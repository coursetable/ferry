            "\u00a0Should not make it mandatory. Some of the topics and presenters were just plain boring and uninteresting. And plus, there was not always enough food. Also, not any vegan/vegetarian options. And they used the tiny plastic water bottles that you finish in a sip and are so bad for the environment. YSPH should really practice what they preach in terms of sustainable and environmental-friendly food options. ",
            "\u00a0Some great seminars - I really liked meeting the faculty candidates and having the chance to go out to lunch with them afterwards. ",

            "\u00a0One of the best courses at YSPH ",
            "\u00a0It was alright. Bring in practicioners though. too research heavy. got boring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Many lecturers with diverse research topics came to discuss their work, which was exciting and helped me to learn about many new topics that I wouldn't otherwise have encountered.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- I think the course could benefit from having other types of lecturers that are in other fields of work come to present  (i.e., not just research) ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had more space for conversation! And I also wish there were more opportunities to get to know the SBS students. ",
            "\u00a0The talks were very engaging this year! A few nore non-sandwich lunches would be nice ",
            "\u00a0The seminar was mostly used as a time for presentations, which is helpful and fun, but doesn't encourage SBS bonding, or conversations with faculty. I hope next year it can be re-vamped to include more activities for the department. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how this seminar had a social justice and health equity theme. ",
            "\u00a0The speakers were interesting, but it would be more interesting to bring speakers from a wider range of topics. Maybe ask students (via survey or poll) what types of talks they are interested in hearing, and try to tailor the talks to more student interests. Also, it would be useful to provide enough lunch and quality lunch options for all students after the seminar, and potentially hold the seminars in another room that would allow students to eat during the seminar (many times there are other courses and events that started immediately after the seminar and it was difficult to get lunch after the talk). ",
            "\u00a0There wasn't enough food sometimes. I would go to the lectures, stay the whole time, and the sandwiches or lunch offerings would be gone. It was sad when you expect food but would leave hungry (perhaps because students from other departments sometimes sneak in before, or enough isn't ordered). ",
            "\u00a0Great seminar, would have also enjoyed a more variety of speakers, perhaps some public health practice professionals and not just those working in academia. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the content discussed and professionals that discussed their career work this semester! The timing was convenient for me based on my course and work schedule and the fact that lunch was included was definitely a plus! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the SBS seminar is that it allowed students to meet and hear from professionals in the real world who are practicing public health research on SBS topics. A weakness of this seminar is not being somewhat sensitive to individuals who have differing viewpoints than the lecturers. One seminar in particular that discussed gay bath houses in California seemed inappropriate to discuss in such a casual manner, and the lecturer almost normalized these bath houses. I understand that as public health professionals we are trying to be open and focus on health issues without any judgment. I just wonder, though, if morals are ever allowed to be discussed. It sometimes is disappointing that they are not. ",
