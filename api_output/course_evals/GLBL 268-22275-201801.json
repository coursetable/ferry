In the end, it was tough to read, but it was well worth it and even necessary to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was an intellectual challenge. Being asked to apply the same 5-6 theories to a plethora of events pushed me to think critically and analytically. Also, this course is helpful in viewing events from multiple angles, which broadened my understanding of the factors contributing to these events. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are too many readings, which made it difficult to be consistently engaged with the material. Additionally, because of the heavy reading load, it was very difficult to prepare for the midterm and final, which required an understanding of all the readings. ",

The method suggested for forming arguments in this class was overly simplistic purposefullyI think there arent other ways to achieve parsimony than refusing to acknowledge the nuance in an explanation, and as an upper level political science major, I have been in other polisci classes that encourage that type of nuance. The course took a deeply Eurocentric perspective; even when discussing other parts of the world, it was from the perspective of how would this influence the US or Europe. Aside from the theoretical perspectives, which we reviewed in one class and were very straightforward to apply, I think one could gain a lot more from taking some history classes. ",

            "\u00a0The course is great at describing the theoretical frameworks of international relations and the development of IR all the way from Ancient Greece to our days. I do wish, however, that it was structured a bit more cohesively in the second part of the course after we finished the Cold War topics, it seems that we were just jumping around all over the place without a clear structure. ",
            "\u00a0A phenomenal course. Professor Lyall is an ever-engaging lecturer, and is able to cover a mass of information during each class section. I'm glad we started with a history of the world through IR theory, so we could see how theorists have interpreted past attempts, and how the tools to interpret past events have now come into question.\r\n\r\nI wish that we had a more systematized introduction to international theories, one that discussed scope conditions and whether the theory was a primary or secondary theory. Even though realism, liberalism, and constructivism are the main theories in present day IR, we were introduced to rationalism and cognitivism as if they competed alongside the three previously mentioned ones. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness was reading amount and going over them in section. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a strong overview of international relations. Its strength definitely was in the quality of Professor Lyall's lectures. Its weakness was the fact that there was too much reading for an intro course. While it was all very interesting, it was hard to get through. It often seemed like I was sacrificing close analysis for just trying to get through the readings. ",

            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading - I don't think that there should have been less, but I wish that we had engaged with the readings more in lecture or section. It would have helped build a connection between all of the course materials. ",

            "\u00a0The introduction of theoretical frameworks and then the illustrations of their applications made the class interesting and informative. The varied subject matter of the lectures kept the course interesting while references to the theories provided a nice, overarching theme for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the lenses sometimes limited our treatment of certain issues. Further, the \"feminist\" lens was hardly explored at all -- Professor Lyall reduced the theory to male leaders' testosterone driving poor decisions. This course could certainly benefit from discussion of the masculinization of IR, on which even our TF seemed to agree would have been appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0It was quite repetitive and despite the use of different perspectives generally somewhat uncritical. \r\n\r\nThe content became more interesting toward the end of the course.\r\n\r\nThere was far too much reading assigned and we barely used or reviewed any of it. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and I enjoyed section however, the reading load was incredibly high and dense and I struggled with it. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of assigned readings, which do help you to engage more with the subject and to really learn the material. However, the readings were oftentimes excessive to the point where it would be almost impossible to complete them all adequately. A lot of times, the readings could have been shortened or edited to just include subject material that was pertinent to the class so that we wouldn't have to waste time reading information that would never be addressed in class or in section. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved by more focussed and integrated reading schedules. Despite multiple conversations with TAs from students who found the readings excessive, the quantity of reading was not slowed. It reached an unproductive state where all, TAs and students included, knew that not all readings were being complete. If everyone was complicit in this understanding, clearly these readings were agreed to be excessive.\r\n\r\nI would have liked a lecture series that did not reduce content to numbered explanations etc as was visible in the lecture presentations but a series that stimulated us to think and engage with the system.\r\n\r\nI think that, after the response papers, we could move away from theoretically grounding our work in rationalist/realist etc but expand our repertoire of analysis. The emphasis on theory might have been logical for political science but felt reductive on a semester-long course.\r\n\r\nI would have also liked readings that were more in dialogue with the lectures themselves. This would have facilitated Section much more easily. Instead, Section was focussed on reading and not lecture materials. ",

            "\u00a0Way too many readings. Lectures were engaging and slides were well organized, but discussion was sometimes difficult during section because it was clear that most people found it difficult to get through all of the readings. Interesting topic, and good professor, but this needed fewer readings. ",
            "\u00a0There should be way less reading and more test prep/essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I appreciated learning about the different theoretical approaches to international relations. Please keep this in the course! It was super useful for an introductory course, and I will definitely apply it to what I learn in the future.\r\nThe most interesting parts of the class were the more modern sections. I thought the laws of war lectures were the most interesting. Please keep these in! ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of readings each week. I know we should all have done everything, but it would be useful for discussion purposes to highlight some primary readings and then label some as secondary, so that during discussion at least everyone has read the primary articles.  Could be useful as well to have an office hours prior to discussion that goes through some readings that are confusing ",

            "\u00a0It's a pretty standard intro course.  Professor Lyall did a good job of organizing the huge topic into themes and issues over time, but the breadth of information prevented us from getting a deep understanding of any particular unit. ",

The current issues were some of the more interesting aspects of the course, but they were saved for the last third or so of the semester. Professor Lyall is a fantastic lecturer and it is definitely worth taking the course if you like his lecture style and think that he can make some otherwise dry subject matter interesting for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they understand that they are taking a course that is very heavily focused on theories of international relations and depends upon them for essentially all of the analysis of events.

Don't take it if you already have a lot of experience in European history or in reading a lot of NYTimes or modern events - some of the material is rather repetitive. If you do take the course, do the readings! The papers and journals you read here really are wonderful and open your eyes to so many more perspectives. ",

I think the nature of the workload allows students to develop their reading and critical thinking skills, and the course evaluations force students to work on their analysis of historical events. ",

The readings and lectures are very interesting and raise a number of questions which have no straightforward answers. As a result, the course challenges you to think in different ways and arrive at innovative solutions while its historical overview coupled with pressing modern-day issues means there is likely at least one area which will prove of interest to you in the future. The class tends to focus more on issues of war which can be good for those interested in military history and theory but should be noted by any student interested in this course who is less intrigued by this subject.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student interested in history, global affair, polisci etc. It was a great course to learn about relevant topics and to get a sense of the international system. Above all other courses this semester, I feel like I learnt concrete information - facts and figures and explanations. I think I we engaged reasonably well with ideas, not always nuanced. ",

It provides a solid foundation for understanding historical and contemporary politics. ",

Take it if you're mildly interested in international relations, global affairs, history, or poli sci because you will learn so much that you can apply to other disciplines or just the world today in general. This is a great introductory course, but I would recommend it to people that don't even need an introductory course because you'll learn so much that you wouldn't know otherwise. The theoretical frameworks of international relations will seem annoying at first but they are so worth it!! I truly learned so much from this class and my horizons have been broadened, even if my grade isn't perfect. A+ class you go glen coco ",
