            "\u00a0Easily my favorite course of the semester. Quite possibly the only time I have genuinely wanted more work, more opportunities to flex the muscles I was working within my project group. ",
            "\u00a0Could have even been more reading for the class (independent from the projects). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It sometimes felt a little random, but made sense since it was generally according to when the guests could come. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures felt a little circuitous/randomly structured, but all of the info was still presented very clearly and directly. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I loved having visitors. It was really nice to hear from other professionals about budgeting and artistic and management relationships. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed hearing from artistic directors and producers. I think there is room for expanding the knowledge base though by including a Production Stage Manager to reflect on their in put during season planning to help guide the stage managers in the room and their groups as to what their roles could be within the projects. ",
            "\u00a0REALLY interesting to see Darko on the day that he resigned from his AD position. Historic. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I don't know how much I'll be able to recall of the top of my head, but it's great to have access to so many example budgets and contracts, and to have been walked through how to read them. ",
            "\u00a0This was an exceptionally polished, concise, and applicable course experience that makes me want to take more classes in the Department of Theatre Management and from Vicki. I'm extremely grateful that it is part of the Director's curriculum. The preparation of the final project was one of my proudest collaborations at the school thus far, and the lectures and guests were perfectly weighted to balance the project experience. I have no precise feedback to provide at this time, but will contact Vicki directly should something come to mind. "

        [
            "\u00a0My only suggestion is that it would be helpful at the beginning of the semester to make it clear how much groups have to stick to the XYZ profile. Seeing all the final presentations, it is clear that some people didn't stick to it fully which is obviously okay but I think it could be helpful to explain how much groups should stick to the profile or not. Personally, there were some moments where some of my company's vision had to be revised based on the XYZ profile but maybe it would have been okay if we could back it up with good reason but I didn't think that was an option. So just something to maybe share with the next class. ",
            "\u00a0I understand that this course is a Theater Management course, but I firmly believe that it is incredibly valuable to other departments. That being said, aside from the single lecture with Jon Reed in which he practically reiterated his lectures from Production Planning, the course was 98% theater management and what was learned in other aspects of the process was learned from hands on work during the project itself. I learned more about a Production Manager's role from working within my group's company than anything, and would have loved more instruction based learning within the class. I honestly think this class is strong but it could be so much more if partner with Jon Reed and even James Mountcastle to really teach us what the three aspects are in coming together to plan a season rather than approaching it mostly from a Theater Manager or Artistic Director's point of view. \r\n\r\nI also feel that this class should be a requirement or strong suggested course for any TD&Ps on the PM track.
