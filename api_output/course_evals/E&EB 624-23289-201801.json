This was truly one of the most informative courses I have ever taken. \r\n\r\nI liked how lectures were often set up in a point, counter point style. The lectures often addressed topics through debates (May modeled this, and perhaps this is why his assumptions were wrong). It helped reinforce the conversational nature of scientific publishing, and made the content of the course really interesting. \r\n\r\nI would have liked a different, more theoretically inclined textbook recommended at the beginning of the course to help me through the some of the mathematical models and mathematical approaches to the content covered in class. The textbook seemed too introductory for what we were actually talking about in class. "
