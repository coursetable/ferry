            "\u00a0I learned a lot of substantive information about Victorian literature. We mostly covered important themes in 19th-century English history, such as the reform of the franchise and the changing roles of women, and the ways those themes were treated in literature.\r\n\r\nProf. Markovits usually framed our discussions around a few key devices, such as agency, plot, and narrative style. I definitely expanded my understanding of the construction of a novel, but I don't think I improved my critical analysis skills more than I would have in any other English class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read much more carefully and considerately. I also learned to get through many many texts. I think my writing improved dramatically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to recognize the use of novelistic technologies in the novels examined during the course. I feel I have a better foundation of Victorian literature to build upon, and the issues and imageries examined in the class enhanced my close-reading abilities, as well as my ability to read symbols and figurations across both a single body of work and a larger genre of works. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Markovits's course was consistently challenging, and exposed me to ways of thinking about the novel form  its conventions and \"technologies,\" the way it's evolved over time, and how different Victorian authors manipulated it  that I had never before encountered. Before this course, I'd always felt much more comfortable writing about poetry and criticism than I had about novels, and I'm grateful to Prof. Markovits and the entire class for helping me develop a way of thinking about them that felt comprehensive and deeply rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to gaining a comprehensive understanding of the politics that defined the Victorian periodfrom industrial reform to socialist anarchyI learned how several technologies of the novel, most notably the Bildungsroman, function to serve the authors political purpose. ",
            "\u00a0I gained greater insight into the mechanisms of how the Victorian political novel operates and of the similarities and distinctions among some of the era's most prominent authors. ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly improved my close reading abilities. During each session, we would dive deep into individual passages and be asked to deconstruct the language of paragraphs, sentences, and sometimes, single words. Professor Markovits asked challenging questions to the class and enhanced my ability to decipher complicated passages. The course also expanded my understanding of the novel as a medium of literature. Professor Markovits often encouraged us to keep in mind the \"technologies of the novel\" as we interrogated passages. I now have an elevated understanding the \"novel\" as a form of writing.\r\nThis course also improved my argumentation skills. Professor Markovits encouraged students to defend their claims. She would often push back against assertions from students and expect everyone to fight back. This push and pull positively impacted the seminar. \r\nThis course improved my discipline and work ethic. Professor Markovits assigned more reading than I have ever encountered at Yale. However, her high expectations challenged me to manage my time in more effective ways.\r\nThis course improved my writing skills. Professor Markovits wrote meaningful and instructive comments on essays. I plan to keep her notes in mind for future writing assignments. She was also always willing to chat during office hours and I am very thankful for the insights she shared with me during one-on-one meetings.\r\nFinally, and most importantly, I learned a lot about Victorian political novels! It seems silly to say, but this course definitely delivers on its mission. I feel like I have a clear grasp of how the Victorian novel treats the world of politics and action. As someone who plans on pursuing a career in public service, this class has also impacted the way I view political action and has informed my definition of public service.\r\nIn short, this class was rigorous, challenging, and incredibly rewarding.

            "\u00a0The greatest two strengths of this class were Professor Markovits and the readings. Professor Markovits is so knowledgeable about the books and genuinely entertains theories about the readings brought up in class. The books are of course wonderful reads, although they are long. The greatest weakness, though, was that the class size was way too big to be an effective seminar. As someone who is more introverted, I found it very difficult to speak in class  because there was just so much \"competition\" to speak. ",
            "\u00a0The course attempts to cover six novels in one semester, which means about four classes per book on average. As a result of this framework, students faced rather difficult reading assignments each week (sometimes around 200 pages for a Wednesday class, in addition to secondary sources). I think it makes sense to remove one or two novels from the syllabus in order to dive deeper into the texts. With fewer novels and shorter reading assignments, we could have covered more material in each. We also would have had better class discussions, as many times throughout the semester it was obvious that some students hadn't done the reading and thus couldn't make helpful contributions. Middlemarch in particular stands out as a novel that is extremely long and not very political. It's a great book, but I'm not sure if its inclusion in the syllabus helped the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Markovits is a wonderful professor and it was so enjoyable and interesting to read so much Victorian literature and engage with it on such a high level. I found the reading to be very heavy and sometimes struggled to fully keep up lesson to lesson. However, the level of discussion and analysis was better than any other English class I have been in. ",
            "\u00a0I can think of only strengths for this class-- the discussions were enlightening, and I felt I learned something new walking out of every seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The intensity of the reading load for this course was a definite strength; apart from DS freshman year, I've never felt pushed to get through so much material for a single class, and finishing up the course felt truly like an accomplishment. If I had to name a weakness, it would maybe be that the class size was rather large, and that sometimes meant that the same 3 or 4 people would do all or most of the talking; however, Prof. Markovits made sure that as many people got the chance to speak as possible, and discussion rarely flagged. ",
            "\u00a0This courses strength lies in both the reading assigned, and Professor Markovitss class preparation. Professor Markovits came to class every day prepared with an agenda of themes and passages to discuss, and was just as passionate talking about (potted) peas as she was discussing the terrorist plot at the heart of The Secret Agent. I feel like the only way the class could be improved is if at the beginning of each sub-topicRevolution and Riot, Reform, and Anarchystudents were given a little more detail of what was actually happening politically at the time each text was written. I felt as if we got fantastic context for A Tale of Two Cities, North and South and Middlemarch, but then I felt very lost during the first few readings for Phineas Finn and Princess Casamassima, and wanted a better understanding of both how British Parliament worked (rather than having the book explain to me how it worked) and the aims of the underground socialist movements happening towards the latter half of the 19th century, as Princess Casamassima puts the goals in (purposefully) vague terms. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that overall this course was very strong. I really enjoyed the works that we read and thought that Professor Markovits set a wonderful balance between guiding the conversation and enabling student voices. My one major suggestion would be to split the writing requirement over more papers such that there are at least 3-4 opportunities to write and get feedback. I make this suggestion as Professor Markovits sets high standards for grading, but, at the moment, it didn't feel like there were enough opportunities to get feedback and actually improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. The class improved my close reading abilities, argumentative skills, work ethic, and writing. Professor Markovits knows what she is doing and has thoughtfully designed a course that expanded my mind. The greatest strength of this course is Professor Markovits who breathed new life into novels from the 19th century. I never thought that I could be so excited to discuss Victorian literature. Because of this class, I plan on taking similar courses in the future.\r\nOne weakness of the course is the heavy workload. I would recommend reducing the number of pages due for each session. This is not because it took a large amount of time to prepare for class (though it certainly did). Rather, I found that the steep page requirement made it difficult to meaningfully engage in the seminar. I would step into the classroom juggling 200 or so pages of text and often had difficulty navigating all of those pages during discussions.  I would sometimes feel lost in a sea of passages that all swirled around in my head. Slightly reducing page requirements could alleviate this issue.\r\nAlso, I wish that we had one or two more writing assignments. I found it quite daunting to write a 12-14 page paper (which constituted a large chunk of the grade for the term) after having previously submitted only a short 5-7 page paper for Professor Markovits' consideration. This recommendation comes also out of selfishness. Professor Markovits leaves such strong comments that I wish I had more opportunities to receive her revisions. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to students who are prepared to do the readings for the class, and only if the class is small enough. ",
            "\u00a0I am a junior and no professor I have had at Yale has pushed me to become a better writer as much as she has. Take her up on her word if she offers to read your essay drafts before you submit them! This year I have finally found out how to properly format a bibliography, as well as learning valuable lessons on how to write introductions, how to spot inappropriate passive sentence structures, and how to make papers more logically coherent. You will probably do more work for Professor Markovits than for your other professors, but it's really worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are genuinely interested in the subject matter or who know that they will do hundreds of pages of reading each week. If you aren't interested in the topic and/or won't do most of the reading, you won't be able to do much in class. ",
            "\u00a0Take anything with Markovits she's brilliant! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Mainly because Professor Markovits is incredible. She is so clever and facilitates excellent discussions. She has high standards for her students and really helps them meet them. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course! The variety of readings kept the class lively and fun, and I have a new understanding of the historical context and the novelistic technologies employed in each book. I have to say, I was always excited when I woke up and remembered it was a Victorian Political Novel day. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if you have the slightest interest in the Victorian period, how literature can respond to political events, and/or just want another excuse to read Middlemarch, then I can't recommend this course highly enough. Prof. Markovits is a wonderful teacher, whose passion and erudition are palpable in every comment she makes; and what's more, she truly enjoys the experience of learning and discovering alongside her students, which makes the class consistently rewarding. If you're brave enough to tackle the reading load (and come on, you really should be able to handle it when the texts are this great) then TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0If you know going into the course that Victorian novels are your thing/youre not intimidated by the amount of reading youll have to do, then absolutely take this course. Professor Markovits is the definition of a dedicated instructor, whose detailed feedback on our written assignments was incredibly helpful for my writing. The syllabus is fantastic (and will finally give you an excuse to read A Tale of Two Cities, if you havent already), with the one exception being North and SouthIve now read that book twice, and I still cant force myself to like it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for the stimulating discussions and works that we read. However, I would also advise that grading is tougher (with fewer opportunities to gather feedback) than other English courses that I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course. The class greatly improved my abilities as a writer, thinker and reader. Professor Markovits is fantastic and has a way of making Victorian literature really exciting and intriguing. The course is difficult, though, and the class proves challenging both during bi-weekly sessions and at home. Professor Markovits leads very challenging seminar discussions that will force you to think about the literature you read in new ways. I always left class feeling like I had learned something new. The class also required a great deal of preparation. Professor Markovits assigns large chunks of reading for each meeting. However, if you're interested in studying English or simply intrigued by Victorian literature, you should definitely take this class. "
