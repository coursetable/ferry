I found at times it was difficult to find the through-line for the class, occasionally getting bogged down by the work of breaking down an entire book's structure and content each week. It would have been useful to come up with succinct summaries for each cultural historian we examined so that each approach to cultural history we observed was clear and easily compared from one cultural historian to the next.

This class provides a nice sampling of cultural histories for anyone who wishes to be introduced to these kinds of materials. "
