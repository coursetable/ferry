Also gained insight by looking at specific case studies, for example learning about why companies charge a membership fee or how insurance is necessarily bad value (although if the cost is prohibitive it could still be worth it). Learned a few miscellaneous skills like how to do calculations with different market structures and doing profit maximization using calculus, but I found these most interesting and useful when they were helping me gain a better understanding of the concepts, the calculations themselves feel next to useless.

            "\u00a0The core textbook was well written and I felt we covered all the necessary topics in a thorough and timely manner. No glaring weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Econ 110 with Tolga is an incredibly interesting and engaging class. The strengths of this course include its small class size, teaching style, and resources available. The capped enrollment allowed students to further clarify confusing material, and since most of the students got to know each other, study groups outside of class were common. Tolga's teaching style is one of a kind--he manages to make what could be a dry, dreaded introductory course into a fun one with his strange examples and jokes. It's very clear that he knows the material by heart. One of this course's most prominent strengths is the resources offered: Tolga held office hours every week and other undergraduates also held office hours weekly. If you were confused with a problem set or particular concept, there were many places you could go to for help. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were definitely a strength, as they allowed you to consolidate your knowledge of the material covered.\r\nThe seminar itself, however, was very large and not very engaging. The class often got distracted, and it was easy to lose focus.\r\nI think that there should be smaller seminars and perhaps regular in-class quizzes to keep everyone engaged, and avoid getting into the final without any sure knowledge of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Tolga is an amazing professor. He provides students many opportunities to succeed whether it be taking questions during class, hosting office hours, or posting lecture videos online for students to review. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the class can feel rushed at times because of the amount of material that must be covered. Sometimes much of class was spent on tangents. ",
            "\u00a0The instructing in the class was fantastic. Having a midterm and final which account for 80% of the grade is tough, because if someone has a bad day on one of those examinations, it can ruin their entire semester. I might have two midterms instead. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly straight-forward and is strong in this sense. However, the assigned readings in the class were tedious and dull; lecture was much more captivating and provided better explanation of concepts. While I understand that the textbook provides many in-real-life examples, they appeared increasingly as filler as concepts became much more uprooted in graphs and numbers. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar-style of this class was really helpful because you could ask questions as they came up, which really helped to consolidate learning on the spot. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very well organized and executed. The video lectures are a great tool, and Tolga makes sure he is always available if you need assistance. The problems and class topics were very interesting and relevant to modern day. We would always laugh in class, and Tolga made the environment very funny and welcoming. Weakness is definitely the strict curved grading system. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is an incredibly funny teacher, and he teaches a lot in the span of just a semester. That is both the strength and the weakness of the course: it goes by incredibly fast and sometimes it is difficult to grasp information as it generally lacks repetition. Although his stories are much appreciated and loved, sometimes it may be helpful to go over more example problems at the end of the class rather than a long anecdote. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the way in which examples are presented and the way all the course information is connected. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses I would say is more just the ambiance of the class. There is excessive worry about the curve, and grades, and exams. ",
            "\u00a0I like the seminar approach of this course. Tolga is an amazing teacher and definitely take ECON 110 with him if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Tolga is great - he's super engaging, makes jokes, and gets through all of the content. I enjoyed all the time I spent in class and I think I understood most if not all of the concepts when they were first explained.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the class can seem a little fast, but if you review a little, it's definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is a very fun guy who makes classes very lively and entertaining.\r\nHowever, we go through the material very quickly and not very thoroughly. Often, we are given formulas or graphs and we are not given an explanation of where these came from or how they were derived. I therefore felt like I only gained a superficial knowledge of microeconomics (which is probably all I should have expected from an intro class).\r\nPerformance is given a lot of importance and we were constantly reminded of the expectations to beat the curve. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: definitely Tolga! He's a really good professor and very patient and will repeat himself, and will answer all your questions in class. He also knows that economics and the long class time often leads to boredom/falling asleep, so he will crack jokes, tell anecdotes, or something else to liven up the class. He also breaks down the complexity of the book well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Tolga teaches really fast (you have to, in order to cover the entire textbook in one semester), and it's hard to keep up. Also, the concepts are difficult and if you don't already have an economic intuition, it may take a long time for you to understand fully (which is difficult as you only have a limited amount of time before the midterms/finals). \r\n\r\nImproved: not much you can do in terms of teaching/covering material. One suggestion is to hold more office hours/peer tutoring sessions that is dedicated solely to answering questions/explaining concepts/reteaching material for students who are a little unsure or don't understand in the fast-paced class. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the structure of the course regarding the assignment timeline and how new lessons were introduced. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was that it was interesting and related to a lot of real world situations. It was a small enough group that any questions could he answered. The class though, was fast paced and sometimes got extremely confusing with the graphs which were often unclear and messy. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is in the engaging teaching style that a seminar allows for and the way it forces attendance upon its students. In addition I liked how closely the course material stuck to the textbook material, as it was very easy to go to the textbook and review concepts I didn't understand in class. I also thought that the textbook we used was really good, some sections at the end were a bit in the weeds, but overall it was really good at explaining concepts and focusing on what was important. The weakness of the course is that is feels diffuse and disjointed. A lot of topics feel as if they're basically unrelated, maybe there's a loose connection, but it doesn't feel cumulative at all. Often felt as if I was developing an understanding of 17 different things rather than one continuous field. ",
            "\u00a0Better balance between the amount of content covered in the first half of the term and the second half of the term. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is generally an engaging lecturer more practice problems would be helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course had a decent teacher who loved teaching, but grading on the bell curve was cruel. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: \r\na lot of material to cover in a short time -- there need to be more ways that force students to review the material naturally from week to week -- optional examples and problems to review\r\nclass sometimes felt slow because it can get off topic\r\ntextbook is useless\r\nproblem sets sometimes had problems that we weren't taught how to solve\r\nStrengths: \r\nfun lectures thanks to Tolga\r\nfunny/interesting examples to really imprint the material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Koker makes learning econ genuinely fun! I hated micro in high school, but Tolga's anecdotes in class makes econ a lot more interesting and applicable to real life. OFFICE HOURS ARE AMAZING!!\r\nWeaknesses: I really can't think of any. I definitely wasn't the strongest student in this class, and I made a lot of mistakes, but I feel like I left the class with a pretty good understanding of microeconomics. "

        [
            "\u00a0Especially if they are considering studying in the social sciences (not just econ), but even if they aren't, this class is not too difficult and provides valuable insights into the field and into the way we live our lives. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any students particularly interested in economics. My friends in Econ 115 often complained of how miserable and confusing their class was, but I was learning the same material and actually looked forward to going to class. The seminar is harder in the sense that you will have to be more engaged in class, but it is completely worth it. This class with Tolga is interesting, fun, and engaging, and it's indubitably the best way to learn intro microeconomics at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, because it is a prerequisite to other courses, and the professor is very nice, but I do think that anyone who feels that they learn better in smaller classes, should make an effort to really stay on top of the material over the course of the semester and avoid going into the final without having self-taught all along on top of engaging in the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even for those not interested in economics the class is extremely accessible. It provides an important framework through which to understand the world. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if one is interested in economics-- and definitely over the large lecture class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're learning econ for the first time, I think this seminar would be a lot more helpful than the lecture class, because there is a lot of support in-class and in office hours. Intuition/genuine understanding about economics probably take much longer to develop, but as someone who just started out learning economics, the course was informative and clear, I could see these connections forming and so I think it does its job as an intro class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Tolga is a fantastic teacher and he really makes this class enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Out of all of the intro-microecon sections, Tolga's section is the best. In general, ECON is a necessary skill for everyone to know about as it trains you to think more logically. ",
            "\u00a0Depends on how passionate they feel about econ. Tolga is a good teacher and he can be entertaining. But the ambience of the class is a little overwhelming, specially for an intro class. It is not a lot of work though, so if a person is passionate about econ, or just wants to try it out, id recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are going to take microeconomics, take it with Tolga. ",
            "\u00a0If you have the opportunity to take this section of micro, do it without any hesitation. Tolga is a great person to know and his class will teach you much more than the basics of microeconomics, you might also learn a few life lessons or two. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend microecon for sure: it's an important foundational class for all college students.\r\nI would only recommend the seminar for two reasons: one, you want to make friends and have fun in class - two, you are only taking lectures and want to try a seminar class.\r\nHowever, I do think more hard-working people choose the seminar and that it is thus harder to beat the curve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great class for intro micro. You learn a lot and it is not too difficult. However, the curve can sometimes be harsh, but i nonetheless recommend taking the seminar (110) over the lecture (115). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely if you need to take microeconomics, or are interested in taking a basic economics class. It's much better than the lecture class in that aspect. However, don't fall asleep. Be engaged and eager to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The professor made the material very applicable to current issues in the world and made it easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly Tolga's section. The concepts covered are incredibly interesting; and the way the Tolga teaches them allows for personal connections to be made to the lessons, allowing for deeper and more valuable internalization. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very necessary to apply to other aspects of life. ",
            "\u00a0I would hesitantly recommend it. It's not going to expand your mind that much, but a basic understanding of how economists think is interesting. You also gain some practical understanding of how businesses maximize and how you can avoid scams and utility maximize in your own life. I got a bit of enjoyment from the class, but mainly I would recommend it because it's a pre-requisite for a lot of stuff and it is really not that difficult. If you read the textbook you should get an A-. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn economics, I would suggust starting here. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if that student was committed to studying a fair amount for this course. You have to actively review for this course week to week. You cannot just show up and expect to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Tolga's seminar beats the lecture every time (trust me I've tried to sit in lecture and I now have major respect for the kids that had to do that all semester). "
