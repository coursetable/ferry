            "\u00a0Strength: learn a lot by doing hands on experimentation. \r\nWeakness: large workload. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course focuses a lot on the theory of the techniques (why does blue/white staining turn blue? how does a His-Trap column work? why is an SDS-PAGE gel usually made with 2 segments? etc.) which is great for students who may already know how to do the technique but may not have a perfect understanding of the theory behind it. We also focus a little bit on the history of biochemistry, which is fun to learn about. You also get practice writing an actual science paper for publication.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: many. The theory behind the techniques is taught, but don't expect to actually be able to do any of these techniques in a lab. Every technique is done no more than once, and you oftentimes don't get to do the full thing (e.g. for PCR you don't get to add enzyme nor do you get to put it in the cycler or even learn how to use the cycler; you only mix the template and salts in 1 singular 200 ul tube). The weekly quizzes oftentimes contained oddly specific information from the lab handouts. The lab itself is pretty disorganized; the manual is only followed 50% of the time, and the other 50% you are basically just running around the lab getting yelled at. The worst part is the first lab report, which is about 25-30+ pages. You receive no guidance about how to do the level of advanced writing and analysis they want in the report, and most students also die writing it. It's a full publication-style paper with 3D analysis, p-values, figures, discussion and all; except you get a week to produce it and receive no guidance on how to do most of this writing. ",
            "\u00a0great class ",
            "\u00a0Well taught except lecturers ran a little long. The curriculum was well-designed as it covered the basics of biochem lab well. The lab reports should be divided into chunks as they became overwhelming closer to the deadline. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: Aruna Pawashe is a caring instructor that will try her best to explain a concept you don't understand. \r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a weak point in this course. Prof Konigberg is not engaging and sometimes the lectures seeemed like a waste of time. I would have preferred to have had the TA give lectures or for Aruna to do them. Also, organization in this course was nonexistent and it was a major point of frustration for myself and my peers. Sometimes, Aruna would be writing a procedure or explaining a concept on the board while we were in the middle of the experiment. Additionally, the manual was confusing at times because of poor wording, so the manual should be revised. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a decent job introducing various concepts and experiments that are commonly used in biochem laboratories, such as SDS-PAGE, protein purification, cloning, selection, etc. The layout of the course as a whole was well-organized and the lectures clarified the material in our lab handbooks. For weakness, the only main thing I'd say is that the handouts for each assignment (problem sets, labs, etc.) need to be more specific if they are going to be graded somewhat harshly. I think it's fair to pick at the lab reports with a bit of a fine-toothed comb, but the instructions in the lab manual were all over the place, and the sample report posted on Canvas raised more questions than it answered. I think a more concise sheet or rubric would allow students to generate great reports without wondering whether they are missing something. As for the problem sets, I think the expectations for each assignment need to be made clear. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that it teaches fundamental laboratory methods in biochemistry. However, this course needs clearer guidelines on what is expected for a lab report. There were problems in how assignments were graded that must be solved in order to fairly assess student performance in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot during the course. One way it could be improved is that for the first lab report, it would be helpful if we had to hand in certain sections in for comments before submitting the entire thing because some of us have never written a lab report before so it was too much to expect us to write one in one go.

            "\u00a0I would be very hesitant in recommending this course to another student. I took the course as an MB&B major with lab experience, but only with RNA. I figured I would learn something about proteins and move on. The course is fairly disorganized and does a bad job of providing you with lab skills (you do every technique half way and once at most). I think the theory and history of the techniques is taught well, though. The weekly quizzes are mostly okay, but sometimes contain pretty specific information so they can be tricky. The first lab report is the killer, though; 25+ pages of a full publication-style paper with no guidance whatsoever. The expectations of the first report are crazy: dozens of figures, statistical analysis, structural analysis, you need like 3 different softwares to even make half of the stuff, a lit. review, a full length discussion and more. The second report is more manageable but still difficult. If you're looking for a bio lab, I would only recommend this one if (1) you're okay with dying over writing a huge paper in the middle of the term and (2) aren't looking to gain actual biochem lab skills. ",
            "\u00a0a lot of work, but not distributed evenly \r\nfirst lab report is particularly time-consuming, rest of assignments were fine ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought this lab might be repetition of concepts in research lab but it's actually really helpful for solidifying basic concepts. Be careful with the lab reports though! ",
            "\u00a0I think that yes, I would recommend it with the appropriate caveats. It is a good introduction into biochemsitry lab settings, but I would warn them of the amount of work (especially for the 1st report)  the course demands. I would also warn them of the disorganization of the class. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this class to another student, unless that student were very experienced in a biochemistry lab setting and willing to slave away on lab reports. This course covers fascinating concepts in biochemistry, but it is challenging to the point of not being worth it. If you are inexperienced in the field or slow, you will suffer. ",
            "\u00a0This course seemed very scattered, and you don't learn all that much. We often got conflicting instructions in the lab from the manual and the professors, and the assignments were equally confusing. If you've worked in a research lab at any point the techniques will probably all be familiar to you. ",
            "\u00a0I actually would recommend this course because I learned a lot about biochemistry technique and concept in this course. "
