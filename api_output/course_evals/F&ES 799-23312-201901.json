            "\u00a0The course does well at examining the Sustainable Development goals from many different angles, by bringing in a new speaker each class to focus on one individual goal. This becomes a weakness when the speaker isnt as engaging or knows less about their assigned goal than others, but in general the format works really well. Its also fun to hear about everyones term projects at the end, as the class is so diverse  in terms of nationalities, subjects and approaches. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I enjoyed the diversity of lecturers who brought in new and different perspectives. I also really liked that the class focused less on theory and more on implementation (the focus of our paper as well as the fact that many of the speakers were practitioners). Finally, this was one of the very few courses at FES with a clear international focus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I can't think of anything. ",

I'd especially recommend at least trying to skim each reading, and try to ask at least one question of each speaker, as this helps you stay engaged. Also, go talk to Gordon in his office! He's great! ",
