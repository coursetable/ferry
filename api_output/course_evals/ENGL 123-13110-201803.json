            "\u00a0I really learned how to engage with writing and accept criticism. I know what makes a story, poem, or dramatic piece interesting for readers, and my love of writing has been renewed. ",
            "\u00a0How to read, analyze, and write fiction, poetry, and drama. How to cut down writing to its bare core, removing all unnecessary fluff. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, we learned to write short stories, plays, and poetry by analyzing the works of established writers and drafting our own works. Because our assignments were so open-ended (the final piece of each unit could be written about anything we wanted), I found that I was given the freedom to develop my own voice and writing style. As a result, I felt that I had not only improved my technical abilities by the end of the semester, but that I had also gained a better understanding of my identity as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about creative writing in three genres: fiction, poetry, and drama. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing for different genres, and gained valuable exposure to cool work and writers I hadn't encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of great writing feedback and a great challenge ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a lot more about what constituted tight writing in this course. That is, the elusive (to me, so far) quality in writing (creative or not) that makes it powerful, concise, and affecting. ",
            "\u00a0Drama, Short Stories, Poetry ",
            "\u00a0How to write in the styles of fiction, poetry, and drama by reading the work of other authors and writing our own creative exercises. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about poetry. I was introduced to stories, poems, and plays I hadn't read before. We heard from some famous writers (that was probably the best part). I was exposed to some of my classmates' writing, though I wish I could've read more of what people created. "

            "\u00a0I don't really think the course has any weaknesses; I love the lectures where we all come together and the seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging, a ton of fun, designed to make students better fiction writers. Lectures (two per unit, from esteemed Yale faculty or outside professionals) were always a lot of fun and helpful to see real writers at work. I really feel like I have improved as a writer, both in the quality of my work, and in my interest in that work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: no incremental grade points. A grade was assigned per unit, so while we received comments on every piece of writing, we only got 3 grades the entire semester. This may be a strength (because we were less focused on grades), but that's kind of up to you. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading and workshopping each others' writing was especially helpful, and I was exposed to some really great modern creative writing from the readings and visitors.\r\nWeakness: I would have liked some more guidance on different approaches to our own writing; I often felt lost as I tried to begin an assignment, ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that you are constantly practicing your writing in this class. One weakness was that there wasn't enough time to develop a draft before receiving a grade on it. I would have liked to receive feedback on drafts before receiving unit grades. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great, well-designed class. I like that we get to hear from experienced writers in our big group so much. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: writing is the core of the class, as promised, and the feedback and improvement is awesome!\r\nWeakness: unequal time dedicated to each persons workshop, entire books bought but only 1-2 chapters read. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated Professor Demings willingness to sit down with students so often. The times often didnt work for me, but he always worked to accommodate me in office hours, which I really appreciated. I thought that he was by far the greatest strength of this course. I tried another professor to begin with and felt much more at home in Professor Demings class, even the first day that I switched over. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt like the lectures. They felt a bit disassociated from the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a great job of creating a space that allowed students to explore their writing, even if they were non-english majors. The lectures at the beginning and end of each unit were helpful as well. The shift from different units seemed to come just as students were getting comfortable with it, but that's a side effect of having 3 creative mediums in one course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the major weakness was that most of the time we were supposed to just \"write,\" without really having any structure or guidelines to go on for how to write a poem, story etc. Especially since it's a non-application introductory class, having to write a short story without much structure or help from class was daunting. It felt like writing.something that the professor deemed worthy was based on chance or intuitive magic rather than the honing of specific, practicable skills. The strengths were getting to hear others' writing, although the discussion as a class wasn't always super productive - I wish our class time had been filled with specific tasks, instead of sometimes aimless comments. But especially towards the end of the class, I loved hearing the amazing words of others, and wish we could've done more of that. I wish we also could have more productively discussed the texts we read or at least had it explained what was relevant or important about them. The major strength of this course is that it will force a budding writer to actually be somewhat productive. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take it with Professor Deming if you can. If you are even a little bit interesting in creative writing, sign up, you won't regret it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend. If you have taken ENGL 120, this is similar, but just for fiction. If you want a fun writing class, want to try your hand at creative, go for it. This class requires absolutely no prior knowledge of creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0Taking it as someone who is a science major and doesn't write much, I thought it was a great way to develop hobby writing and engage with some interesting creative writing. However, I wish I had taken it Cr/D, since it is really difficult to compete with some of the great writers at Yale that are taking the course and I was constantly stressed about my grade. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but caution that it is in no way an easy class. You must be constantly working and thinking about the material. It is a class for people who are truly interested in pursuing creative writing at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. This is a wonderful course. You learn a lot, put together a diverse portfolio to help you apply to other classes, and work closely with wonderful professors (who are also a great resource in terms of future classes). The class is lots of fun, and really not that much reading or work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but only if youre super interested in creative writing. Dont bother if you dont enjoy creative writing ",
            "\u00a0Yes- even if they are a non English major. If you are interested in writing, then this course really allows you to explore and try out different creative mediums. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure what other creative writing classes or their applications are like, but I think it'd be best to take another, more focused creative writing class, that, with its specificity, could possibly include more helpful instructions and structures instead of grazing the surface of writing. I just sort of regret this class - but if you really, really want to write all three genres, then maybe consider it. "
