            "\u00a0I learned to pay more attention to the language of historians and political theorists. Thinking about their writing itself can be helpful in understanding their arguments. I also gained a good survey knowledge of more recent thinkers, and encountered a few I wish to keep reading myself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to reason critically and write about works pertaining to political and historical theory. I also learned how to closely engage with texts. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved, and I was able to read and learn about many influential thinkers. The chronological structure of the course enabled me to consider changes in thinking over time, and the relevance of texts to the present was often apparent. ",
            "\u00a0I evaluated different and opposing ideas about the role of government, how people should interact with it, and how it should be organized. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read political thought critically and worked on tying the texts together. ",

            "\u00a0The course load for the spring H and P section was lighter than the fall, and as such, more manageable. It is an excellent survey. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the class discussions we had. They were always really insightful and informative. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest challenge in DS is always the limited amount of time to discuss each text, but the combination of lectures and seminars enabled us to engage with each thinker. I also enjoyed the variety of authors we read. ",
            "\u00a0Spring semester of DS H&P really isn't much history at all. It's a slew of political theory and that's fine, but students who come in expecting even as much history as the meagre amount first semester had will be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Of all the DS courses, the reading list for HP was the least cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bromwich really pushes you to think. He encourages everyone to participate in class discussions and will work with you on your writing individually. The pace of the course, as with much of Directed Studies, is quite quick, meaning that we only usually get to look at small portions of long texts. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus promotes an understanding of the dialogue between political thinkers. It is at times a little scattered. For example, Nietzsche seemed out of place in H+P. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the second semester of H&P was a lot more interesting because the writers that we were reading discussed common concerns and the different texts often responded to each other. "

            "\u00a0Yes  its part of DS, and DS is valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I loved Professor Bromwich and his section was one of my favorites in Directed. Studies. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who is interested in getting a sense of the foundational ideas and contentions in western political thought. I found the lectures and seminars very helpful in clarifying my ideas about the text and in gaining a better general understanding of a writer's key concerns and beliefs. "
