            "\u00a0Gained background knowledge in debates in, and approaches to, U.S Cultural History. Gained pedagogical skills such as building a syllabus and facilitating class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Speed reading comprehension, how to break down the mechanics of a book, how to engage with colleagues over books I had not read, and so many more things I cannot even begin to type. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insights and knowledge into methods in cultural history and approaches to American Studies. I also gained skills in how to approach reading a book and effective and efficient note taking and critique. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about culture in a variety of ways. I learned about the diverse processes of researching, constructing and writing a book. ",
            "\u00a0State of the field, trends, major books/scholars I should know. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything, I learned form. And I learned he work it takes to do cultural history. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to developing my understanding of the field of American Studies, this course motivated me to think more critically about my own research, and about the writing process in general. By examining works by authors from multiple disciplines, I gained exposure to various methods, such as oral history and visual studies. This course pushed me to consider a book's organization more than ever before and specifically developed my ability to read a book for an argument and synthesize the content in a concise way. While I will take away all of these practical skills, I also feel very grateful for the opportunity to have worked alongside such an incredible cohort of scholars. Engaging with them every week was a joy. The great reading selection on the syllabus only further facilitated the great class dynamic. ",
            "\u00a0A broad understanding of the various methods and practices of scholars of cultural history, and an understanding of the history of the field and its main concerns and questions. I learned how to read effectively and think critically about cultural history scholarship, and the different methodologies that cultural historians use. "

            "\u00a0No weaknesses. At times, I wish we had engaged more contemporary cultural history texts. Fields such as queer studies were not always reflected on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a lesson in supreme grad seminar pedagogy. Not a single thing could or should be changed. By far, one of the most incredible courses I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposure to a range of scholarship and approaches.\r\nWeaknesses: At times it felt that we only had time to summarize the various different books that we read, and by the time we got to the meaty questions, we were out of time. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the syllabus was very rich; variety of perspectives was stimulating for discussion. \r\n\r\nweaknesses: for only one week did the conversation reach a lull due to divergent topics ",
            "\u00a0I loved the way the course was organized. There was both freedom and structure in its organization. In addition to the content of the syllabus, the class discussions were something I looked forward to every week. I also enjoyed hearing each individual's primary source presentation. Although I enjoyed the choice to read alternative readings and understand its purpose, some weeks, the discussion sometimes felt a bit disjointed when there were more than three or four books on the table. Maybe by offering fewer choices, the conversation could become more cohesive. Other than that, perhaps the other weakness was that it wasn't long enough! The strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great overview of work in the field, exposure to many different topics and methods, opportunity to chose books in the second half of class was really helpful for being able to build a personal reading list and also learn from peers, discussion was always lively and interesting, I thought the strategy of having someone to introduce the reading and an artifact each class worked really well. Also the critical journals were so helpful in thinking about how to strategically and effectively read, and they are a process that I will definitely continue to use. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt like the class was a little too large to have a really good discussion, sometimes discussion seemed to get bogged down on one very specific facet of the work "
