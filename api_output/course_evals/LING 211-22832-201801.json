            "\u00a0I gained a broader understanding of dialects, how to define them, how they change, and how the country as a whole views them.  I built upon previous linguistic analysis skills and also developed a new area of knowledge, which is social linguistics.  All in all, I have an increased awareness of the social impact of speech in the United States and I can confidently pinpoint where someone is from in the United States based on a few questions about their idiolect. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of linguistic terminology and concepts, and a great deal of information about diversity within American English ",
            "\u00a0As someone who'd never taken a linguistics class before, I learned a lot about how language works that I'm now really glad I know. This class really taught me so much, and it also lets you explore your own fields of interest. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers multiple faces of Linguistics from the perspective of diversity in American English. We learned about many morphosyntactic features in English that are considered to be non-standard. These were typical of different varieties of American English, such as African American English, Appalachian English, and Southern English. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various grammatical systems in the United States. I also gained skills in linguistic research, reading primary literature, and experimental design. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was the freedom each student had to pursue their specific interest within the realm of grammatical diversity.  As a linguistics major, I would have loved to dive into a bit more of the mechanical workings of the dialect variation, like the syntactic parameters or the phonetics of dialects.  Nonetheless, I got a lot out of this class and had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are a professor who both gives excellent lectures and does a fantastic job leading class discussions, incredibly interesting subject matter, the opportunity to explore one's own interests in addition to the course topics, and assignments that are interesting and engaging but not unnecessarily time consuming. This course covers the subject matter in great depth, but it is still accessible and intriguing to someone without any background knowledge.\r\nThere were no real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a really well-conducted course, with a lot of room for what the students are specifically interested in. A bit more advance planning would have been nice (ie knowing the syllabus more than a week ahead of time) but I see how that's a double-edged sword. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! It was extremely flexible and adapted to the interests of the students. There were many opportunities for students to learn from each other since two big projects involved a personal journal project and the final project. Both of these allowed students to explore on their own while digesting the information taught in class. By sharing these projecting with each other, students were able to learn about a very wide variety of topics. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the size of this course. It felt small and personal, and it was easy to have class discussions in which everyone participated. I also liked the relatively casual format of the course. The instructors provided plenty of feedback and were very open to discussion. Assignments were adaptable, and if we wanted to study a particular subject, they adapted the readings to this. All of the content was very interesting and the workload was manageable. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend that people interested in language, social linguistics, or anything surrounding speech in the United States take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to anyone with even a minor interest in grammar, lexicon, etc. There are a good number of assignments, but they are all incredibly rewarding and worthwhile. The effort I put into this class was always worth it. It was incredibly satisfying to my own curiosity, and I gained a great deal of knowledge and insight from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you've never taken a linguistics class before (which I hadn't) - if you're interested in language you'll catch on. This course does a really good job of covering a diversity of aspects within its pretty broad topic, and it also lets you delve into your own research projects. I learned so much from this class that I'm glad I know. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who has an interest in linguistics. I think a class like this is much more interesting than an introductory linguistics class. This class does not require any prior knowledge about linguistics, but it also does not hurt if you have some. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course if you're interested in language variation, sociolinguistics (how language relates to society and social issues), or even if you've just wondered why different groups of people speak in certain ways. This course opened my mind to linguistic diversity and put in perspective the grammar that I learned in high school. We learned how systematic and rule-governed other English dialects are, and I could feel a lot of my linguistic prejudice evaporating as I went through the course. The final project was a good opportunity to really delve into a particular subject that interested you (there is a lot of flexibility in the topic choice!). The project felt like a very manageable size, there were checkpoints along the way, and Raffaella and Sean (as well as all the other wonderful people in the linguistics department) were always available to help and provide guidance. This course is a mix of small lectures and class discussions. There are a few readings each week, and they are very interesting and not overwhelming. There is a lot of discussion of particular linguistic phenomena, and this course can get slightly technical at times, in terms of discussing particular grammar points and sentence structure. However, there is no exam or anything that holds you accountable for a lot of really complicated grammar, so it's okay if you don't understand all of the technical details. Just be aware that in addition to the discussion of social context and the general idea behind grammatical phenomena, you will go into depth on, say, whether this type of phrase can occur after a noun phrase, or only after adjectives. You'll talk about the difference between tense and aspect, what it means for a word to be present but \"null,\" and many other linguistic concepts. I had taken intro linguistics before this class, and I found it helpful but not necessary. Many other students had no previous experience with linguistics, and I don't think they had too much trouble with the course content. "
