I definitely think that this course greatly increased my knowledge in math, but it also helped to develop my problem solving skills. This class was definitely one of the most challenging courses that I have ever taken, but I do believe that it helped me develop better study habits. Through this course, I learned the importance of studying far in advance, doing practice problems in order to make sure that I fully understand the concepts and the material, and making sure that I understand the material right after I learn it, rather than waiting until a few days before exams to learn everything. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of how to perform mathematical operations (especially calculus) in 3-Dimensional space. With that, I learned more about how to use calculus with functions of more than one variable. ",

Speaking bluntly, the professors teaching this course are generally very poorly regarded and I see why after witnessing a few of the review sessions in action. ",

            "\u00a0The course was definitely difficult, but Prof Sudesh Kalyanswamy did a fantastic job of teaching the class. I think the class should have more class time, because it often felt like we were speeding through the material. ",
            "\u00a0While the course moves at a quick rate, it has been finely tuned such that it is taught in manageable chunks. The biggest weakness of this course is sometimes conceptual understanding is given less emphasis than calculations (even though Sudesh is probably the best for the conceptual side). ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly well-taught and very interesting. However, because of the course's fast pace, at times we could not delve into conceptual explanations for the new material we had just learn. This made it more difficult to grasp each new concept. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that there were a lot of opportunities to get my questions answered. Weakness was that the tests marked down too many points for silly mistakes, like computational errors. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course was poorly organized and moved at too fast of a pace for a student like me that has never seen multivariable calculus before taking this course. I think that this course is designed in a way that is not conducive to effectively teaching all of the material to people who have never been exposed to the material prior to taking this particular course. I definitely felt like I was at a severe disadvantage in the course because I was in the small minority of students that have never taken or been exposed to multivariable calculus in high school, and I do not think that the current format of the course is helpful in making students like me feel like they are able to handle the material in the same manner as students who have taken multivariable calculus before. I think that the course, or at least many of the lessons in the beginning that teach more of the basic concepts in multivariable calculus, should be redesigned in order to really teach the concepts from a basic, fundamental level rather than assuming that all students understand every concept being presented. Due to the fact that this class is dominated by students who have experience with multivariable calculus, I also felt an extra element of stress because I felt significantly disadvantaged and I felt the need to work so much harder than everyone else just to reach the same level of understanding. I think that the course needs to be re-evaluated and redesigned in a way that makes every student feel like they can succeed equally, without adding stress onto the students with little to no knowledge of the material beforehand.\r\n\r\nI think, at least in the case of my particular section, that it was very helpful that there were many problems given in class and in the form of worksheets in order to make sure that we understood how to implement the concepts of the material into problems that we would see in our problem sets and on our exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- small class and Sudesh's teaching methods created a clear, easy to understand course.\r\n\r\nWeakness- lack of review. It would've been nice to have a cumulative review going along the entire time. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that the high amount of problems that you do in it generally prepares you very well for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think that having so many different sections and professors makes it harder on the students, especially with professors that are new to the university. ",
            "\u00a0Strength and weakness: much material\r\nMuch too learn, real-life applications\r\nCannot fall behind ",
            "\u00a0I think the structure of this course is so well thought out. It makes the focus of the calculus less about memorization and more about decisions and options, through the use of multiple theorems that either increase or decrease the dimensions of each problem. ",
            "\u00a0Strong: lots of content\r\nWeak: fast-paced; I would recommend improving peer tutoring system ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the amount of resources offered to students throughout and especially before each test. A weakness was the low number of opportunities to prove one's knowledge of the material. The course could be improved with weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Prepare more for the multiple choice/true false questions ",
            "\u00a0We move very very quickly. It seems like some of the material that we cover (limits for example) has almost nothing to do with anything else and is there to make the class more difficult. Perhaps get rid of that stuff, spend more time on the big theorems and helping us get a better conceptual understanding of the material. Having said that, we do learn a lot (which I think is a great thing). ",
            "\u00a0The course content was good, as were resources for students. For my Tuesday/Thursday class, however, I often forgot material over the weekend. I wish there had been more of explicit connections between topics, otherwise everything was great. "

            "\u00a0Take it if you love math ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class only if you need to take it. Take it with Prof Sudesh Kalyanswamy!!! He is an incredible professor and does a really good job of teaching the material super clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is a good transition from intro calculus into more complex math. It has a lot of applications in different fields (even though this course doesn't ever really look at applications). I especially recommend it with Sudesh. He goes out of his way to explain the concepts and is super helpful (hosting extra review sessions, writing extra practice problems, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is very interested in math. The course is fascinating, but very difficult. It is also incredibly well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0I think math 120 is very computation heavy. I think it's a good course to take if you just took calc bc and are looking for something similar to it. If you're not an engineering major, I'm not sure how applicable the material is. Overall, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Frankly, with the way the course is designed right now, I would not recommend this course to another student unless they have significant exposure and experience with multivariable calculus. This class caused so much of my academically related stress this semester, particularly because I felt like I had to work so much harder than the majority of my classmates in order to achieve the same level of understanding of the material, and I would not want other students to experience that. I had an overall poor experience with how the course taught the material, and unless someone has taken multivariable calculus prior to taking this course, I would not recommend this course because the format is not conducive to students with limited to no exposure and experience with the material. I would only recommend this course to someone if they would have Sudesh as their instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students, though I would only recommend it with two caveats:\r\n\r\n1. I think one's experience in taking this course is highly dependent on how interested one can make themselves in the course material (i.e., I'd hope that they're able to see how what they're learning will help them, if they're aren't interested in the material itself).\r\n\r\n2. Shopping multiple sections for this course is essential; from what I've heard, the ability of the instructor makes or breaks Math 120. It's also, potentially, an easy course to teach badly. Having the student ensure that the instructor works for them is crucial. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend all students to take this class, as I believe math proficiency of this level is a valuable skill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would. This course was for me a \"rite of passage\", and it was a great time overall. Now that I took Math 120, I have the standard set of calculus skills that most people would need, and it opens up the possibility for lots of other majors. ",
            "\u00a0I took AP Calc BC senior year in high school. This might be unique to my high school teacher, but I thought the pace was reasonable to slow and had a solid grasp on the material. Math 120, compared to my BC class, was faster pace and harder. If you think that you could have been challenged some more in high school, you should have no fear going into this class. Even if you find yourself struggling, there are plenty of resourced to get back on track. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because while it relied heavily on student engagement with the material, and having a good professor, the material was not unmanageable. ",
            "\u00a0Foundations for real-world applications ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that the conceptual and technical challenge would be engaging for any student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a valuable way of learning how math works in college, and the teaching was good. The topics were interesting and useful. Sudesh was an amazing instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it's not as bad or hard as everyone says. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a tough course, but you ultimately come out of it a better thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it gave me a good conceptual background in math so now I can better apply it. "
