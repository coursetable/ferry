However, this class was actually pretty interesting, beyond just fulfilling a distributional requirement. As the name suggests, you learn about how the media influences the trajectory of medicine, covering topics like health heroes (doctors/scientists as heroes), health as a social issue, stigmatization/destigmatization of various diseases, national healthcare, and mental health from the 1880s to the present. It was honestly a pretty engaging course; the lectures are pretty interesting (and important to attend for the notes). You don't really have to do the readings to do well.

This class reinforces the broad American historical timeline since the 1870s, and connects major events to the way the media decided to engage the public and portray the  medical discoveries/establishment. The professors stress the effects of different media tactics, especially, the inadvertent spread of stigma. Professor Berland, a doctor, makes comments on practices that doctors should use with respect to the media.

            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting for a class with very little workload. There could definitely have been more guidance on the final paper, as there wasn't even a rubric, and all of the requirements were inconsistent across the different TAs. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting as are most of the readings. The lectures were split between two professors with a couple of guest lectures. It's sometimes difficult to stay engaged during lecture, but overall the lectures were interesting. The professors had visual images onscreen as well as video clips which helped to break up the talking. I didn't always find section exceptionally useful since we just rehashed what we learned in class and in the readings, but overall I found the class interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I found the material itself very engaging, as well as the readings (though sometimes the readings were a bit long). I enjoyed having guest lecturers give perspectives from their own areas of study as well. I think the exams are fair and the paper wasn't long. I found the paper fun because it gave me a lot of range to pick a topic that interested me. My TA in particular was great at helping me engage with the material and asking thought provoking questions that, I felt, helped me see how the topics week to week connected with each other. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the lectures should be posted online alongside key IDs (people, groups, events, etc.) because the lecturers all talk quite quickly and it's hard to keep up. I do wish there was some kind of prompt for the paper. It's fun to pick your own topic, but it's hard if there are literally no instructions besides your topic having some relation to the interplay between media and medicine. ",

            "\u00a0I think the course is well organised and the content is very interesting. However, I would have prefered a more international perspective as a lot of the issues discussed were very relevant all over the world and I think this course could benefit greatly from a more global perspective. Additionally, there was very poor communication to students about what was expected on the midterm, and even worse for the final paper. I received no information until days before the paper was due and am still unsure as to whether or not I did it correctly. Additionally, there was next to no consistency between TFs with regards to the paper (the aim of the paper, structure, content, length, formatting), which caused a lot of confusion among students. ",
            "\u00a0lectures were really interesting, although it was sometimes hard to follow with all that was packed into them such that the points being made were obscured. Also, while the lectures were good it sometimes felt as though the professors were just reading essays to us ",
            "\u00a0The class did a great job of delving into some very tough issues, but I hope that the class could include some info on Indigenous/Tribal healthcare. There was barely any mention of this, and I think a knowledge of Indigenous healthcare is essential to understanding US History in general. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it can give the international students the brief overview of the American history. The most fatal flaw/weakness of this class is that the grading is very not consistent among the class. What I mean is, your grade is very dependent on who you are assigned to (TA). This really needs to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely interesting topics that came me engaged throughout the whole lecture ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: It's a gut\r\nWeaknesses: TAs, classmates, it's an HSHM course. The TAs miss the mark by assuming that people in the section actually have any interest in the course. We see you, members of various Yale Athletes, making the trek to Davies and then to section. We know y'all are not really that interested in the material, rather you know (like everyone else) that the class is a gut. ",
            "\u00a0Miserable lecture. Room was hot and felt like there was no engagement. Shaded the awesome material and knowledge from the professors. TA's were fantastic and learned more in 50 minutes of section than I did in 100 minutes of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very interesting and I learned a lot. I definitely recommend it.\r\nHowever, there were some problems with the way the course handled disability and disability rights, for example using person-first language (person with a disability) rather than identity-first language (disabled person) as most disabled people prefer. There were also a lot of missed opportunities to cover the ways disabled people advocate for themselves, rather than focusing on problematic family members (such as Jenny McCarthy, who uses harmful ableist language about her autistic son). A course like this is a perfect opportunity to introduce students to basic disability politics, so it's quite disappointing that the professors didn't take that opportunity.\r\nOne of the midterm questions was poorly phrased, and my TF brought up in section that some people had gotten low grades because they hadn't answered it about two different themes. In that case, it was a problem with the question, and we should not have had our grades lowered, especially since it was a widespread enough problem that my TF had to bring it up. If the question was written well I would have answered it the way the instructors wanted. ",
            "\u00a0The course is super engaging without being too much work. Section and readings supplemented the lecture material well. It is tough that they don't post the lecture slides because it can be hard to study for the final and midterm unless you take really good notes throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the lectures were boring. The readings were heavy, and often not very helpful. Sections were the the only opportunity to actively engage with the material. Your grade was composed entirely of a very few number of assignments that was pretty stressful. However, the material was very interesting, and I learned a lot about media and medicine in modern America. ",
            "\u00a0I think the greatest strength is the size of the class. Opportunty for tons of different opinions. Course materials are strong ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super interesting and engaging, not a lot of work, the lectures were taught by theme (instead of chronologically) so it made it easy to study for the midterm/final\r\nweakness: bouncing between two professors was a little annoying. I think it's easier to fully engage in the class when you have a connection with one professor ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught, but lectures are pretty dry. It was helpful that many of the readings were covered in class, and section was also a good way to discuss these readings. ",

There were lectures that, though interesting, felt unnecessary and distracting to the rest of the course material. The class jumps around so much chronologically in a way that feels unnecessary. I feel like this class has so much potential to be so interesting and engaging but lacks an overarching coherent narrative and message that ties all of the lectures together and thus makes the class stronger.

The problem is there is almost no reason to really engage with the material on a deep level. The weekly reading responses are very easy to do with only reading a couple pages of 2-3 reading, and many people get by fine without attending lecture regularly. Obviously we should be personally motivated to engage with the material, but realistically, Yale students will always prioritize more demanding classes. ",

Archival footage and well-prepared lectures come together to create unique narratives--lectures are presented more like a flowing story than a compilation of facts. Both lecturers and the TAs are knowledgeable and lead insightful discourses. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course were more technical. The lack of guidance ahead of assignments and feedback after essays/examinations proved to be a consistent sticking point. At a certain point, this began to cloud the enjoyable lectures because I felt like I wasn't being taught how to integrate evidence from lectures into successful essays. ",

In addition, it was not clear exactly what we needed to know/memorize from lecture; after having taken the course, I realized that I could have done well in the course without going to lecture or discussion section at all - only a quick overview of important events in media/medicine history and a skim of readings would have been required to take both midterms and write a strong paper.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone! You don't need a strong background in medicine to enjoy this course and you learn so much about present day and past media campaigns, advertisements, drugs, movies, etc. The lectures are interesting - you will want to talk about them with your friends! ",
            "\u00a0Highly highly recommend. It's one of those beautiful courses at Yale (Bioethics and Law is another one) where I felt like I had learned so much material that is a) actually relevant and useful in future endeavors and just as a member of society b) that I will retain after the course, AND I didn't have to put in too much work in order to acquire all that knowledge (the class just has one paper and a couple tests). Incredible fifth class, incredible class in general. Also probably a good one to Credit D because the lectures are great and there's not much work. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great 5th class to take. The class covers the role of media in health movements beginning in the 1870s. This class reinforces the broad American historical timeline since the 1870s, and connects major events to the way the media decided to engage the public and portray the  medical discoveries/establishment. In particular, you discover how the use of media led to the perceived rise and fall of the glorification of the medical profession. The workload is super easy and includes weekly reading response (super short), midterm, final essay, and a final. The lectures and readings are super engaging. GO TO CLASS, because the slides don't really describe what was said in class. Overall low stress, enjoyable, and a lot of fun, general knowledge material.  For me, I enjoyed learning about what media campaigns were well received and effective, and which ones had inadvertent negative effects. It also forced me to question TV shows that I was previously a fan of, such as the Biggest Loser, that are pretty detrimental in spreading negative stigma about obesity. Recommend if looking for a fun, easy humanities. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture material for the course was really interesting -- i'd encourage you to go to class. Your experience with the course can vary based on your section, so try to choose a TA you vibe with. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I loved every part of this class. It was relatively easy to do well in, the topics were engaging, and I felt there was a whole other part of American history I would've missed out on had I not taken this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as it does a great job of pushing one out of their comfort zone regarding what they thought they knew about medicine and the medical field in general. The course can also be very eye-opening for some who may not have heard of some of the material that is covered in the course. ",

            "\u00a0This is a great 3rd, 4th, or 5th course. You can't just show up to the midterm and final without going to class because a large portion of the midterm and final was based on media images that are shown during lecture/section. The class is pretty straightforward and it's interesting. It's not the best class I've taken at Yale, but it's a great elective. ",

The media/ image analysis skills that I developed in this course will be useful in other courses at Yale, another reason I suggest that other students take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because its a good intro level course to see if youre acrually interested in the history of science and medicine. The requirements of the course arent too serious at all and the workload is not that high compared to other Yale courses. As a result, its a good course to survey the field. ",

I would recommend it to pretty much anyone as it's pretty relevant to our daily lives, and its good to be aware of how outside forces shape what we see and think. Both professors had pretty interesting lectures with lots of pictures and videos which was helpful in understanding the material. The workload wasn't bad, midterm final and paper, and the TAs work with you a lot in section to work through it. I did sort of feel like it was geared towards earlier classes, so taking it as a senior felt kind of easy (which can be good or bad). ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the role of media in reinforcing or weakening the authority and prestige of the medical profession through film, posters, political cartoons, and television advertisements. However, please take note that the claim of \"light reading\" in the class syllabus is very misleading, as there are two entire Tyco course packets full of close to 100 readings. They are all great, but be prepared to read on average 50-75 pages a week. ",
