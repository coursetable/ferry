            "\u00a0Idk if I learned anything tbh lol. Super disorganized course. But I memorized the whole strat tech dictionary for the exams so that's cool and also pretty useless. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of tradeoffs in how organizations are organized., nuclear deterrence, and the interaction between strategy, technology, and organization. ",
            "\u00a0learn how to think about national security/defense challenges using business concepts/frameworks ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a great big picture perspective on how technology drives change in society and must be considered when forming strategy for business and war. Professor Bracken is great at identifying problems, and the class was fantastic when he focused on modern-day business cases, technological developments, and emerging strategies. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to think like a CEO or high ranked government official in today's constantly changing strategic environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the upcoming challenges facing US national security and defense capabilities. We also touched on some frameworks for analyzing and tackling those challenges. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the defense industry "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Just looking at the syllabus before the first day of class, I could tell this course was going to be horribly disorganized. No clear unifying themes or theses. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material, constantly connected to present affairs and real-life examples. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: interesting subject, professor with a lot of experience in the field, very unique class\r\nweaknesses: lectures were sometimes repetitive, especially toward the end ",
            "\u00a0A fascinating topic that was never given its due in lecture. Lectures seemed to be a cursory glance at certain topics in the headlines without fulling tackling the underlying subjects in a comprehensive and methodical manner. Additionally, the grading and structure of the exams was problematic. Students receiving wide variations in scores based on similar responses to questions was frustrating and, in my opinion, not an effective way to test comprehension of the subjects taught in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers very interesting material. The lectures at the beginning of the year lacked clarity and direction. Perhaps a section could make the material more concretely understood throughout the year. The assessments are seemingly random and fail to capture what it seemed a lot of the big picture questions were. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers very cool material and the lectures were great. The only suggestion I have is to make the course more engaging so the students get more out of the material. Also, the tests in this course are ridiculous. Professor Bracken asks very specific questions with only one right answer so there is no BSing the answers. The average on the midterm was a 71 which is very unnecessary. Study hard for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I was there for the military aspects, so the business lessons dragged a bit, but it is an SOM class so I understand they have to be there. There was very little work which was nice, but that meant I fell off on the readings toward the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The MGMT students were not at all engaged with the class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Nah, if you take it for a grade you will freak out because the average midterm score was a 68 ( i think). If not, you will still be frustrated with how disjointed the course is. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in business, technology, strategy, war, or organizational structure, this is a fantastic course. Many of the topics combine technology with geopolitics and business. You either find this combination fascinating or really boring. Many connections are made to modern militaries, so it helps to have a general understanding of military affairs. The course morphs as it progresses to focus on nuclear escalation, the professor's specialty. I found the topic engaging, but many people may not so be warned it becomes a large part of the course later on. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Bracken is a brilliant strategic mind with a fascinating and diverse career. However, expect the lectures to be somewhat 'all over the place' and for the exams to be a 'gotcha' set of very specific questions that rely solely on rote memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly structured, no work, long and challenging readings. However, the insight that Professor Bracken has and the content of the class is unparalleled in any class I have taken at Yale. A must take (credit D it for sure though) for anyone interested in any part of business, national security, international relations, and technology. The class is not linear and the structure doesn't make sense. The tests are graded harshly so credit d it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. While some of the lectures seem tangential at times, Professor Bracken has a ton of knowledge and delivers it from a new and interesting perspective that will change how you thing about strategy, business, technology, and how governments use and develop each of those. The one bad thing is that the assessments ask for seemingly random, one-word answers. The subject matter, however, is really interesting. It seemed like Bracken's insights were often a month to weeks ahead of major news stories on the same subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the current strategic environment and problems facing many policy makers. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in how rising tech will influence war fighting and national security relationships. You don't need to have any specialized or advanced knowledge going in, but it can be helpful especially for the business aspects. ",
            "\u00a0I'd take it if you are interested in the material. But the exams are brutally specific, and there is no feedback. "
