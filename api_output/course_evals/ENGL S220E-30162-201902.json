            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about the poetry of John Milton and related works. ",
            "\u00a0Prior to this course I had only a very basic familiarity with Milton and Paradise Lost, but my appreciation for the writer and his work has increased tenfold. Furthermore, the writing requirements for this course significantly honed my skills in both general scholarship and rhetoric. An exceptional course taught quite perfectly, especially given the eight week limitation. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to improve my critical reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to navigate doing work from home and managing my time. "

            "\u00a0The teacher was incredibly dynamic and engaged. I really enjoyed the structure of the class and thought that two weekly sessions online were perfect. The workload was not excessive, which really allowed me to delve into each homework assignment because I did not feel overwhelmed. At the same time, I was challenged in a good way with the confusing poetry! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: guided reading, very intense and well-structured weekly discussions via zoom, and superior knowledge of the two instructors.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think the course would benefit from an additional two weeks of instruction. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was well-structured and engaging (despite that it took on the challenge of being conducted online). The discussions in this course were very interesting and invited a wide variety of thoughts regarding the reading material. "

            "\u00a0Yes 100% ! It was enjoyable and I learned a lot, and even fulfilled a WR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  The text changed my life and Rogers is an outstanding teacher.  Please, take this course ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely; and I say this especially for non-English majors. As a philosophy student, this course engaged me in no less a degree than my toughest philosophy courses. This course is a must for any dedicated liberal thinker or student of the Liberal Arts, regardless of major or concentration. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student because it introduces a wonderful selection of texts as well as comfortably encourage a deeper level of reflection on literature. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting, helps if youve already read paradise lost. Best part was the Golden Compass series ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, especially if Professor Rogers is teaching! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student in that it served as a challenging but reasonable online class. "
