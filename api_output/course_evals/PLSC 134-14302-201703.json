            "\u00a0I took a lot away from this course. I was able to study a variety of airpower theories and historical examples, and begin to develop a clear understanding of its advantages and disadvantages. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave an excellent overview of Airpower theories, as well as assessments of efficacy. ",
            "\u00a0You will develop very deep and specific knowledge about use of airpower since WWI. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course on the progression of both the action and theories of airpower. Essential for those interested in the political and military effects of the use of airpower. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I liked that we read both airpower theory and historical airpower cases. Professor Lyall was very engaging, and incorporated a nice mix of teaching and leading discussions into each class, given that much of the material was new for most students. I was very pleased with this course, both in terms of its breadth and depth, and don't have any suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of the course is Prof. Lyall who is a great academic. Because this is a course mainly looking into history, much of the material read is not at the cutting edge of social scientific research. Many of the readings are also rather unscientific theories of important military leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Plenty of productive discussion on the readings tied into current events. Weakness could be a relatively limited historical scope. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course that was able to do a complete overview of a fairly narrow subject.  The reading was for the most part very interesting and relevant to the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible. I wish the commentary and engagement with more modern parts of airpower would have had more time "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It was an excellent introduction to, and analysis of, both airpower theory and historical airpower cases. Professor Lyall was very engaging, and incorporated a nice mix of teaching and leading discussions into each class, given that much of the material was new for most students. I was very pleased with this course, both in terms of its breadth and depth, and don't have any suggestions for improvement. The assignments were weekly reading and section participation, a ~10 page midterm paper, and a ~12 page final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. There are not enough courses at Yale that look closely at military strategy, both US and foreign. This course takes steps in the right direction to fill that void. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it. A necessary step for Yale to begin teaching military related courses. Professor Lyall did a phenomenal job with combining the theories with what was actually happening in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who has a deep interest in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class. Great professor and great material. Not a ton of work and an in depth teaching of the entire history of air power and air power theory ",
            "\u00a0Solid course, take the class to learn from Lyall ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely.  It is a fairly niche topic, however so I would only take it if you have a strong interest in airpower.  Professor lyall is fantastic and runs a great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to have a really strong course on the military and political implications of airpower, this is it. Lyall is a brilliant professor as well and a great mentor. ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoy learning about military effectiveness, specifically the through airpower, this is a great course for you! Professor Lyall is great and I enjoyed waking up early for this lass. "
