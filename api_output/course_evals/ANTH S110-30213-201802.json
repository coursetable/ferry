            "\u00a0The whole course is a multi-flavored pie of cultural-linguistic anth in general. Everybody can find something they are found of. \r\nThe key methodology are Semiotics, Social status-role, ontology(basic)-inference relations, which are all elaborated and instanced.\r\nProfessor also showed us the whole development path of anth in the past 50 years from classic ethnographies to modern, unusual sites that might trick you into a research, as well as abstract notions that are disclosed through research and the ontology of such research (or the enclosure process of the researcher, after all anth is a subject with high self-awareness). ",
            "\u00a0Never before have I viewed the world as complicated as I have before I took this class. The Sign-object-interpretant relationship is mind-blowing, and I am a different person for learning it. This course simply changes the way you view the world for the better. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new way of thinking about anthropology and I was able to apply the skills learned in class to daily observations. I learned more about and understood the relationships between everyday objects and their relation to different cultures. It was a class that opened my perspective to the world around me and as a result of this class, I am able to perceive the world in a different way with the skills about observation that I acquired through this class. ",
            "\u00a0sign, object, interpretant etc. semiotic terms ",
            "\u00a0Though this course is about anthropology, professor contained knowledge of economy, physics, semiotics and etc in his lecture. All in all, he taught me to think interdisciplinarly, to see the connection among seemly different subject and joint them to tackle the problem in human society. ",
            "\u00a0In the Introduction to Cultural Anthropology course, I learned a lot of anthropological concepts and ideas such as semiotic process, status-role relationship through a lot of deep reading and exploration of ethnography works written by famous anthropologists. This course widens my understanding of some commonly used daily words, such as culture. It allows me to catch the sign, object and other subtle yet important things in the world, building anew perspective to my observation of the daily world. ",
            "\u00a0There are four different divisions of the study of Anthropology. Choosing cultural Anthropology class could be one of my wise decision, because I learnt so much as a future undergrad of Humanities. \r\nFirst of all, knowledge.\r\nI learnt specific knowledge about ancient cultures, whenever and wherever these cultures originate and locate, they brought me beyond my own country, beyond the U.S. For instance, the belief in witchcraft of the Azande people, and the essential role of cattle in the culture of the Neur. Indeed, knowledge within text is closed connected with the ideology of the authors. In this course, I analyzed more than ten documents and studies the mindset of those writers, including our professor Mr. Kockelman, who wrote professionally regarding the concept of Anthropology. Specific term include semiotic background, indexicality and so on. His words and realistic examples assist our class to a passionate and interesting one.\r\nSecondly, skills.\r\nThe vision taken by anthropologist and me is the biggest obstacle that prevent me from becoming one of them (LOL). This course taught me to better understand some social phenomena around me, as well as better understand the actions of my intimate family members or friends. Its unnecessary to break things down into sign, interpretant, and object, but it will sometimes assist me to draw links and connections through figuring out the function of certain cultural mediums. Moreover, the proper way to write an academic essay with ethnographic examples is also what I learnt from our classes.\r\nFinally, insights.\r\nI learnt different people and various cultures, but I still need to reflect how to apply them into everyday lives and plentiful fields. The discussion between students with distinctive cultural background on class is also what contribute to my increasing interest, in another word, I will be able to learn insights from other students and take advantage from the platform provided by YSS instead of only the professor per se. Application of Ethnography is the principal method I observed in the study of Anthropology. In this sense, thanks for further raising my cultural pride, and making me cherish the glory of my own cultural background. I will probably access into a more thorough understanding about my own culture afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0I'm new to the concept and disciplines of anthropology, so taking this intro course really helped me learn and have kind of an insight into what anthro is about. Definitely get to learn about a bunch of different cultures I didn't know before, but more importantly I get to be familiarized with the mindset of how anthro, especially ethnography, examines cultures and worlds. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read critically, and to apply the examples from the readings to abstract concepts of the class, and to carefully construct an essay. "

            "\u00a0It's a highly condensed course of a plentiful field. \r\nProfessor and TA made it possible for us to understand clearly without too much effort.\r\nReadings are of high quality, high representativeness and can be approached by a stage 0 student in this field like me.\r\nTA is super patient and nice and can point out what good points prof made in class that we may have taken for granted.\r\nClasses are filled with laughters and witty comments and interactions.\r\nFor me it's a perfect class. \r\nIf there is anything that I would like to change, perhaps is to have a 'map' for all the notions and points that we might encounter in advance to make the process of thinking easier. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was adding value to the unknown, and the weakness was it only being a five week class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it has interesting subject matter that is relevant to daily life in terms of observing other's anthropological means of communication. The material was taught and explained well and thoroughly in a way that encouraged thought. There are no weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Compared to others, I do want to study anthropology in University and I got to know this subject before the summer session since I have an activity related to local culture heritage protection. Therefore, this course can help me to build some new perspective and I am willing to experience the change about my previous understanding, making my mind more open.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The Introduction to Culture Anthropology course itself demonstrates the meaning of the culture. In the class, since lack of the American culture background for understanding and knowing some idiom, customs, I got confused many times when professor or classmates from USA provide some examples into the discussion. I cannot get their points, why they said this, what is the point of mentioning this information. It would be better to ask them to provide some basic background to the rest of class. And the time for office hour is so short that I cannot have enough time to raise my doubts and have some conversations with professors. ",
            "\u00a0Things are generally mentioned in the answer of the first question.\r\nI will list them again in a very simple and concrete form.\r\nStrength: \r\nCultural diversity of the students\r\nThe great teaching methods and prodigious knowledge base of the professor\r\nThe uniqueness of the class contents per se (no course like this in high school)\r\nThe thorough understanding delivered between students\r\netc.\r\nWeakness:\r\nI didn't come up with one yet. If I've got a chance, I would like to experience this whole thing again :) ",
            "\u00a0The course is very various in terms of the materials we got to look at. It covered not just old-school anthro but also some modern ones and ideologies. It could maybe include some works from foreign anthropologists, just to see how anthro is approached differently. ",
            "\u00a0I think if the course was designed so that the students could discuss class room readings and topics on a forum, or in a discussion thread on Canvas, it would've encouraged more of the students to be more engaged, and allow students to bounce ideas off of one another, to agree and disagree. Alot of the concepts are not hard and fast, there's alot of grey space, so I would've preferred it to be more interactive between students either inside the classroom, or online. "

            "\u00a0YEAS!\r\nThis is a field where you can find most of the major ideas in Humanities and Social Science intertwine AND acquire main methodologies based on western philosophy and inquiries. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if they were a fellow political science major. This course offers insight that most classes don't offer through firsthand experience and anecdotes, and I hope everyone that can take this class does take it. If I had taken it sooner, it would have significantly improved my experienced at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is an interesting subject to learn about. It is relevant in many other aspects of learning and life's observations in general. It was also presented in a way that clearly explained the key details about anthropology, and it always encouraged thought about the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The professor is extraordinary. His course helps student understand what is undergraduate study and how amazing it is ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will. Because the professor and TA are all very intelligent and kind people. And the classes do change one's perspective toward culture, sign, etc. Finishing this course can make one become more reflective, better at noticing subtle things happening around us and broaden our horizon. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, since I've benefit from this class a lot. Like I've mentioned in question 1, I felt my own improvement in knowledge, skill, and insights.\r\nLove this kind of challenge and unique experience with great professor and classmates! ",
            "\u00a0For sure. Just because it's interesting to explore other cultures and to learn to perceive things from an anthropological perspective. ",
