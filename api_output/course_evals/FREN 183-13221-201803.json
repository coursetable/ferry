            "\u00a0This is a course that introduces you to French in a very organic way. You discuss hot ethical topics in French (such as the history & role of French NGOs in developing countries, surrogacy, abortion, contraception, homeopathy, mental health, etc.) and put it in a French context. Discussions are focused on utilizing some key vocabulary from the readings and drawing comparisons to the way these topics are viewed in the US and other places. It's a very fun way to become fluent in discussing relevant medical issues in French. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot of vocabulary about the French medical system and general medical terminology in French.  I also gained insight into a lot of the French cultural beliefs surrounding medicine and some of the strengths and weaknesses of their medical system.  The course is also very discussion-based, which helped me get back into the groove with my French speaking abilities, which I felt had regressed since I had last taken a course in French. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about french medicine, both from the perspective of french citizens and how they view certain practices, and from the perspective of french physicians. I developed my french speaking skills, both in one on one conversations and group presentations. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of how the French medical system works and medical vocabulary "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course is good and that it emphasizes oral fluency and we received extensive feedback after each assignment. I do think the course could be improved perhaps by requiring a few more assignments so that more feedback could be provided, and a few ideas include requiring students answer 1 or 2 pre-class reading responses based on the discussion questions that would otherwise be distributed in class. I think waiting to receive feedback for a total of 5 assignments this semester really limited the extent to which I could make a conscious effort to improve my French; but, that being said, the feedback I did receive was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You cover a lot of different things and are forced to think critically about the French medical system.\r\nWeaknesses: The course is more of a survey of a lot of different topics, and you don't go super in-depth into anything, and it was not super well-organized.  The prompts for the papers were a bit unclear.  Also, while the readings are interesting, and you learn about contemporary issues in French medicine, I do not feel that I learned that much actual information or that my French improved all that much. ",
            "\u00a0This layout of the course was efficient and worked very well at introducing us to french medicine and progressing the class through different aspect of it. This class could be improved by having more group discussions in place of the typical one on one conversations we had in class. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging and lots of participation "
        ],

            "\u00a0Yes, take it! (if you're interested in improving your oral fluency and/or are premed). The course this year was relatively small, which meant there was no way to get out of speaking in class or to get by without doing the readings, so be prepared to do the work. Fortunately, the work is not extremely demanding, with 2 writing assignments and 3 presentations (1 individual, 2 group), you will mostly working on oral fluency!\r\n\r\nThis class provides a relaxed way to become fluent discussing medical issues (abortion, mental health, homeopathy, etc.) in French. These are topics that you have formed views on in English, and it's a fun experience trying to translate all of that into French for discussion. The group projects are a fun way to work with your classmates and combine ideas to recompile and expand on the material covered in class.. the writing assignments are low-stress, and the discussions are always interesting (hot-takes only!!). \r\n\r\ntl;dr - take it!! ",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting and a good way to keep up your French without too much stress or hassle.  It was not particularly challenging, which is nice, but I also don't feel like I got all that much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are interested in medical french this is a great class to take with a professor as wonderful at Prof. Tertain. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, pretty interesting and fun if you're looking for a French class that isn't just grammar. "
