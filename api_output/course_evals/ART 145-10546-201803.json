            "\u00a0I gained experience making movies and thinking critically about that process. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of video as a medium, and the mental and intellectual framework necessary to make experimental and abstract videos. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of using Adobe Premier, After Effects, and Media Encoder. I also learned how to correctly work together in a group to create a video. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the medium of digital video and different ways artists and thinkers have conceptualized communicating through certain media. I also learned some editing and effects skills in After Effects and Premiere Pro and was able to apply those to making my own short projects. In addition, I learned about the process of structuring an idea or narrative and the deliberation of steps necessary to convey that through visual and/or auditory means in a piece. "

            "\u00a0This course is more focused on video as a topic of intellectual discourse (ex. how is the content of a video informed by the specificities of the medium/ how is society shaped by the prevalence of videos?) than on \"making movies\". I liked that angle quite a lot, and I agreed with many of the insights that Justin offered. The big weakness of the course was the discussions. I would have loved a lot more of back and forth between the students and less of Justin lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0There is very minimal technical instruction in the course, with classes instead focusing on the theoretical nature of making videos, and discussing how to put together experimental and abstract pieces. If you want to understand video as a medium, it's a great class. If you want to learn camera and editing skills, it's not for you. I would say that the class should spend a bit more time teaching technical skills, as I feel it would aid many of the students in putting together their videos, and really expanding what they could do. But the class did do a great job form the theoretical end. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course, but the student should know that they'll be getting much more of a theoretical understanding than a technical one. There is very minimal technical instruction in the course, with classes instead focusing on the theoretical nature of making videos, and discussing how to put together experimental and abstract pieces. If you want to understand video as a medium, it's a great class. If you want to learn camera and editing skills, it's not for you. But overall, I enjoyed the course, and would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! Youre pretty much given free range to make whatever you want which makes learning so much easier. And the skills you do acquire can be used to make almost anything after. "
