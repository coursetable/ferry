            "\u00a0We covered the fundamentals of Jewish thought from Spinoza to the Holocaust.  Along the way, we had in-depth discussions and learned how to analyze philosophical texts and ideas in historical and social contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about different interpretations of Jewish thought and how to apply them to the Jewish situation today. This class gave me a much greater understanding and appreciation of Jewish history because I had previously been largely unaware of the intellectual side of Jewish history and the thought reactions that it produced. This class also made me better at questioning sources and arguments as much of our seminar was debating and comparing the validity of different thinkers. The final paper also gave us the opportunity to explore whatever interested us most and Professor Stern was always available to help us with it or give his opinions on our ideas. This was not only the case with the final paper but throughout the entire course. "

            "\u00a0This course is great, especially as a seminar.  Professor Stern is the real highlight of this course--you can tell that he's brilliant, and he's also a leader in the field of Judaic studies, so he has lots of valuable insights.  Readings are reasonable in length and always relevant even if we don't always have time to discuss them all explicitly in class. ",
            "\u00a0It is impossible to cover all of modern Jewish thought in one semester, and Professor Stern knows this. I think it was smart not to try to cover more than was realistic because the conversation that came out of the thinkers and ideas we did cover were valuable. I think more assignments could be added so that students get more of a chance to reflect upon what we have been learning over the semester. I'm not sure how this would work, but other than that the discussion and readings were great. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the fact that this course was thematic by week, which I thought helped structure class and learning throughout the semester. However, it did feel clear to me that this had been a lecture course--  discussion never felt very meaningful or deep to me, and the student leaders didn't make that much of a difference. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a great syllabus, and the Professor has very insightful points. I definitely learned a lot and expanded my thinking. The downsides were class organization and the classroom dynamic. At least this semester, the class was the size of a seminar, but run as more of a lecture. Students often asked questions or made points, but that participation led more to one-on-one conversations with the professor during class, whereas I would have liked the professor to turn it into more of a group discussion. Also, we would sometimes barely talk about long reading assignments. "

            "\u00a0Yes, great course, especially if you're interested in Jewish thought or how Jews and Judaism came to be the way they are today. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, Jewish or non-Jewish. The material is an interesting blend of political history, intellectual history, and religious studies, and Prof. Stern is an enthusiastic and thoughtful conveyor of information. ",
            "\u00a0I was recommended to take this course by a professor after I took the History of Jews class with Ivan Marcus and was not disappointed. The two cover two completely different times and standpoints of Jewish history (this one being much more from an intellectual standpoint) and I loved the fact that Professor Stern will constantly surprise you with new ideas and opinions. This class flew by and if you have any interest in learning about Jewish thought and its impact on the history and future of the Jews take it. Also there wasn't a ton of work (one 6-8 page midterm paper and one 10 page final paper) so unless this changes, you have the opportunity to explore the topics you're interested in as much as you want without having to worry about weekly assignments (other than the readings). At the very least you should shop this, you'll know after the first seminar if you want to stay in the class or not. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you like the syllabus and if after you go to the first meeting you like Professor Stern's style. That first meeting sold me on the course, but if I didn't like it I think it would have been downhill from there. This course had a great syllabus, and the Professor has very insightful points. I definitely learned a lot and expanded my thinking. The downsides were class organization and the classroom dynamic. At least this semester, the class was the size of a seminar, but run as more of a lecture. Students often asked questions or made points, but that participation led more to one-on-one conversations with the professor during class, whereas I would have liked the professor to turn it into more of a group discussion.
