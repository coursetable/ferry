            "\u00a0Reciprocal lattice is a subject I've never encountered before. I've taken several courses in materials science, but reciprocal lattice was a topic which was avoided somehow, until I took this course. This course also paid a lot of attention of electronic and phononic dispersion curves, energy bands, etc. Looking at both types of excitations side-by-side in so much detail was very useful. It is good to be more familiar with their relative scales and the consequences of their different energy scales. ",

The order of topics was also very good.\r\n\r\nThere were a few topics along the way which I initially struggled with more than probbaly expected, which I think may benefit from extra care:\r\n\r\nthe difference between form factor and structure factor\r\nthe difference between the different brillouin zone schemes\r\nthe difference between conservation of momentum and crystal momentum\r\n\r\nBCT 408, as a classroom, could benefit from a remodel to use the space more effectively.
