            "\u00a0Imperfect tense, conditional, subjunctive. How to talk about things such as vacations etc ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish improved vastly over the semester. The course was well designed for someone like me, who has Spanish learning in their background but was very rusty with much of the grammar. The entire course being conducted in Spanish really facilitated my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Aprend un poco espaol, como hablar, escribir, escuchar, y leer con frecuencia y exactitud.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, I learned a great deal of Spanish comprehension, and my abilities in speaking and listening especially drastically improved as a result of this course. There was a lesser component of the course involving exposure to Spanish media, and that also proved quite helpful. "

            "\u00a0We used a lot of paper in this class, and I would love to see the reliance on paper decrease. ",
            "\u00a0Catered to student learning, but moves very quickly and has a lot of petty work involved ",
            "\u00a0I found the format of the class didn't allow for students to practice speaking with feedback enough. Lots of writing is a positive. ",
            "\u00a0More speaking practice in class is needed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the strengths of the class was the fact that we did a lot of exercises to practice in class. I did not like that we barely had the opportunity to practice the speaking section in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think I already filled out a handwritten course evaluation that contained my answer to this question. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly strong in regards to general classtime activities. I highly recommend taking this course with Professor Daz if at all possible, as he is an engaging teacher who would often talk about subjects that came up in group discussion--I found myself learning about everything from bullfighting to manners of different countries and the room for diverse discussion of topics was immense. I also believe that the exams, while frequent, are fair (although the lack of extra credit in the Spanish department as a whole is not a good policy). The biggest weakness of the course comes in the readings: they will expect you to piece together texts (and even a novel) beyond your comprehension, and you will often miss chunks of it. While this doesn't really matter grade-wise, it is kind of demeaning to be thrown in so deep. You will also be thrown in to only speaking Spanish day 1, but everyone will struggle with you--don't think you are the only person affected. "

            "\u00a0Yes! It was a great way to improve my spanish abilities and gain quality relationships with my peers! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, but mostly because of Seor Diaz. He made this class such fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; my Spanish speaking, writing, and comprehending skills greatly improved. Professor was great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though I would stress as someone who has taken courses at Yale College from many different departments, that this course is relatively difficult and time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially to someone who last took Spanish in high school a year or two ago but wants a more immersive classroom experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend both the course and professor for those interested in language and Spanish, or for those who need to fulfill a language requirement. If you are taking the class for pleasure, you may find it more work than it is worth, especially due to meeting every week. The homework is light in some days and miserable on others, but overall manageable. I think it is a solid course that improved my fundamental knowledge of the language, but you have to work for it. "
