            "\u00a0Knowledge: range of scholarship addressing critical questions for social science and development that are usually left out of conversations, understanding of importance of self-awareness/history of disciplines/gaps in understanding and acknowledgement of different knowledge forms, etc.\r\nSkills: critical self-reflection, comparative analysis of theory-informed texts, holistic understanding of complexity of spaces in which conservation and development projects take place, ability to think about unforeseen consequences and effects of projects\r\nInsights: all of the above... plus insights on how certain scholars have applied and altered theory in order to better understand \"how\" and \"why\" questions in conservation and development ",
            "\u00a0I learned about notions of power I was not previously aware of, and how these are deployed in conservation and development to advance some goals ahead of others. I learned to recognize these forms of power, and to detect who they benefit and how. ",
            "\u00a0I became familiar with the literature based on Foucault. It transformed my understanding of power and its relation with development as an agenda of government and international cooperation. It also made clear the pitfalls of speaking of traditional and comunitarian development. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me new ways to look at work I had been doing for years prior to beginning at FES. I learned how to look for patterns of power in conservation and development projects, and to use different anthropological and philosophical theories to answer the question \"why did this project fail?\"\r\n\r\nI found this class to be especially important for my thinking at this point in my career, since I gained a useful historical perspective of conservation and development through the readings--something I sorely lacked, and something that can help me approach future professional work with greater sensitivity and awareness. I would probably, too, draw on the authors/readings from class to help me contextualize future work. \r\n\r\nFinally, I felt the insights I drew from this class were extremely useful to me as an MF student. It won't matter how well I can write a conservation plan if I can't work with the people nearby in an appropriate and thoughtful manner. I wish I could take this course again. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to several important works in the field of environmental anthropology. I feel more confident that my breadth of knowledge in this subfield has widened. By asking us to write thesis sentences each week that would summarise the readings in our own words, this exercise has challenged me to be a more critical reader. I imagine coming back to these sentences will be useful as I prepare for my qualifying exams in the Spring. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a breadth of theories and frameworks that enabled me to think beyond the conventional way of evaluating and analyzing conservation and development. I think the strongest aspect of this course is its ability to force oneself outside his or her comfort zone, specifically in terms of knowledge and skills. While much of the course is based upon Foucauldian concepts, the discussion part of the course allows students to bring in outside knowledge, thus expanding the topic of conversation. "

            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class exceeded my expectations and will certainly inform my engagement in conservation and development work I plan on pursuing. I expected an overview of social science \"issues\" faced by development and conservation projects, but came out with a better understanding of theory, applied to case studies and used for analysis, and provocative questions to think about in the future. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge, skills and insights I gained in this class surpassed my expectations, by far. I did know how much I did not know before taking the class. ",

            "\u00a0This course met my expectations in terms of difficulty and work required for a graduate seminar. ",
            "\u00a0It exceeded my expectations. I have taken classes similar to this one in undergraduate, but this course provides a much more in-depth look at conservation and development. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: improves self-awareness, questions assumptions and offers different perspective on the pervasive views and disciplines promoted at FES, actually clarifies theory and possibility for application without pretending to offer \"answers\"\r\nWeaknesses: making a case for itself as relevant to a broader, larger audience towards the beginning! everyone should take this course, and it needs to be better at seeming appealing - not requiring structural changes or substantive changes\r\nImprovement: again, not really structural changes... perhaps more dedication to thinking about relevance to our specific interests and future. I wouldn't even really say this is necessary because it is built into discussions, but it would be great to get more of the professor's views on this. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked Carol to have taught a little bit more. I know we got a lot of insight from her throughout the discussion, but would lave liked the first 45 minutes as a lecture, and then the rest led by the students. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite demanding, for those who aren't already familiar with concepts that surround the social sciences, and sometimes took an excessive amount of time to understand independently. In particular, some terms we used in class were not always fully understood by all-- I think a working list of definitions and examples for each important concept would be a useful addition to the weekly reading summaries. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was definitely one of the strengths of the course, although the conversations in class could have been more structured ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend breaking the course into two meetings, or building in a significant break into the three-hour course time. The class is entirely discussion-based, and it is a bit difficult to keep the discussion moving in a productive direction for a solid three hours. Another solution could be a short lecture from the instructor, or short presentations from students at the beginning of class to help frame the discussion, which I found to be a bit free-form and nebulous at times.\r\n\r\nA final thought: if the three-hour format is necessary, then maybe offer the class in the morning, rather than the afternoon, when minds are fresher and sharper. ",
            "\u00a0Again, the biggest strengths is the readings. I don't think that many environmental professionals are exposed to these types of readings even though they are critical to our field. They truly give a new outlook on the profession as a whole. Furthermore, the level of required reading was a strength. We typically were assigned about 50 pages of reading per week, which allowed us to actually engage in it instead of skimming it. Finally, I think the requirement of weekly thesis sentences was really helpful. Not only was it useful when I was writing my final paper, but it also ensured that the discussions during class were lively.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, I think the biggest challenge of this course is that it is a bit of a downer. You spend a semester analyzing issues in conservation and development, but rarely find answers to these issues (and when you do they are often problematic). It was hard to walk away from our weekly discussions without feeling a little doom and gloom about the world. "

            "\u00a0DEFINITELY take this course! I wish it were in the \"core\" or \"required\" option bins for more specializations. You have to be a little patient, but about a third of the way through you will realize that you can't help but see and understand the world a little differently. It will influence your experience in other classes, for the better. It is worth doing the readings to be able to engage fully in discussion, but also because they are genuinely fascinating and insightful - especially when paired with the professor's writing which makes them accessible and more widely applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Read ahead! ",
            "\u00a0To be prepared to do regular in-depth reading-- skimming is not an option here! And to ask to clarify concepts as soon as they come up, rather than operate with a vague understanding of them. Concepts build on each other, in this course, and a thorough understanding of each reading/class topic benefits students in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure that you commit enough time for assignments and preparing discussions, and to read the texts carefully and critically ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend setting aside five or six hours a week for the readings, and to pull quotes from the readings along the way to make writing the final paper less arduous. ",
            "\u00a0I would say they'll need to be prepared for a high work load. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT! It provides such a unique perspective on our field that not many FES classes offer. I especially encourage those that are in the hard sciences to take it. While it appears intimidating because its a heavy social science course, Carol is a great professor and understands that each student comes with a different background. I truly think that this course would greatly influence several FESers future academic and professional plans. "
