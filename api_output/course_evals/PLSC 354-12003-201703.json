            "\u00a0As far as skills go, I learned how to handle a large amount of reading during this course.  I learned a lot about the structure of the European Union, as well as about the issues that it faces.  One of my major insights that I had during the class was that the EU is incredibly bureaucratic, partly as a result of the historical growth of its institutions, but also partly by design.  I also learned a lot about what challenges the European Union faces, with my greatest insight being that many of the problems the EU faces come from the clash of nationalist and globalist movements. ",
            "\u00a0Going into David Cameron's \"The European Union\" I thought I knew plenty about this supranational institution. Going out of the class I cannot stress strongly enough how wrong I was. Professor Cameron comprehensively covered all the vital aspects, issues, and topics about the EU. No understanding of the European Union can be complete without the incredible depth and breadth of this excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the European Union (EU), not only as a political system, but also as Europe's cultural entity. I developed knowledge of different countries in the EU such as Germany, the UK, and Ukraine, and their respective issues. I learned to listen to my classmates and analyze their arguments, and debating my positions logically with people whose opinions differed from mine. ",
            "\u00a0I've gotten a broad introduction to the most pressing issues facing the European Union. ",
            "\u00a0Solid class. The European Union is a complex political body and Prof. Cameron offers valuable insight into its structure and workings. ",

            "\u00a0Sometimes I felt overwhelmed by how much reading there was for this course.  The readings were interesting and informative, and were where most of the material was really learned, so I understand why there was so much; it was just difficult to keep up with during the busier parts of the semester.  One of the strengths of the course was the discussion, I felt professor Cameron moderated these well and I found the insights of the other students to be particularly beneficial.  One weakness of the course was also that there was not always clear feedback.  Most of our feedback came from the comments on our reading responses, but I wish that there was a more clear correlation between that and our grade.  I also wish we knew how we were evaluated during class discussions, since that accounts for 1/3 of the grade as well. ",
            "\u00a0\"The European Union\" was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Professor Cameron struck the perfect balance between breath and depth; he discussed topics from the legislative process of the EU, over the Ukraine Crisis to the future and international importance of the supranational body. The wisdom that shone through in his lectures and comments enthralled me. Professor Cameron managed to make even the most dry aspects of the EU engaging. For example, he once hosted a simulation of the Brexit negotiation in class. The experience was remarkable. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Cameron is brilliant and knowledgeable, but his speaking style is somewhat dry and droning. The class can feel a little boring. And the readings are often too much and too boring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class discussions were productive because the professor asked specific-- instead of general-- questions. The reading selections were diverse, which made these discussions more informative. The readings were comprehensive and had various insights into and views on the EU. For example, The Political System of the European Union by Simon Hix and Bjorn Hoyland was like an Encyclopedia with mostly facts. On the other hand, books such as Brexit: How Britain Left Europe, were more opinionated, which helped me understand how people felt about Brexit and the arguments that they had. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The professor tended to ask the same students questions because they tended to be more informed than others. This gave students who were not as well versed fewer opportunities to participate. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a nice survey of EU issues and the workload is reasonable. \r\n\r\nI might include some form of evaluation before the final paper, since it was difficult to gauge where our grades stood all semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Prof. Cameron is always willing to spend extra time with students to discuss the topics mentioned in class. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions sometimes lacked enthusiasm and engagement, readings were sometimes too long too have effective discussions. My favorite parts were the Cameron news updates. More activities like the simulation would be great, but it would have been better with a provided briefing on the questions we were addressing and very brief overview of issue.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the lack of focus on grades, but this class takes it too far--I had no idea how i was doing. A mid-term progress grade for participation for Homeworks and participation  would help a ton. ",
            "\u00a0I loved participating in this course, doing its readings and writing its final paper. There, however, was no feedback throughout the course. Aside from being stressful, this made it difficult to adjust how I went about doing the coursework. "

            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to students who are interested in the European Union. It is not for the uninterested, much of the material can be dry--the EU is boring by design! Professor Cameron does a good job leading the discussion and tolerates disagreement and discussion, important things for a seminar class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have even an ounce of interest in economics or politics--and  you should--you would be foolish not to take this class. It is it once an excellent study of the European Union and an unforgettable experience. You will benefit tremendously from Professor Cameron's limitless wisdom. Only after you have taken this class can you truly understand Europe and the world. ",
            "\u00a0No... this course was really poorly taught, in my opinion... ",
            "\u00a0I would not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course was overall, very informative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in the EU, you should definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Solid class. The European Union is a complex political body and Prof. Cameron offers valuable insight into its structure and workings. Take it if you're interested in the EU. ",
            "\u00a0One of those classes where the more you put in the more you get out. But the subject matter is often dull in content or presentation. If you're very interested in the topic, take it. "
