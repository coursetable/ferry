            "\u00a0- Strength: clear and succinct mathematical derivation and broad coverage of industries\r\n- To be improved: could accommodate more case studies and more implications of carbon footprint analysis; we have spent a lot of time performing the calculations, but what is the key merit of these analyses? Whether and how will they support policy-making? Considering the bulk of the audience is undergrad and master's student, it is highly appreciate that we have a balanced understanding of carbon footprint from both academic and real-world/cross-discipline perspectives ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it is a skill-based class and provides you with training to develop the skill of carbon footprint modeling. The other strength was the TA who was incredibly patient, available, and methodical in his explanation of the topics. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths. Do not take this class if you do not have experience with linear algebra. It is a very technical class and the professor does not teach the topics, he discusses them with the assumption that students already know how to perform carbon footprint modeling. Your learning is also dependent on your experience with Matlab, and since I did not have experience with this platform, I had to learn this in addition to the course topics, which was very challenging. P-sets assume knowledge of Matlab and without coding experience, you will struggle. I wish I had been able to get more out of the problem sets but unfortunately, I felt like I spent half of the homework just guessing.  \r\n\r\nMy main source of angst with the class was I didn't feel the professor provided us with the resources to assist us. Professor Hertwich did not teach carbon-footprint modeling and analysis, he assumed we knew how to model already, and used lecture time to discuss the largest contributors to the world's carbon footprint--topics I already knew. I would encourage the Professor to think through a more methodical approach to teaching and to explain the tools that are necessary for the problem sets. It would also be helpful if there were more linear algebra resources and instructions for Matlab. ",
            "\u00a0The format of a lecture and computer lab session weekly worked well.  \r\n\r\nI was already somewhat familiar with the content, but for others, likely need to spend more time going over the basics of IO. ",
            "\u00a0Good contents. Maybe more explanation would be great! ",
            "\u00a0I think that it is hard to balance both the math and the theoretical material. I think that this improved over the course of the semester, though I wish some of the theoretical material focused more on systems thinking and wider applicability. In the future, it would also be interesting to have a HW assignment that compares using EEIO in MATLAB with using one of the more common software programs that are used in professional practice. Another thing that may be useful would be an intro to MATLAB session or video watching. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The assigned journal article readings were informative and interesting. The matlab tutorials were also very useful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: One weakness of the course was the frequency with which the homework problem statements were revised after they had been assigned. It was tough when the questions kept being updated, sometimes two or three times in one week.\r\n\r\nConsistent variable symbols would have also helped for this introductory course. While the meaning behind a symbol can sometimes be understood from context, the context is difficult to see when trying to learn something for the first time. Confusion over changing symbol definitions and symbols that were not clearly defined sometimes distracted from learning new material. "

It may not be directly applicable, especially because in professional settings, one often uses other software for input/output analysis but the theoretical information is really interesting! ",
