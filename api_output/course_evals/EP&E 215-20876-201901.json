            "\u00a0In the past semester, I learned the cannon. But in taking this course, I also learned how to think critically about our society and our place in that society. ",
            "\u00a0I have gained a much deeper understanding of the texts that define the great Western canon. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of the Western Canon.  Economic history and theory, if you took DS, is the most new and interesting aspect of Classics of EPE ",
            "\u00a0I reread the Western Canon. Reviewed many western thinkers. The greatest skill that I practiced, was looking at arguments from different perspectives. While some ideas are commonly attributed to these thinkers, they usually do not define these thinkers. It is important to try and understand the thinkers themselves without putting my own biases upon them. After I do understand their arguments, I may judge them. "

            "\u00a0Max really drove this class and made it interesting and engaging. The weakness would probably be the many pages of reading that we had which could at times get dull. ",
            "\u00a0Course helps you improve your understanding through discourse. It is a long seminar, which helps you to really dive into the questions within the text. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, but the focus on the Western Canon obfuscates the overall purpose of the major.  As the single course required for EPE, this class begs the quesiton: what is EPE about?  The focus on a very white, very western Western Canon without analysis of race or gender obscures the purpose--is this class about learning about what people in power cared about or learning about systems of power?  Without race, it is the former--and a very whitewashed, colorblind one at that. ",
            "\u00a0Too little time to study everyone on the syllabus effectively. I've had conversations about this already. "

            "\u00a0If a student wants to have a solid understanding of ethics, politics, and economics, I would absolutely recommend this class. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it (even though it was at 9am every monday morning.) ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you have to take it.  Class discussions are by far the best part of the class.  Shop around professors, because from what I can tell there can be variation in teaching styles that can tend toward lecture-based or discussion-based.  Having had discussion-based, it was pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course especially. While Classics of EP&E is important for understanding western society's foundations, this class taught by Krah exposed me to different perspectives of thinkers I might not have had with another professor. "
