            "\u00a0I learned so much about dance and about my body and movements. It was a really insightful course and helped me connect my mind and body. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about embodied experience and how to let go. This was a really therapeutic and community-oriented class, which made it fun and relaxing to come to every week! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to feel the floor, feel the air, and feel the energy between dance movements that I wasn't aware of before. The greatest skill that I've learned (but not perfected yet, as it is a very tough skill to perfect) is to let go of control and \"learn to be in control when not in control.\" I think that everything learned in this class has applicability outside of dance, and I quite honestly it has had such an impact on my life I would want to see this class, as a bodily intelligence class, some sort of requirement in our liberal arts space, since body intelligence is just as important as each other form of intelligence focused on at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This sounds weird, but I learned a lot about myself in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Dance Theater gave me both the time, space, and resources to learn more about dance, movement practice, and embodiment. I got much more comfortable with movement improv and different movement techniques, while also learning about a large number of 20th C. choreographers ",
            "\u00a0A much deeper self-knowledge and self-awareness. Every day in studio, I learned something new about the way I think or feel or look at the world, just by moving. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths are the amount of freedom you have! I think the papers make less sense than maybe a more creative project -- there was a lot of freedom, though, I just wish the assignment had been more open (photography portfolio, choreographed dance, etc) ",
            "\u00a0I think the way this course works as a space for anyone to jump in regardless of previous skill is perfect. We start with techniques that are comfortable for beginners but also essential even for seasoned dancers to learn because its not so much a technique but a head space that one must learn to get into. I honestly can't think of any weaknesses because of how transformative this class was. ",
            "\u00a0This course revolved around a great deal of studio/movement time, which was much more helpful than a dry lecture on modern dance theater. It did mean that it never felt like we had enough time in the week to discuss the readings and/or pace the semester accordingly, because then we wouldn't be moving. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Irene is an amazing professor and it's the perfect balance between a light-workload class and one where you get to learn a lot of interesting stuff about things you probably hadn't been thinking about before. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course with Irene! Dance Theater is essentially a class on improvisation. Before taking this class, I was absolutely terrified of improvisation, but now, I'm so comfortable moving my body in new and surprising ways. Initially, you might be bored with the improvisation, but stick with it and you will be rewarded, as you will find yourself unconsciously incorporating principles of improvisation into every part of your life. The weekly reading/viewing assignments were always super relevant and totally manageable. Also, Irene is absolutely the most caring, understanding and nurturing teacher. She made it a joy to go to class twice a week. I cannot recommend this class enough for dancers and non-dancers alike. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to every single student. This class has improved my posture, both physically and mentally. I think learned how one's body moves and where our body's tension and weakness are found are such important skills for life, not just in dance. This course is definitely a higher level conceptual course in the sense that it treats the body with the same respect as we treat the mind in academic settings, and that's beautiful. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take any class with Irene. ",
            "\u00a0YES. take this course. Its amazing. My favorite course I took this year, and one of my all time favorite courses at Yale. It will push you out of your comfort zone in the best way. I loved coming to class and looked forward to it every week. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely adored this course and would definitely recommend it to another student, regardless of whether or not they have dance/movement experience. It's a course unlike any other I've taken at Yale College, because it asks you to think about the way you move and live in your body and then gives you time to experiment with doing so. The practice is highly meditative but also incredibly insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you're at all interested in dance, the arts, or knowing yourself better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, one of the best classes I took at Yale. I can dance now!!! "
