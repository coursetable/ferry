            "\u00a0Because there are many required readings, I really broaden my reading areas to psychology and opera. Also, professor Lind taught us a lot about how to writing college papers. For psychological part, I learnt something on Freud theory and how it can be used in literature analysis. For philosophical part, I explored different approaches to love and the relation among beauty, pleasure and love. The most impressive thing to me is the three opera courses for Tannhuser, L'Orfeo, and Magic Flute. It is the first time I got in touch with opera actually and it really rose my interest in opera. ",
            "\u00a0A very broad view of the issues treated in the topic. Knowledge on how to write a type of essays I have never seen before. ",
            "\u00a0Apart from a greater depth of knowledge in both the fields of art history and philosophy, I believe I gained the ability to link several fields academically. ",
            "\u00a0The most imparted skill I learned from Dr Lind is the systematical approach and it is my pleasure of being his student. The systematic approach really helped me to gain the structural understanding of the articles and construct my essay better. This is a theoretical-based class, although it has a relatively greater workload, it is still my favorite class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0There are too many contents about philosophy  and psychology, but too less about art or art history. ",
            "\u00a0It should not be categorized into Art History for it has nothing to do with this subject. ",
            "\u00a0Gave students an introduction to many aspects of a very large course. Could be improved by less time spent on the first unit, love beauty and pleasure, so that more time could be spent on the latter topics. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps by having a more evident structure to the lessons and the course overall because although it was really interesting, sometimes it was difficult to keep track of what we had learnt. ",
            "\u00a0It should not be categorized under the department of HSAR. ",
            "\u00a0There are almost no weaknesses in this course from my perspective. The only thing I want the Summer Session Office to do is to reconsider its category. It more tended to be a literary class other than the history of arts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who love philosophy and psychology, but not those art lovers. Because the category of the course is a little bit confusing. The course is more relevant to philosophy or psychology rather than art history. ",
            "\u00a0I will recommend this course to students who are interested in philosophy, psychology, literature and German studies. But I will never advise Art History students to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For someone who is unsure about whether they would like to study this topic, it provides a good introduction of many topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially those with a surface interest in the humanities as this deals with a range of fields and their interrelation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. From my personal experience, this class taught me the amazing approaches to construct my essays and understand the underlying claims for each author. Although it has relative greater workload and reading materials, it is worth for having it. Dr Lind is a fantastic instructor to guide your way to match a high-level requirement. "
