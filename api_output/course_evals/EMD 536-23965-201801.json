            "\u00a0WAAAAAAAY too much busy work. Having multiple assignments a week was overkill.  The questions that were being asked for the homework and the papers and the material being taught in class were completely different. \r\n\r\nI liked the case study format. ",
            "\u00a0It's really great to be able to have real professional epidemiologists teach this course - we get to go through cases they actually worked on, and get an insider view of the field. However, it was very apparent that they were epidemiologists and not educators. The curriculum was disorganized to the point of being non existent, the homework assignments had no relation to what we were covering in class, the classes were often very drawn out basic powerpoints of cases that became super redundant after the first three. I really liked the Canvas case studies that let us work through a case and do some investigating and equations and draw conclusions, but the \"Outbreak in the News\" discussion assignments were throwaways that no one ever really discussed (if it's a discussion we should have it in class and not on an online forum). The last paper, about pandemic flu, was a really good concept but very poorly thought out- It was actually a complex modeling problem and it was clear they hadn't thought about how complicated of a question it was. Overall, the general content about outbreak investigation was worth taking the class, but I could have taught it to myself and saved a lot of time and frustration. At least one professional educator of some kind needs to be involved in planning this course. ",
            "\u00a0this is a great course.\r\njust a small thing to improve, the peer evaluation makes up too much of the total, i would suggest instructors grade the students' performance in the discussion, which would be fairer. ",
            "\u00a0The content is amazing, but instruction is very dull and not interactive in an engaged/exciting way. It's also from 3-5pm and most students are exhausted from the day. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting and applicable information. I enjoyed the overview of the different parts of working in real life, day-to-day public health. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most disappointing course I have taken at YSPH.\r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint is the lack of learning in the classroom compared with what we were expected to know for homeworks.  We would do simple case studies in class then have much harder homework assignments.  For example, there was one assignment that required mathematical calculations and statistical analysis that we never learned in class, and we were then told they expected us to have learned this in other class.  I found this very frustrating, as they said at the beginning of the semester that you were welcome to take this class if you were not in EMD, yet they assumed we had a lot of background knowledge.  We rarely had formal notes, but were expected to understand many topics with minimal exposure to them.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, their teaching style was questionable.  For example our last long paper had a question that students could not figure out.  This paper was worth a large portion of our grade so students were determined to figure out the right answer.  I personally spent hours on this question as I was not going to just stop trying to get the grade I wanted on this paper.  After it was due, we were told it was a learning experience regarding how you dont always have all the knowledge you need to solve something in public health and that there was no right answer.  This is extremely inappropriate in an assignment worth 12% of our grade.  Perhaps this would be effective in a small weekly assignment, but this was a waste of students time and unfair.  We did not know that no answer could be an answer.\r\n\r\nThe workload was very high.  There would be weeks where we would have up to three assignments due, even when we had long paper assignments due.  We had other assignments due the same day as our midterm paper which was a lot to ask.  Most of the assignments are pure busy work rather than anything we learned from.  We had readings assigned on top of the assignments.  It was too much when learning from these assignments were minimal.\r\n\r\nOverall, this class needs to focus on class time learning.  We cannot do easy case studies in class then have much more difficult homework case studies with methods we never learned.  Paper prompts were vague and confusing and again were based almost entirely on concepts that we did not cover in class.  The course material needs to prepare us for assignments, which this class failed to do.  Focus on learning in class rather than assigning lots of assignments and please start teaching students what they will be doing for homework (case studies and papers) rather than cramming in more and more repetitive case studies during class.  We need to actually learn methods to apply to case studies, not just simply go over case definitions over and over again.  I feel unprepared moving forward in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course.  Conducting an investigation during an outbreak is a key skill in communicable disease public health, and I felt that the instructors for this course did a great job in teaching how to do this.  A recommendation I have for the course is to make sure we have a basic knowledge of the outbreak investigation framework before we start doing case studies in class (i.e., give us a formula for and examples of constructing a case definition prior to our first time having to write one).  Also, the group discussion might work better if we were in smaller groups of 3 rather than 5.  I found that in my group, it was difficult for everyone to get a unique idea in if they did not speak first. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the things we learned in the course regarding disease outbreaks, and how we would do different outbreaks but reiterate the things we learned in the past to reinforce the ideas. It felt more helpful than other courses because it seemed like we were applying what we learned into \"real-life\" situations. Group work was definitely helpful in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. I learned a lot in this course and greatly enjoyed the case-based format of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I love how the class was divided into group discussion.\r\nI wish this class could have emphasized more on the difference and similarities of different outbreak scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you learn about outbreak investigation from people who work on the topic everyday. All the professors involved with the class are extremely knowledgeable and accessible.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the nature of the class means you don't walk away with a tangible skill set, instead, you learn a beginner level general framework on how to assess and possibly control outbreaks. The assignments we do for homework should be discussed in class the following day. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good course to learn the process of public health practice. However, I think some discussions in the course is not necessary because the questions we discussed is not the ones we could have different opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-went over case studies together and in groups, working step by step and getting a good feel was a great way of getting the feel of working in a health department \r\n-instructors were very helpful and shared their own experiences, advice, and reassurances\r\n-online case study quizzes, while long, were sometimes fun and it was interesting to go through each one step by step\r\n-instructors and TA requested feedback, which was appreciated and helped the class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-discussions were integrated into the classroom well, but this was only done later in the course, it would have been interesting to do this from the beginning\r\n-assignments due tended to be overwhelming, especially since due dates coincided with other class assignments, might help to not have many things due in the same week (particularly case study quizzes, which tended to be long) "

            "\u00a0Dr. Cartter is an excellent epidemiologist and it's wonderful that he's giving his time to teach this unique field to students. While he had very interesting tidbits and valuable pieces of advice, as a lead instructor he left a little to be desired. He had a tendency to ramble, which would have been fine if the rest of the content was engaging and useful, but since it often seemed overly simplistic and repetitive, there was a general air of slowness throughout the class. Dr. Cartter often seemed a little irritated when we had more nit-picky questions about assignments, which were often vague or highly qualitative. I understand that in real life public health professionals have to work with what they're given, but many of these assignments asked us to present conclusions that were impossible to back up or verify, or sometimes just blatantly incorrect. It makes sense that we would struggle with that, but it felt like all our questions or concerned got brushed off with \"there's no right answer, this is a learning experience,\" when in reality it was often clear (particularly in the last paper) that the instructors hadn't thought out the prompts. In the last paper Dr. Cartter was posing a theoretical question that was supposed to be the base of the assignment, and when informed that the peer reviewed article that was linked to one of our resources clearly answered that question, he said he didn't know there was a paper and hadn't read it. I hope that's not how the DOH usually operates. ",

            "\u00a0Good teacher, good selection of topics ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Cartter did not listen to student feedback.  Around the middle of the semester, he gave students the opportunity to tell the teaching fellow, Katie Owens, any problems with the course as a class.  None of these issues appeared to be addressed.  We still had multiple homework assignments due on the same day every week, and still spent lots of time on questions like \"is this an outbreak\" \"what is the case definition\" and \"make an epi curve\" and homework prompts and assignments continued to not reflect what as learned in class and continued to be unclear.  \r\n\r\nBiggest recommendation: assignments need to relate to what we actually do in class.\r\n\r\nAlso sections were added to grading that were not in the syllabus.  For example class attendance and a peer evaluation are part of our final grade when there is no indication of this on the syllabus.  Professors should not be able to add grading sections on canvas that are not in the syllabus after the semester is over when students are never told that these would be part of a final grade. ",

The presentations were sometimes tedious, but this may be due to the later time of day than the subject material, but overall I thought Dr. Cartter had good pacing, breaking up presentations with group discussions and videos. He was very helpful in keeping groups focused during group discussions and reminding the class of important things to keep in mind for each case study. "

            "\u00a0This course is really heavy on foodborne illness outbreaks - particularly in CT. While it is interesting to be in class taught by people working in the state health department and practicing applied public health, the class mainly focused on local outbreaks. If you are looking for a course that delves in outbreaks occurring across the globe this course does not cover that. ",

Just be prepared to do some self teaching and to do most of the synthesis of all the information yourself. The class sessions themselves can be dull and slow-moving, but every once in awhile we'll work through a fun case study. There's weekly homework, but usually something online that doesn't take too long to do. If you're looking for a thorough, well-organized course this is not the one for you. If you want some exposure to the field and access to interesting outbreak resources I think sitting through it is worth it. ",

I would highly recommend this course. While the work can tend to pile up some weeks, overall the class was very enjoyable. Students get the chance to work through past and potential disease outbreak cases, using data analysis tools and coming up with conclusions and recommendations. The course also introduces the steps of an outbreak, how to determine whether an outbreak is occurring or not, and what processes should be undertaken during an outbreak situation. Moreover, students get advice and tips from the instructors who work at the CT DPH, as well as getting to hear about their experiences and the lessons they learned. "
