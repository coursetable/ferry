            "\u00a0I was exposed to a wide array of literature and intellectual traditions within the field of religious study. Papers, section discussions, and exam prompts taught me how to think with sound philosophical reasoning and improved my reading comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to critically think about arguments and track the logic from the first premise. Thinking philosophically has become more natural to me. ",
            "\u00a0This is an intellectual religious class. If you liked Prof. Eire's Catholic Intellectual Tradition, I would highly recommend this class. The class is also very western-focused. Very good with highlighting Abrahamic arguments for God and about God, but if you are looking for something about Hinduism, for example, this class is not for you. ",
            "\u00a0As this was my first philosophy class, I learned about how to read, write, and talk about philosophy. I learned how to identify and restate the key points of an argument and how to look for objections to every paper, no matter how convincing, and to take into account the context of the piece (who wrote it, when and where, in response to what). ",
            "\u00a0We covered topics like the problem of evil, death and immortality, pluralism, cosmological, teleological, and ontological arguments for the existence of God. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of problem of evil, religious pluralism, faith and reason, science and faith, etc. Covered the philosophical topics relevant to religion ",
            "\u00a0I gained an insight into the thought of various philosophers across history on this very important subject and developed the skills to think about it myself. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me how to better parse out an argument from a text. ",
            "\u00a0Explored fundamental questions about evil, morality, and God. Read a lot of really interesting arguments for and against theism. Learned to structure philosophical arguments. Overall, really engaging contents and interesting overview of philosophy of religion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class. I learned about ways to evaluate morality and if it is cogent in a religious framework. I learned about how arguments for and against God. I learned about multiplicity in religions and how to grapple with religious experiences and religion as a reasonable person. I got even better as a philosophy writer and reader. And I go to think about my own beliefs as well. ",
            "\u00a0The ideas of prominent philosophers about major issues we must all encounter in life: the existence of God, the meaning of evil and suffering, the origin of the universe, the relationship between science and religious faith, the occurrence of miracles and mystical experiences. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job covering the most important areas within the philosophy of religion. Professor Hare is extremely knowledgeable and gave brilliant lectures about things like the problem of divine hiddenness and the arguments for the existence of God. Each lecture was extremely interesting, and the readings were short philosophical essays that were packed with important arguments. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you a thorough, well-organized, and fascinating overview of the philosophy of religion. The course certainly grants a central focus to the Christian tradition, but does not fail to provide glimpses into the alternating philosophies of Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam.  Every few weeks are focused on a particular subject, including Religion and Ethics, the Argument from Religious Experience, the Problem of Evil, Faith and Reason, Traditional Arguments for God, Death and Immortality, Miracles and Hiddenness, Science and Faith, and Religious Pluralism. As each of these topics could easily be a full-length course in and of themselves, the class is taught at a trotting pace, certainly more of a survey than other philosophy courses that focus on a particular subject, yet more in-depth than Intro courses. \r\n\r\nRegarding the content of the class, don't think for a moment that this course focuses on obscure systems of thought from ages past  the questions of this course are real, tangible, and live. You will dig into the foundation of ethics  why should you be good? Is a god or some transcendent good required for a coherent moral system? You will question the limits of logic and reason  can personal experiences override reasonable, calculated conclusions? Is belief simply a question of reason, or is it a question of psychology? You will get to discuss some of the most weighty questions humans face every day  why is there so much evil in this world? Can our existence still be fundamentally good in the face of so much suffering?  How could God, if he exists, allow for such suffering? Is it possible to know, with certainty, that God does or does not exist? To what degree of certainty is it possible to know anything at all? I could continue, but hopefully this provides a glimpse into the breadth of questions covered in this course. I would say there is a heavy focus on epistemology (essentially, how can you be certain of what you know?), which I really enjoyed, but metaphysics, normative ethics, and even aesthetics all play a prominent role in discussion as well. Beyond questions of philosophy, you will also be provided with a good look into the intellectual history of the past 2,000 years through the lens of religious thought  a rich and storied perspective that is often overlooked in other Yale courses.

            "\u00a0I think the reading quizzes were an unreasonable burden because there are ways to ensure that students are keeping up with the coursework that don't involve penalizing us for not interpreting very dense and difficult material perfectly accurately. I loved how discussion sections allowed us to explore the topics in ways that were applicable to our personal lives and ask questions freely. I think the lectures were especially insightful because the professor would expand on the reading material in unexpected and interesting ways. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- lectures are great and weekly questions are helpful\r\nWeakness- More engagement with how to write philosophical papers ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I learned a bit about how to form a philosophical argument\r\nWeaknesses: This class is really, really hard. I was Credit/D-ing, and I think most of the class was. Many of us were afraid of getting D's. The problem is the quizzes and the final, which require you to basically memorize a whole bunch of philosophical arguments and then regurgitate them. Memorizing the arguments is really tricky, and even figuring out what the philosophers are saying is tricky. Moving to a completely essay based format, or not making us memorize an entire book of philosophy would make this class better. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging content, great TA's, manageable workload. More engagement with the lecturer would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good overview of the field of Philosophy of Religion, helpful quiz questions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were a lot of assessments in the class. I might have gotten more out of the class if I either had written a final essay OR taken a final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the clear units and delineation of topics, the balanced range of readings and perspectives, the discussion sections, and the evenly distributed workload.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A. I really enjoyed this class!! ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lectures and the content and thought the course in general was wonderful. It might be able to be improved by laying a groundwork of what the major religions actually believe, what their individual philosophies of religion are, before attacking or defending them. The course often tried to lump all the religions together under one banner, which is difficult to do. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hare is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Readings are really interesting, but also really dense. The reading questions don't exactly always cover the key aspects of the reading so they aren't always super helpful for studying for the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong. The readings are interesting and not too large. The essays are fun too write. The lectures are absolutely amazing. The units are very well curated and the quizzes are very fair. The pace is fantastic, and we cover so much in a single semester. As far as I see it, there are no cons. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the content of the course is extremely interesting. It is a wonderful introduction to questions of significant importance. Prof. Hare is a superb lecturer, who speaks slowly and deliberately. Weaknesses: you must really keep up with the readings, which can be hard to do in this class. Without much philosophy experience, you will struggle. But asking for clarification and help frequently will keep you up to speed. ",
            "\u00a0Beyond the professor and syllabus which I have lauded in other sections of this evaluation, a perhaps surprisingly formative part of this class is that there are a good bunch of Divinity students within it, as it is cross-listed as a Div School class. As there were a few Div students in my section, the perspectives brought into discussion were more diverse than the typical cross-section of Yale undergraduates, and I found their contributions to be quite interesting and fruitful. I know most of the Div students generally had their own section, and that is entirely understandable for a number of reasons (not the least being location and different educational aims), but I did find the integration of Div students and Yale College students within my seminar to be a heartily positive attribute to the strength of the course. \r\n\r\nOn another note, while I feel more comfortable now in recognizing different strands of thought in Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, I feel my grasp of the intellectual traditions of Buddhism and Hinduism is not very strong. However, there is so much to do in so little time, it is hard to imagine what could be edited in the syllabus to carve out  space for more authors. (Arguably, I should just take a RLST class next semester that has the room to dive into what this course physically could not). "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in contemplating some of the most important questions about our world--but only if they're not afraid of receiving poor grades and if they're not afraid of a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take this class. However, this is not a fifth class. Do not, under any circumstance, believe that this is an easy class in any capacity. I cannot underscore this enough!!!! Take this class credit/d/fail. Or, take it for a letter grade and be content with a B as a good grade. \r\n\r\nYou will explore the reasons for God, the reasons for belief, the reasons to NOT believe, and so much more. This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nPro tip: when you take this class, keep in mind that the quizzes are entirely based on memorizing the answers to the reading questions distributed at the outset of the semester. Memorize. ",
            "\u00a0No, don't take this class. I was Credit/D-ing and I'm not sure if I passed. It's not an easy course, and it's not laid out well to facilitate learning for those who are not good at memorizing an entire textbook. It made my semester so miserable. Besides the brutal quizzes, there were also 2 papers, which were tricky to write. Prof. Hare was a decent lecturer, but I wouldn't recommend this course unless you're willing to memorize a lot of philosophy and spend hours reading esoteric texts. \r\n\r\nWe also only focused on Christianity, and in section there were a lot of uber-Christian people which made it seem like a fight between the atheists and the Christians. It got a bit tiring, and I think in general a larger focus on other religions would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course to explore all of the big, troublesome questions of religion from a philosophical perspective, getting an overview of the main arguments and influential philosophers. It was a great first philosophy course, because I was introduced to the big ideas of ancient and modern philosophy without it being a shallow introduction. I also got a lot of guidance in learning how to take a philosophy class, with great feedback on quizzes and papers and really engaging discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to anyone who wants an overview of the most interesting questions related to the philosophy of religion. However, the course may be less interesting for those who already have a solid background in the field or have taken other classes related to the questions explored in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a very well-organized class. You'll get out what you put in, but I found the readings to be really interesting (if a little dense some weeks). I would recommend this class if you're at all interested in religion. It critically examines a lot of commonly held beliefs or soundbite arguments about God in a respectful, balanced way. Really, really enjoyed this class. Try to get Sarah Zager for your TA if you can! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in philosophy. The religion component is obviously a big factor in the course but not in a spiritual context. Philosophy of religion stays very much within the realm of reason to understand the concept of God and its implications ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great content especially when taught by Professor Hare ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. It it a great way to start thinking about what is arguably the most important subject in philosophy. I found my previous ideas challenged and refined, all in the spirit of healthy inquiry. I also found myself thinking deeply about the subject matter and even proposing my very own thoughts in papers and in class. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Professor Hare is amazing and the TFs (Dylan and Sarah) are both wonderful as well! ",
            "\u00a0Even though the content is engaging and interesting, it's a bit hard to keep up. The quizzes cover a lot of content and in a good amount of detail, so it's a lot of work to study for them. The class covers really interesting material though, and we read a lot of arguments that offered insightful answers to questions about religion that I've always had. Just a lot of content, so a bit stressful even as a credit/D. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student of any religion or lack thereof wanting to think about lifes biggest questions and what it means to be human and in search for meaning in his world. Really try to take any course at all with Professor Hare. He is the best professor I have ever had, a brilliant and kind man. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course content is fantastic. You will not regret exposing yourself to the various ideas and opinions that are out there about our very existence. Prof. Hare is a wonderful lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting, and the professor is amazing. Even for people who are not religious, this course provides a great deal of knowledge about religion. This is especially true given that many of your classmates will be students in the Divinity School, which is cool. ",
            "\u00a0YES! TAKE! THIS! CLASS! This course is the type of Humanities gem that students come to Yale for. It is unlikely that you will have come across the course material before or ever will in another context  unless, perhaps, you attended a rigorously religious grade school, and in that case, all the more reason to dive in deeper! Some texts, like Anselms Ontological Argument, Aquinass Five Ways, and Maimonidess discourse on the attributes of God, are encountered in Fall DS Philosophy, but they only provide a brief glimpse into the field of the Philosophy of Religion. A great strength of this course is that it includes a good number of contemporary (or near-contemporary) authors in the syllabus, an important component that is absent from the Spring DS syllabus. The field of the philosophy of religion, I would say, is currently enjoying a revival, and its exciting to be in the midst of all of it. \r\nRegardless, no matter how familiar or unfamiliar you are with the material, it will be a mind-widening class that I guarantee will capture your fascination. Whether Humanities, STEM, or anything in between, this class will be completely worth your time and energy. "
