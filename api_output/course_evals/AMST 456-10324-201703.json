            "\u00a0Professor Agnew is brilliant and the course texts are all very engaging. I did feel as if the discussion could've used a bit more structure at times, for when Agnew did jump in it oftentimes felt as if he moved the discussion in very specific directions where some of us were a bit lost, but overall I did feel as if I walked out of every seminar with a new take on the week's readings. ",
            "\u00a0I disliked that the class was based largely on secondary sources. We would normally read only one secondary source (typically a book) each week. Without additional readings it was difficult to think and speak critically about the books we were reading and made it hard to have a productive discussion. It would be helpful if the professor provided more structure for class discussions. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. As a history major I had always been interested primarily in political history but this course brings cultural history of the industrial revolution and progressive era to the forefront. I learned many things that I wouldn't have even thought about otherwise, which has made my appreciation of history all the greater. Professor Agnew is very knowledgeable about the time period and all the readings facilitate the discussion very well. The final essay is very stressful and time consuming, but very rewarding once completed. ",

",
            "\u00a0This class is quite unstructured, which I found frustrating. That being said, if everyone in the class is engaged with the readings you can learn quite a lot, and the final project gives you room to explore your own interests within the time period. "
