            "\u00a0This was my first foray into screenwriting and I learned so much about the proper format of screenplays and about telling stories in general. Workshopping with classmates was so rewarding and intensely fun. I learned to look at stories from a new perspective, where the building blocks of plot and dialogue are fluid, can be moved around and chopped up in different ways to craft an engaging narrative. ",

            "\u00a0This course is good, but I think the reading requirement could be a bit larger, especially if we spend reading scripts as a class. I would have preferred a bit more direction in terms of the midterm packet requirements, but Lapadula turned out to be a relatively easy grader and the assignments were pretty straight forward.  A canvas site would be nice. ",
