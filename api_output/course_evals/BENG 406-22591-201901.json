Also, at the end of the semester, putting together the proposal felt really rushed - although we had the material we needed throughout the semester, reorganizing them into the proposal didnt reallt walk us through how to write a proper SBIR proposal.

I'd recommend it if you're curious about how software design works, i.e. the workflow of the entire process and all the requisite documentation. I wouldn't recommend it if you're interested in seriously developing medical software, as while this is the focus of the second half of the course, there isn't very much time to actually do software development. I.e. if you want a class that teaches you and tests you on making applications, this isn't the class for you (it isn't rigorous enough tbh). ",
