            "\u00a0Learned a lot about biomaterials and real life examples and engineered bio products.  It was one of the only classes with more tea examples of things.  Lot of interesting papers. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge with regards to tissue interaction and biotechnology. Our body comes in contact with so much technology and we give very little credit to scientists who work on ensuring these materials are bio-compatible and \"inert\" to prevent bio-toxicity. We learnt about sensor design, bio-compatibility tests, histology and immuno-histochemistry, vascular graft designs, surgical interventions etc.. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about major factors and processes in the body's response to the use of biomaterials and how materials have been designed to minimize this response. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome - the main topics concerned modern biomaterials and biomedical devices and whatnot. It was incredibly informative concerning current applications - it was great to see the current and recent innovations taking place ",
            "\u00a0This class gives you a general idea of how research should be conducted and what mistakes to avoid. It also teaches you how to read scientific papers and analyze figures/graphs. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the human body interacts with foreign implants. I also learned a lot about what makes studies and research good. ",

            "\u00a0A better understanding of how to examine scientific studies in the field of biomaterials. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course about all types of implants and how the body reacts to them. The class centers on the immune system's foreign body response to anything we put in the body and reviews a ton of current literature on how researchers are trying to overcome the response to make implants more viable. ",
            "\u00a0This class was all about the foreign body response from multiple different perspectives - biological/chemical/physical with emphasis on the biological.  It gave me insight into the processes that affect how the human body responds to implants and medical devices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the applications of biomaterials and the challenges associated with their longevity and performance upon incorporation into tissue. This class also taught me how to read scientific papers with a critical eye that does not take the literature at face value. "

            "\u00a0The course draws from many publication data, real life examples, and personal experience anecdotes of the professor, making it very interesting and linked to real life applications. However, both the lectures and the slides materials themselves lacked clear organization throughout, making it difficult to keep track of the topics covered and their transitions, both during lectures and later while studying. ",
            "\u00a0The course was always interesting because it focused on another field of BME and gave a lot of information about different kind of implants and focuses on addressing the foreign body response. It was at 9am so it was hard to stay awake in class sometimes and it would sometimes be challenging to hear and follow along with the lecture, but it was straightforward and engaging otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: really really interesting material and amazing professor!! No real weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nMaterial was very interesting \r\nTeacher was engaging ",
            "\u00a09am was rough at times but the material is super interesting.  It has a lot of real life examples of actual papers and actual bio products which made this class unique and very interesting.  Themis is also funny and super knowledable.  He is clearly an expert in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Very informative, and well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are super interesting, but sometimes it can be hard to keep up because they are very fast-paced. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a broad range of topics, but I think the overall structure of the course throughout the semester was a bit scattered. It might have been helpful to structure the course a bit more thematically, so the lessons would be easier to follow.\r\n\r\nAlso, I liked the focus on analyzing the results of scientific papers, but I would have liked more coverage of straight material, like general immunological processes and the design of biomaterials. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class was awesome - good subject matter, great professor and TAs, well run and well formatted. Grade was composed of 5 short homework assignments and 3 non cumulative exams, all of which were open note. This places the onus not on extreme studying before tests, but simply on being present and taking good notes throughout the semester which is by far the more preferable way to do things. All in all, a great course. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very organized in the order of the lectures. The 2 midterms and final exam are open notes which is a strength because you don't have to remember very specific facts, but rather the class has a focus on understanding research methods and critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0It was very interesting. I think that there could be slightly more discussion of the biomaterials that the implants are made of. ",
            "\u00a0Themis is an amazing professor and the course material is very interesting. The TA's weren't always the most helpful in answering questions in review sessions, however. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the focus on examining primary literature, and Themis is a good-natured lecturer in general. Could be improved if the slides were adapted to be more up to date each year, as it seemed many of the slides were re-used a lot from past years. Also, a more descriptive syllabus to give a sense of the overall arc of the course would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the main weakness is the class being at 9am. The lectures are really fun to listen to and engage with, but sometimes difficult in the morning. I think the main strength of the course is Themis Kyriakides himself, who is an awesome lecturer that really brings personality to the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The open-note format for exams focused the course on learning how to think critically about challenges facing the biomaterials field, rather than memorization. I also really enjoyed the writing assignments; they were a great way to see the concepts we learned in class put to use in creating and testing biomaterials for novel uses. Weaknesses: The lectures could be a little disorganized and confusing; it was sometimes difficult to figure out the most important takeaways from individual lecture slides. I also wish the class had focused more on engineering and problem solving, rather than pure biology related to molecular and cellular events. "

            "\u00a0yeah, if you meet the requirements and can commit to coming in at 9 am (and you definitely should actually go to class) then it's a fairly easy high-level BME class ",
            "\u00a0A quite interesting class with a professor that has definitely gained much real life experience to offer key insights on the topic. Organization is a little lacking so you need to make an effort to keep track, but the workload is quite light, and the exams are often open-notes. Topic-wise it is definitely a fascinating, important, and long-underappreciated field, so it's definitely cool to study it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! super chill, interesting class and AMAZING professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes highly recommend.  Work load is 2 open note midterms and an open note final.  Then 5 shorter writing assignments that are 1 page single spaced and dont take that long to do.  Material is super interesting and well presented.  Lot of real life examples of products and materials and goes through a lot of recent papers so super interesting and relevant.  Much more application based than any other engineering, BME class Ive taken ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A very good class, worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0This is a pretty solid BME elective; the workload is really low and the lectures are generally very interesting. Tests are open note, but this means you have to be super attentive during lectures because Themis goes very quickly and everything he says is important/can be tested over. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great partner to BENG 434 and helped me feel like my knowledge of the body and biomaterials was much stronger. I would recommend this course as a solid BME elective for anyone in the biomolecular track. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - if youre BME major, this is a great elective. Informative and interesting but not too intense a workload and exams which are not as stressful since theyre open note. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. If you enjoy learning about implants and have an inclination to biology, this is a very fascinating class. The lectures are really interesting, and you not only learn about biomaterials/device, but you also learn general research methods, how to analyze scientific figures, and research mistakes to avoid. The class has a very low workload. There only 5 writing assignments in the semester which take no more than an hour to do. The two midterms and final are all open notes, so as long as you go to lectures and take good notes you will be fine. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this class. I am a MechE major, but I could still understand all the bio concepts because they are presented very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0As a MechE student taking this course as an elective, I struggled at first but Themis was very willing to work with me to improve and excel in the course. Ended up being much more work for me than most of the other students, but well worth it. Definitely recommend as an interesting and generally not very time intensive class! ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if you want to spend time examining a variety of scientific papers on biomaterials from Themis's perspective. You'll likely leave with some sense of an array of proteins and biomaterial targets that have been studied by the research community, to further the goal of reducing foreign body reactions and improve the success of implantable biomaterials. It's unlikely you'll leave with a great sense of where the field is going, or with any really cohesive sense of biomaterial targets, but you will likely better understand how to read papers with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, you need a bit of a background in biology to really understand everything in the course, but it doesn't require a lot and you learn some really cool things about the human body and the forefront of research into biomaterials, implants and tissue engineering. ",
            "\u00a0Because the exams are open-notes, it's often tempting to have this class be the one that is neglected in a heavy course load semester.  To do well, you really only need to be present (mentally present and alert), and take good notes in the class.  However, it is tempting for many people (including me) to do not even that.   Just pay attention and you will actually learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0For BME majors, this is an easy yet still very interesting and informative elective. The class has a very light workload with three open-note exams, which are very fair and come directly from the lectures and readings. The short writing assignments are also a good way to learn more about recent developments in the field of biomaterials. I would definitely recommend BENG 435 if you're looking for a chill class that explores a fascinating subject. "
