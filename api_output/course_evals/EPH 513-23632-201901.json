            "\u00a0This course was EXTREMELY POORLY CONDUCTED. I've heard non-stop complaints about this course since the beginning of the semester. How can you have 3 completely different subjects covered in a single course? They say it's for accreditation but this course was an absolute waste of time and money. Individual assignments were not helpful in understanding course material and the group assignments made me feel like I was back in middle school. The course wanted to emphasize systems thinking and group collaboration but 70% of this course is individual work. Over the semester, this course kept changing, which made it difficult to prepare for the final. Individual assignment questions were very unfair. I prepared so much for them through studying the lecture slides, reading papers, and even watching Youtube videos. My preparation didn't help at all. The individual assignments also included questions about epidemiology, which put so many students at a disadvantage if they had not reviewed concepts from Epi 1 from first semester. They really should have made this course online to save time and frustration. ",

The instructors tried to make it more interactive, so people felt responsible to be there for their team. \r\n\r\nThe course was very disorganized. This caused me a lot of anxiety when trying to plan out my work and study schedule. There needs to be more consistency between modules, so we can learn to know what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most unorganized class I have taken at YSPH and oftentimes made me feel overwhelmed and confused. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Unorganized Canvas site\r\n- Did not follow Syllabus \r\n- Too many assignments (3 assignments per module + final was overwhelming) \r\n- Poorly utilized class time (blocked out 1 hour and 50 minutes/ 2 x a week ], yet all assignments were given other days of the week)\r\n- Harkness auditorium is not conducive for group work \r\n- Lack of clarity on how to prepare for individual assignments \r\n- Assessments did not reflect material taught in class\r\n- Assigned seating; I was forced to sit in the back of a crowded auditorium which was not conducive to learning \r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\n- Engaging reading \r\n- Breakout sessions were the most meaning experiences ",
            "\u00a0This course was completely disorganized and random. The topics covered, although important, had too many things for one class which led to a lot of information and they demanded expertise in each. ",
            "\u00a0variety of topics, important ones, but a large crowd (sometimes unmanagable) ",
            "\u00a0Honestly? This class was a mess. I feel like it was YSPH's attempt to simply meet CEPH accreditation requirements, and as someone studying neither AMR, obesity, nor climate change (and as someone conscious of other MHTs, like those related to socioeconomic status), I found the class incredibly disappointing.\r\n\r\nClearly attention was given to the structure of the course, but the end concept didn't translate (at all). It often felt like the equivalent of an online class, and I did not come to this program to have that experience. The individual exams felt more like standardized tests (i.e. knowing how to \"read between the lines\" of test questions) than assessments of my understanding of the course material (i.e. pulling from content of course lectures). I never felt properly equipped to know how to study for these exams.\r\n\r\nForcing students to work together in pre-assigned groups also created a lot of problems given the disparity between maturity levels and professional experience prior to the program. While my group managed to find a groove by the final assignment, we faced a lot of stressful and frustrating problems throughout the better part of the semester.\r\n\r\nExpectations on the final (whether it would be online, in person, etc) were unclear until the end of the semester, and I still don't feel confident in my understanding of course material (or how the exam will be structured). Example questions or study guides would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This course was all over the place. The climate change module seemed well thought out and planned. The leadership lectures and groups seemed out of place. The leadership reflections seemed like busywork, especially for advanced professional students. There was little substantive feedback on group assignments and much of it seemed like busywork. The negotiation workshop was good and can be improved as an example of public health in practice. Not having the slides before lecture inhibited my learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class was poorly designed. Three very different professors. Assessments and expectations changed throughout the semester. None of it seemed cohesive. Just a mess thrown together. I don't like feeling like a guinea pig in grad school, but that's what this course has felt like. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-intentioned course. I appreciated the opportunity to learn from different professors and engage with various public health topics. I enjoyed the fact that the course took a different approach than any other class I have taken. There were a few bumps in the road. I understand that there are generally hiccups when running a course for the first time. I enjoyed working with my peers in our group throughout the semester, but I believe there should be a group evaluation at the end of the semester. Some group members were more engaged than others, and I think it would be fair to award students participant points based on their peers' evaluations. Also, there were many assignments, and I think the class could have benefitted from some more clarity about deadlines and expectations. Overall, I enjoyed the different interactive assignments (debate, obesity working problem). ",
            "\u00a0This was an extremely disorganized course that was not catered toward the entire first-year class by any means. Many of the topics necessitated far more than a basic understanding of biology-- as someone in the Policy department, many of the scientific rhetoric went right over my head and there were no opportunities for rudimentary review or further reading to establish a baseline understanding of what was being discussed. I do not doubt the brilliance of the professors who taught the course, but they clearly assumed that all students would have a much more in-depth scientific background than I and many of my peers felt we have to tackle the material in this course. \r\n\r\nProfessor Dubrow, notably, did the best job at establishing context for the Climate Change module, thanks to choosing accessible yet interesting readings and sharing his instructional climate change videos with us. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the group I was matched with and feel lucky to have the group members I did, but felt that requiring us to sit in our groups for every lecture was overbearing. Attendance was also taken for every single lecture, which I also felt was overboard, especially in the greater context of YSPH classes which (in my experience) trust students to do their work and show up to class, but also understand that sometimes conflicts arise, that we may not want to sit in the same seat with the same people for every class, nor that being monitored by a TA actually will increase the understanding of a class overall. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really poorly organized. Everything changed on the go.\r\nTeaching was really poor for the climate change module. Information was repetitive.\r\nThe place assigned for the course was not appropriate to work in groups, as the instructors proposed.\r\nThe group work was really hard and there were notable differences in participation and time investment for the assignments among different people in the group. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of potential--the modules were all about interesting and relevant topics, and I like group discussion. However, the auditorium was not conducive for group work. The lectures were kind of bland and I had trouble paying attention; they could have been more engaging. Overall, it felt poorly organized. The exams did not reflect the content covered throughout the year and sometimes it was hard to pin down what I actually learned. My engagement with the class decreased over time because I felt more and more frustrated and was not learning much. ",
            "\u00a0I am truly disappointed in this class. It was very much an epidemiology class, but was marketed to be interdisciplinary. As a health policy student, it felt completely inapplicable to my specialization. The tests were tremendously difficult and the group assignments non-sensical and incredibly frustrating - because we were split into groups to work on group assignments, it seemed that the instructors wanted us to collaborate as a team. However, groups who delegated the assignments to the team leaders seemed to get better scores (ie, rewarded for not working as a group on a group project). It seems like the class was meant to check \"capabilities\" boxes, so it was very disjointed. I feel robbed out of a class this semester - when the program is so short, every credit counts. I don't feel like I learned enough applicable or useful information to justify having to take this class, and wish I could've spent this time in a class I could've made use of. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt very disjointed and disorganized. I felt as though I was taking 3 different classes (climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and obesity). It was challenging to grasp the material when we were changing gears so quickly. Additionally, expectations for the course were not clear. During the climate change module, we had advanced notice of the group/individual assignment and were able to plan ahead. For the AMR and obesity modules, however, the assignments were released very close to the deadline. I felt as though these group assignments were very rushed. The dates for individual assignments also deviated from the syllabus and there was very short advanced notice. Sitting with your group each class is also challenging and contributed to the disorganization of the course. People were often climbing over each other in the auditorium and discussions were difficult in this setting. I think that having lecture followed by smaller sections for group work (in a classroom) would be beneficial. Finally, working in groups can be a strength, but I believe the course emphasized this component too heavily (sitting together in class, three group assignments, and several group activities). Overall I had a positive experience with my group, but many other classmates struggled taking on much more work while their group members were absent or unwilling to help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- I came to enjoy the climate change model and while no one will accuse Dr. Dubrow of being overly animated, he knows his stuff.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- quite frankly, just about everything else in this class. I understand this was a new 'concept' class and the topics are required through the Public Health Accreditation, but this class needs to be seriously re-thought. The AMR module was so technical and detailed, I overhead some Dr's in the class commenting that it was more detailed than they got in medical school. The obesity module was ok and the leadership reflections were forced hype of the worst kind.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest issue is that the professors were really ambitious thinking that they were going to get an entire lecture hall to behave like a small seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think in theory the course could have been amazing- I loved the concept of topic-based modules and rotating professors. The team-based work was also a great idea. However, in application the course was unfortunately a bit of a disaster. There was no accountability for group members, so people often ended up just not coming to class or not doing any work whatsoever for group assignments. Perhaps a QR code or a short prompt for students to complete would be helpful in order to track attendance. It was also just so difficult logistically to have discussions in the middle of class that were actually productive when we were spread out so much and in such a loud environment. I really enjoyed the idea behind some of the in-class assignments, like the causal loop diagrams or intervention design, but I feel like I didn't actually gain anything from them because they were so rushed with little thought put in due to pressure to simply get something in. \r\n\r\nI think ultimately a lot of the issues stemmed from it just being too big of a class to be conducive to the meaningful goals of the course.  I know this would be more of a time commitment for the professors because they would need to teach the whole semester rather than just one module, but one idea is to split the class into 3 separate groups that would rotate through modules throughout the semester (with one starting in obesity, one starting in climate change, and one starting in AMR). This way, the class size would at least be cut down by 2/3 for the immediate learning environment. It could also be good to break the 2 lectures a week into two themes: the first topic-based and the second activity-based to make the in-class activities more impactful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a combination of parts that may not be useful for biostatistics student. The contents of course is fragmented. The intent for the course is good: to let public health student know more about the public health issues. However, the components of the course is not to let student know a broad picture but some soecific points, which is not as efficient because of too much biological language which leads to high difficulty for non-biology-related major students. The content of leadership,!systematic thinking as well as negotiations are left superficially and do not help. ",
            "\u00a0I really didn't like this course. It felt like it had been thrown together while I liked each professor of the course individually, I felt very uninterested in the course as a whole. I would have appreciated having the option to replace this course with a relevant elective that gave more specialized, in depth knowledge about MHT than this course provided. It was choppy and the evaluations for student learning were unusual to say the least  the online open-book quizzes were marginally representative of the material discussed in class (I felt like the AMR quiz was designed for students in EMD with a more advanced understanding of AMR than most). I think the climate change module was the most interesting/well-organized of the three. The assignments felt like busy work. And the break out sessions didn't help to make the class (of 200+) feel more intimate. In fact, the group projects were sophomoric and rather boring. But if CEPH needed it for our accreditation, then I guess YSPH did its job. Since the class is a required course, I guess stating that \"I wouldn't recommend this course\" doesn't really matter. Just finish it/try to enjoy. I hope they fix some of the kinks before next year. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not great...it was poorly designed and organized, had way too many assignments, and in-class group work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Summary of critical issues in the field of public health (climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and obesity) condensed into a one-semester course. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Each module was very rushed, and taught by professors who are incredibly knowledgable in their respective fields, which unfortunately led to a deeper than necessary focus on niche topics more than on a broader understanding of the complexities of the issues. Furthermore, group work was incredibly frustrating to complete due to the lack of an attendance policy. The attempts to focus on leadership development and group work would be much more effective if attendance were required. ",
            "\u00a0I was excited for this course; however, it was a mess from the beginning. For one, the syllabus is unorganized and confusing. I expected to learn big picture ideas from each of the modules, but the lecturers instead presented very specific topics that I did not think were necessary. The first two modules were okay, but I do not think that evaluating a research paper is conducive to learning about climate change. The third module felt like a waste of time. I feel like by tuition dollars were wasted in this course, and I expect something better from an institution like Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This class has so many weaknesses. It was really disorganized, the syllabus was not adhered to at all, the professors seemed as confused about the direction of the course as the students. The class just had too much going on: negations, debates, writing policy briefs one week and then health communication plans the next. It didn't feel like we were learning, just being shuffled around from busy-work to busy-activities. I didn't feel challenged by the course, just irritated. And the individual assessments were all out of left-field. Getting the correct answer was a matter of semantics, rather than a matter of knowing the material. The structure of this class really needs some work. ",
            "\u00a0It was a horribly executed course. Instructors did not take into consideration the scope and point of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course material and topics, however, the organization of it made it difficult to grasp main concepts. \r\n\r\nThe modules may need to cover more basics for those who do not have a background in the subject. \r\n\r\nGroup essays were not an enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a waste of time. And at that, a stressful and time consuming waste. The biggest areas for improvement are as follows:\r\n1) Professors did not seem to know what our background is. In particular, the AMR professor and obesity to some extent, seemed to think we had an understanding of the basics of what they were talking about. I DID NOT. most people in the policy department did not. No attempt was made to bridge this gap. Overly technical, and little understanding of what the takeaways are supposed to be. To me (policy bias, I know.), a class like this should be aimed at helping us to understand potential solution to all of these major health threats, and this was accomplished in NONE of these classes. Obesity and AMR are naturally interesting- over fixation on random things like biomarkers made this class completely useless.\r\n2) The assessments were TERRIBLE and unfair. They did NOT test the material, and there was no way to improve. For AMR, extremely technical language was used, and it was not uncommon for me to only understand about 1/10 words of each question. A more thorough assessment of the non-emd students' background was needed. For me to improve my performance on these assignments, I would just have to take Epi 2... most of the questions could NOT be answered by what we learned in this class alone.\r\n3) I was not blessed with a group that has natural writing skills, meaning I ended up doing about 3x as much work as everyone else. They'll probably get a better overall grade than me. This class does not balance strengths and weaknesses. If you are a good writer but don't know much about biology or epi (I.e. most of the policy department), you end up having to do all the work for everyone else but then left on your own on these ridiculous individual assignments. I reported in every single \"leadership evaluation\" thing that I was doing a hugely disproportionate amount of my groups work. Even the one kid who literally did not contribute to a single group assignment will probably get a better grade than me overall, despite putting in like 1/20th of the work. ",

It was a poorly designed and confusing course. The instructors seemed to be bottom of the barrel and the assignments were arbitrarily graded. The exams were far too difficult, even for someone paying attention in class. The group project aspect of the course was a nuisance but at least there were people you could commiserate with. The TF team seemed equally as frustrated. This was just a perfect example of a course gone wrong. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nPart 0: The leadership portion of the course was confusing. I understood what it was trying to do but it wasn't effective. The instructor was not really engaging. The lecture itself was all over the place. Just a mess. \r\n\r\nPart 1: During the climate change module, we learned that climate change was leading to excessive drying in some parts of the world. What *wasn't* mentioned in class was that the professor's lectures were in fact the driest things on Earth. The professor was just not the most engaging personality. And the \"supplemental videos\" were unnecessary. If you can't fit all the information you got into the lecture time then rethink your portion of the course. The group assignment was really out of left field and not related to the course.  It didn't help us engage with the material. This was a horrible way to begin the course. It had the potential to be really interesting but the delivery fell flat. \r\n\r\nPart 2: Melinda was fine. She was probably the best professor. But she just had this aura of being \"over it.\" Which is fine, because we were too. The AMR stuff was the most interesting and most engaging portion of the course. The interactive components like the debate and negotiation were not really needed (they felt thrown in) but they were a welcome break from lecture.\r\n\r\nPart 3: This part was an ABSOLUTE MESS. The lecture slides were made by a third grader. The instructor was way too all over the place. I could not follow her. She just had way too much to say about nothing at all. I just left this portion of the course feeling tired by all of the tomfoolery that had occurred throughout the entire semester. The group assignment was horribly misguided and didn't help me learn any new skills or push myself. It was just busy work. This was probably the worst part of the course based on content. \r\n\r\nThis was just a horrible class. Absolutely no merits. ",

            "\u00a0I think they tried to cover too many things in one course. You can't have a course that includes leadership, systems thinking, health communications, climate change, AMR, and obesity. Those are all huge topics that could all be a course in themselves. I don't feel like I gained any real knowledge from the course, except for some basic understanding of the three main topics. I would honestly have preferred to take a whole class on one of these subjects than taking a course that tried to fit in too many topics. ",
            "\u00a0Garbage course. Better for a student to take a course in one of the three modules separately than taking this overview of all three with minimal knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0not interested in this topic, have no idea why we make it a core class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was based on a great premise. I definitely like the idea of having students work in an interdisciplinary team to tackle major public health issues. However, the course did not live up to its potential. The three professors were definitely intelligent and experts in their respective niche fields, but I think they got lost in the details and did not communicate the material well for a broader public health audience. Not all students in the class were in EMD or EHS or CDE or had a background in biology or biochemistry to understand the nitty gritty details of antimicrobial resistance or the specific pathogen or antibiotics for certain strains. Requiring students without a biology background or those in HP or HCM to sit through dry lectures on horizontal gene transfer is absolutely ridiculous. I understand that knowing a bit of biology is helpful, but what is the stretch from memorizing different antigens or different types of green house gases or different types of fat to passing legislation to address these major health threats from a structural approach? The course's idea was great, but it should not turn into a biology course and in the end give students zero tangible skills to apply in future public health settings (i.e. not everyone will work in a lab setting to figure out virus strains). Also, I was disappointed that group assignments were only 10% of our grade each while the multiple choice format final was of 30%. These multiple choice questions were on nitty gritty details about the material that added little value to our development (anyone could just look things up on Google). On the other hand, we spent a lot of time and energy on group assignments, which I found to be more meaningful as they actually required us to think critically. I wish an assignment like that could have been something we all worked on throughout the semester, not just a few weeks. The course should also give students the option to choose a topic of their interest and come up with an action plan for it. I think these assignments are more meaning and have more practical implications. Again, I think the course has a lot of potential; it just needs to be made more general for a wider public health audience and focuses on expanding students' skillsets, not their knowledge of the nitty gritty details of science. This is a course for a Master's degree, which is a professional degree, so the course should focus on developing tangible skills. I think it was a bit ridiculous to force students to follow text book principles of leadership and followership whereas these dynamics typically develop organically in the real world. While I understand that the school needs to meet certain requirements for accreditation purposes, I think that instead of treating leadership as if it was a box to be checked, the school should require all core classes or certain departmental courses to have a group work component in the syllabi. That way students aren't forced to carry a label of being a leader or a follower and instead just developing their own work dynamics on something tangible and applicable. Also, requiring students to take this course their first year for accreditation purposes simply makes no sense when students still graduate from Yale with the course on their transcript no matter what. It was demoralizing for students to have taken this class where they didn't learn any valuable new skills due to the way it was executed; MPH is a professional degree, and we could have taken a skills-based class in place of this to boost our skillset to be competitive in our internship search. There should be a balance between providing students knowledge and providing students skills. Lastly, I found it ironic that while the course urged students to think of major health threats from a big picture perspective (case in point: the last lecture on system thinking wrapped everything up and drove this point home), the MC assignments were on the nitty gritty details. ",
            "\u00a0This was truly the worst course I've ever taken. I think I was lost the entirety of the course. I felt that for a course that was supposed to synthesize the core from the previous semester, the modules asked for a very niche understanding of content, especially AMR. Additionally, instead of fostering collaboration by assigning groups, this came across more of micro-management (i.e. sit with your groups in lecture). I felt that the space (lecture hall) wasn't conducive to the type of conversation the instructors intended. While in theory the course had all the components to be great (collaboration, synthesis, modular structure), but practice was a whole other story.

Having to work in teams overall wasn't the problem but I think there should have been some sort of penalty system towards those in the groups who weren't contributing. The climate section had some parts that were just way too technical for an intro, and also I felt like the topics weren't really centered around public health. There should have been a much stronger presence of health overall. For the antimicrobial resistance module it was also very technical for an intro. I would say the same about the obesity module as well. I wish it focused more on diseases and overviews / big picture topics. The individual assignments were WAY too knit picky. They should have been testing us on broader themes and larger take aways. Overall, this course needs to be redesigned to cover larger view topics. It might have been better to break it up into three different classrooms and have us all rotate from one to the other after a few weeks so it's not such a large lecture and more personal / spark more discussion. I think it's important for us to be exposed to these topics, but it was not executed well at all.

Some content was so basic I found myself in need of a coloring book. Other content was so super specific, I found myself wondering if I would ever need to know it again. I wished the course focused a little more in the middle -- enough detail to understand critical issues - and more about what are we going to do about it. I wished for more discussion from professors about their ideas and solutions - or what has been tried and proven not successful. I found myself wondering so what often.  As I understand it, the fall curriculum was also mostly new, however those classes flowed much better. This course was a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I am very disappointed in this course. I love the concept of every public health professional being competent in major topics that transcend our departments.  However, the execution of the course was very poor. It felt sloppy and on-the-fly until the end. The fact that each module was organized so differently than the last, it made learning very difficult. Additionally, this lack of consistency made it difficult to learn because the teaching style change 3 times. Next year, each module should be organized exactly like the last. The professors need to agree on this. The individual \"assignments\" were midterms not so cleverly disguised. Timed and only available for a short period of time. It's an exam, not an assignment. 3 exams is annoying. I understand an exam for each module but still annoying. The \"special topics\" were a waste. Health communication and leadership are indeed skills and knowledge we need. But cramming this all into one course was a horrible idea. It was a disaster. These special topics can just be organized into mandatory Professional Skills Seminars that are offered during orientation so there is no class conflict and everyone can make it. They do not belong in this course. I felt like a genuinely learned during the climate change module. I came out of it feeling well primed to take an in-depth course on climate change. AMR wasn't overly informative because I'm in EMD. I'm not sure I learned anything during the Obesity module. The lectures were not organized well. The actual slides were barely legible and were just a cluster of random graphs and figures with barely any actual written content that I could learn from. I would also argue that addiction might be a better module than obesity. Especially considering New Haven itself having ongoing issues with substance use and the mass poisoning from last August. ",

I have two major problems with the course. \r\n1. Changes!: The format of the exam changed, format of the assignments changed, due dates changed, the syllabus changed. And I really don't understand the reason of changing the format of an assignment since this was a new course. It was acceptable if they had bad experiences from the previous year (or at least from the first one) and change it but why are you doing this from the first assignment, and without any data? Where is the evidence-based approach that you focused all semester-long? I felt that we were not trusted.\r\n2. I was really tired to get e-mails about this course! Almost everyday, we were receiving e-mails, at least one. After a certain point, I lost paying attention and was saying \"ah, another e-mail from MHT\" \r\nI really appreciate the enthusiasm of the all instructors who were experts in their field and I am thankful to them, the course just need to be improved and structured more effectively ",

            "\u00a0From the beginning it was clear that the convoluted structure (in content and administration) was designed for the sole purpose of satisfying new CEPH requirements. The pieces did not at all fit together well, which frustrated both the professors and students. This course had several weaknesses for which I would provide the following recommendations:\r\n1. This course was VERY biology-heavy, which is unreasonable for a core course that is intended to reach a broad audience, most of whom do not have a biology background. This led to a high level of frustration among students. Future iterations of this course should be more accessible.\r\n2. The assessments did not reflect what we \"learned\" in class. Much of the time, these tested synthesis and application of the material. However, many of the students did not have a strong enough background in the material itself to synthesize and apply it in the manner we were being tested. This led to very low grades and frustrated, angry students. In the future, individual assessments should more explicitly test lecture material itself. While this is a graduate level public health course, most of us do not have a strong background in biology. \r\n3. The grading for this class did not make much sense and was not communicated clearly. For group assignments, professors admitted their grading scale was \"subjective\" and when taking off points often only gave vague comments related to the prose of a group essay rather than the content provided. In many cases students received comments equating to \"great content; essay structure needs work.\" This was particularly confusing given that students were under the impression they were being graded on their group collaboration and mastery of the information rather than their writing ability.\r\n4. There was an unreasonable amount of work for this course. Students were so focused on accomplishing one task after another that they were not able to assimilate the material. This was a particular challenge because both the individual component and the group component appeared to be equally important. In the future, instructors should choose what will be the focus of the course-- either individual work or group work. \r\n5. The course structure (quick, modular, unrelated components) did not promote student understanding. Like the assessments, students learned how to get from one topic/assessment to the next and just manage one hurdle after another. In other words, students spent so much time and effort trying to understand the administrative side of the course that it made it difficult to retain content. \r\n6. Eliminate assigned seating in the lecture hall, and eliminate group cold calls. This only made the course more stressful for students. \r\n\r\nThe only strength of this course was that it \"checked the boxes.\" However, in doing so, it really was just trying to do too much.  \r\n\r\nOverall, this course should be significantly restructured in future years, or eliminated altogether. If restructuring is an option, I would recommend breaking  up the components of this course and incorporating them into the existing MPH core classes or department-specific courses (i.e. HPM students focus on policy-related issues of these topics; CDE/EMD students focus on the epidemiology-related components of these topics). ",
            "\u00a0Very disorganized, the goals of the course were not clearly set out or executed. Expectations were variable and the exams were not indicative of how much we knew about the topic. The exams were more about trying to trick the students with small details than to test knowledge. The exams almost felt like standardized testing, reading comprehension. The due dates for things were sporadic and sometimes the workload and how it was distributed was inconsiderate of the fact that most students are juggling many other courses and internships. The group activities as a whole were actually really effective and fulfilling, but the way the material was taught and the exams were absolutely useless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - covers a broad range of important topics.\r\nWeaknesses - the use of the group projects/group layout was not particularly effective, especially in Harkness (the physical space was not conducive to group learning). The group assignments often seemed slightly meaningless as well, seemed like they were just a lot of fluff/not much substance. 100-200 student lecture style is not usually great for student learning in general, and I think the lecture style of this course was particularly unfair to each of the instructors (Dubrow, Pettigrew, Yeckel). I am sure they would all be great instructors in a smaller classroom setting, but in such a large lecture it was difficult for both the students and the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0an interesting course, but too much teamwork making us tired ",
            "\u00a0Generally, the professors assumed students come in already having a basic knowledge of certain concepts although the course has no prerequisites, which is unfortunate and made it more difficult to learn. There were many times I felt like the \"stupid\" one in the room who was always playing catch-up. The professors also did not stick to their syllabus, and the changing number and type of assignments made it difficult to plan throughout the semester. Moreover, I think they try to teach/pack too many concepts into one class. Topics range from leadership to antimicrobial resistance to systems thinking. Perhaps, if they are all concepts we need to understand, some of the concepts may be embedded in other courses, so it it feels less like we are drinking water from a fire hose. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course had a lot of potential, and there was content that I loved.  The three content areas of the course - obesity, antimicrobial resistance, and climate change - are pressing issues that need to be addressed globally, and specifically in the field on public health. Providing three unique perspectives from respective experts in each field is a strength of this course. Similarly, I thought it was interesting to have a variety of different assignment types, including exams, essays, group assignments, and reflections.\r\n\r\nHowever, there were also things I did not love about the course. This course felt rough around the edges and it was noticeable that the instructors were figuring things out as the course went along. They frequently changed their minds on due dates of assignments, on the structure of assignments, and what the primary takeaways were from each module. This was a disservice to the students. Grading at times felt arbitrary, and lacked objective guidelines - this was an admission of one of the instructors. He suggested there were no objective criteria for our first assignment, and as such he provided grades based on his gut feeling. Utilizing newer approaches to content delivery is great, although didactic expectations should come with objective criteria that students feel they are graded on equally. Uncoordinated efforts of the instructors undermined their intentions, and resulted in a lack of interest from many students. It was a source of frustration witnessing our cohort being used a testing-ground for this course.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there was too much content provided for students to feasibly cover within a semester. It felt as if the instructors tried to pack as much content as possible into the course, without considering the impact and retention of students. ",
            "\u00a0The material for all three modules is vitally important, but was not delivered in ways that were digestible. Simple lectures were followed by assessments that escalated in difficulty to levels that left a lot of my peers feeling discouraged and lost. The lack of organization overall made the course material hard to engage with. The idea is great, it just needs some tweaking. ",
            "\u00a0N/a ",
            "\u00a0Horrendous. They clearly gave ZERO thought to it. This course was meant to be about leadership, followership, teamwork and group collaboration. Then, they make the course 60% multiple choice, individual tests. As is that is relevant. The nitty-gritty questions are ridiculous when this course is for everyone and not those in one specialized area. I recall nothing from the course. They did not even give it any thought. ",
            "\u00a0The whole structure with changing professors was a big weakness. Not having a consistent teacher was difficult because each of their teaching styles were very different. This in turn made exams harder to study for because we didn't know what to expect for each one. Additionally, the exams were poorly constructed and had little relation to the slides presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not organized and not optimized for a good learning experience.   The lectures are always interrupted for discussion, and the discussions in the auditorium was not productive because we could barely hear one another over the 200 other people. The lectures also only touched on the surface of the problems, leaving much to our own discussion and therefore no one felt like they were actually learning anything useful. The leadership aspect was also unnecessary; everyone has had to work in groups before and there was no need for group people to work together for a whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class was mostly a mess. While each instructor alone was fine, together, it was chaos. The structure of the course changed every three or so weeks and dates kept changing as well. It was unclear what we were supposed to get out of each portion of the class. The hands-on activities were helpful to a certain degree and I don't think I would have been able to make it through without a group, so definitely keep the group aspect. \r\n\r\nFor next year, setting a very clear structure and following that structure from day one to week thirteen would be helpful. Also have all the professors teach with the same expectations. We had no idea what each instructor prioritized and it stressed everyone out. ",
            "\u00a0This is a poorly designed course.  It was awkward to meet in 20-some groups of 6 in an auditorium. It was hard to discuss class topics with your group as some group members would essentially have to spin their heads like Reagan did in the Exorcist when she had the demon inside of her.  The alternative was sitting in a row of 6 without the head spinning issue.  However, when we tried that, we couldnt hear everyone.\r\n\r\nThe guest lectures were weak.  The PhD students were clearly interested in their research and well prepared, but a mostly disengaged auditorium was not the proper forum.\r\n\r\nThe leadership component felt forced and superficial.\r\n\r\nThis course should be taught as a small seminar.\r\n\r\nThis course was also thrown together without thinking about how it impacted other course offerings.  Those of us in the health policy track were literally unable to take required courses and had to scrounge around in the business school to find a Methods-like class.  That created domino effects in the scheduling process.\r\n\r\nThe group projects also suffered from some students taking on much more work than other students but not wanting to disclose this as some students were significantly better writers and researchers than other students.  Professors would not be aware of this because students dont want to jeopardize their relationships with other students, which are ultimately more valuable than equitably distributing work, and as a result dont disclose what is actually occurring with the group projects.  There is a lot of duplicity in the leadership self evaluations as students protect each other and dont disclose the reality of groupwork. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the instructors, as well as the assignment of group work in conjunction with individual work. I think that as relevant and helpful as it is to learn about these threats to public health issues, people coming in with different levels of expertise on the matter in such a big class size led to the detriment of learning overall. I would've appreciated the three modules happening simultaneously--climate change, AMR, and obesity--but with three smaller sized cohorts taking each module. I still liked the group work which made the class size seem smaller than it what it actually was, but still, the larger class size led to diffusion of responsibility to answering questions in class. I think three smaller sized cohorts--similar to how some law school classes function--would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely disappointing. The \"concept\" was interesting, but the inability to pick groups we wanted to work with and the module set up was strange. There was incredible variation in the motivation between groups, and many people, like myself, were subsequently shafted with poor groups and poor grades. No matter how many \"leadership\" lectures there could have been, the fact that many students didn't take this course seriously resulted in poor outcomes for too many and I am furious that this sub-par course grade will be reflected on my transcript as a result of work my group members didn't feel compelled to put in. ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly organized and seemed very disjointed, with little overlap between the modules.  It was clear that these issues were thrown together in order to maintain CEPH accreditation rather than because of any overarching similarity or guiding principle. Many of our tests seemed to focus more on whether or not we understand foundational epi materials than on whether we understood core concepts in climate change, AMR, and obesity.  The best parts of this class were the debates and negotiations, where we were able to take our understanding of these issues and apply them to relevant applications. ",
            "\u00a0This class was terrible. A mess of a course. While in theory and I'm sure in intention, this class would have been amazing - a survey class learning about major health threats, in practice the class was disjointed and unorganized. This class was certainly not a survey course - many of us lacked the foundation education in climate/environmental studies, biology, CDE/EMD, to appreciate the new course material (control + F, being the saving grace for many). \r\n\r\nThis class needs an incredible overhaul. The professors should try to align their teaching styles and evaluation styles (each exam was different and difficult to maneuver), we do not need 10 assignments over the course of the semester; group work in the auditorium is the epitome of messy. \r\n\r\nI would have loved a survey class that actually went over the main concepts of current major health threats - but this was an epi class, disguised as a core class, with ceph accreditation standards forced into it. ",
            "\u00a0Worst course I have ever taken in my entire life. Learned absolutely nothing. Professors were incapable of teaching an iota of information. If Yale has any sense of decency it will refund the student's who took this course the $4000 it was worth. To think that you can turn a 150+ lecture class into a \"groups\" type course is beyond asinine. ",
            "\u00a0I understand the purpose of this course, but it was one of the worst classes I have ever taken. Its structure was very confusing and the assessment process did not seem to be an efficient way to accomplish the goals of this course. The individual assessments very detail oriented and seemed to be better suited for a class that was solely focused on each of the units. It was extremely frustrating to struggle with these assessments despite preparing for each one as if it was a closed-note exam (they were open-note through Canvas).  For instance, the final exam consisted of 39 questions, and a substantial portion of those questions felt like riddles in their phrasing. Again, I must emphasize how frustrating it is to prepare for an exam, even though it is open-note, only to be deterred by the phrasing of the questions. For a course that emphasizes group work and development of leadership skills, requiring such technical individual exams seems counterproductive. It would have made more sense to focus solely on group projects for each module. I truly hope that next year's cohort has a better experience with this course. ",
            "\u00a0Very important themes and generally interesting. First year of the course so understandable that it was a mixed bag. Prof Dubrow seems nice but could do with a shot of enthusiasm when delivering lectures to engage the audience. Some of the detail seemed way too granular for general MPH candidates, unless you're an EMD student, particularly with regard to AMR and HIV treatment. Group activities were decent enough, lots of class discussion which was difficult in the lecture setting in Harkness. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting and covered important topics, but might benefit from a more clear structure. ",
            "\u00a0OVERALL Strength: highlights 3 key major health threats; appreciated that the individual assignments were take-home; however, indirect sources report a significant amount of group work for these assignments... perhaps mixing up questions a bit more would have been good.\r\nLeadership: quite rudimentary discussion; could have been done as a module with actual class exercises practicing these principles during those 2-3 lectures\r\n\r\nClimate change: provided a foundational introduction to climate change where I didn't have prior understanding; lecture style was quite dry, however, and individual assignment seemed more like an epidemiological exercise, rather than an exercise investigating climate change\r\n\r\nAMR: most engaging lecturer of the 3; enjoyed the debate leading into a final group paper\r\n\r\nObesity: highly relevant topic, but seemed to overemphasize biological principles instead of foundational public health measures (school food options, housing structure); practical application and interventions would have seemed more worthwhile ",
            "\u00a0The topics they chose were awful. For example, obesity truly is a serious health threat to the US citizen, but it is not a problem in many countries like Japan and China. Please think about international students when designing the course!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0This was the worst course I have taken in my academic career. It was very frustrating to be in this class because I felt like it was a waste of time and I didn't like the feeling that this was an experiment gone awry. I am also taking courses at the School of Management and I have never felt like they were wasting my time, while I frequently feel like that at YSPH. I think the climate change module was significantly worse than the other two modules. I do not think that Robert Dubrow is a good lecturer, or, to give him the benefit of the doubt, not good in a large lecture setting. The attempts to get audience feedback during his lectures were painful, and I was frequently the only one participating. I'm really disappointed because I think that climate change is THE issue of my generation but there was no enthusiasm or urgency communicated. The anti-microbial resistance section was ok. Again, I was missing the enthusiasm and the urgency. I think the obesity module could have been good but I was so over it by that point.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the assignments and the evaluations, I did not appreciate the reading-comprehension feel of the canvas assignments. There was little to no critical thinking required, I just ctrl f'ed my notes. The other assignments were better, but I did not feel particularly challenged. This was not what I was expecting of grad school, I was not challenged by this class.\r\n\r\nI am much more interested in thinking about the ways in which policies can attempt to mitigate these issues. I thought that is what we were going to do, but I feel like this course fell short.\r\n\r\nI hated writing papers as a group.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest that this course be split into 3 sections, maybe by departmental groups, so that the sections are smaller, and have the three professors rotate through. If it were by departmental groups, the policy people could focus on policy solutions and the epi people could focus on that. I think it would be more interesting and people could more easily participate in the smaller class sections ",
            "\u00a0I respect all the work of instructors and TFs. But, this course is really a disaster for me. This class has a lot of questions about biology, which makes no sense for a policy student. It is not fair for us to take the quiz in which all the questions are about biology. The course design assumes we have a background in biology, which is not true. It makes us feel frustrated and not interested in the classes. I am not saying that we don't need to learn these things. What I mean is if this course is required for all students from the background, it should teach us more about biology first. I understand the time is limited but the course design definitely should be improved. It is really not fair for policy student without any biology background to take the exams of anti-biotics and obesity. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - important concepts to be discussed as part of Core MPH, attempted leadership/teamwork aspects of the class were well-intended\r\nWeaknesses - poor structure, timing, and delivery of information. Way too much detail about each module and expected to understand and apply too much information on complex topics after a short amount of time. Teamwork in class was unsuccessful when group members had no incentive to show up. ",
            "\u00a0Very smart and accomplished instructors... BUT the TF's were very incompetent and vague with their expectations.\r\nThis course felt like a waste of tuition and too experimental. As someone paying full tuition for an education I was disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0The strength were the material presented but it was done in a very disorganized manner. ",
            "\u00a0While this course provided interesting content, I felt that the course went too in-depth for what was supposed to be a survey of climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and obesity. For example, the obesity unit focused a lot on the physiology of obesity. For a public health course, shouldn't we also be thinking about policy, behavior change, systemic factors that shape obesity, etc.? In contrast, I felt that the climate change module effectively provided a survey of climate change and health, with an appropriate balance of climate change science and links between climate change and health. \r\n\r\nI also felt that the individual assignments did not fairly assess what we learned in class; again, they just felt way too high level for a 4-week session. I wonder if a future version of this class could focus on just one of the major health threats. In that case, we could explore the problem all of its levels: individual physiology through systemic factors.  Otherwise, I very much enjoyed the group work and felt that the number and content of group assignments allowed group members' diverse perspectives to shine through. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the idea behind this course was good but to was poorly executed. When so many instructors are involved it is hard to learn the style of each one and learn effectively. I also think that having the whole course formatted in groups was frustrating. I also felt that often we would be expected to achieve unrealistic turnaround times on assignments, especially taking into consideration the extra time needed to coordinate in a group. ",
            "\u00a0Messy ",
            "\u00a0Three different modules (+ systems thinking and leadership) in one course are a good idea in theory, but it was a sloppy course and I don't feel like I learned much about any of the topics because they were either too introductory (climate change + obesity) or way over my head (AMR). All course modules should be taught at the same level (introductory, but to an audience that has heard about them/may have some familiarity). Some method of assessment of students' familiarity could be implemented at the beginning to assess the level to teach at/provide students supplementary basic materials at the beginning of modules? ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly designed and run. There were not any rubrics for the group projects.\r\nThe lectures felt disjointed and like cramming 2 years of PhD level material into less than a 1/3 of a semester. It was clear the the professors were knowledgeable, but it was also clear that they were not meeting the majority of students where they were. \r\nThe was also unclear objectives for each lecture, so we were unsure of exactly what we should be expected to know.\r\nFurthermore, the topics were not easily bridged in lecture or by assignment. ",
            "\u00a0This was, by far, the worst course I have ever taken. The leadership, communication, and systems thinking components did not effectively teach any of these skills in a practical or applied way. I never did any of the readings and still did well in the course. The group structure was meant to encourage interdisciplinary teamwork, but we could not effectively work in groups because it was so loud in the lecture hall. Smaller classrooms or a room where group members could face each other would be nice. The TFs did not engage with the groups much. The leadership evaluations were not rigorous and quite tedious. They did not prompt genuine reflection on team dynamics or leadership/followership. The instructors did not indicate any interest in supporting students and accepting these criticisms. The instructors did a poor job of connecting the three topics and ensuring that their evaluations reflected the depth of the material covered in the course. The take home tests did not encourage deep learning. I am deeply disappointed with this course and the faculty and administrators involved. I believe this could have been a much more positive learning experience had the instructors and TFs been sensitive and responsive to these issues throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0I did like how the class revolved around group work. I liked my group how we collaborated together. However there were weaknesses in the structure of the class. There were times some things were confusing and I didn't like how the modules were lined up. We should have been given options on what modules we wanted to do. Also I thought course was very epi based. It was a bit unfair to those students who weren't epi focused as they could find the quizzes quite difficult. The quizzes should have been more generic and grasp the module overall rather than being so epi focused. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think the course was structured in a way that was conducive to teaching what the syllabus stated. The leadership and teamwork components of the course seemed like they were haphazardly integrated. Additionally, we were encouraged to work in teams but were not always compensated for our work (i.e. the MORDOR study debate during the AMR module) and were instead given individual assessments which were not always reflective of the content taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs to be reformed. While I like the team-based structure, the material needs to be woven together better. As well, the testing style needs to be more content or application-based. I feel as if most of what we learned in class was not tested. It was taught at either too basic or too high of a level with respect to the diverse backgrounds of people in the room. By taking two mini climate change quizzes rather than a reading-based climate quiz, it would better prepare students for the final and make sure that they are learning the material. With respect to AMR, it needs to be more basic science. Many students felt lost and like they could not succeed because of the higher-level science. Obesity was focused on individual factors, when a lot of obesity is due to structural level, systematic factors impacting individuals. The debate, negotiations, and project proposals were the highlights of this course. One could add something similar in the climate change section; for example, students could have a budget and need to make NYC more climate friendly by investing in mitigation/adaptation measures. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly appreciated the opportunity to collaborate with fellow classmates in this course, and thought the papers on various topics were great. That is where I, and many of my fellow students felt they had the opportunity to really share their knowledge and excel. However, writing such short papers with six group members was really ridiculous. This class would be better served if longer papers were the only form of assessment, instead of quizzes that asked oddly specific questions unrelated to the main knowledge presented in class. Having multiple instructors presenting different topics was an interesting concept, but poorly executed. There were no (natural or otherwise) transitions between material, and it very much felt that we were being taught a class in the conceptual stage, which was nowhere near ready to be taught to MPH students. Having constant small group interaction in a massive lecture hall was a huge mistake. It made learning extremely difficult, particularly when I could not hear my group mates most of the time over the din of the other students in the lecture hall. The idea to call on groups in this massive lecture hall was also great in theory but extremely impractical and a huge impediment to learning in this class. I'm disappointed that I learned next to nothing, and I feel that I wasted my time and efforts for a grade that did not reflect my knowledge of the materials taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course lacked coherence. The climate change module was fantastic-- readings were relevant, and the lectures were concise and organized, but I had a hard time following the AMR and Obesity modules. More work needs to be put into the lectures so that they fit the audience; ironically, this was a topic that the course was supposed to teach. ",

            "\u00a0This course is the WORST one I've ever had at YSPH. I think the topics are important, but the way it is being taught is so bad. The class requires much background in biology, which to be honest, many of us don't have. And the tedious reflections basically cannot represent any of my learnings in the class, but I have to make up stuff in order to earn the points. ",

Brooke Severe was the most wonderful individual and helpful when we really thought no one could help us in this process. ",

            "\u00a0Poor.  All three course instructors have their own weaknesses.  Dr Dubrow covered way too many materials and had too much assigned reading plus videos.  Not at all realistic plus his constant Canvas posts and corrections irritated most of the class--it even prompted the TFs to write instructions on how to turn off Canvas announcements on mobile devices--IT WAS THAT BAD.  \r\n\r\nDr Pettigrew was probably the best among the three of them.  But she assigned too many last minute work.  Geez, give us at least 2 weeks to work on something big such as writing an entire group paper.  Her quiz also asked way too many specific Biology questions that was beneficial to arguably the CDE students in the course given their course work with her in PID.  \r\n\r\nFinally, the worst of the three:  Dr Yeckel.  You are the course leader--put some structure to the course!   Nice lady and I hear she is a great mentor.

I didn't understand why I was paying for another class to learn the exact same thing nor why I was taking a class that was designed not to give me a comprehensive education on the topic. All of us are intelligent and driven, and yet all of us struggled with the material and with engagement in the class. We are educated and concerned about climate change and obesity as epidemics, yet this class did not play on that.

Catherine Yeckel was engaging, passionate, and interesting as a lecturer. I feel her expectations for students were the most well understood.\r\n\r\nFurther, the first two instructors (Dubrow & Pettigrew) were very slow at providing students with feedback on their assignments.

Too little consideration went into the development of course material to ensure that all students would be able to access material, even if some may have found it a bit easier than others.

It was poorly run and very much a trial run of a class, and it is very clear that the trial did not go well. I would never have taken this class had I not been required to, and I feel that it was a complete waste of my time. I learned very little that I had not already been exposed to. Even more frustrating was the feeling that no exam actually tested what I had learned in class. This class was unnecessarily detailed at times (geared toward an expert in AMR, for example) in ways that were completely irrelevant to my course of study. At other times, this class was a mere survey (climate change) that simply went over facts that high schoolers in a decent environmental science class would learn, and was not fitting to an MPH degree at all. I went into this class with very low expectations, and this class failed to meet them. This class needs to be completely reworked to meet the expectations of a MPH level course at Yale. ",

Perhaps if time travel was real administrators would choose to do the same thing; go back in time, slap the person who voiced this idea in whatever meeting room the decision to create this course went down in, and return to a future where Major Health Threats (or was it \"Soci, Envi, Bio, determints of health\"??? or was it \"Lets throw leadership training in this course for no G-D reason\"... either way this course had more titles and instructors than the King (or Queen #nospoilers) of the Seven Kingdoms, first of his/her name, protector of the realm, breaker of chains, etc. etc. you. get. it.) never existed.

            "\u00a0I absolutely would not recommend this course. I understand the need to fulfill accreditation criteria and fundamentally agree with having a well-rounded education. This course, however, was another failed attempt by this program to abruptly change the previous curriculum to meet the new accreditation standards at the clear expense of the time and fiscal resources of the students in this cohort. There was no reasonable way to expect us to swallow and genuinely comprehend knowledge beyond a shallow degree on 6 distinct and poorly transitioned topics. But instead in each of the 4 modules, we were expected to know superfluous disease and vector examples, theories, and mechanisms. In climate change, why would we cover dengue fever, and cholera, and malaria on top of natural disasters, and air pollution, and vulnerable populations, etc? That extent of material could only have responsibly been covered in a semester-long course. The exact same can be said about the antimicrobial resistance and obesity modules. The only reason why I would not include the leadership \"module\" and communication and systems thinking special topics in that critique, is because each of those 3 was tacked on like an afterthought. I was a student who attended every lecture and prepared outside of class every week and for each module, I found the individual assessment to be unreasonably difficult, used language students who were not specializing in those topics would not understand, and today I could not recall any of that material if asked. Furthermore, when in-time feedback was given, it never felt as if the professors of this course were taking that feedback seriously. It felt more as if they were resolved to keep everything as is and \"fix it\" for the next cohort, but what good does that do for our education? Especially given all of the other changes made to the curriculum in the fall and all the mistakes made with those too. We now expect students in the cohort to understand structural determinants and social justice frameworks, and yet the curriculum of this program and those making choices for what that curriculum looks like in requiring courses like these in which students are not going to truly learn do poorly influence the health and long-term trajectory of success of students who are not highly privileged. There should be more intentional thought and participation from diverse students in decision-making in this program if it and its faculty ever want to move beyond a highly white, wealthy, minimally professionally experienced student population.
