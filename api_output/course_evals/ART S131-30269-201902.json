I also was able to look through the perspective of prospective customers and think about how the work I was creating would be perceived to target audiences. ",

However, the weakness was that we had to learn everything by ourselves, the teacher did not teach us how to use the tools ahead and how to make things in advance and that was a struggle amongst the class. ",

Every class would go overtime for at least an extra half an hour which was extremely inconvenient for those who had classes in the afternoon. ",
