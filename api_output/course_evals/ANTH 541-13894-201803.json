            "\u00a0I gained many insights from this class that are difficult to summarize. All three professors are amazing. This class changed the way I think about modern food systems and international development ",
            "\u00a0In ANTH 541, I learned to think both specifically and globally about the politics of rural life, especially in regards to the influences of empire and the pressures that can lead to both civil war and popular revolt. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to interrogate the history of many objects that have been naturalized, such as elements of our food system and structure of environmental thought. I gained a perspective on how land and people interact in creating political and social systems, and how the different assumptions that each have affect one another. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger understanding of agrarian studies from an interdisciplinary perspective. It was useful to have three professors with distinct specialties sharing multiple approaches. ",
            "\u00a0Learned more about agrarian societies and started to pay attention to peasants movements in Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course I feel that I have further developed my critical reading skills and have gained a more holistic understanding of the ways peasant communities have been affected by colonialism, political agendas, and economic pressures throughout the 20th century. I also enjoyed the course's discussion sections and feel I have gained more confidence in contributing to class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broad understanding of the themes and concerns relevant to the study of agrarian societies. In particular, this course taught me how to incorporate the some of the major themes of agrarian studies into the history of the Middle East and North Africa.  \r\n\r\nI am particularly pleased with the course focus on land appropriation, as I hope to integrate such concerns into my own work.

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. My one suggestion is that the sections were too long - 1 - 1.5 hours would have been more appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of the course--half lecture and half discussion section. I also really enjoyed having three professors. I've been in other co-taught courses that were not cohesive, but to the contrary in this case I think the three voices, disciplines, and perspectives offered by the three professors only enriched the class. I sometimes struggled with the amount of reading, and I also sometimes wished that the lectures tied in more specifically with the reading assignment. I felt that the richest discussion days occurred when the lecturer directly addressed the assigned reading material. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the length of 4 hours is difficult and that the discussion element would benefit from being split into 3 sections, rather than 2. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are the great strength. Sometimes discussions seem to drift a bit. ",
            "\u00a0It was personally challenging to fully and deeply read the 200-400 pages assigned every week for the class. While it developed my abilities to skim through the literature I feel that I often did not fully have the opportunity to immerse myself in the readings as much as I would have liked due to the sheer volume, especially in combination with the other readings and assignments for my other courses. \r\nOverall, I appreciated the breadth of content covered in the course and the diversity of topics covered. Each instructor spoke and presented to their strengths and expertise in ways that allowed the class to fully dive into the topics discussed each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nHighly knowledgeable Professors. Instructors are clearly passionate and well-versed in the materials they present. The course syllabus is quite varied and interdisciplinary. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nTime management. There were too many days in which instructor presentations were cut off by time constraints. Perhaps the group presentation exercise for paper topics ought to be posted solely on canvas. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. It's one of a kind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially a student with my academic interests. The lecture and discussion topics were fascinating to me, and the intensive structure offered a really unique opportunity for community learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course. It is a way to gain a perspective on global capitalism. Especially for those who study issues of race and social justice in more traditional political contexts, understanding how all of this interacts with the production of food and the creation of landscapes is an important way to realize that the political ideas you care about have significant reach. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think for anyone interested in formation and development of human societies, the study of agrarian societies and its economy is essential. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Agrarian Societies was a pleasure to attend.  I believe the course helped mold me into a more well-rounded historian. "
