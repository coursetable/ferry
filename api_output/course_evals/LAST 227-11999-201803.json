            "\u00a0I dramatically improved my writing skills, literature analysis skills, and communication in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my writing abilities, vocabulary, and command over the Spanish language. Reading pieces from notable authors in Spanish and Latin American literature also broadened my views on the culture and history associated with the language and regions involved. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my command and knowledge of Spanish grammar and spelling, and I became more comfortable with writing in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Got a lot better at writing, reading comprehension, speaking in Spanish. Maria really cares that every student grows as a learner in class whether you're a fluent speaker or have taken it for a few years. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing skills in Spanish, learning to communicate my emotions in a creative way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write and analyze Spanish poetry, fables, and short stories. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better writer in Spanish, as we covered fables, short stories, and various forms of poetry. The wide variety of readings and assignments helped my Spanish improve. In addition, my oral Spanish improved as we had discussions, workshops, and presentations in class. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to really improve my writing in Spanish and maintain my preferred level of fluency. I also honed my poetry skills and learned a lot about the Latin American literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new appreciation for Spanish poetry, something I had little prior exposure to, as well as the sense of freedom that comes with writing in a language other than English. I also developed greater speaking skills in Spanish simply because the class was conducted in Spanish, but not because of any specific instruction. ",
            "\u00a0-Better control of language \r\n-Many great author recommendations and a familiarity with Hispanic body of work ",
            "\u00a0Not only did my Spanish speaking skills improve, but I was able to express myself creatively in another language. "

            "\u00a0The course was very strong, and promoted great discussions. I'm not sure what to improve. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very strong in its community; the close-knit workshop style classes helped a lot in preparing, understanding, and presenting the pieces of writing covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths included learning about a variety of different writing styles from which we can base our own work off of, and the weaknesses are that we covered such breadth of material, we sometimes dont cover material as in depth as I would like. I would like for there to be slightly less breadth and more depth in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course - the readings were great, and Maria created such a welcoming, comfortable, learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Jordan is extremely passionate about what she teaches, and made the course much more enjoyable. The course is a lot of work, but it is enjoyable. The homework should continue to be communicated on a regular basis so that students are sure about what is assigned. ",
            "\u00a0The course had an excellent selection of readings and interesting class discussions. I liked the small seminar format, but there was a wide gap in language ability. Being one of few non-native speakers in the class was difficult and I often felt that I was not among academic peers. I think that, ideally, there would be a class for native speakers and one for non-native speakers, or just two options split by ability level. This was pretty minor, but I often found myself confused as to what was going on in the class in terms of homework assignments, testing, and grading. ",
            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal course! Mara does a great job of running the class - everyone was engaged and into the material. Class discussions are interesting and it was great to have the chance to workshop our works and hear from others. Mara gives feedback on every single piece we write, which was helpful for our final project. Going to office hours is very helpful as well. There are only a few minor things that could improve. The homework load was light but sometimes she would move things around on the syllabus, which led to some confusion. Also, it would have been helpful to have access to our grades throughout the semester. Overall though, the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Maria Jordan is incredible and she should teach more courses. Strengths include: amazing professor, engaging readings, good use of class time, fun assignments and projects, good feedback. \r\nThe course could maybe only be improved by a clearer syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the very manageable workload, small class side, and amazing professor. Weakness is the feedback on writing was rarely big picture and mostly grammatical, so I did not feel like I got advice on how to improve my writing, it just improved with time. ",
            "\u00a0-Wonderful discussion style, loved talking with the group and with professor jordn\r\n-Would prefer a fewer number of stories, but I especially appreciated some that I'm told were added to the curriculum this year, like Cajitas Felices by Nadia Villafuerte "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The professor was so helpful and gave a lot of feedback and edits on our writing. She guided helpful discussions of literature, and made the class a good environment for students of varying levels. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Having Professor Jordn as a teacher was an amazing experience. She made the class a pleasure and designed the syllabus to offer various types of writing and cater to everyone's needs and interests. The stories and poems read in class were very interesting and enjoyable to read. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot and greatly enjoyed the material in this course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Any student who wants to improve their skills in Spanish, learn about the history of Spanish literature, and improve their overall communication skills should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- this is a great L5 Spanish course that allowed me to develop my language skills in a supportive and productive environment. It was more of a creative space than anything else, and the small seminar format gives students many opportunities to contribute and learn from one another. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any Yale student who needs an L5 Spanish class! Mara is the nicest professor and genuinely cares about you, both in and out of the classroom. She would bring us food and took an interest in our lives. In class we covered a variety of writing styles, from fables to stories to poetry, almost all of which were quite interesting. I also enjoyed the workshop process where we read each other's works and discussed them as a class. As a non-native Spanish speaker, the first few weeks were rough since about half the class was native speakers but Mara made me feel welcome and supported me. Once I got into the swing of things, the class was manageable and fun. My Spanish definitely improved. I didn't think that I would like the class because I am not the best writer, but by the end I strongly enjoyed it and was a good learning experience. The workload is light, as the nightly homework is a short reading and/or a short writing assignment on which she always gives great feedback. Because of the nature of the seminar and instructor, the class grew very close by the end of the semester. Definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. It is a fun and engaging course and a really great way to keep up your Spanish if you are a native speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to take an L5 Spanish class. It is low-stress, low-workload, but a lot of fun and your Spanish will improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if they're like me, and were torn between Spanish class and creative writing class! A wonderful combination of two things important to me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Especially if you love the Spanish language/creative writing. The professor is awesome. "
