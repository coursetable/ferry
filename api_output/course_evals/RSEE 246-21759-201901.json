            "\u00a0This course gave me a great overview of Russian short stories that spanned a wide time period. I also practiced comparative literature analysis and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Russian literature, the genre of the short story, general literary devices (in particular regarding narrative points of view), and interpreting intertextual conversations between texts. Over all, the class was tremendously informative. I also feel like the format of the short story allowed us to read closely and made discussions particularly enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This class definitely improved my comparative and analytical skills. We went through many short stories and analyzed them deeply. I feel like I improved not only my abilities to analyze literature, but also a great deal about the Russian literary tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This class really taught me to analyze the short story with respect to intertextuality and narrative complications (unreliable narrator). "

        [
            "\u00a0A strength was both the breath and depth of our study. We read a lot of stories, but we still were able to delve into each one individually. The seminar discussion format was ideal for this kind of class. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the three \"units\" that we went through that helped frame discussions in the class. The discussions were also well guided by Professor Bojanowska and the class felt very structured in a great way. Professor Bojanowska's feedback at office hours and on the papers was thorough and extremely helpful.  \r\n\r\nI think one way in which the course could be improved would be getting rid of the midterm quiz and final exam, which didn't really feel like they were assessing my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bojanowska is incredible to work with, and her method of teaching and discussion is fantastic. She came to class with a lot of prepared material, but also kept student engagement very high. It was the perfect balance between not lecturing too much while also not feeling too unstructured. The professor also gives tons of feedback on the essays. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved if we had guiding questions for some of the readings to help narrow the scope of discussions. Sometimes it felt like I couldn't get to in-depth analysis because I didn't know what features of the story to pay attention to. I did enjoy how Prof. Bojanowska always contextualized the stories. "

            "\u00a0Yes it was an awesome class. The professor was great, discussions were interesting, and Russian literature is just plain awesome. Good for both new readers and obsessive old-timers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you have any interest in literature or Russia, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are at all interested in Russian literature, definitely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course to another student! It seriously was one of the best courses I've taken during my career. You can really enjoy every short story in all its complexity, and the discussion in class was so rich you definitely didn't leave without a new realization. All the short stories were incredible, and Professor Bojanowska was so involved that she made learning about literature so easy and enjoyable. I would take this class again if I could! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to read some amazing and fun stories in the Russian tradition. I loved most everything that we read and had the opportunity to gain some amazing insights into famous authors like Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Lermontov, Gogol, etc. "
