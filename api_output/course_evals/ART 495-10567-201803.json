            "\u00a0it is pretty fun seeing what other people are working on ",
            "\u00a0Course was presentation based; each student had to give 2 presentations on past/ongoing work over course of term. Would have been helpful to have some individualized direction earlier in the termwe did not get advisor assignments until very late. ",
            "\u00a0We should probably break up into smaller sections or something.... ",
            "\u00a0The class has too many people enrolled in it to promote active discussions. I would suggest that when there are too many art majors, the class be divided into two sections. ",
            "\u00a0not particularly helpful for critique; nice to see what your peers are working on ",
            "\u00a0Strength: I loved hearing people talk about their work. It's weird that, before senior year, we don't have more spaces for us to hear about the work of other Art majors.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish the class was more than just student presentations. This made the class very low-stress, which was nice, but it also made the class a bit less engaging than it otherwise might be. I wish we were learning skills that were applicable in some way. Maybe some kind of student-led workshop would be nice, to emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary learning across the arts? (i.e. Computing and the Arts students could lead a class on coding-based graphics, Graphic Design students could lead a class on the history of typography, Painting students could lead a class on color theory, etc.) Learning how to talk about your work is important, but we only presented twice (15 minutes each) for the whole semester, so the amount of learning was a bit limited. ",
            "\u00a0I did not think this course was very engaging. The presentations were required to include certain information (such as inspiration and related literature) which could be important to some projects, but may not be as applicable for others. It think it would be better if students were given guidelines for the presentations, but were not required to talk about all of the topics. "
