            "\u00a0The political and economic history of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview of various topics concerning Latin America (e.g. democracy & dictatorships, regime change, historical antecedents, crime, inequality & poverty etc). I feel like I come away with a slightly better understanding of the region (better than the zero knowledge I had before), but I feel like the overview was very broad which might not be ideal for other people seeking a more in depth understanding of the region. ",
            "\u00a0I came out of this class with an enormously helpful background in everything Latin America: culture, history, and politics. I have followed a political crisis throughout the semester and have simultaneously been exposed to a variety of sources of Latin American information, watching movies, attending talks, and reading newspapers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about political science concepts and themes through evaluating Latin America and Latin American countries as case studies. Through this, I developed an understanding of key theories in addition to the historical foundations and current events that define Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about applying large political science theories in a region wide perspective as well as in countrywide perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Good blend of history, economics, and political science lenses in analyzing historical and contemporary issues in Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about macroeconomics and how it relates to Latin America. To be honest, I felt like a lot of the lectures lacked substance and I think it's because the professor didn't make any normative claims. Something about it felt empty because of that since we were discussing things which had material impacts for so many people, especially people in the room. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the historical legacies that influenced contemporary politics, the various economic systems used in Latin America, crime and inequality, and ethnopopulism and political parties. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, you are essentially signing up for a large amount of reading and theories thrown at you in regards to studying Latin American politics. This course furthermore does well in allowing the set up of various relationships that are constantly being reinforced. The lectures were great in the sense that they summarized the readings and were organized in a concise manner, however please do the readings. Staying on top of those will allow for a better balancing of time and the workload that this course demands. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the economic and political factors that currently affect Latin America as well as the different approaches to solve some of the challenges in the region. "

            "\u00a0Not sure, it was pretty good the way it was. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course was interesting in terms of both its topics and its assessment methods. I appreciated how we didn't have to do long tedious papers, but rather newspaper assignments & film reviews (in addition to the 2 exams), which made the class workload manageable and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air in comparison to my other classes. It is a good fifth class in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A lot of (dry) reading, which is necessary to do for the exam and can really catch up to you if you don't do it conscientiously. Also, this is class was a very BROAD overview of various topics concerning Latin America which can make it feel like this class left a lot to be desired, given how surface-level it was. If you do decide to take the class, go in with this understanding.  I feel like I come away with a slightly better understanding of the region (better than the zero knowledge I had before), but I feel like the overview was very broad which might not be ideal for other people seeking a more in depth understanding of the region. Still, Prof Sellars tried her best to make it as good as a survey as she could given the broadness of the class, and also started every lecture saying that you could have a whole semester's worth of classes on each topic. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the variety of assignments and how everything I learned could be applied elsewhere. I do wish that the readings could be shorter or more engaging in order to reflect the interest of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and though it was well planned out. Everything was communicated effectively, and I never felt lost in the course material or assignments. One of the weaknesses I found was the lack of integration between the majority of the readings we completed for section and the material discussed in lecture. Though lectures did include some political theorists or scholarly works from our required readings, they were few and far between. This made it hard to be engaged in section, as I felt that it was hard to understand why we were discussing these readings in depth if they were not to appear anywhere else. They were really interesting, but at times I felt like it was kind of pointless. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be better if we could tie in the newspaper and film assignments to the class. They felt a little bit disconnected to the material. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the text book readings much more than the papers. The newspaper assignments were very interesting and in addition I enjoyed the film assignments. However, given how many assignments there were I feel like it would be fair to have a leas laborious final. The final was incredibly long and exhausting, which was difficult for me because I had anothers final right after this one. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Broad overview of things, I think actually pretty useful as an introduction to some macroeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Sellars is genuinely interested in the topics about which she is lecturing. The workload is pretty light as well (two 5-page film reviews, five 1-page newspaper reviews, an outside event review, and the midterm + final). The TA also gave a lot of feedback on our essays. However, the course content was very easy and at least two thirds of the content is common knowledge or covered in an intro to comparative politics class. Lectures could be a bit boring at times and only scratched the surface of how much we could have covered over the semester. Sections were dry and just involved recalling facts from the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course: You get the opportunity to learn a lot concerning the world of Latin America and the many theories that are written about the current state of their politics. Section was very engaging and allowed for more sense of discussion. The flexibility within some assignments to dive into the more specifics regarding a particular country was also refreshing.\r\nWeakness: A sense of repetitiveness at some points of the course, as well as the readings becoming a bit dry and long at times. More of a general approach to Latin America which can make it difficult if you have a specific country you want to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding that the class is a survey course by nature, I feel as though the class didn't go too in depth into some topics and glossed over a lot of nuances and intricacies of the Latin American countries. The class did a good job of explaining the economic crises of the region during the first half of the semester, though after the midterm it felt as though the topics we did talk about didn't get as much coverage or weren't given enough time to discuss. The class was very structured and at times it felt as though that made class predictable, with a heavy use of slides to take notes. Newspaper assignments and film reviews are great, though I feel as though the class should do one or the other. Newspaper assignments are a good way to get students exposed to Latin American countries' news, though the assignments became busy-work and didn't increased my depth of understanding of the region. Maybe both can be kept, with a decrease in the frequency in the amount of newspaper assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: broad overview of region, exposure to various theories \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lack of clarity in important takeaways. Theories contradicted each other, which made it frustrating ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the assignments feel like busy work, and for a while you do not see the value in them, however they provide you an insight on the region you would not obtain any other way ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that Emily is very thorough, therefore the course is very good for someone who knows absolutely nothing about Latin America. The weakness is that this class demands way too much for being an introductory course. Should possibly be listed as a writing course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, good intro course for Latin American history/culture/economics/politics. ",
            "\u00a0This course was interesting in terms of both its topics and its assessment methods. I appreciated how we didn't have to do long tedious papers, but rather newspaper assignments & film reviews (in addition to the 2 exams), which made the class workload manageable and enjoyable, a breath of fresh air in comparison to my other classes. It is a good fifth class in my opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, do note that there is a lot of (dry) reading, which is necessary to do for the exam and can really catch up to you if you don't do it conscientiously.

I feel like I come away with a slightly better understanding of the region (better than the zero knowledge I had before) and I needed a simple but interesting fifth class, but the broad overview might not be ideal for other people seeking a more in-depth understanding of the region.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another Yale student in order to learn interesting political theories regarding Latin America and to engage with the culture and real-world implications of those theories on campus. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to students wishing to learn about Latin America and broad political concepts on an introductory level. This coursework was manageable and the concepts were well-explained, so it served as the perfect introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoy learning from Professor Sellars and the TA was really helpful and accesible. ",
            "\u00a0Ehhhhhh probably not. It felt empty due to a lack of normative claims-making. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who has not taken any political science classes before. It offers a nice introduction to international politics. Otherwise, the class is very easy (near-gut level) and a bit of a waste of time. Most of the material can be found in an intro to comparative politics class and, while it is a survey class, it does not go into depth on specific countries or incidents in much detail. I feel like I came away with very little new knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to take an intro course to Latin American politics, this is it. The course offers a survey look at issues facing Latin American countries today, with an emphasis on the economic and political challenges. I would recommend to anyone who seeks to learn more about the region and the challenges we see in the news every day. ",
            "\u00a0I would, Yale does not offer many courses on Latin America and this does a great job giving an overview on a region that is under discussed "
