            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about how to think. I really liked how as a group we questioned methodology and the categorization of disciplines. I learned so much about the different ways that ethnographies can be conducted and written. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to love the humanities - as I was coming from a STEM background. Every week I was excited to read the books (some of which are now among my favorites) because I knew that I would learn something new from every one of them. In this course, I learned that there are plausible non-scientific theories/explanations for what happens in the world in topics such as masculinity, achievement ideology, LGBTQ+ issues, race issues, and so much more.  I also gained a solid understanding of what an ethnography is, and how they can contribute to the field of anthropology. Furthermore, I learned how to review academic books and write a book proposal. Finally, I learned how to engage thoughtfully in a seminar setting and how to dissect a book. ",
            "\u00a0This course really tested how I thought about anthropological works in its entirety, spanning from the authors positionality to how we can relate to major themes like social reproduction. ",
            "\u00a0The nature of anthropology and ethnography\r\nCritical and empathetic discourse\r\nEngaging with theorizers\r\nAppreciating the history of the discipline ",
            "\u00a0This class totally opened up an unfamiliar field to me and made me think deeply about pedagogy and the ways we structure our knowledge about other groups. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really loved the structure of this class. The book-a-week model is one of my favorites, because even though it involves a little bit of reading it gives us something fresh to talk about every week even as we always connect back to previous weeks. Prof. Cox also chose books that were reasonably short usually so it never felt like too much of a crunch to get the reading done. I prefer this structure to classes that do all journal articles because it lets us dig in more. The two hours of this class always flew by so clearly we always had enough to talk about. The weekly assignments were good and sponsored conversation. The midterm and book review assignments felt like they fit in with the structure and helped us focus on class themes. Sometimes these major assignments felt a little more vague and broad, but Prof Cox was always available for office hours. The field trip was such a cool experience and all the guest speakers we had were awesome. Can honestly say, I see all strengths and no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing reading list, covers many topics, the discussions were fun to lead, Professor Cox and Keahnan were supportive, and the NYC field trip. \r\nWeaknesses: I sometimes wish it was longer because there was so much to cover each week, but other than that, absolutely none - this course was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0We had a very small group and got to go very in depth into every conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Aimee Meredith Cox is a legend. Period. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the class was mainly student led and we were able to personally meet authors of assigned readings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the size, the speakers, the texts, everything! No weaknesses really, I think I would've done better with a more traditional essay but that's just me. "

            "\u00a0Take this class. Take ANY class you can take with Professor Cox. I am not an anthropology major, but this class was fascinating every week and we never ran out of things to talk about. The books were all super interesting and a lot of them I would have honestly read even if they weren't for class. There are so many cool author visits where we got to talk to the authors of the books we read and we took a field trip to NYC as a group to learn about non-profits that provide youth services. I shopped this class on a whim not thinking that the topic was something I was passionate about, and I can honestly say its one of my favorite classes I took at Yale. The assignments are reasonable and you get plenty of feedback and the opportunity to workshop. Prof. Cox's classes are going to be so oversubscribed once word gets out, so get in while you can :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned so much and all of the other students enjoyed it the class as well. Although it might be beneficial to take a few intro anthro classes before this, I was able to come in and take away from the material, despite not having any background knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Cox is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Please please please take this course if you can! Professor Cox is unabashedly free in her thinking and teaching -- so inspiring and refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- a good class to learn about anthropology ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fantastic opportunity to think critically not only about its topic (youth) but also the discipline of anthropology more generally. Aimee Cox is a must-have professor before you graduate, too. "
