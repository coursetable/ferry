            "\u00a0Do not take this class with Gomez!\r\nStrengths\r\n1. everyone was struggling together for the most part \r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. Lecture was always all over the place. The professor would jump from topic to topic without really explaining what was gong on so it was very hard to follow the material. The professor's handwriting is also illegible! Couldn't follow his work on the board or his explanations. \r\n2. This course has a lot of derivations, variables, etc - sometimes the professor would write the wrong equations, notice his mistake, and still move on without fixing his error by saying we (the students) could just look in the textbook and do the derivations ourselves  \r\n3. There was only one TA for the entire class and no office hours - which isn't very helpful when majority of the class needs help \r\n4. We had a section every Tuesday night (7-9pm) thought by the TA which was basically another class - if you actually want to learn/be able to do the p-set you probably go to the section\r\n5. We had extra lectures some weeks in the semester - the idea was to finish learning the material early to have more time to study for the final BUT this was a huge MISTAKE since cramming more material into a week didn't mean we actually learned the material. People just got more behind so by the end of the semester you just have to learn EVERYTHING by yourself again.\r\n6.  Exams were horrible even though they were open book/notes - literally horrible. i don't know what else to say about that. - partial credit was barely ever given on any problems. It's either 100% correct or 100% WRONG. \r\n7. The professor makes insensitive comments/remarks after exams about how the class did \r\n8. The professor doesn't really answer questions clearly ",
            "\u00a0This is the most rigorous course I have taken at Yale. The pace at the beginning is relentless, with the professor demanding that the curriculum is complete before thanksgiving break. He claims this is a unanimous decision, though he intimidated people too much for people to raise concerns. Even when people did raise concerns, he was incredibly dismissive. This meant meeting three times a week (so an additional weekly lecture) + a two hour problem session every week. Altogether this amounted to ~4 hours of extra class time for the single credit per week, not even beginning to mention studying or problem sets. The grading schema is absolutely absurd - students are given no credit for homeworks, but will be penalized in the final evaluation of the grades if they do not complete them in a timely manner. Sometimes, we would have multiple problem sets due within a weeks time, and Professor Gomez had no consideration for breaks, often putting deadlines on the day we would return, making fun of students who were traveling or going home for break. Professor Gomez made us feel guilty for taking any sort of break or respite, even in some cases when it meant spending time with sick family members (as I know is the case for one particular student who went home over october recess to visit her grandmother who'd been diagnosed with cancer earlier in the semester). Of course, Gomez never made himself approachable enough for students to feel comfortable coming to him to explain such circumstances. In one case, a student discussed with me that she wanted to go to Gomez to ask a question about the midterm, but was too afraid he would make her cry that she chose not to. Students ended up cheating/copying from solutions manuals on the problem sets. This sums to mean that the entire course grade is determined by three exams, despite hours and hours of work put in on other assignments, which is altogether unfair for students like myself who are often putting in the work but don't necessarily test well. Not to mention that the distribution on exams had averages of 15% and 46%, with people getting zeros. \r\n\r\nIf this course has any redeeming qualities, the textbook is actually decent. I highly recommend using both FM White and Fox and McDonalds to supplement study. Despite personal qualms, Gomez is actually a good lecturer. The material is rigorous, his approach is aggressive and he is unempathetic as a human being, but as a lecturer he has a strong command of the material and goes to great effort to pull things together at the end of the course, cementing an understanding of the principles of fluid mechanics. Despite my probably overall poor performance in this class, I feel like I will have walked out of fluids having learned the most of any of my classes this semester. I am afraid the grading will not accurately reflect this distinction, which is a key weakness of the class. Gomez' handwriting and accent also made the early part of the semester all that much more difficult to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The course is not very interesting and generally seems like a lot of math for little conceptual understanding or problem-solving intuition and skills. The course is also pretty terrible for the number of students who are not mechanical engineering majors because it is never made applicable to other disciplines. There is also a great deal of challenging material that is just barely covered in class and there is little to no help offered outside of lecture. The professor's office hours are short and busy (and really inconvenient for people who have obligations between 3pm and 5pm), the TA runs structured review sessions that do not offer much time for specific questions from lecture that do not touch on the material that the TA brings to the sessions. Also for a class of this difficulty and this size (~50 students), there is usually more than 1 TA. Finally, when asked for peer tutors, our professor was unsuccessful in finding them until after the mid term of the semester. \r\nIn terms of the structure of the class the professor rushed through material at the beginning to accommodate for his own travel time in the latter half of the semester. He required extra lectures outside of the given class time, and put quite a bit of pressure on students to move other commitments in order to make his extra time fit into their busy schedules. \r\nThe course grading was also rather ridiculous. There were a number of problem sets to be completed throughout the semester and submitted on canvas. these problem sets were never graded, except for a note in the syllabus that said that if the student did not keep up with the problem sets this would be reflected in the final grade. While that grading scheme alone is quite unfair, the fact that the problem sets were never graded meant that the students did not receive any feedback on any work until after the first midterm. How is one to study for a midterm when they have no idea what the professor expects from them in their solutions? This also made the entire course grading scheme pretty brutal, as the 2 midterms were each worth 25% of the final grade, and the final exam worth 50%. That meant that as the students walked into the first midterm with little to no idea of what was expected from them, they were simultaneously laying 25% of their final grade on the line. \r\nAlso, Thermodynamics should be a prerequisite for this class, but it is not listed as a prerequisite. While most mechanical engineering majors take thermo before fluids, or at least concurrently, it seems as though the mechanical engineering department, while constructing this class, has forgotten that students from other majors take this class, and therefore are not required to take thermodynamics beforehand. This means that students in the class who are already at a slight disadvantage because of their inexperience in mechanical engineering in general, are placed at a greater disadvantage when knowledge of thermodynamics is assumed. ",
            "\u00a0This course subject is incredibly difficult, and the pace is very very very fast... especially at the beginning. It really throws the students into a hectic experience, especially since there is a lack of material that prepares students for the exams - there are no practice exams, homeworks are often irrelevant and ungraded, and the only way to get a good grade is to be lucky on the exams. This takes up a lot of time and is often difficult to prepare for. ",
            "\u00a0The course had a weekly problem session where the TA ran through a few specific problems using that week's concepts, which was helpful. Professor Gomez ran good lectures but a lot of the theory and derivations could be quite lengthy and detached from applications. He did start to complement the lecture with powerpoint slides which helped understand the relevant big picture topics and concepts of the week. I also really didn't like that our grade for the class was completely based on the three exams of the semester. I would like to see homework be counted as a grade because this would both lessen the impact of the individual exams and incentivize students to be more thorough in their homework, and get better practice out of it. This would also allow us to get feedback on how we do problems. No homework feedback meant we started getting feedback after the first midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were all theoretical and the psets/tests were practical. Really hard to bridge that gap.\r\n\r\nSometimes content was haphazard when taught (I.e. The class would jump around some) ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were good although very theoretical. The evening problem sessions were a nice complement to class time in that they provided actual problem examples. I wish Prof. Gomez had provided practice exams. Also, I thought the extra lectures scheduled so that we could devote the last two weeks to review were unnecessary. I would have preferred class running at a slower pace right up to reading period and having out-of-class review sessions. Also lame: our problem sets weren't graded. Prof. Gomez should get an additional TA or something so we know how we're doing on the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The class breakdown of 0% homework isn't great in my opinion.  It means that we're only receiving feedback 2 times a semester and there wasn't really a great way to know what to expect on the midterms.  The lectures spent too much time on derivations that made figuring out what the important parts were difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material\r\nWeaknesses: Poorly organized, hard to engage, no feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Stop letting Gomez teach this course. He does not care about his students and his teaching style is abysmal. I cannot think of one strength about this course. Gomez has been teaching too long for this to be his teaching style and we are not the only students who have felt this way. He is a very smart person but let him stick to research and stop interacting with students. ",
            "\u00a0There is so much material packed into this course that it just has to be fast paced. However, it was such a huge time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Gomez is the big weakness of this course. His handwriting is illegible, he writes all over the board in an incoherent manner, and skips around in his notes. The material is fast-paced and difficult but manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like a have a genuinely solid understanding of the material coming out of the course. The problem sessions on Tuesday night were very helpful. That being said, it felt a bit excessive at the beginning of the year when the professor had extra lectures and problem sessions in the same week.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed the videos that we watched towards the end of the course which demonstrated elements of the things that we were learning in class. I wish we could've seen some of these throughout the course as opposed to just at the end. \r\n\r\nIt's a bit harsh that psets do not count towards the final grade. I've never taken an engineering course where that was the case. I understand that it was out of a fear that the answers could be found online, but I feel like the numbers could've been changed from the text book problems or slightly adjusted in order to account for that problem. Furthermore, it isn't easier to find the answers to these problems than other engineering courses. Most students use the solutions to check their work, it is a helpful part of the pset process. ",
            "\u00a0This course moved way too fast for no reason at all, we finished all the material by Thanksgiving for no reason as we didn't have the final any earlier so it didn't take any of the stress off of anything, in fact it made the class more stressful. The problem sets were too long and posted too last minute to be useful (not to mention multiple PSETs over fall break). I do think I learned more in this class than I did in some of my other classes though and I do enjoy the material. It should be structured more appropriately to be a manageable load for students who have other commitments as well. ",
            "\u00a0The professor, Gomez, was easily the worst professor I've had at Yale. Fluids should be a good course. It is interesting and useful material for all types of engineering. However, he made it completely foreign and uninteresting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor is very available for office hours and extra help, TA review sessions were helpful in clarifying the material covered in class, class generally does not use powerpoints. Weaknesses: material is covered at a pace that is a little too fast, lectures were sometimes disorganized making it difficult to see the bigger picture, professor's handwriting was often hard to read, homework being graded for completion would have helped, first midterm was too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Gomez would probably disagree with this but-- I thought a rubric of topics for the exam, or review slides could be very helpful in the review for exams ",

            "\u00a0The course material is very hard, which makes teaching it difficult.

His lectures were absolutely useless and he simply talked to himself while pacing at the front of the classroom scribblING gibberish on the black board that he expected us to decipher.  We were left to teach ourselves an already difficult subject out of a dense and confusing textbook. Before the semester started he gloated about failing his students and making tests so hard that the average would be below 50%. That honestly should have been my first trigger to get out of his class as fast as possible. When we all feared for our grades, instead of finding tutors for the class he asked members of the class to volunteer to tutor each other and just never followed through with finding a tutor. He also forced us to complete 12 PSETs that were not graded nor looked at but if we didnt submit would negatively affected our grades. This means our grades were based on 3 exams (25%, 25%, 50%).  These PSETs took several hours to complete because he deliberately chose the hardest problems in the book and some of the information we were not even taught and were not relevant for the exams. The first midterm was essentially impossible partly because we didnt LEARN any of the information in class and partly because he refuses to give partial credit. The midterm also was not scheduled until last minute (like a week before) which he then yelled at us in class about not making time in our schedules last minute to hold it during the night instead of during class. Then, he proceeded to berate us in lecture about how poor our grades were. Maybe the problem is not us but his teaching?! On top of this, we were given almost no feedback for grades throughout the semester. He would only make passive aggressive comments in class such as A couple of you might fail. IF YOU ARE NOT ABET AND GOMEZ IS TEACHING THIS CLASS AGAIN, GO TALK TO COREY ABOUT SUBSTITUTING THIS CLASS FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING ELSE.
