            "\u00a0how to read and write knowledgeably in french. ",
            "\u00a0I really developed my French reading and writing skills through this course. Sometimes we had to read up to a hundred pages between classes, which forced me to take French reading seriously and dedicate a lot of time and effort to it. The result: my reading improved so much that I feel confident that I could basically read any piece of French literature now. Not only that, but I also built my literary analysis skills, similar to how one would from an English literature course at Yale. "

            "\u00a0There is too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could benefit from having more creative projects. This course is likely the first time its students haven really engaged with French literature, so fun projects could make it more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Mme Pinzka presents historical context in tandem with any new works of literature, which was super important to create context. The workload is quite high, however. ",
            "\u00a0FREN 170 gives a good survey of French literature in a way thats enjoyable and engaging. I didnt like all of the books I read, and I found a lot of them to be problematic. But, even the books I didnt like taught me a lot about French societies throughout history, and about literature. Obviously, its a question of personal taste and not a question of the course or the professors ability.\r\nI don't think anybody really brought up or even noticed this, but I think wealth/income inequality was so rampant among the students. This is a systemic issue within the French department or even just within Yale, not just this course. (I did notice, however, that French courses weirdly have a higher concentration of privileged people.) I got an impression that literally every other student but me went to well-known private schools like Choate, Hotchkiss, Exeter, and other ridiculously named schools that Ive never heard of before coming to Yale. This issues was especially important in this class because the concept of wealth/income inequality is SO important in literature, and I think could have been explored further. But it seemed like, even when the literature we were reading had clear implications about inequality, nobody really noticed or cared. For instance, in LAmant or Eve de ses decombres, the theme of wealth inequality is so important, but we didnt really discuss it. As a FGLI student, I felt unappreciated and left out in class (I mean it happens in basically EVERY class I take at Yale, but especially in the French department). I think the French department should start a discussion (among its faculty and also with its students) about how to reach out and provide extra resources for FGLI/POC/LGBTQIA+ students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: emphasis on discussion, on quality participation (remarks prepared outside of class and presented by each student); personal engagement with the texts (weekly reading responses); steady expansion of literary vocabulary.  Suggestions for improvement: greater attention to historical and artistic context. "

            "\u00a0Yes, this is a fantastic class for anyone who wants to be exposed to classic French literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would because I think literature is an important aspect of a language student's career ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you're willing to put in the work. It's very reading intensive and there are weekly written responses, as well as discussion questions you have to prepare for before each class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0FREN 170 is cool. You get to read a lot of cool literature and it will boost your reading and writing skills. Some of the students can be annoying but don't let them stop you. Its a fair amount of work  not too crazy, but not a gut. Be ready to work your brain. Just because its in French doesnt mean youre not going to do complex analyses. Think of it as a Yale English literature course, but just taught in French. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly: I think this course is a great stepping stone into higher level classes, both in terms of classroom approach and in terms of the skills and knowledge acquired. "
