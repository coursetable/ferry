            "\u00a0210 with Deb is a great exploration of acting methods but you don't even know you're doing them! This course was really therapeutic for me - it helps you explore what's going on inside your head in a way I never have before. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me so much--first and foremost a love of the craft of acting, second, the knowledge that the study of acting is the study of self and overlaps with so many other fields, and third, a better understanding of how to study the self. Deb is a life coach and a teacher, a mentor and a friend. This class was all about learning to break down parts of the self in order to understand how to manipulate them as an actor and a writer. ",
            "\u00a0We have received a great amount of practical skills to expand on some of the theory introduced in THST 110 & 111. Both in understanding past technique and developing work of our own, we were expected to filter everything through our own creative ideals. ",
            "\u00a0How to begin the process of become an artist and appreciate everything i and others can create ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about acting processes and how as a director to work with less experienced actors. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a solo show/curate ones personal writing for performance\r\nHow to use the body to create character\r\nStanislavsky work and how to make the private interesting\r\nRelaxation and ensemble-building ",
            "\u00a0The greatest thing about this course was finding power in myself as an artist and performer. I learned how to use that which is within me. ",
            "\u00a0I deepened my understanding of accessing humanity in acting through character work and acting exercises. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A little bit more \"rules\" for some of the exercises may have helped. Also there should've been a limit on how many friends could be invited for the final performances. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\n-Deb's teaching--Deb is an exceptional human being and teacher. More on her in the instructor section of feedback\r\n-Nice suggested readings--quite interesting. The final required reading, \"Mr. Vertigo\" was a wonderful way of wrapping things up. \r\n-a reasonable amount of work that was challenging and appropriate yet never gratuitous \r\n-wonderful tone for class--everyone had to participate, but never in an unhealthy way. coming to class was always a relief--something to be excited about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\n-only once or twice did Deb show some level of insecurity and let that impact her teaching approach. however, she is a human being, and this is totally okay. overall, she was consistent and wonderful. \r\n-sometimes expectations weren't crystal clear, and things could be a bit disorganized for some students (though this did not bother me personally) ",
            "\u00a0The strength is in the amount of work we get to do in class. As a theater studies major it was nice to move out of theory and use things in practice. We also got to create our own content, which was difficult and empowering. I wouldn't call it a weakness, but one of the challenges is that given the size of the class I don't think we were able to work on things as many times as we needed. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course, though selfishly I would have loved a bit more engagement with the academic side of acting theory. ",
            "\u00a0The number of people in this course was higher than normal, so there may not have been as much time to do everything we would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that this course did not truly provide me with acting knowledge that deepened my craft as an actor. I do feel that it helped me see and find the humanity in every person, which I think is a valuable and necessary asset as an actor, however I wish that there were more opportunities to work on acting itself. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It's a required class for THST majors, so yes. But if Deb is teaching it again, get on that one!!! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to write, act, study theatre, or have a better understanding of yourself and your world, take this class! It is like nothing else at Yale that I've experienced. Deb takes the approach that acting and writing are fundamentally connected, in that, to understand our worlds, and our relation to our world, we need to work hard to break down the concept of self. To understand the self is to be able to break it down and manipulate it as an actor or writer, opening up new ways of seeing. This class sometimes feels like therapy, but it's not. It's a thorough study of self, and if you believe Deb--take her word, as many before you have done--you will not regret it. She knows exactly what she's doing. Let her guide you, do what she says, and you'll reap countless benefits. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Take THST 210. You will be empowered to create and express through performanceit's not necessarily a traditional \"acting class,\" though we delved into various acting technique exercises. It is somehow more fundamental than that, an exploration of the one's desires, identity, and creative potential. The skills you learn in 210 are vital to engaging yourself in art. ",
            "\u00a0Deb is amazing. Anyone willing to step out of the box and let go will gain so much. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you're interested in acting Deb is a phenomenal teacher, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a very useful course for anyone pursuing performance or writing; it empowers you to consistently generate work and learn from peers. ",
            "\u00a0This was the greatest academic experience I have ever had. I am so grateful to have taken this. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, as Deb is a gem and the opportunity to work with her is brilliant, however if you are looking for acting training, this may not be what you are looking for. "
