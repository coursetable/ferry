            "\u00a0We learn a lot about European politics, both from a contemporary historical perspective. Learn how to take a more theoretical approach to many of the contemporary issues (immigration, etc...). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about European History and Politics and gained very strong research and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0European Politics taught me to understand the national politics of advanced economies. The analytical, research and discussion skills Professor Cameron taught will serve me well academically, professionally and personally--at Yale and beyond. "

            "\u00a0Very good, but challenging, course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was excellent and I really enjoyed it. Potentially a greater focus on contemporary European issues would be good, but the historical focus was also excellent. ",
            "\u00a0European Politics boasted nothing but strengths. First and foremost, Professor Cameron is a brilliant scholar--evidently one of the leading experts of his field. No doubt, he is one of the best professors I have had at Yale so far. He is not only incredibly brilliant but also tremendously charismatic, humorous, approachable and caring. He went above and beyond to educate and care for every single one of his students. "

            "\u00a0If you are willing to do in depth, sometimes dry reading, then yes. I definitely learned a lot from the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - the class had excellent discussions and I learned a huge amount. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a must-take for anyone interested in the politics of developed nations or Europe more broadly. You will gain tremendously from Professor Cameron's wisdom, the breadth, depth and structure of the material and discussions--facilitated expertly by Professor Cameron--with brilliant classmates. "
