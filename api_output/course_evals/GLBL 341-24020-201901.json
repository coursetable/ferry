            "\u00a0I reflected alot on the state of democracy today, gained a greater understanding of reading social science literature, and gained a better background in the different political ideologies of the day. I improved my speaking skills in discussions, my social science writing (research, argumentation, etc), and in general my ability to asses strengths and weaknesses of today's political institutions, policies, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushed me to think about some really tough questions -- many of which didn't have clear answers. As such, I learned how to think critically about the current system in which we live. ",
            "\u00a0A thorough dive into democratic norms and institutions, recent and past threats they have encountered, and efforts to preserve them. Great readings, interesting discussions, and a balanced seminar format all made the course outstanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of the various challenges facing democracy in our complicated time. It is one of the most well-structured and engaging seminars I have taken at Yale, and every class is a great discussion. Readings are selected from old and new authors, very well balanced, and always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Working knowledge of the most important issues and themes relevant to our democracy today. ",
            "\u00a0A well-rounded understanding of the threats facing democracy. We participated in very productive discussion and Dr. Young was very helpful in guiding and organizing our thoughts. ",

            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of and insights into the challenges currently facing democracy and democratic countries, particularly in the United States and Europe. The course examined key democratic institutions and how they could be preserved, and further analyzed contemporary challenges to democracy, such as technology and globalization, and how they could best be mitigated.

            "\u00a0Dr. Young is a FABULOUS professor, the class discussions were super interesting, the writing assignments were really engaging, and the workload is very manageable. The topic felt extremely relevant and we began each class with a talk about the news, which provided alot of insights. I loved how much Dr. Young cared about her students and the topic. Her personal experience in politics added alot to our discussions, and I appreciated the outside speakers too. She gives great feedback on writing, which was also super helpful. The presentations at the beginning of class are a great refresher on the readings. The only improvement I can think of is sometimes directing the seminars a little bit more through giving some more background information on that day's topic (i.e. statistics, policies, etc), so there are concrete points learned in addition to a great, more open-ended discussion. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing class. Great readings, engaging discussions, and a fantastic seminar professor in Dr. Young. You get so much useful and constructive feedback on your writing and thinking, individualized attention during office hours, and exposure to different ways of thinking during class. Truly what a Yale seminar should be! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the professor, the class discussions, the readings, the paper topics - everything!\r\n\r\nI can think of no significant weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) Dr. Young is phenomenal. She is very dedicated to the class and goes out of her way to engage with students. She has a knack for building positive classroom environments in the service of particularly timely and relevant questions. (2) The subject matter is fascinating. Being active engaged in thinking about our democracy is so important!!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) Occasionally we would meander a little too far out of the way in our class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very strong in that Dr. Young successfully guided all of us through some of the hardest questions facing democratic governance today. The biggest strength is its structure, and the ways in which we as a class discuss these topics. Dr. Young is incredible at providing comprehensive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Young is a great instructor. She is well-prepared and engaged with students. The topics are incredibly relevant to politics of today, and therefore, students came to class willing to learn. The structure allowed a broad, but in-depth, exploration of democratic problems. Many of the readings were interesting, making discussions lively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While I appreciated the focus on current events, sometimes the discussion would distract from the week's materials. Moreover, I think the beginning third of the class, which is grounded in democratic theory, could be expanded on; there were important topics that were touched on in later classes that would have been nice to dwell on. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Young's courses are always amazing because of the student discourse she allows for in class. I would change nothing about this class. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions are generally interesting and engaging. They mostly focus on discussing current events and on whichever aspect of democracy is the topic of the week. This makes for good class discussions , but while readings provide a general introduction to each week's topics, they are rarely discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the syllabus, which includes key readings that introduce a variety of perspectives on the different topics, the structure of the course, which methodically examines different democratic institutions, and the seminar discussions, which helped me better defend my own ideas and also showed me new arguments and ways of thinking. The only weakness of the course was that I often felt we did not have enough time in seminar to cover everything about that week's topic. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! Dr. Young is amazing, she cares so much about students and their learning. The class discussions and assignments were very, very interesting. I learned alot and it felt like the kind of class I came to Yale for. ",
            "\u00a0I think every student at Yale who wants to be an engaged global citizen should take this class. It's one of the best classes that I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A class to cherish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Absolutely take it if you have the chance. If you care about democracy (you really should) this class will provide you with various angles to think about what democracy means, what the main threats to democracy are, and what you can do to preserve democracy. Essential knowledge for our complicated 21st century. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in democracy! Perfect class for someone who is interested in both the theory and the practice. Dr. Young appreciates both sides as well. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, for anyone who likes to debate and discuss issues about governance. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in covering topics such as the courts, inequality, technologyall in relation to democracythis class is the opportunity to do so. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any Yale student interested in today's politics and future of democracy and today's global institutions. This class was fascinating, and I enjoyed all of the diverse readings on the syllabus. I became a better writer and more involved political spectator as a result of this class, and students are called to get involved with democracy in its many forms. This class, and discussions make the time fly by. Dr. Young is an excellent professor, and her personal engagement with many significant current events gives students a unique window into the political and social movements of today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in learning about, discussing, and debating current challenges to U.S. and European democracy. Professor Young brings experience working in the U.S. government and facilitates lively and interesting debates in the classroom. She also provides some of the best and most comprehensive feedback on essays that I have received at Yale. I would recommend this class to anyone hoping to understand the current state of U.S. democracy and the best ways to ensure its preservation. "
