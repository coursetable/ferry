            "\u00a0I gained a higher mastery of both written and spoken Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Continuation of Chinese 132, as the course description says. There's more focus this semester on the finer details of grammar, and you really start to dive into some of the more subtle aspects of the language; this usually entails attention to words and phrases that roughly have the same translation to English, but differ in their Chinese usage. You will also transition from learning about daily life in China to larger social, political, and economic phenomena, such the increase in divorce rates, the Chinese college entrance examination, and the many implications of China's economic transition in the 1970's. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT of Chinese. I've improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I increased my Chinese language ability. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills all improved dramatically. It was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Chinese. In addition to learning lots of new characters and grammar patterns, we also focused a lot on conversational skills which was very helpful. I'm still not great, but I'm better! ",
            "\u00a0I grew more comfortable with using elevated vocabulary in speech and writing, while entertaining topics in Chinese history and society. "

            "\u00a0On the whole, this course is very effective. It is well-organized and practical, and the teachers are approachable and always willing to help. One weakness of the course is that class conversations feel forced and are not very engaging. Perhaps that speaks more to the language level of us students, but the class may benefit from more creative ways to encourage dialogue. I enjoyed days when we held debates, or broke up into small groups. ",
            "\u00a0The small class sizes facilitate plenty of discussion, and present an abundance of opportunities to practice speaking and incorporate new phrases, vocabulary, and grammar structures. I do also think the textbook, part of the Princeton Chinese Language system, is an incredibly effective way to learn both the Chinese language and about Chinese culture. Furthermore, while the daily quizzes might seem like a nuisance at times, preparing for them will get easier and easier this semester as you inevitably start to master the art of learning characters. With that said, a substantial weakness of this course was that the lessons became repetitive; we would sometimes simply read the text over and over again and go over true and false questions that I didn't find to be a particularly effective use of time. I feel that time would have been better spent going over grammar structures or having the aforementioned discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the inclusion of student voices in what should be taught next or if we should start including films in our syllabus. However, I think grading could have been more transparent. No students ever knew what their grades were at a given time in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of engagement and the professors were really good at communicating with the students ",
            "\u00a0It is a fantastic course for improving your Chinese abilities. It is a lot of work, but it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well taught, and it is evident that the professors highly care about not just the students' learning, but their overall well-being. ",
            "\u00a0The strength and weakness is the same: there is a lot of work. You'll learn a lot because there is so much work, but it's also frustrating sometimes how much work there is. ",
            "\u00a0Small class sizes, opportunities for presentation, and a variety of assigned tasks were definite strengths.\r\n\r\nSometimes the class material adhered to the textbook too closely. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. You'll be able to build on what you learned in Chinese 132, and your Chinese will continue to improve in all aspects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the professors were so great ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to improve your Chinese. It is a lot of work, but it is worth it. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to anyone trying to improve their Chinese skills, especially oral skills. ",
