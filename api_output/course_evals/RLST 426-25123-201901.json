            "\u00a0This course incorporated a wide range of texts and dealt with each rigorously in a way that both brought out each individual text's unique contribution to the course and linked their relative impacts to the anthropology of religion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lucia was a definite strength of the course. She's an excellent discussion leader and provides incredible feedback on written work. It was also clear that she is passionate about what she studies and teaches! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The only one I can come up with is that sometimes, the readings felt like they were a bit longer than needed  I think we could have gotten the gist of most scholars' approaches and arguments with fewer sections from their works.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested ethnography or religion without reservation. It was informative, engaging, and combined complex material with active and innovative student discussion that helped me grow intellectually. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend Religion & Ethnography, or any course taught by Lucia, to any student. Lucia is right that the class has more of a book group feeling in the best way. There's no jockeying for airtime or extra points in her class, just thoughtful conjecture and engagement. It seemed that everyone in the class, whether theory newbie (me) or graduate student, was able to delve into what interested them most. If you take the class, you will get excellent feedback on your work. Not only were the assignments interesting and varied (for most of them, we got to choose the genre and creative angle), Lucia provided a page of single-spaced feedback on each one. She will summarize what you've accomplished in the piece, enumerate and praise your strengths, and provide specific areas for improvement and further development. And a random note to end  out of all the professors I've had in college, Lucia wins Best Use of Chalkboard. She really used it as a tool to map out our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I could not recommend this class enough to another student. The content was contemporary and exciting to engage with and the classroom environment that Lucia fosters is par none. This class, in my opinion, was everything a Yale College course should be: a place to push yourself intellectually among a community of scholars. "
