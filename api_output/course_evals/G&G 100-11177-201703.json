The averages on our midterms were a B- and B so its by no means a guaranteed A.  Our weekly P-sets took a surprising amount of time and office hours were often filled since the material was significantly harder than what we were doing in lectures. In the end, if you need a science credit its a relatively painless way to get it. Otherwise, I'm not sure what you're doing in this class. ",

While this class is called Natural Disasters, and you do learn about earthquakes, hurricanes, and asteroid impacts, you learn a lot about what allows them to exist: how the universe and solar system were formed, how the earth was formed, how plates have moved and changed the world's climate, how clouds themselves form, how plate tectonics allow life on earth, or how life on earth formed. ",

I had originally signed up because natural disasters are a significant part of humanitarian operations, development, global warming impacts, etc. Not only did the professors include many of these real-world intersections and talk about tons of examples with every scientific concept, but I also came to enjoy the science of it all too. My intention coming into Yale was to only take two science classes and make them as easy and humanities based as possible, and now I am psyched to take not one, but two terms of physics, a term of chemistry, and more science classes down the road. In high school, I'd never taken a hard science course past freshman conceptual physics, so there was a steep learning curve for me to do the problem sets. Section was really really great, and the professors have set up tutoring drop-in sections too, which were enormously helpful. I would go to section, where the professors walked us through the problem sets and helped us learn the math and physics to set up the problems, then we did them on our own. I needed additional help to figure out some of the things I just copied, so going to the tutoring drop-in hours was really really great, so much so that every time I turned in a p-set, I understood what I was doing. I am thrilled by how much I learned in the course and how much I see things I learned in my life and just to understand.Natural disasters deeply impacted my family this fall in both Houston and San Juan; to me, it just felt a little better knowing the science behind why. I also am a huge hiker, camper, backpacker, etc, so learning about a bunch of the ideas (in particular, how thunderstorms form) was really exciting and relevant to me to see what I've learned when I'm out. Overall, the professors were really really great-they were both so friendly and helpful, and their lectures were awesome. Their enthusiasm is also contagious! Goodness, I ramble a lot. ",

Also the lecture slides are all posted on Canvas, which makes studying for the tests a lot easier. The weaknesses of this class are that lectures can get a bit dry and, and the problem sets sometimes took longer than expected. These issues could possibly be improved by making lectures more engaging and making problem sets shorter or less tedious. ",

I learned a lot about the earth. \r\n\r\nI think the way the subject matter was presented, especially in the latter end of the course, was not always conducive to helping people without a geologic background learn this material. Oftentimes, lectures included a boatload of information, which was difficult to distill to the main points. However, going to section definitely helped me do this. \r\n\r\nAs far as exams, I really preferred the structure of the final to those of the midterms. Yes, there were more questionsbut each question was worth fewer points. ",

Would have preferred problem sets that included more conceptual questions since the tests were mostly based off those. ",
            "\u00a0Love that the class was taught 3 times a week--repetition helped with retention. Prof.s Berkovici and Long knew how to make the information digestible and were a delight to listen to. They were really focused on making sure that we remember the basics down the line so they didn't force us to memorize unessential details that we would forget right away--really appreciated that because I think it worked! ",

            "\u00a0This course is often sped through material that was later discovered to be important (appearing on exams), but would harp on math problems that would have been possible to do without such extensive help, and did not contribute as much to the critical knowledge that we should have gained have from the course.

If you want to save money, you don't need it at all. I don't regret buying it though because it's really well written, very readable, and frankly, I was really interested in the topics so I'm keeping it too to finish reading it. \r\nIf you get P. Bercovici's book, (which looks cute, but don't be fooled-it's dense), the questions on the problem set feel even more relevant. I read the book over winter break after finishing the class, and I realized that the seemingly random questions actually were so important and relevant and their answers are discussed in the book, so it was cool to know the math and concepts behind their conclusion.\r\nThe sections are great; they're really really great and super helpful. Yes, they walk you through the problem, but for me, I spent a lot of time afterwards understanding each step that I copied. If they hadn't gotten us so far in section, I would not have had the time to really understand each of the problems and some I would not have figured out at all. \r\nAgain, both professors were amazing-I can't even stress that enough!

I'd also often have to go back through lectures to get concepts down before I could start the pset. ",

I would never have been able to work out some of the equations without going to section, which was a bit frustrating at times. ",

If you couldnt attend the optional sections, you had no chance of passing. Also, it took 10 days to grade a 4 question p set, I ended up failing the first p sets because of a simple error, and I never got feedback so I made the same mistake in the second one and failed that one too. Also, the midterms have one math question on them. So its hours of p sets on things never covered in class to take midterms on things not covered in p sets. If you didnt memorize the book you were screwed. ",

Maybe the only thing I can think of is it would be interesting to learn about a bit more practical stuff about what to do in the event of natural disasters (we did talk about this briefly) as well as engineering solutions, etc. ",

Instead of having to read the entire chapter, since much of the readings were not relevant to the tests or what we discussed in lectures, the readings can be specified to sections perhaps. That way, students may feel less discouraged from the high amount of readings and will focus better on what they know is crucial to understanding the materials. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any other student that is not a science major. The material is not too complicated and is very interesting. Who would not want to learn about the Earth's natural disasters? ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for someone who needs a science credit. This is also a good class for someone interested in the material as a science major, as long as they are not frustrated by the time taken for very basic physics. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a science credit and are comfortable with math below calculus, take this. If you like rocks or are how natural phenomena occur, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0be prepared to solve physics problems in a class that doesnt prepare you for that material and only glosses over natural disasters in themselves. poorly run and not interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a good course for non science majors ",
            "\u00a0Sure, its a good science credit, straightforward ",
            "\u00a0Natty D's is a great science course to take if you are not a STEM Major. Don't be fooled; it is NOT a gut. That being said, the professors are great and the course material is super interesting if you actually involve yourself in the course. I definitely recommend it. And if you put in work into the course, it is definitely not hard to get an A/A-. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good science credit, and it is interesting and relevant to current events. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class so much-I wrote two really really long answers to the other questions, so if you want to know more and why, read that too. I would absolutely recommend. I've only taken four classes at Yale so far, and this has been my absolute favorite. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially one curious about the basics of the solar system, and earth's weather. This course is incredibly interesting, with subject matter that I know I wouldn't have learned anywhere else. The lectures are super entertaining and raise questions about human existence and our relationship to the environment. Already I have found this course incredibly useful in understanding everything from politics to weather. In taking this course, keep in mind that it is a lot more work than you'll expect. The psets do take time, and the exams are hard in that they cover a lot of content in a very short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0NatD is a pretty easy science class. The math is tedious mostly algebra and unit conversion, think non-calculus high school physics, but if you'd rather have that than more conceptually challenging math then NatD will be fine. The concepts covered in the class are actually pretty interesting, but you have to go out of your way to understand them in greater depth. A solid gut, overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. The professors are highly engaged and knowledgeable and are very accessible with their office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course. It is very informative on topics that occur in our everyday lives and very interesting. The professors are very nice and willing to help whenever you need it. ",
            "\u00a0Take Natty D! I feel like I have a much deeper understanding about the earth and climate. The class isn't too difficult if you pay attention in lecture and take it seriously. The professors are both really cool and experts in their fields. This entire class was an awesome experience and it is very accessible for non-science majors. ",
            "\u00a0Never ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I came in knowing very little about natural disasters, and left the class understanding how and why they occur, as well as gaining some insight into disasters in recent history. The workload was not too difficult (one pset per week, 2 midterms, and a final), and there was a lot of support from the teaching staff when I had any confusions. Very interesting and fun class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend, especially to a non-STEM major who is looking to practice the basics of math, physics and even a little bit of chemistry without taking a course with a lot of pre-meds and pre-engineers. I was able to practice skills I'd forgotten from high school and learned a ton about natural disasters which was really interesting and frankly very relevant! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Not necessarily a gut. Go to homework sections and study those for the test ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY recommend. However, be warned, it has a gut name but it is not a gut. You actually learn pretty cool stuff, but if you don't study/go over lecture notes, you'll be in trouble. It's a fun class though. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes - good science credit for non-science major ",
            "\u00a0No. Never. You are better off just googling natural disasters and reading the wikipedia page. May be the worst class I have taken at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I definitely recommend. It is a pretty cool class- I learned a lot of fun random facts as well as a basic understanding of how the earth functions. It is a great science credit for non science majors. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking to gain a broad overview of earth science, this is a great course. You learn about a lot of interesting things, from earthquakes to the origin of life. You don't need great quantitative skills because they will help you do the whole problem set in section, and there aren't many quantitative questions on the tests. So as long as you go to lecture and have a good understanding of the concepts it won't be too difficult and you can learn a lot of very interesting, relevant things. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think it was a relevant course to what was going on in the actual world and what will be going on. The physics and math parts of the course was definitely manageable and interesting. This was a great introduction overall to the geology field. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It was very interesting and didn't require a ton of work. "
