            "\u00a0Lecture is actually pretty interesting most of the time, but section is absolutely terrible. Class discussion was extremely forced and incredibly awkward. I left section every day feeling frustrated that this is what passes for a Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0given that usually many professors teach the class, it was hard to deal with the different teaching styles of each professor when we moved from topic to topic (i.e. some spoke extremely fast and were not the best at explaining complex material, others were much more patient and paced with us) ",

But all in all, we did learn a lot of important information that will help us in understanding our world and its sociopolitical issues. ",

As a result, engagement during exam times was limited to memorization, and connecting biological concepts from class was limited (since it required the student to go beyond the \"study guides\" of the course) ",
            "\u00a0Some of the instructors are much more engaging than others. I found that it was so much easier to grasp the material with certain instructors over others, which could be frustrating. The TFs in the class were very helpful though. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of the lectures moved too fast for the students to be able to write down and understand the material they were hearing, and I thought the exams could have been a bit shorter so we had time to check them over and finish them ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting, and I definitely enjoyed learning about a breadth of topics over the course of the class. I think the course could be improved with more integration of the biology and issues portion in lecture, rather than just split between lecture and section. The tests often asked questions I feel weren't covered heavily in lecture or in the readings, but they still seemed fair enough. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths was that the lectures were only fifty minutes, which definitely helped to keep students engaged for the whole lecture period. The material was well taught, however the teaching styles and speeds at which the professors taught varied a lot. It would have been better to keep one lecturer for the entire course. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting types of technology, discussion sections were great\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: terrible lecturers except for Sung, repeating lecture ideas and knowledge, tests were way too difficult and had nothing to do with discussion sections, honestly this class should have just been the discussion section, weekly discussion section assignments were unnecessary ",
            "\u00a0this course was great, very engaging and had a good balance of issues and biology ",
            "\u00a0It seemed like we had an exam every other week, and then a paper afterwards was a LOT. A lot of the lectures kind of got bogged down in the science to where it was hard to follow, especially in the beginning. The lectures were where more of the science was discussed, while the issues were kept solely to section, and I kind of wish they had been better integrated. I would have loved to have had lectures which discussed the issues, that was kind of what I was hoping for with the course in the first place ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Weekly writeup assignments\r\n-Section participation \r\n-Rachel, my TA\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Changing professors every few weeks was really difficult to keep up with.  Teaching styles differed literally once a month.\r\n-The final exam review sheets did not always match what was on the exam, which meant that we could not rely on review sessions to help us study for the test. ",
            "\u00a0The ordering of the different subjects in the course was sometimes a bit random, and even suboptimal. It seems that this could be mitigated by having the different professors communicate more between themselves on what they were gonna teach\r\n\r\nSection and the paper were by far the best parts of this course. Lecture sometimes seemed to focus on almost arbitrarily chosen peculiarities of biology ",
            "\u00a0The course had no strengths. It's major weakness was that it went into too much detail in lecture and was very poorly organized.\r\n\r\nThe structure with multiple professors was very confusing. Each professor talked in-depth about the topic they research, which meant the level of detail in lecture was way beyond that required for a non-major science class.\r\n\r\nThe class also had very strange policies. There was a \"don't ever tell students their section grades\" rule. This was incredibly stupid. Every week we had to write 1-2 page papers, but because TAs couldn't discuss assignments/grades, this made it impossible to try to improve your writing for the harshly-graded term paper. Also, apparently the class will be curved, but the TAs were forbidden from sharing this information. This is a very strange policy to enact when students are averaging low Bs on every exam. Telling us would probably have boosted class confidence.\r\n\r\nStudy guides and review sessions were terrible. They barely overlapped with the material that we were tested on. This was incredibly frustrating because students would spend hours researching study guide questions and attending the review sessions to eventually learn that all their hard work was for nothing. ",
            "\u00a0The material for section related like 0% to the material in lecture -- its essentially two different courses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was fairly accessible to everyone, regardless of your science background or academic pursuits here at Yale. The professors were cognizant of breaking down any scientific jargon and really rounding out discussion to focus not just on science, but also the ethics at play. Discussion sections were another core asset to the class, and really helped press the ethical/political/social issues that we weren't necessarily able to fully cover in lecture. As for a weakness, it was kind of hard to switch between different lecturer (and thus teaching styles), but having a constant TF and discussion section really helped maintain consistency. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness is having a number of different professors teach, getting just one throughout a course is better ",
            "\u00a0The \"issues\" and the \"biology\" side do not connect as much as they should. What we learned in section was not what we learned in lecture, and the tests covered too much material. The course rotated professors too often, and I think it tried to cover too much. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course material and found all the lecturers to be engaging. Some material was covered in class more quickly than I would have liked, but the TAs were always good at explaining things in section. I also wish we'd received clearer instruction in what was expected of us on the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course to be a very manageable science credit - I enjoyed the way it was taught. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is extremely organized. The weakness is that it could talk more about biology in the discussion section since ultimately the biology is way more important than the ethic involved. ",
            "\u00a0Great course- very in depth but instructors varied ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - lectures are interesting\r\nWeaknesses- most of the homework is just busy work ",
            "\u00a0This course is poorly taught. A lot of assumptions are made and sometimes professors will use terminology for a whole lecture that no one understands and then figure it out at the end. Dont take this if you dont want to be learning kind of difficult bio topics on your own. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class was how beneficial the section meetings were, also the class structure was organized and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was that the articles we read about ethical issues were interesting. Overall weakness was that science professors don't understand how to tailor a course to non-science majors. We moved too quickly through scientific course material but also didn't go into enough depth, leaving students confused about what the concepts were, how they worked, and why they were significant. Homework assignments were also incredibly tedious (although I appreciated that they weren't difficult). ",
            "\u00a0The TA is amazing and you receive a lot of feedback. You get a specialist to teach you each section. I thought the transition from one professor to the other was smooth. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this class much more than I thought I would. I missed taking science courses and it was refreshing to revisit bio. Some lecturers were more interesting than others, but my TA (Rachel Plumb) was outstanding. Discussion section was interesting and I liked the topics discussed. Sometimes the order of lectures seemed arbitrary, and there was an excessive amount of weekly work. I don't think there should be an brief essay assigned every week. And 3 exams and a final essay seems excessive. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting switching up the lecturer every few weeks but also meant that some lecturers were better than others. It was nice to have professors teach on their specialties. Certain lecturers had way too much content on their slides and it was difficult to take notes at the pace they were moving at, and sometimes professors covered the same material by accident. Each professor made different assumptions about what background knowledge the students had- would be better to have this be universal. Overall though very interesting material and presented the biology in a relatively understandable way. Felt like we had an exam every 3 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course's goal of giving students an understanding of the science behind issues so we can develop a informed opinion is very important, and I felt that the course achieved that. I also appreciated the chance to discuss the \"issues\" in section, and the chance to delve into a topic of my interest in the final paper. However, there was some inconsistency in terms of depth of science across different lecturers, and some lecturers were better than others. I also felt that the course overall was a bit disorganized with all the different people involved. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture and section were both informational and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many of the lecturers, really good TFs, interesting material, well organized for learning (user friendly to review for exams and prepare the final paper). Weaknesses: many students don't talk in section or don't say interesting things (probably an us thing and not a problem with the course), some lecturers were weaker than others. "

The lectures are very science-heavy and the discussion sections are ethics and politics based. You should know that the course requires more work than you might expect. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah this is a great class to take as a 5th class or for a science credit. Make sure you get a good TA. Interesting material and good lecturers, not too much weekly homework but a lot of tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good science credit in terms of actual being useful, so I would recommend it for that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a perfect science class for a non-science major. It covered major issues and tied in political applications. ",
