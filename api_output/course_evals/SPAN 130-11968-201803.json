            "\u00a0I learned so much from Profesora Symons-Roldn about how to speak extemporaneously in Spanish, and how to engage in really meaningful conversations without fearing small grammar mistakes. She always corrected them, but so kindly! ",
            "\u00a0I developed better speaking and writing skills especially. I also learned a vast amount of different tenses and really enjoyed the way the professor taught. ",

            "\u00a0L3 had an exam/quiz/essay almost every couple days. it felt like as soon as one ended then you had to cram to study for the next one. I think more formative learning would improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0There is definitely too much testing. Students are constantly studying and trying to stay on top of homework, readings and testing/ in-class essays were too much. Two ways to mitigate this pressure may be to provide the opportunity to drop a lower grade or to reduce the amount of testing altogether. I think the content is well organised and important, but maybe a little reading-heaving. ",
            "\u00a0The short stories we read were really so enriching to my understanding of Spanish-speaking culture, and I wish that the novella we read at the end of the semester were more reflective of classic literature in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths are the amount of work and information. The weaknesses are sometimes too much is expected, for example, reading 50 pages of a book in one night. ",
            "\u00a0Having this course everyday of the week deters many students from taking it. 2 or 3 times a week for a longer amount of time would be much more effective and would inspire students to take spanish up to L5 ",
            "\u00a0Some of the curriculum was quite boring like the book. ",
            "\u00a0Great variety of interesting materials. Useful vocabulary. Pleasingly even distribution of work throughout the semester (with a bit of an increase towards the end). The course could be improved by: (1) avoiding italic font in notebook readings (e.g. El sueno de Pluto); (2) assigning less weight to quizzes in the final grade. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course with this teacher. Profesora Symons was OUTSTANDING, and I loved every morning of Spanish with her. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to a student that is trying to fulfill the language requirement. It is a lot of work and meets every day, so it is not worth it to take the class otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, every student must fulfill the language requirement, so I strongly suggest taking L3 Spanish. It is a challenge but at the end of the semester it feels as though you can speak fluently in most tenses (past, present, future). ",
