            "\u00a0I developed my writing skills (can be seen in question 11), and through the different readings and discussion, learned about the avant-garde movement, what made a n art piece avant-garde, and how to evaluate art in terms of their content and formal elements. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a wealth of knowledge on both the history of artistic movements and the philosophies behind these movements. In terms of my writing ability, I received private instruction on my writing at least one time per essay which helped me develop my writing's structural problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop a strong and cohesive claim. I also became much better at participating in class. I learned how to think critically about the course's readings and then contribute to the discussions. This was class was honestly amazing in terms of the material that we covered. I entered the class not even knowing what the word \"avant-garde\" meant and am now leaving it with an incredible understanding of it. ",
            "\u00a0I became a stronger writer by taking this course. I learned how to form a strong claim and develop a supporting argument. ",
            "\u00a0I think my writing improved immensely. I was finally able to develop my own voice when writing critical analysis. I feel much more comfortable with proper Chicago citation as well. I also learned a lot about of avant-garde film and art. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a profound understanding of avant-garde movements and theories. I am also now equipped with some of the tools and strategies necessary for art analysis. I furthered my ability to critically assess my own writing with a newfound understanding of the components that make for a cogent argument. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to build and support an aruguement ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to interpret Avant-Garde art and how to identify art forms of the AG in cultures throughout history. Additionally, I learned how to properly structure and formulate a college level essay. "

        [
            "\u00a0As much as reading art critics were stimulating, I would also prefer to look at more avant-garde poetry and writings in class (which we did a couple times), being exposed to even more objects would be helpful in understanding and identifying the avant-garde.\r\nOther than that, I think this class is very focused on improving writing skills, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of the course are negligible and my initial misgivings about taking this course were rectified by the end of the class. What I love about this class is the structure. Every reading had a purpose and felt as if it were building a great body of artistic and historical knowledge. There was also a great connect between the readings and the classes. Too often I hear stories of teachers assigning readings, only to never discuss them. In this course, the readings always corresponded with the class material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths: many chances to meet with the Professor, lots of peer editing, improved my writing abilities, great class discussions, interesting readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: heavy workload ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it is very interesting and engaging. All of the assignment deadlines are given well in advance and the multiple drafts really help with writing a solid paper. \r\n\r\nThe weakness is that there is unfortunately not a lot of time available for peer review. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fascinating readings, great professor, dynamic class dialogue, freedom to write about what we care about. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none! ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I can identify was the procedure for peer-editing. Anna would send us 3 essays the night prior to class and we would then proceed to analyze all 3 in class. By not staggering the essays over a few days, we all felt a bit of editing fatigue -- there was not much incentive (or class time) to really engage with the second or third essay. I think a partner, rather than collective exchange system would enable closer, more critical constructive criticism. \r\n\r\nThis course's greatest strength was our fascinating and engaging class discussions. Anna did an excellent job facilitating productive debates, ensuring everyone's ideas were heard and interrupting only to raise a thought-provoking, erudite questions. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was absolutely amazing. She was so knowledgeable about the content of the course and was very passionate about our class discussions. Furthermore, she made each class interesting and fun to participate in. "

        [
            "\u00a0Would recommend. Especially if you're into modern/contemporary art or want to know  more about some of the concepts in art, this is an incredibly interesting class. In order to participate in discussions, you don't need a strong background in art or art history, and this class teaches some of the basic concepts of avant-garde in an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student, especially if they are interested in art. The discussions of the course get very wild and philosophical, which I personally loved. If one does not like art, I will still recommend it but give the warning of the course being difficult at times if one has little to no experience with art. I went in with little experience with art and now have the ability to discuss art competently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class has drastically improved my writing abilities. Anyone who wants to learn how to write college-level papers and/or is interested in art should strongly consider this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is interesting, Professor Shechtman was phenomenal, and it will truly help you improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0YES! This was perhaps my favorite class I took this semester. Anyone, even if you aren't particularly interested in the avant-garde, should take this course because it gives you another lens through which to analyse the art/world around you. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone fascinated by art history and looking to enhance their writing abilities. It was extremely well taught, readings were interesting and usually pretty accessible, and classes struck the perfect balance between lecture/presentation and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Please take this course! It is meant for anyone and not just to artistically orientated people! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The workload is very manageable, the professor is wonderful, the content is interesting and fun. "
