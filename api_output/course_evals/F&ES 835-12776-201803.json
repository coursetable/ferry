Key insight I gained was how many stakeholders are involved in community decision-making, and how complex and time-consuming the approval process can be for these decisions. ",

The classes didn't really connect to one another and 50 minutes each week didn't seem like long enough for the class to seem real. I think it'd be better if this one credit course was a more intensive half semester course. I also think it should be 1 hour instead of 50 minutes. The readings were not that engaging. ",
