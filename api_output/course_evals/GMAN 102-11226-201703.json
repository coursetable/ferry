I also think a shorter class time meeting 2 days a week would've made it easier to retain information than one long class each weak. I also really liked the songs and other fun aspects of the course.

Not a stress inducing class or a heavy work load, but still a wholesome way to learn or hold onto a culture that is in need of preservation. The monotony of the long class time is nicely broken with songs... ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are looking to get an excellent base in the reading Yiddish! we go over the structure of the language and translation strategies so that we can understand complex texts on our own. Workload is manageable and often times quite intellectually compelling. ",
            "\u00a0Grammar-based and translation-focused intro to yiddish. Lots of leeway to choose texts to translate and present on authors. "
