            "\u00a0Ah, course evaluations! I learned a LOT about Prussian Blue. And that some guy got poisoned by eating sushi that was poisoned with polonium-210. I also learned how to teach myself 1000 slides worth of material since the professor did not. Lastly, I learned that I will absolutely not be taking Organometallic chemistry because I am not putting myself through this again. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to determine the properties of inorganic complexes (d electron count, electron configuration, geometry) and how to write reasonable mechanisms for basic catalytic reactions. I also learned about applications of inorganic chemistry in alternative energy and biology. ",
            "\u00a0I'll tell you what I learned very little inorganic chemistry, and a lot of useless historical trivia. The only inorganic chemistry this course actually taught was electron counting, d electron configurations, metallic complex geometry, substitution reactions, electron transfer, oxidative addition / reductive elimination, and insertion / elimination reactions. Fundamentals of inorganic complexes? Nah, not necessary. Anything useful to modern day inorganic reactions? Nah. Topics that are actually important to inorganic chemistry, such as crystal field theory, ligand field theory, proton-coupled electron transfer, the Heck reaction, and Suzuki coupling were either mentioned once for 30 seconds (this is not an exaggeration), or not mentioned at all. But I don't think I could have lived another day without knowing that Vermeer used ultramarine pigment, that the Tenere Desert exists, that World War One was OBJECTIVELY the most important event of the twentieth century, that the Soviets thought anomalous water was real, that the anomalous water debate was fought on the scientific front of the Cold War, or that some people like to ride on a \"bogus bus\" powered by hydrogen.

            "\u00a0Strengths: the level of memery that can come from this class and how great the TA is. Jessica saved my life.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the fact that I had to teach myself EVERYTHING in this class. Lecture was worthless and the biggest waste of my time. He also chili peppers things that are \"red hot important\" and it turns out that the things on exams are usually not the important stuff! In fact I'm not sure we learned half of our second midterm! The average before the curve was LITERALLY AN F. I also really hated how the psets would be posted only a few days before they were due. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The psets take an hour or two tops, and you can drop a midterm or a final, and the first midterm is super easy. I also definitely got good at determining oxidation states/d-electron counts for complexes and coming up with mechanisms, and I feel like I got a lot better at qualitative MO theory. Crabtree is also big on including applications, which are interesting and are kind of a break from learning. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the class is a mix of really basic gen chem and advanced inorganic chemistry, instead of being at an intermediate level. Crabtree uses these pics of chili peppers on slides to indicate what we need to know, but I think he should be more specific on what level we need to know the material. There's also a big learning curve right after the first midterm where you really have to study stuff like pi donors/acceptors that's alluded to but not explicitly explained to understand what's going on. ",
            "\u00a0Instead of spending the first 5 weeks walking through Gen Chem, it would be great just to jump straight into organometallic chemistry. Honestly this course should just be replaced by either coordination chemistry or organometallic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: N-O-N-E. Absolute zero is not supposed to be possible to achieve, but somehow this class attained it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course, though named \"Introductory Inorganic Chemistry,\" was actually a course in \"Useless Scientific Trivia.\" Robert \"Mr. Krabs\"  Crabtree and his slides teach students next to nothing about actual inorganic chemistry. The course was focused on useless trivia, or current theories in research (but not the chemistry and reasoning behind said theories). Mr. Krabs spent three whole classes talking about historical blunders in chemistry, such as how the Soviets mistook water with silica and sweat in it as \"anomalous water\".  That means students can graduate from Yale with a degree in chemistry without ever learning the core principles of inorganic chemistry, which is unacceptable. I am currently pursuing a B.S. in Inorganic Chemistry, and this class has not added anything to my understanding of chemistry besides giving me free time to study topics in chemistry I actually care about. This same issue has been mentioned in previous course reviews, but Crabtree has never incorporated this feedback into his course, and the chemistry department has not pressured him to do so. The only way to improve this course is to stop letting Crabtree teach it. Get a new instructor who actually understands what is important in the field of inorganic chemistry. It does not matter if Crabtree is one of the most famous inorganic professors of all time; he cannot teach. Let him stick to what he is good at - his research - and get a competent instructor to educate the next generation of scientists. This class scares chemistry majors away from pursuing inorganic chemistry research (unless they were already interested in it before taking the class, as I was). Even so, this class almost cost me my passion for inorganic chemistry - let that sink in for a moment. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of material that did not necessarily all fit together. Clearly Prof Crabtree is an expert in all things inorganic chemistry, so hearing him talk about the material made it exciting and relevant.\r\n\r\nA lot of material to focus on for the exams; important to know overarching ideas rather than getting caught up in details. The grading system is definitely a weakness; the average is brought up to a B+ for exams, but then final grade depends on how you rank according to other students, which somewhat undermines the previously collaborative environment towards the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course had the potential to be interesting and useful to the chemistry major, but the way it was presented made it very unengaging. Exams were not focused on main concepts of the course but instead asked about specific, unimportant details mentioned once in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0All the lecture slides are posted on line which is great. However, lectures themselves are kind of all over the place with repeated information often and somewhat irrelevant topics scattered throughout. Approximately 6/16 powerpoints this year were on inorganic basics. The rest were gen chem and other random things. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting, however, the design of this course is really bad. The slides are very confusing and hard to understand what is actually important versus what is just historical information Crabtree wants you to know. Crabtree is a really nice guy, but his lectures aren't very informative. Overall, this course, with a different instructor, could be a really amazing chemistry course that many students enjoy, but, in its current form, it is not. The grading system is also completely broken, and the unnecessarily forced curve really detracts from focusing on the material. The curve should be removed completely. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-structured class. The tests/psets are fair, and the slides are in-depth. ",
            "\u00a0Although the chili Peppers in the slides were helpful, the fact that we were still be tested on things that didnt have chili peppers kind of defeated their purpose... ",
            "\u00a0I think it covered a little too much material outside of the scope of inroganic and that made it difficult going forward. Some lectures weren't very clear but many were ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very hard to follow and uninteresting. Psets are fair and manageable, but what is going to be tested on was always extremely unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Are there any strengths to this course besides our TA/section and the camaraderie of other students who are suffering through the same course? There are so so many weaknesses to this course. We don't actually learn anything  the first midterm material is just a gen chem review, the second midterm is similar to the organometallic catalysis material that is learned in second semester organic chemistry. After that, powerpoints like scientific \"Blunders\" are useless and don't teach any material. In fact, one of the questions on our second midterm wasn't even contained in the slides. Overall, you learn some useless history facts and very little inorganic chemistry. Also, this class is graded on a normal curve, which just pits the students against each other  students should be rewarded for doing well instead of getting an overall grade that doesn't reflect above 95 averages on exams/psets. ",
            "\u00a0Better preparation for the midterms and final would improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has no organization.  Topics are disconnected.  There is no central theme that runs through the course at all.  I legitimately don't understand the definition of \"inorganic chemistry\". "

            "\u00a0Oh hell no. Why would you take this if you're not a chem major? You learn next to nothing. ",
            "\u00a0Assuming they're not a chem major (b/c otherwise it'd be required), I would recommend it, but with the caveat that you should really be interested in chemistry. Duh, but the class is pretty conceptual/theoretical and it's the first time where I feel like scientists are really just making shit up to explain it. It's good enough for an intro class and pretty easy, and it's the only place you're going to learn inorganic, so take it if you really want. ",
            "\u00a0The stories are kind of funny. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend taking this class, but if you are reading this, you probably don't have a choice, and for that, may God have mercy on your bored soul. Do not take this course until it is offered with a professor other than Crabtree. If you take it with Crabtree, prepare to learn useless trivia and hand-wavy scientific ideas WITHOUT justification for those theories. Prepare to think you don't have to know any of this shit until half of the questions on your exam ask you to vomit up useless information mentioned ONCE, in FINE PRINT, on ONE slide. Save your time and tuition money, and wait to take this course until Professor Hazari teaches it, so you can actually be presented with information on inorganic chemistry (like crystal field theory, ligand field theory, PCET, you know, all the topics vital to inorganic chemistry that Crabtree DID NOT COVER). As if Crabtree's inability to recognize important information is not bad enough, he is also a liar. Regarding the second exam, he specifically told us not to memorize any of the dozens of catalysts he described, just to have a question where we had to tell him which metal was in each specific catalyst. No theory, no mechanism... just MEMORIZATION. Memorization is the kind of fake science reserved for BIOL 101. Moreover, Crabtree enjoys playing God with your grades. He grades the course on a scale that weighs you against your peers, giving only 20% of students an A (in a 25-person class like this one, that is 5 students). It doesn't matter if you actually do well on the tests; if everybody else does just as well as you, and all of you score in the 90s, you can still get a B, which is outrageous. So if you do take this class, prepare to become a premed, only caring about your own grade and not caring about who you have to step on, or who is going to step on you, to get to the top. Before the final, Crabtree flaunts the possibility of your grade in front of you, saying \"there is no way to tell what your grade will be.\" Who would have thought that performing spectacularly on multiple tests will not guarantee you an A? Apparently Crabtree does. It may have been the case that, 20 years ago, your grades did not matter, but today, they certainly do. The difference between a B+ and an A- in intro inorganic chemistry can cost you admission into grad school. But does Crabtree care? Nope. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are a Chem major, you have to take it. If not, I thought it was interesting, but there is definitely a lot of material to memorize. An easy 5th or 6th class to add to your schedule! ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking this class, you're likely a chemistry major and don't have a choice. Otherwise, I would not recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Inorganic Chemistry is really interesting; however with Crabtree youll only get a few days here and there of actual inorganic. No other options really, so have fun! ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking at this course, you very likely don't have any choice regarding taking it. The material is very interesting and this certainly is not as hard as Orgo 2 or P Chem 2, but, the class is deceptive. The first exam is one of the easiest tests I've ever taken at Yale (like really, it's so easy). The second midterm, which is like 2.5 months later, is incredibly hard and full of random information you would have to memorize. The final was also very difficult. Unfortunately, this class is completely on a very strict curve, which means your performance on 2 out the 3 tests determines your entire grade. Because of that, it can be really stressful. Also, Crabtree's lectures are not even worth going to. Going to class will not help you in any way whatsoever. The slides are very messy, so you'll have to spend a lot of time just trying to figure out what is even important for the test. The homework starts of easy but quickly picks up in difficulty. Overall, this course has the potential to be one of the best chemistry courses at Yale with a different instructor, but, with Crabtree, there's no way that can happen. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's also required for chem majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Its an interesting topic for a chemistry major, and if you are interested in metallic chemistry, you will like this course. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good course, I'd recommend it ",
            "\u00a0It is a requirement of the chem major, but otherwise not worth your time. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you're a chemistry major and have to take it (see Strengths/Weaknesses). ",
            "\u00a0I assume if you are taking this course it is a major requirement, so I won't go into details about the good and the bad. I will give you fair warning, however: do not be tricked by the difficulty one test in preparing for future tests!! The first midterm class median was ~95%, and the second midterm class median was ~55%. I assume the final was somewhere in between. Bear this in mind when studying for the exams because you will never really know how hard they are going to be. ",
            "\u00a0No, this class is genuinely horrible.  Every lecture is worthless.  Every problem set and every test had questions that were so irrelevant they had no business being asked. "
