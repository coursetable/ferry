            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course! Mainly, I learned about how authors can create vivid worlds and characters in a short story, and how this is effectively done. We also talked a lot just about the actual process of reading a short story which was very interesting. ",

We read so many great pieces covering a wide range of experiences that, though fictional, allowed us to have very meaningful and eye-opening discussions that I will carry with me throughout my own life. ",
            "\u00a0We read numerous short stories in several different forms, and we learned how to view them analytically through the eyes of consumers, students, and critiques. We learned how to write about fiction, and how to communicate opinions about fiction to a broad audience. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to read stories for enjoyment as well as analyze how society is impacted by stories and vice versa. Taking that class made me realize certain analogies to real life that I had not seen before and I was able to read about different experiences from so many different perspectives - veterans, refugees, immigrants, people with mental illnesses, and so much more. This class was fulfilling in more ways than one. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze both the microscopic and macroscopic traits of short fiction, how to appreciate how the medium is often more effective and more striking than others, and how to place myself into cultural contexts that are very different to my own, in order to understand the motivations behind a writer's stylistic and narrative choices.

            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Think of the most perfect class you have ever taken, then triple it, and you get this course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's super low-workload, and Prof Gordon is so amazing at directing class discussion and drawing out insights. The stories we read are also all incredible, and I liked the course's focus on fiction from the past 30 years. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes we spent a ton of time focusing on one story out of the several we were assigned to read for each class, so we couldn't cover the others in a lot of detail. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful! Professor Gordon is so intelligent and can make you attuned to so much in writing that you wouldn't see otherwise. I liked that it was very participatory and the discussions were really insightful. The workload is super manageable and the most enjoyable kind of assignments- reading fiction and writing about fiction. It was also nice to have students lead discussions and Professor Gordon is really accommodating. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I loved discussion format of this class, by far its biggest strength. Prof guided discussion well and allowed for good balance of class participation and direction. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that our class dynamic was integral to our success this semester. Everyone was engaged, arguably because the material was so interesting!! ",
            "\u00a0strengths of the course: dove deep into the texts; analyzed and perused a wide range of modern literature, works that were actually relevant to us as students, not just dry classics but stories full of emotion and purpose; Professor Gordon really allows for student-led and student-driven discussion; it feels like a warm, encouraging environment where feedback/commentary is always welcomed + heard ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. I could not have had a better experience in this class ",
            "\u00a0This class is really great in developing class bonds and a sense of community. Sometimes I wish there was more structure in terms of the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The stories on the syllabus were phenomenal. There was a very wide range of authors and subjects which made engaging with the material really fun. The writing assignments were difficult and stimulating because they required more thought and care than regular analytical essays. This class was awesome! ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of a negative after taking this class. The readings were enjoyable and Professor Gordon is lovely and did a great job navigating the difficult topics we often discussed in class. I think it was also a great touch that groups of students led discussions every other class because it allowed the rest of us to see what was really important and stood out to them. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely engaging and I found myself looking forward to every class. I loved the texts that the professor chose because they covered a broad range of themes and gave voice to a diverse group of authors. He guided each conversation with thought-provoking questions, but students had control over the direction of the discussions. I learned a great deal from the professor but also from my classmates. I don't think there were any weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting reading material means homework is more like a study break than a burden, Prof Gordon is the most amazing and caring professor in the world, very manageable workload (especially for a writing credit), a sense of class community is really cultivated so you get to know other first years\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: literally none I loved this class so much ",
            "\u00a0I believe we could have written more, given that it was a writing credit, but I also feel our writing assignments were very well organized and in-depth. The books we read for class were absolutely fantastic. I enjoyed each and every one of them. However, I believe we could have spent lest time of What We Talk About When We Talk About Love, Raymond Carver, and related short stories and spent more time reading other collections. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - reading stories from so many different perspectives, including veterans, refugees, immigrants, people with mental illnesses, and people from different ethnicities and sexual orientations. And of course, the amazing Professor Gordon.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - None, really. Though sometimes, grading was a bit unclear, as I wasn't sure why I got points off sometimes. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a life changer. Because the books are not old white men, there is simply so much room for real discussion about issues of immigration and race. Must-take! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It's a WR credit that's not very difficult and gives you some assignments that aren't typical analytic/academic essays, e.g. two of our assignments were writing a review of one of the collections we read and creating an anthology out of the stories we read and writing an introduction to it. It also focuses a lot on marginalized/underrepresented groups, like LGBT people, Black people, immigrants, and women, which I liked a lot. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! Professor Gordon is an amazing professor who cares so much about his students and their learning. It is a super fun class where you basically discuss really interesting fiction of today, and you will learn so much about authors and what makes good, engaging writing. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student! Professor Gordon is really kind and flexible, and makes the seminar truly enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great learning environment (largely due to it being a first year seminar) taught by an enthusiastic professor who leads great discussions ",
            "\u00a0This course is really amazing and I enjoyed coming to class everyday. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was the first course I've taken at Yale where every assignment was challenging, but enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I am so glad I took this class. It was amazing to read short fiction written from the perspectives of so many different people in (and outside) of the US. As a minority myself, it is truly important to see representation in literature and even more so to have it offered in a class. The reading list was incredible, but even greater was the wide range of voices and opinions from my peers in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any type of student. Whether you are an avid reader of short fiction or have never laid eyes on a fiction piece before, you will walk out of this course with a much better understanding and appreciation of the genre. It is a fun and engaging class, with low stress but high return, and his feedback will help you become a better speaker and writer. ",
            "\u00a0YES! A THOUSAND TIMES YES! I'm going to miss this class so much. The subject attracts a very diverse group of students from all walks of life and it's a perfect complement to any schedule for any major! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This is a great fantastic first-year seminar that will introduce you to seminar learning at the university level. It teaches you how to write better, how to read better, and how to contribute to class discussions better. Also, if you are an enthusiastic reader, this class will be perfect for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The workload was not very heavy, Professor Gordon is engaging, understanding, and overall an amazing professor. Any student lucky enough to get into this thought-provoking class should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course helped me grow tremendously as a reader and definitely inspired me to read more in the future! ",
            "\u00a0If you are a first-year who is fortunate enough to gain a spot in this course, you would be doing yourself an immense disservice by failing to take it. It was the most incredible class of any kind I've ever taken. "
