            "\u00a0Where do I start....\r\n\r\nThe strength of this class is that it has a good TA who tries his best to help the poor little kids who are completely lost with the lectures. The weakness is I guess everything else. The professor is quite terrible at explaining. The lecture notes are filled with complicated notations. If you look up the lecture notes from some other institutes, they are much easier to understand. \r\n\r\nWe also had very few problem sets. 3 psets in the whole semester. So by the time of the midterm you realize you don't actually understand anything but you don't have any materials to practice on. So you basically turn to the Internet and stalk every other institute's website to find materials to study off. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a very interesting way to learn economics for the first time. It's taught similar to a math class, with definitions and theorems, but the examples are cool real-world phenomena. It could do with more problem sets to review the material. ",

More problem sets would be good (i.e. more than 2 before the midterm and 1 afterward); alternatively, a textbook (e.g. directions at each lecture / on the syllabus to texts that have approximately the same material). While Prof. Faingold's slides were thorough they were often (and occasionally unnecessarily) notationally dense, and so the problems created by a lack of ability to practice were compounded by the absence of a thorough exposition we could consult while studying.

            "\u00a0This is a course that requires a textbook, or at least extensive written notes, to be taught properly. There was no such written material as it was taught this semester, which made learning the material extremely difficult, especially given the consistently low quality of the lectures, and the lack of problem sets after shopping period. The syllabus said there would be weekly problem sets. Instead there were two during shopping period, and then only one for the remaining three months of the course. Everyone I know who took this class relied on online resources to teach themselves the material, and I am fairly confident that nobody came away with anything approaching mastery of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0very inconsistently run course with variable deadlines and not enough communication between professor and students. ",
            "\u00a0By far the biggest weakness of the course was that it did not teach the background necessary to understand various proofs/definitions almost at all. More than in any other class I've taken at Yale, at the end of every lecture I had way too many questions and felt that there was a lot left unexplained. I think spending more time intuitively explaining each step in a given proof would greatly improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0this was one of the worst classes i've taken at this school. the quality of teaching in the math and econ/math departments is unacceptably bad. Professor Faingold was checked out for most of the semester. the PDF slides that he uploaded online were very clear, but his in-class boardwork and explanations were very hard to understand. a class like this requires some kind of textbook or consistent material to follow and come back to. unfortunately, Professor Faingold would go weeks without uploading lecture slides, leaving me in the dark when i'm unable to understand subsequent lectures that build upon the material in those slides. things got worse when, halfway through the semester, Professor Faingold decided to stop using lecture slides, leaving us nothing to review but incomprehensible boardwork that i could not understand during class and definitely couldn't understand when trying to review it a week or two later. we only had three problem sets, despite Faingold repeatedly expressing the intention to give us more. one cannot learn complex, nuanced mathematical concepts without applying them for oneself, leaving us to fend for ourselves on the midterm and final exam, which included material that we were never or hardly given the opportunity to practice on our own. altogether an awful class that didn't inspire in me any desire to want to know any more about game theory ",
            "\u00a0The course is meant to be the capstone of the Econ & Math major, and sounds very interesting but was very poorly managed.\r\n\r\nThe professor was extremely disorganized and wrote on the syllabus he intended assign homework every week, but due to his own complications, we were only assigned a total of 2 problem sets (both in the first week of classes) prior to the midterm. He also was absent for many days of class, either due to his own meetings or for other reasons, and was not able to find a substitute for all of his missed lectures. As for the midterm, he also said he would provide practice problems of some sort, and we received none as well as not having any sort of review session. The midterm was ultimately a take-home assessment of 4 problems, one of which was not in the realm of the course and was unfamiliar material to the entire class. It was never touched on at all during lecture and upon talking to the TA, he revealed almost everyone only earned 5 out of 25 points on the question. "

            "\u00a0never take this class. after 4 months of class i have no idea how well i do in the class since there have been only three problem sets. teaching was very ineffective. don't take any class with Eduardo. he claims to care about students but often doesn't respond to e-mails and is very unstructured in his teaching style. he never posted midterm practice problems despite his numerous promises. he never followed the book or gave us a hint where to find additional resources for the material we're covering. he was often absent, either cancelling the class or having someone else teach for him. the three (!) make-up lectures were scheduled in a way such that not all students could attend. despite his promises, lecture notes from these make-up classes were never posted. he's frequently late to class, too. he started off well with frequent problem sets and clear lectures but this class got just unbearable by the end of the semester. just don't take it with Eduardo. ",
            "\u00a0If you love pain, sure, why not? If you are an Econ Math major, you really have no choice. You will be spending most of your time in this class wondering why the heck you chose Econ and Math instead of double majoring, whining to your friends about how you feel so hopeless, and crying inside out of desperation. Do not misunderstand: this class is very chill. You only have 3 problem sets after all, if Faingold is teaching. He also likes to take the class too seriously and play actually mind games with you where he promises he'll post psets and practice problems but never will, and you will be left hanging and constantly on edge, wondering \"Is he going to post it today?\" every single day. So basically you'll have to calculate a Bayesian nash equilibrium each week to see what strategy you should play that week under incomplete information (only Faingold knows whether he's gonna really post it or not): should you reserve time to do the pset or should you spend your time on something else. By the end of the semester, your belief at the information set is always that you assign probability 1 to NO PSET.\r\n\r\nBut the learned helplessness will make you feel miserable as exams near. You want to run to your TA to get help but you don't even know what you don't know anymore and if you sit down with him you'll make him go over the class materials since Day 1, so you just resign yourself to the fact that you're gonna flop and hope everyone flops along with you (but you know there'll always be that one person). You'll read mechanism design notes and fervently pray to any deities out there that it will not show up on the exam because you have no clue what it is talking about and your friends also have no idea either. Get ready to spend a lot of time self studying because the professor is terrible at explaining. Whenever you ask him to clarify what he meant, he would happily agree too but actually does not clarify anything further, and you feel stupid for asking the question twice so you refrain from so doing, hoping that you'd somehow understand it as you go back to the notes the next day but the notes are never posted, so you forget about it, and then panic when you review the class for exams. \r\n\r\nThat said you'll gain lots of friends through comradeship. You'll suffer together and cry together. Get ready to spend 14 hours of bonding with you friends on the second pset, only not to finish the whole pset and give up because it's 3AM and you have an early morning class the next day. You will actually learn some pretty cool stuff. Game theory is interesting and extremely applicable. But this class will give you PTSD. The mere word \"game\" can trigger you, especially after the final. \r\n\r\nSo devise your optimal strategy and may God have mercy on your soul. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend, especially if, like me, you are looking for an SO that feels like a QR, or maybe an additional CS elective (yes really). The material is cool, with definitions and theorems making a rigorous study out of interactive games. It's also pretty good as a first econ class, if you can keep up with the math, since it shows how econ can actually be a formal discipline. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you must ",
            "\u00a0The material is great; unfortunately, the organization of the course remains the same as last year. Two psets before the (fair) takehome midterm, one after, one in-class final. The material is incredibly difficult to learn without either (a) psets or (b) a textbook. (Prof. Faingold does post lecture notes; however, they're terse and notationally dense. This would be probably be fine if we also had psets; conversely, the lack of psets would be ok if we had a textbook, perhaps with worked examples...) It's a shame that such an elegant and important subject (supposedly the capstone in the econ/math major?), taught by someone who obviously knows it front and back, largely fails to be conveyed by the course. ",
            "\u00a0Take it with Horner - his notes are what kept me afloat most of the semester. Faingold doesn't care too much about teaching the class. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're Econ Math not really. Needlessly frustrating. For example: we had a take home midterm and the mean was a 71. A 71! When everyone has all the resources the course has provided and the use of the internet and the mean is still a 71 I think something is seriously wrong. ",
            "\u00a0No. Please replace the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0If you're thinking about going to graduate school in Economics, I think this is an excellent course to test yourself, and to also see if you like the material. A lot of brilliant math students also take this as a social science credit, which is less recommended. Don't worry too much about the grade, and be ready for the challenges: unclear assessments, and very few of them. ",
            "\u00a0No, this is a very poorly taught class. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to anyone in its current form. This sort of class requires either a good instructor, which Yale did not provide, or good written materials, which the instructor did not provide. The lectures were very difficult to follow. Most material was first presented in full generality and abstraction with little motivation or explanation. It is possible to learn like this, but unnecessarily difficult. Had there been a textbook this would not have been such a big deal, but there was not, nor were there any other substantial written materials.\r\n\r\nThis class was also a disaster from an administrative perspective. The syllabus promised weekly problem sets; instead there were two during shopping period and then only one more for the remainder of the semester. This left one with little to no opportunity to practice the material.  The exams were also conducted in the most unreasonable fashion I have seem in a Yale course. We had about 24 hours during the week to complete a take-home midterm, which meant that ones grade largely depended on ones schedule during that period. The final was originally going to be conducted similarly, but complaints about the format led to it being changed to a sit-down exam at the last minute.\r\n\r\nI think that most if not all of the problems with this course were due to the instructor. The material is quite interesting, and had it been taught in a more competent way I imagine it would have been a pretty good class. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you have to take it ",
            "\u00a0I 100% would not recommend this course to another student, this is the course I most regret taking in my time at Yale. I had taken an introduction to game theory course prior to this one and I absolutely loved that one and found the material very intuitive. This course was the complete opposite and basically made game theory a lot less engaging and interesting. This course was horribly disorganized (we were supposed to have weakly problem sets and had a grand total of 3 in the entire semester, midterm/final scheduling issues, etc.) and almost nothing felt fully explained. It's also extremely difficult to teach yourself the material and overall this course contributed a lot of stress to my semester. The professor and the TA were very friendly and helpful once you got to meet with them one on one but even organizing that was difficult. I was very interested in game theory going into this course but I still could not find this course enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0no, not with Professor Faingold. this is a poorly taught class that didn't have enough homework or material to truly understand the concepts. Professor Faingold would promise to upload slides or to give us a homework assignment, and then a month would pass without either of those things happening ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely not recommend this course, as it is not a game theory course so much as it is proving relatively simple phenomena in an extremely roundabout way. The only students that should take this course are the prospective Econ&Math majors, but be warned it is extremely variant with grading and it is completely unstructured. "
