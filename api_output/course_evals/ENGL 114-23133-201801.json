            "\u00a0I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into this course as a first-year never having taken a writing-intensive course at Yale, I feel like I have definitely improved my writing skills and I feel more secure about writing papers for other classes in the future. Class discussions with Professor Park were also always extremely interesting, and I've never had to think about empathy through so many lens before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to craft a written claim, lay out my argument, and engage with literary material on a deeper level. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about formulating a strong argument and outlining it with a logical flow. English 114 really helps hone your skills far beyond the high school level and teaches you to create nuanced arguments. In this particular section, I learned so much more about empathy, everywhere from its historical origins to neuroscientific mechanisms. We read a bunch of fascinating texts including Anne Fadimans A Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down, Toni Morrisons Recitatif, and many others. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to improve my writing, how to come up with strong arguable claims, and how to structure my essays. ",

            "\u00a0Gained more confidence in writing. Definitely learned how to structure an essay and how to write a convincing thesis. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly revise and edit my writing. I also learned about empathy and how it has influence in culture, medicine, and society at large. I was able to understand some of the limits of empathy and some of the implications of these limits. "

            "\u00a0Prof Justin Park is a fantastic professor and this course was amazing with him. If you can get into the class, TAKE IT! Youll think about empathy in a new light after the class, and youll also learn so much about writing. As a whole, English 114 does have a rigid schedule and sometimes the turnaround time for papers is tight. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that it is a very interesting topic with good readings, and great discussions. It also helps improve your writing. One weakness is that at times it felt that the readings were a bit two much (we had to read the two books for this class right after each other, and it was a time that was already really busy for me, so I didn't get to enjoy them as much as I could've.) ",
            "\u00a0Longer time on books ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong in going over the tips/suggestions for good writing, but more time could be spent in peer review. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Strengths: exposing students to new viewpoints through literature ",
            "\u00a0Would have liked for more close reading vs broad overview/thoughts about reading. Class discussions were still exciting though. Professor was very willing to help. ",

It teaches you to think about writing in a new way and we had a lot of great discussions in relation to empathy, the role of emotions in our lives, the different groups found in our society, and how that all relates to each other. I thought that most of the readings were very interesting and relevant and liked how professor Park ran the discussions in class. ",

            "\u00a0YES. It was incredibly eye opening, one of my favorite classes at Yale. Writing courses can often feel tedious, however, this was actually a lot of fun. Also, prof Park is SO engaging, teaches writing in a unique way. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. One can learn a lot about empathy and have his or her views changed on different things. It is a great course with a great teacher. "
