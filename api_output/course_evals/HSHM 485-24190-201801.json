            "\u00a0This class was incredible for teaching students how to work with limited sources to create comprehensive stories of an event. Specifically, by focusing on non-traditional western sources, I was forced to be more critical of what we consider to merit authority. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned about so many other global health movements and programs that I had never encountered before in my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a much needed foray into health into health beyond the west. It covers a wide array of topics from psychoanalysis, to indigenous medicine to colonialism and biomedicine. ",
            "\u00a0I read some really interesting pieces about healthcare in other countries. I feel like I developed a more global understanding of health and how its perceived and interpreted. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely helpful in reducing historical biases when studying global health. Really felt like I gained a well-rounded perspective on the lived experiences and realities of health and medicine in the Global South. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course. I definitely learned novel ways about thinking about health access and provision in developing countries. The class also challenged me to think outside of the United States standards of health medicine and consider other ways to achieve well-being in regions of the Global south. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided an overview of how the history of health and medicine manifest in nations across the globe, namely those in the more \"forgotten\" Global South. ",
            "\u00a0This course built upon some common themes in HSHM but with a Global South framework. I enjoyed how each week was structured almost like case studies to understand health and medicine from a Global South perspective. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include a focus on voices and material that would not be present in any other class. The western world has so much academic material and prestige which makes it so much easier to study. On the other hand, the global south is generally denied authority and this class does a fantastic job of focusing attention on important advances made there and the methods used. This class excels at demonstrating why a diversity of approaches to medical issues is necessary. \r\nThe course's one weakness was it was very broad. And while that is mostly a positive, it's breadth often made class discussions difficult because the material available covered too wide a range of topics/regions for one class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing! ",
            "\u00a0I wish Jose had guided our discussions more. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very strong, the readings were very engaging and so were class discussions. No weaknesses to report. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class is great! The readings were all very interesting for the most part. Prof. Ragas did a good job of incorporating contemporary articles. The class was a bit unorganized in terms of assignments. I think during the first class, I would have liked for the teacher to clearly discuss the expected assignments and their exact due dates, specifically the reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really great class! I really valued the opportunity to study the history of health and medicine from a non-western perspective since this is mostly the lens through which I have viewed these histories during my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the overall topics we covered and feel like each week revealed a major theme from studies of health and medicine in the Global South. Reading the book on Zika was one of the highlights of the course. However, I think that sometimes the seminars focused too much on a summary of the readings and not enough on the analysis of these themes. In the future, maybe topics that we wrote about/discussed in our short essays (like questions we had or things we realized) cold be included in the weekly discussions. I also think that the process for the final paper started way too early. Early on we were expected to have our topics/bibliographies for our final paper (even though we had not delved deeply into the subject material for the course yet). If the final paper process had started around midterm time, I probably would have picked a different topic/something more related to what we were discussing in the class. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to students interested in learning about health interventions in the non-western world. This course has opened up my eyes to the importance of not assuming that a western method of disease control, health systems, etc. is the best method. It is undeniable that the western world tends to have the best medical interventions, however they cannot be assumed to have the same function elsewhere and instead there must be tailored responses. Additionally, this course was important for its focus on politics and how medicine can be used to alter the global powers. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course because it tied together different global themes and shifted the focus of health innovation to the Global South which is quite revolutionary. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class, with lots of very interesting readings and a great professor. The seminar discussions this semester were very lackluster though; it frequently felt like everyone was just rephrasing summaries of the readings or going around saying unconnected things. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0YES, it is not only very interesting, but allows you to develop our own ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student! The opportunity to look at health and medicine from a non-western perspective is incredibly valuable, and is something I feel has been missing from my experience in HSHM. We talked about relevant issues in health in medicine in history, but also got to see what those issues meant for modern health and medicine. Any student interested in how these processes work, would enjoy this class, or some similar variety of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. A lot of classes in HSHM are either based in the US or in the West. It was refreshing to gain more perspectives on the differences and interconnectedness of health/medicine in this context. "
