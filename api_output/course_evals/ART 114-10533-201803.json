            "\u00a0I not only improved by drawing skills, but I also gained familiarity with media I had never experimented with before. Professor Keegan encouraged us to explore media besides charcoal or graphite, and I think that helped me really grow as an artist. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about drawing, craft, meaning and art in a new way. I love the prof's broad definition of drawing. He's rad and kind. V encouraging. Had a crush not gonna lie. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach a drawing. I learned about improving/adding to my constructive process as I moved from project to project. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to manipulate various mediums of art, make insightful creations/commentary, and art history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to draw with purpose and a variety of materials. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I was able to challenge myself to represent nature and other subjects of my artwork in creative ways (with respect to both style and materials). ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about figure drawing, making collage works, and how to think about developing my individual art projects. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of this course is that Professor Keegan left many of the projects very open-ended, which allowed for personal expression and experimentation. Anther strength was the work load: it wasn't too much or too little, and I felt like I was engaging and improving throughout the entire class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthz: Kim and Matt were great. Lots of class time to work on projects. Professors super approachable and smart. Really stimulating field trips.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It can be expensive to get materials, but this can also be a strength as it encourages resourcefulness. ",
            "\u00a0The use of class critiques was very helpful in my development as an artist. The projects themselves had few guidelines which allowed for individual creativity and varied project outputs. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overall great in that it allowed students to explore art very freely at their own pace. However, I think the course would be more helpful if it provided foundational instruction on different art techniques (given that a majority of the students had no prior art background). ",
            "\u00a0The freedom of our assignments was a strength.  This course could have been improved if we had more artist lectures. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I recommend this course--especially with Professor Keegan--if you have never taken any formal drawing class before. I also recommend this for people like me who are relatively advanced in visual art but still want to improve. Professor Keegan made the class approachable, fun, engaging, and pretty stress-free. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yaaaaaas especially with Prof Keegan, I like his ~pedagogy~ ",
            "\u00a0It is a great course to take regardless of major. As a STEM major, it allowed me to take a step back from my other courses, slow down time, and examine my surroundings, formulate ideas, and with that information create an art piece. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor Keegan was excellent at providing feedback to students of all levels, and the exploratory nature of the classes lets students experiment with several different art styles. An excellent class if youre looking to polish skills and/or learn something new. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. This class offered insightful discussions and developed my skills as an artist. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to students because it would help them develop skills that cannot be found in other courses. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a nice introduction to an artistic way of thinking. "
