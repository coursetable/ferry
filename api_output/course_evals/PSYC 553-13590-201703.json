",
            "\u00a0The structure made a lot of sense for the goals of the course. Each week, three papers were assigned and one person led the discussion of each of them. The papers were highly relevant, new, and interesting. The only thing I would've wished, which was partially my own fault, was that I'd had more mentoring in the research proposal development process for our final paper. "
