Through our psets, I also became more comfortable with using Python in general as well as relevant ScikitLearn stats packages. ",

            "\u00a0The instructor and TA are very helpful. Course materials useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches very important information, but should really have a python and statistics prerequisite. Almost no one in the class had ever taken a stats class, and we were all completely lost throughout the semester. Additionally, class lectures were unrelated to PSET's. The in-class labs and PSET's focused on implementation of statistical techniques, and actually ended up teaching me a decent amount about how to use statistics for astronomy. Lectures, however, were more theoretical in nature, mostly going over equations and derivations of statistical methods. The lectures were boring, convoluted, and didn't help at all with the PSET's, because knowing all the intricate details/derivations of the equations wasn't necessary to be able to understand when and how to use each method. I think the lectures should be focused on implementation of techniques instead of theory, because, after all, this class is called astrostatistics, and astronomy doesn't require statistical theory, only implementation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material. Astrostatistics is a fascinating topic with a lot of applications both to astronomy research and beyond. I was excited about the subject matter and truly wanted to learn the theory behind it. Another strength is the people who take this class. Don't take it without a crew. Seriously! ",
            "\u00a0The material felt really disorganized, lectures aren't super engaging, and problem sets are reallyyyyyy difficult and time consuming. You do a lot of self-teaching of python and stats but come out definitely having a better grasp of both. ",
            "\u00a0Please teach us material for problem sets in class. There is such a disconnect from class content to problem set material. Also our TF was so unhelpful - and please get a teacher who knows the material better ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course covers some really interesting topics, and I think the curriculum does a good job of hitting everything that I would expect a astro-statistics class to hit. We covered probability theory, regression, clustering, classification, principle component analysis, and how to implement each of these in Python using astronomical datasets. The lab component of the course every Thursday is a good idea to help us implement the topics we'd been discussing for the past week. I had a really good time with the people in this course, I learned a lot from them and we had lots of fun in the Astro lounge working on psets. Once again, Yale delivers on its promise to foster a sense of community within its academic environment. Additionally, the instructor did ask for anonymous feedback about halfway through the course which was nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is poorly taught. Lecture was often not very intelligible, and the homework assignments were just confusing (not because the material was particularly advanced, but because the instructions were hard to understand and the goals were quite unclear). At one point, a homework assignment asked us to reference a particular paper to learn how to preform a particular analysis, and the paper turned out to be wrong. This was not brought to our attention until the day the assignment was due. The lack of designated office hours was somewhat discouraging. To their credit, the professor and TF made themselves available via appointment or by email, but it would still be nice to have a time when we could just go in and ask a quick question. There is a divide between the theoretical foundations of the course (handled by the professor) and the coding implementations of those topics (handled by the TF) which made assignments and class often confusing. The course is structured in a way such that the material on each homework assignment is not covered in class until AFTER that assignment is due. While I understand that this practice is perhaps acceptable in graduate level seminars, it would have been nice to know that this was the case before I signed up (also, it seems like a 300 level course with very few prerequisites is maybe not the best place to do this). At one point, the professor told us \"And this is what you should have learned in doing the homework last week\" (referencing a derivation we had not yet covered in class, or come close to talking about yet), which rather makes me question what the purpose of attending lecture is (is it to review, or to learn). Also, that request for feedback didn't end up being very helpful; it felt a little bit like we were being belittled for the feedback we gave, and the response was in general \"This is the way the course is\" vs \"We could implement these changes to make it better\". While I completely understand that it is a professor's right to run the course in a way they think is conducive to learning, I would have to disagree with their assessment of what that is, in this particular case. ",
            "\u00a0The class's prerequisites do not cover the necessary stats to understand ANY of this course. If you're like I was, and take this as recommended by previous astro professors without previously knowing what - for example - a Student T distribution is, you will be completely lost.\r\n\r\nThe strengths are that it made me learn to use python much more efficiently and organize my work and code well.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness is the rigidity of the course. For most of the term, our professor and TA knew we were too far behind to really grasp a lot of the concepts but did not slow down or review earlier material. This meant that we couldn't really understand each lesson, as we were trying to grasp the last one. Strangely, we would often have a problem in a PSET on a foreign topic, then learn it the NEXT week in class. ",
            "\u00a0Every Thursday class we would do a programming lab, which gave me the chance to practice implementing the concepts we learned into code. Also, Python is the language used in this class, and learning and growing comfortable with Python is great for any field you may want to go into. One weakness is that the lectures can be very confusing and unapproachable unless you've seen the material beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0This course assumes a lot more knowledge than I came in with. Linear Algebra and at least one introductory statistics course should be prerequisites. Material covered in class often doesn't match up with assignments, or assignments would ask us to solve problems that we would cover a week later in class. Assignments were also often extremely long and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Your grade is very homework heavy and both the homework assignments and labs are useful. The homework provided real-world applications of astronomy and statistics and allowed students to conduct the tests for themselves and see what they meant. This was invaluable because we used many common statistical methods used in numerous astronomy research projects. The labs were also very useful because they introduced us to the concepts we would be using in the problem set before we got it.\r\n\r\nWeakness- Lecture, time-consuming problem sets, little time to think about final projects. Lectures were not too helpful because statistics itself is pretty abstract and hard to teach on a chalkboard. I didn't really understand the statistical methods we discussed in class until we got to the labs/problem sets. The problem sets were extremely time-consuming, difficult, and the grading was occasionally a bit too harsh. The final project was given at a reasonable time, but it would have been better if it was given a bit earlier so we had more time given the common April crunch in most undergrad classes.\r\n\r\nTo improve lectures, I would spend less time talking about statistical theory and more time applying it. Therefore, lectures would be on one day and the following meeting would be for lab/discussion. During the lab session, we go through the methods we talked about in lecture and apply them, and discuss what the code is doing and why it works.  If time is left over, we then go through whatever conceptual/coding problems students are having with the problem set. I believe that would make the problem sets less impossible, and lectures more efficient. If we had more time to think about the final project, I believe our project ideas would have been more diverse/ developed. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Interesting and useful class, great course staff. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this class unless you have smart friends to take it with my peers were the only reason I got through this semester. Professor Arce is really nice, but his research doesn't really use the topics of this class, so he just isn't qualified to teach it. Lectures were super confusing and didn't relate to the PSET's at all. I stopped paying attention mostly because I was confused and found that it didn't hurt my grades at all. There are about 5 PSETs and a final project. Each PSET took probably 30 hours to complete, partly because we didn't learn python implementation in class and were basically on our own for the PSETs. There was also a disconnect between what Professor Arce and our TA thought our python (and statistics) skills were, and the level most of the class was actually at. The PSET's were confusingly worded and incredibly frustrating. The final project was sprung on us only about 2 weeks before the end of the semester and we were casually told that it wasn't just statistical testing, but a full-fledged research paper with a presentation. We got almost no guidance (we had to nag for a week just to get a list of requirements and a sample project posted) and we never received a rubric. Overall the class is disorganized and incredibly frustrating, but it does teach important skills for research in astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Again, I think the material was interesting, but the lectures were lacking. I found it difficult to understand what was happening in lectures and found that I was largely self-teaching for the problem sets. Until there is more structure and until there is a professor who specializes in statistics, I can't necessarily recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly it's not worth the time and stress. Just take a stats class and use online resources for the python bits. ",
            "\u00a0If you like machine learning/ data science I would take it but be prepared to have to learn a lot on your own. Also be prepared to spend around 20-30 hours on problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I probably wouldn't recommend the course. I came into it with almost no Astronomy background, but with a solid background in Mathematics/Statistics and in Computer Science/Programming, so I felt a little lost in terms of the interpretation of the results, but felt fine doing the math and programming necessary to complete the assignments. This course will take up a bit of time, not because the material is justifiably difficult or because the pace is fast, but rather because 1) lecture is not all that helpful, 2) the instructions are unclear, 3) there is little opportunity to get helpful feedback. At one point, the entire class straight up failed a pset because the resources we were told to use were just wrong, and although the TF and professor acknowledged this, they simply told us  \"That's too bad\". If you choose to take this course, I must recommend that you take another statistics course concurrently so that you actually learn the material (I took S&DS 230, which was fantastic and covered about the same stuff, at least for the first 2/3s of the course), since you won't be learning much here. Additionally, make sure that you talk with other people in the class from the start. Collaboration is helpful, and you'll need it if you want to do not-terribly in this course. Look over the homework immediately (even if you don't start them) and email the prof if anything looks strange, since it may be an error (this happened several times). Don't expect a lot of help from the professor or from the TF. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I did have a really good time with the people in this course; it satisfied a major requirement, and the homework assignments were at least not assigned every week. \r\n\r\nBottom line: If all you care about is learning the skills the class teaches, go to YouTube and find some videos, and pick up a copy of the AstroML book and learn it on your own time, don't bother with this class. If you need a physics credit and feel confident in your ability to understand statistics, write code, draw on background knowledge of astronomy, and parse unintelligible homework assignments, go right ahead and take this course. You'll probably even have a good time and make some good friends. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless they had a very strong understanding of basic stats and python ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants a crash course in all the main statistics that a scientist needs to know to do basic research. ",
            "\u00a0I would wait until this course got a little more organized to recommend it to another student. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if you can put the time in for it. In general, coding takes a while. While the TA can help you with bugs, figuring out how to put it all together/implement it and install packages is more time-consuming than you think.  If you are planning to take other time-intensive courses in the same semester, it would be better for you to put this course off for a bit. Other than that, this course is useful to have because statistics are widely used in many areas of astronomy and physics and is an important component in research. I already foresee myself using my/the problem set solution iPython notebooks for reference on how to implement statistical work in the future. Grading can be tedious at times for little things like not coding neatly, copy-pasting code etc, so make sure you review your problem set before you submit it. The professor and TA are very approachable, so if you have any issues don't be afraid to ask for help/clarification. "
