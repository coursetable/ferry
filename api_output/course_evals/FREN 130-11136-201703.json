            "\u00a0We reviewed grammatical concepts from L1 and L2, solidifying previous understanding and enriching our vocabularies in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking, reading, writing, and comprehension skills ",
            "\u00a0FREN 130 was like a review of the previous two courses, but in more depth and applied to works of literature/ film. I am able to read and write in French much more naturally than before, and my listening skills have improved significantly as well (thanks to Jules et Jim). Also, I am much more aware of grammatical nuances that I did not know before this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me much greater confidence in my command of French grammar, and I feel much better prepared to read French literature because of all the novels we read. While I can't understand every single word, I can nonetheless glean a much better general understanding of a French text than I could have at this time last year. I believe I'm also able to notice many more subtle aspects of spoken French. ",
            "\u00a0My fluency in speaking the language increased exponentially during this course, and I solidified several points of grammar and learned to express my thoughts better in French. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The books for this course were all very interesting and culturally significant/insightful. The films balanced things out nicely. All 4 language skills were paid equal attention. ",
            "\u00a0The excellent professors who teach this course course draw from noteworthy books and movies to stimulate conversation. The workload is also pretty light, all things considered. In terms of weaknesses: some of the work involves boring rote repetition, but I don't see how a language class could avoid that entirely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: all the books, movies were a little boring \r\nweakness; the difficult tests ",
            "\u00a0Very organized, paid a lot of attention to comprehension skills and grammar. Perhaps more speaking opportunities would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is very, very good! I enjoyed reading the books assigned and watching the films. There was a lot of work, but nonetheless, the curriculum is obviously the result of decades of French teaching at Yale and it works very well.\r\n\r\nMme. Koizim was absolutely amazing. She was always clear and very dedicated.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that going to class at 8:20am every day got exhausting after a while. ",
            "\u00a0Would love to see more class discussion (under the supervision of the teacher). I think this would help with pronunciation, which was tricky at times. ",
            "\u00a0As much as I sometimes hated them, the audio programs are this course's greatest strength. They're quick and easy ways to review the concepts from that day's class, and they can be listened to as many times as the student likes. The way the tests are structured is also quite nice, with equal emphasis on spoken and written French.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, close to an hour of audio programs almost every day in one week can be a little much. They seem rather unbalanced, with students sometimes being assigned ten minutes of audio program work one day and six times as much the next day. The only other aspect of the course I would change is the presence (or lack thereof) of in-class writing. It was a bit surprising to hear that there would be essays on the final, given that all the writing we had done in that class until that point had been on our own time. A few more short essays, like the five-sentence ones we did in class a couple times, would help a lot, I think. I know those are pretty minor complaints, but they're really all I can think of that could be improved about this course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are in the texts and films we studied - I think the material helped me see very clearly the ways in which we were progressing and the themes we discussed in class were stimulating enough without overwhelming my capacity for thinking in a language with which I am not yet familiar enough to be expressing complex thoughts about abstract ideas.\r\nThe daily audio exercises were also very useful practice. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who genuinely wants to improve their French. It is not easy, but it is worth it. I valued the emphasis on idiomatic expressions. I noticed a difference in my reading ability in a matter of weeks. After all the work on verb tenses and moods, I have also noticed a difference in my comprehension of song lyrics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. While you don't learn much new material (compared to L1 and L2), it solidifies your grasp and usage of French, which is invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--very well-designed course and fantastic instructor ",
            "\u00a0If you love French, then you will love this course! This is your first chance to read real books in French. Keep in mind that it is a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - but only with Madame Koizim. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student interested in studying French. I would do so mostly because to skip from French 120 to French 140 doesn't make a lot of sense, but there's undoubtedly value in taking this course. It trains students well in all aspects of French: speaking, listening, reading, and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely - taking French L3 is, in my opinion, an exponential jump from L2 and was a very useful, interesting and efficient way of learning a lot of French in a short period of time. "
