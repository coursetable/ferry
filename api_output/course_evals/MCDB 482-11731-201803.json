            "\u00a0This course taught me how to read scientific papers in depth and critically interpret their results. ",
            "\u00a0I took away two main things from this course.\r\n1) The ability to critically read a paper and understand what could have been done better.\r\n2) The ability to read the primary literature and develop a research question that I, and hopefully others find interesting and important. ",
            "\u00a0I learned alot about the different signalling pathways conserved in multicellular organisms. I learned how to write a research proposal, how to read a scientific paper, and how to be able to identify bad work/science. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to review signaling pathways, learn about their mechanisms and how they elicit a response in transcription. We also learned how to critically read scientific papers, and identify the components that make up a well-written paper. This was specially helpful when we had to write our own grant proposal, which was by far the most challenging part of the class.  Moreover, we learned how to present in front of a scientific audience, and the feedback was very helpful in helping me improve in these areas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course. It will teach you how to think critically about and read into the methods behind important cell biology papers. In a few weeks, regardless of your background knowledge, you will become much more competent with chemical biology and will quickly become more able to pick apart flaws in published studies. You also will be forced to learn how to write a high-level grant that will definitely challenge you intellectually, but will leave you quite satisfied when you're done. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. Specifically, how to read dense scientific literature, how to critically evaluate the validity of data presented, many different biological research techniques and how to formulate a grant of my own. I appreciated the volume of papers we had to read because it really forced me to become comfortable reading scientific papers by the end of the course. The structure of the class was conducive to learning because it forced us to verbally explain complex figures and data out loud. The workload was challenging but well worth it. "

            "\u00a0I thought this course was very strong and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0While we talked about this in class, it might be good to have another intermediate grant deadline where people also submit the background info and previous data sections of the grant. Additionally, occasionally going over new materials and methods in papers later in the semester would also be nice.\r\nI think the way the course was organized going from small details in the beginning to more overarching themes was well done. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are its small size, Dr. Crews is a very knowledgeable researcher and scientist, and you'll learn  many new scientific techniques and learn how to critically analyze a scientific paper. At the end of the course, you write a grant proposal, which may seem daunting at first, but at the end of the course it is more manageable given how much you have learned. Dr. Crews ensures that everyone participates in discussion, so this isn't like your standard humanities seminar where you can get by by not doing the readings. Its not easy work, but you'll definitely get alot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the way of calling out students during class. It really pushed me to prepare to present every paper we read in class. I don't think I would have done the reading if this calling out system wasn't in place. I think that having a larger  part of the final grant be due in between the semester, it would have helped me have a easier time writing it than having to write most of it at once during an already stressful final period ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class was perfect for this type of seminar. The small class size and seminar format allowed students to all have a chance to explain the papers we read and allowed for conversation and content critique. Professor Crews randomly called on students which was helpful as it gave everyone a fair opportunity to share. The action items and class presentations were interesting and a good break from the paper discussions. It also allowed students to take charge of the content in the class and teach it to others. The final grant proposal was very challenging and time-consuming but a great learning experience. I had no idea what a \"grant\" was at the beginning of the year and learning to formulate my own hypothesis and research literature was rewarding albeit challenging. \r\n\r\nI think more instruction, written or verbal, about writing the final grant would be helpful.

            "\u00a0If you are interested in doing science or med school, I would absolutely recommend this course. Reading scientific literature is an essential skill in both fields and this course trained me well for that part of my future job. I really do feel a better scientist for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to go to grad school. This class taught me more about being a scientist and how to succeed in science than any other class I've ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a good course for any MCDB or MBB major looking for something different from the routine lecture where you have to study slides for an exam. You'll learn alot in a small classroom setting, and you will feel like you're ready to tackle any scientific question know after you've taken the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in cell biology and get a very good overview critical signaling pathways, then this is the class for you. Just be aware of the final grant paper, which might seem like it is not too bad. But if you leave it for last minute, it will not be fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. There will be a mix of students who are very experienced working in labs and will have a great deal of background knowledge while there will also be some who have barely done any research, and are not very familiar with any of the methods discussed in class. Regardless, you will do well, and you will learn a lot. We only had 8 students which made it very easy for everyone to get involved and get out their complaints each and every week. Also, Craig is a boss. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It will be challenging but very well worth the workload and frustration early on. Professor Crews is an incredible and invested professor who wants his students to learn to think critically on their own and challenges everyone in the class to do so. He also is approachable and very willing to help. I would recommend for any student wanting to feel confident in reading scientific literature and aiming to have a comprehensive understanding of scientific research. "
