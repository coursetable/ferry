As for the second unit on asymptotic theory, I am glad to have learned what it means to study the large sample properties of an estimator and how one can prove the convergence of some quantity in probability or in distribution to another quantity. Overall, I think this course is useful for improving one's ability to read and conduct research in statistical theory. I feel more comfortable digesting the content of statistics research papers on my own as a result of taking it. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Fan is an excellent lecturer and was always very prepared for class. His lecture notes, and especially the examples he included, were definitely quite helpful. I also thought the textbooks we used for this class were quite good.\r\nWeaknesses: It's great that this course comes with an ambitious syllabus because students can be sure to learn a great deal in one semester, but occasionally this can come at the expense of deep understanding.  A number of concepts in the course are quite abstract and really do take a lot of time to absorb, but sometimes we moved just a bit too quickly through the material for this absorption to happen.  Even though I made sure to devote a great amount of time to doing the homework carefully and reviewing my lecture notes regularly, I think there are at least a few topics from the course for which my understanding remains a bit superficial as a result of the speed with which we covered them.  Removing just 1-2 topics from the syllabus could alleviate this issue. In particular, some topics we could have spent a bit more time on are: methods for finding minimax estimators, multiple hypothesis testing, contiguity and absolute continuity, and efficiency. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Very theory based. It is a great design to really train  and enhance knowledge and understanding of the students. Also small class sizes meant students get great feedback and attention from the professor.\r\n\r\nWeakness: By the nature of the subject, the course can be difficult to many students with prior background in the subjects. However, it is a great course that teaches great deal. "
