            "\u00a0Taking this clinic changed my life and the course of my career. ",
            "\u00a0The EJ Clinic was an invaluable part of my FES experience, and I'm very glad I had the chance to work with Marianne and partake in the Clinic. There are few avenues to explore environmental justice at FES, and Marianne does a wonderful job of laying out the history of the movement, as well as teaching many practical skills involved in advocacy and community work.

            "\u00a0Yes.  I loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar part of the clinic aligned pretty well with my expectations, but the case work was quite demanding, and rather difficult without any legal training. Marianne tries hard to pair law students with non-law students, but even still I felt a little out of my league as the majority of the work was legal in nature, and thus there was a much steeper learning curve. I also didn't expect the constant nature of the course. Being a clinic, there is no predicting when something will go wrong or require a lot of attention and time. This often doesn't coincide nicely with the rest of your schedule, and my other coursework suffered on behalf of the clinic. I think it's just important to recognize this when signing up. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by its continuation.  The law school need to hire Marianne Engelman Lado into a permanent position.  The failure of the law school to keep her hurts F&ES in particular, which has been trying desperately to overcome its racist reputation in the environmental community.  Clearly unbeknownst to the law faculty, Marianne has enormous clout in the environmental justice world.  Yale's reputation as a irretrievably racist and white supremacist place will only increase as knowledge of the law school faculty's shockingly short-sighted decision spreads. ",
            "\u00a0The clinic, both the seminar and the fieldwork, was the best experience and where I learned the most this past year.  The discussions and topics covered in clinic were really useful and thought provoking, the cases I worked on were compelling, challenging, and complicated.  It was really great experience figuring out how to navigate relations with clients and community members.\r\nIf the clinic had been continuing, the one thing I would have liked to see is more updates from the other students on their cases. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the Clinic is that it provides students with a really unique and valuable opportunity to do real work in places where it really matters, and receive excellent supervision and guidance. A weakness is that the work load for the cases is heavily legal, and not as approachable for a non-law student. "

            "\u00a0Take it.  A refuge.  And you get to do real work that has real-world impacts and makes the United States a slightly less racist place.  The failure of the law school to keep Marianne and the clinic hurts F&ES in particular, which has been trying desperately to overcome its racist reputation in the environmental community.  Clearly unbeknownst to the law school faculty, Marianne has enormous clout in the environmental justice world.  Yale's reputation as a irretrievably racist place founded on white supremacist principles will only increase as knowledge of the law school faculty's short-sighted decision spreads. ",
            "\u00a0Expect to put a lot into the work, and be surprised by what you can accomplish. There were weeks when I spent 30 hours on this class, but in the end it felt ok because it was to benefit a cause which I believed in, with people who really appreciated the help. The Clinic is a unique opportunity at FES, and those who are interested in Social Justice and Environmental Justice shouldn't miss it. "
