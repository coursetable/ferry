            "\u00a0Learned a lot of history about women, reproductive rights/justice, and America. It was a history course but not super focused on minute details and facts, which I appreciated. I learned how to do book reviews and write an academic reflective essay. A lot of my views were challenged; some changed, some were reinforced. Most importantly, I have a lot more nuance when thinking about these historical issues, and am better able to contextualize views that would be out of place today. ",
            "\u00a0To list all of the knowledge, skills, and insights I gained from this course would be impossible as there are so many. I learned the history, first and foremost, of reproductive health in America which enriched my understanding of current reproductive health topics and my own personal views about them. I learned how to write an academic history book review. I learned how to speak about historical sources analytically without retrospective bias. I grappled with really difficult questions about reproductive health - Prof. Eisenberg always asked probing and fascinating questions that were hard to find answers to, but nonetheless incredibly important to discuss and engage with. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a much deeper understanding of the history and the powers dynamics of reproductive politics in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about the history of reproductive health in the United States, and my writing and confidence speaking up in class greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of many issues in the realm of reproductive health, such as the medicalization of childbirth, abortion rights, eugenics, sterilization, and much more. I also learned how to improve my writing and synthesize a main point from a large amount of readings. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great overview history of reproductive health in the united states. as someone who has thought and learned a lot about reproductive health, I worried that I wouldnt get much out of the course, but I actually learned so much. and learned to think about things in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so, so much about how women's reproductive health has changed over the past two centuries, and how trends from the past necessarily inform present-day debates over abortion, eugenics, contraceptives, etc. I also learned how the history of women's reproductive health can be used as a lens through which to analyze shifting power between different genders, professions, and other identities over time.

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, good course discussion, fun video clips and presentations, great professor.   \r\nWeaknesses: seminars could be a bit lecture-heavy depending on the week, limiting time for discussion, although there usually would be at least a half hour dedicated to discussion. There were a few weeks that had pretty heavy reading (120+ pages), which could sometimes be hard to juggle with other courses. It was also disappointing when we had lots of reading but only a portion of it was discussed in class, but we do only get 2 hours a week. ",
            "\u00a0This is perhaps the strongest course I have taken at Yale. I would have liked the seminars to be longer. I would have also liked a little bit more initial guidance on the final paper was the topic and expected organization of the paper was unconventional and not as intuitive / familiar as a history research paper is. ",
            "\u00a0The class is really well structured, the syllabus is carefully organized, and the class discussions were stimulating. I truly enjoyed this class! I have no suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the seminar (it was my first at Yale). The material covered was fascinating to me. I don't have many suggestions for improvement - it's probably been my favorite class at Yale thus far. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great blend of both interesting aspects of medicine and history and how they interacted over time. I really enjoyed the weekly readings and thought the seminar discussion was insightful and fun to participate in. The presentations and papers really supplemented our learning and allowed us to delve deeper in areas discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was completely great! Every week led to an interesting, but rarely repetitive, discussion about some aspect of reproductive health, and Professor Eisenberg did a great job making sure our arguments were based in facts and history. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing. My one suggestion is that I think the final paper should have been a more traditional research paper, because the current style is very hard to do and it was a bit unclear what was expected of us. In addition, I would have much more enjoyed learning a topic more in depth rather than what felt like just skimming over multiple topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a great survey history. The material is so interesting, the readings are AMAZING and really nuanced. \r\n\r\nI wish the class discussion had been more of a discussion and more focussed on the readings. I'm conflicted because Professor Eisenberg's occasional lecture was really informative and interesting; without it, I would not have learned as much as I had. However, I also wish we had had more time for real discussion, especially discussion of the texts. I also wish the lectures had incorporated more of the readings-- because the readings were so excellent. \r\n\r\nI think our class discussions could have been better, but of course that varies from group to group. I don't think we were always provided with very challenging questions to consider. I also wish the class had been more diverse. It was mostly white women, which was difficult in a class that talked a lot about race and gender dynamics.\r\n\r\nProf Eisenberg really cares about his students and our learning-- which is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wow, what a wonderful class. Great selection of readings, thought-provoking class discussions led by an incredibly skilled professor, and fun opportunities to dive deep into certain topics through two book review-esque papers and a classroom presentation. Weaknesses: I honestly can't think of ways to improve the class, other than the fact that two hours often didn't seem enough -- it sometimes felt like we were just scratching the surface of the day's topic by the end of class. This year, the class was all women except for Dr. Eisenberg, which made for a comfortable and supportive environment, but I strongly believe that more men need to take a class like this. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Eisenberg is great - he's a very funny and personable guy when you get to know him (yes, it is a little weird that the class is taught by a male prof, but I got over it quickly). He directs class discussion with intentionally provocative or pointed questions that force us to re-evaluate our views or interpretations of readings. Writing workload is manageable, with two short papers and one long paper, none of which are research papers. Lots of reading in the course can make workload heavy. ",
            "\u00a0If you are lucky enough to get into this seminar, you absolutely 100% must take it. Best class I have ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100 percent recommend this course to another student. I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that the material of the course is very important. I thought I knew the history of reproductive health before the class, but having taken it I knew nothing. This is a history which I think everyone (but especially women of childbearing age) should know. The material was taught in a way that made it fun and exciting to go to class each week as well. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite classes at Yale, I would definitely recommend to anyone! There is a lot of reading, but it's all very interesting and worthwhile, and I found myself looking forward to class every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! This class was a lot of fun and I learned a lot. If youre interested at all in reproductive health definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a must take class. Professor Eisenberg is a phenomenal instructor and makes the course incredibly meaningful. You will view pregnancy and reproduction in a different way as a result of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone who is interested in learning about reproductive health should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0yes take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think the material is fascinating and Prof Eisenberg really cares deeply about his students. I got a great overview history of reproductive health in the united states. As someone who has thought and learned a lot about reproductive health, I worried that I wouldnt get much out of the course, but I actually learned so much. and learned to think about things in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%! This is one of those classes where you might not feel anything week to week, but by the time you get to the end of the semester, you realize just how much your worldview has expanded. The historical context that this class gives is instrumental for understanding the complexities and nuances of modern-day issues in reproductive health, gender, and power. Our readings covered a diverse set of experiences, and the papers -- two book reviews and one reflective essay -- did a wonderful job of pushing me to engage more deeply with both the course material and my own preconceived beliefs. Take this class if you want to challenge yourself to become more informed, empathetic, and insightful when it comes to issues of reproductive health. "
