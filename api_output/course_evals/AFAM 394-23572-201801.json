            "\u00a0Learned how to listen and think about music academically, which was a really new and exciting thing for me. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an incredible chance to think about three geniuses in relation to the world and each other. Not many classes let you go this in depth with an artist, and Prof. Brooks really helped opened Hansberry, Baldwin, and Simone's lives and work up in interesting ways. She also really does a good job pushing you to think in new ways about scholarship (esp in terms of music). ",
            "\u00a0I developed a thorough knowledge of the Black Radical Tradition and gained incredibly useful insights into the study of blackness and cultural production. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the material that we interacted with in this class, not so much from the discussions. I learned a lot about the history of the black radical tradition but I also learned about the artistry of it. ",
            "\u00a0Weve explored the litaray, musical, and biographical work of three prominent artistic contributors and figures in the Civil Right Movement. We spend each week analyzing literature and positioning our way of thinking within certain thematic frameworks that resonate with multiple texts. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH. Daphne teaches you an entirely new langauge totalk aobut these figures. She situates their politics in a current context, but does not ever for a second elide the historical specificity of their work. We learn so intensely/comprehensively aobut each figures artistic/academic credos and its amazing. "

            "\u00a0Sometimes there is too much reading to talk about in class in the depth you want. ",
            "\u00a0Love Prof. Brooks in class, and the conversations we had about the artists. Only thing might have been a bit more time to think about and prepare for the final project. There were creative options, but it was a bit hard to think about a creative project in the midst of all the other finals too. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible class. It challenged me to read more than any other class and develop critical writing skills. Prof. Brooks cares deeply about the class and everyone's engagement was very high. The reading could be a little overwhelming at times, but it was thoroughly worth it. ",
            "\u00a0The three figures were incredible to learn from, but our discussions were not very fruitful. The short papers were very difficult to fully invest ourselves in analyzing their work. I also think that the course was very unorganized and I'm not sure that I learned much from the class and the professor -- I learned a lot from reading the works. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was fantastic, and all of the books I read were ones that I would have wanted to read for fun anyway. That being said, because the class is mostly seniors, their thesis work got in the way in a lot of the required reading and led to limited or shorter discussions in class. Prof. Brooks did everything in her power to adapt the conversation if it wasnt flowing smoothly, but it came down to the engagment from students themselves. "

            "\u00a0Yes but be prepared to do a lot of work. You will learn so much from DA Brooks and Yale cannot afford to lose this professor. We need people consistently in this class bc it is important. However, be prepared to put in the work and come to class having done the readings. Nothing less will be good enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would, you get out of it what you put in ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was an amazing opportunity to think about these artists and their impacts and geniuses. Take a class with Prof. Brooks if you ever have the chance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course changed my life. ",
            "\u00a0This was a course that allowed me to interact with three incredibly profound figures. The course was pretty unorganized and our discussions weren't always the most fruitful, but Professor Brooks's mini lectures were great and reading/listening to the artists was incredible. This class is so important to understanding black art in America, but also for understanding more about humanity and love. ",
