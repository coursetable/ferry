Students were expected to prepare and know what to do during lab days, but TAs were very helpful in explaining needed details and ensuring set ups were correct. The outcomes and percent yields in lab did not matter, which made students more relaxed and provided a better learning environment. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is structured very well. Dr. D understands that this is many peoples' first time working with organic reagents and using these techniques, so you are not graded on yield. You are also not overwhelmed with many techniques, and get a chance to really practice them and feel comfortable doing them. The course is nothing like gen chem lab, and neither is the instructor: the course is not overwhelmingly long, and often gets out around 3:30; there are only 3 quizzes and 2 lab reports that are very manageable; you have more freedom to work at your own pace and you do the experiments yourself; the instruct is a kind angel who actually wants to know her students and support them and teach them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading of the course is very dependent on how strict of a grader your TA is and your performance on like 1 quiz. The quiz only has 5 questions so if you mess 2 up like I did, you get a 60% and it impacts your grade pretty significantly. The grading needs to be more balanced. ",

            "\u00a0Parts of the EP felt redundant and a waste of time. They were also graded pretty harshly. The PLAs were also graded harshly and didn't really seem important to understanding how to do organic lab procedures. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great, because each student is able to work in their own hood, and only collaborate if a partner if they wish to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the strengths of this course are the quality of the TAs, who are very helpful in lab and answer the questions we may have. Also, Dr. DiMeglio always checks in with every student during lab, so every student feels like they are cared for and feels that the professor and TAs want them to do well and understand the material of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-engaging TA's and professor, \r\nWeakness-subject material could be slightly repetitive at times, the odd structure of assigned and submitted work ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely well-structured, with thorough explanations and guidelines and expectations stated. The course packet is an excellent resource. Grading could definitely be more consolidated among TAs, because even though scaling will be done, I think it would be less stressful to be given a particularly harsh TA. I also think that EPs should be graded for completion and there should be more post-lab assignments to understand what mistakes not to make. I think more instructions could be given about the techniques. ",
            "\u00a0It's tough to receive feedback on whether or not you're doing the procedures correctly. I don't think grading harshly by % yield or something like that is a good idea, but 0it was unclear to me if the class was supposed to be a way of showing us what the chemistry we discuss in lecture looks like in practice, or if we were actually supposed to be getting better at the lab techniques themselves. Either is fine, but clarity early in the semester might help guide what we should be spending time focusing on in our studying. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was constructed to reduce student stress, which I hugely appreciated. Things like being able to play music in lab or only having a few graded lab reports were such gifts. I wish, however, that the two quizzes at the beginning of the course weren't weighted so heavily! Ugh! They test like lab preparedness and lab safety, which are undoubtedly important but shouldn't count for as much as 3 EPs. Also, one general problem I had with lab is that I feel like during lab itself, I'm just following a recipe, and it's only in my preparation for lab or synthesis of the material later on that I actually learn. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the Course Packet for this course was extremely helpful because it explained all of the techniques being used in each experiment in a way that made it very easy to understand what would happen when we performed the experiment in lab. I think the format of the course, with the requirement of writing Experimental Plans each week before lab, was extremely helpful because it forced us to read through the procedure and understand what we would be doing prior to coming to lab and needing to perform the experiment. I also think that the TAs and Dr. DiMeglio were so approachable and helpful throughout every experiment; having them there and available to answer any question eased some of the stress of needing to perform techniques that we have never seen or used before. ",

I liked how we had to prepare before each lab, this made sure we really knew what was going on. The only thing I did not like about the course was the final, which was a lot tougher than any of the material we had to do throughout the semester and also graded kind of tough, with one multiple choice question worth 5 points. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall the course was very well organized to facilitate both student learning and critical thinking. However, I do think the class could have been a little more strict when it came to safety and cleaning because I did see people just dispose of acid/base incorrectly or leaving the scales really dirty. ",

The workload is not too excessive and definitely manageable. Christine also does a great job of getting to know all the students and will help you understand what you're doing. Overall, it was a great course and was enjoyable. Weaknesses: Grading was frustrating at times since it was so variable between TAs. Some TAs would take points off for random, trivial reasons while other TAs would just award most of their students full marks on every assignment. Just make sure to follow the EP guidelines word for word in the course packet. Also, it would've been nice if this course complemented the things we learned in the lecture course. It felt completely separate and disjointed throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0The course provides an excellent foundation in organic chemistry lab techniques, giving students the opportunity to learn each skill and apply it in subsequent labs. It was difficult for me to jump into this course as a freshman (having not done Yale gen chem lab) and learn how to operate in a lab with no lab partner and all of the techniques at the same time. I don't think that this is a weakness of the course as much as an adjustment for me, but it defined my experience in the course all the same. I would've liked to do another lab or two with a partner, especially in the beginning of the course, because it takes time to build self-confidence with such tasks. I also made the mistake of choosing a hood next to a whiteboard and hallway, which was very isolating -- it would have helped a lot to be next to other students who I could ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of spelling and grammatical errors in the course packet, and the wording on the quizzes was generally vague and misleading. The EPs I found to be generally helpful with understanding the experiments. The Post-Lab assignments were also a bit vague in some questions, and I think there was a lot of inconsistency in grading across the TAs. Not a bad course, especially because the experiments seemed to have a purpose to them, but the experiments could have been explained better in the lab manual or by the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job of providing an introduction to some lab techniques and basic synthesis processes. It was great that each student got an individual hood and so much of the work was independent. The use of IR spectroscopy felt a little bit unnecessary because the graphs are so difficult to interpret correctly and it isn't used much by research labs. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength of this course are the mandatory EPs (prelabs). They force you to know what exactly it is that you are doing in lab and WHY. I believe this process really enhanced my experience with labs, especially after gen chem lab. Another strength of this course are the short but extremely efficient labs. You learn a lot from a short 2-hour lab and the length mentally helps you deal with weekly labs. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very engaging and each lab session taught or applied interesting techniques. One weakness could be that different TA's operate very differently, so some lab periods receive informative lectures and some sections leave much earlier and are much more efficient. ",
            "\u00a0TAs and professor were much more understanding and patient and evoked less stress from students compared to general chem laboratory; grading was a bit strict when it came to the EPs/pre-lab material and lab reports but apparently final grades are adjusted for stricter TAs; there were also only 2 lab reports which was fine on workload but they were heavily weighted so it would have been nice to have other more heavily weighted things so if you didn't do as well on one, you could make it up with others) ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this was a very good course. There aren't any weaknesses that I can think of. The TA that I had was very friendly and helpful during lab. The whole class loved her. We had a great time talking to her, including talking about things other than chemistry. The labs each week were very straight-forward. The procedures were given to us in advance, and we just needed to write a pre-lab each week, which wasn't hard. The pre-lab was mainly summarizing the info about the lab that was already given to us in the course packet. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the workload was very manageable and the course was great! Everything was very fair and the teaching scholars were very helpful. I thought we could have more postabs - I wouldn't mind more practice with scientific writing. I liked the structure of the course and found the course packet a good resource for safety and guidelines. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was the fact that it promoted independence in the lab and taught lab skills through interesting experiments.  The weakness was the fact that the course relied heavily on the course packet, which was sometimes vague or unclear when it came to describing how to do the experimental plans. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the class was a focus on learning how to do laboratory techniques as opposed to getting a very specific yield or a precise answer. This reduced stress during lab time and overall fostered greater learning. A weakness of the course was the weighting of certain assignments. I spent collectively far more time on the EPs than on the PLs yet the weighting of these assignments did not reflect this fact. ",
            "\u00a0It would be nice if the course tracked more with Chem 220 rather than freshman organic chemistry; there were a few experiments whose mechanisms we didn't discuss in lecture until the week of final exams, which made it a bit difficult to follow in the pre-lab lecture and in the EP notes.

            "\u00a0This course was very well-designed. It taught me all the necessary skills, techniques, and concepts without any additional stress/ frustration. The concepts behind the labs were often intellectually stimulating and challenging, but never turned stressful.\r\n\r\nWhen writing my first Post Lab Assignment, I was not sure how much detail to include when answering questions, and how to approach the questions. I lost some points for not having enough details. Perhaps there could be a little more explanation in the course packet. ",
            "\u00a0The labs were very clear, and designed to help us learn. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: very chill throughout the semester, this semester we only had 2 lab reports, Dr. DiMeglio is so sweet and caring. Weakness: the final exam wasn't a fair representation of the course-- it was only ~30 multiple choice questions, each worth 5 points. It basically determines your final grade, and I feel like it didn't reflect the content and skills that were emphasized to us throughout the course. But in defense of the final exam, I guess there has to be a way to stratify everyone's grades so letter grades can be assigned because I think most people had above a 90 in the course before the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that Dr. D carefully plans each lab such that we are eased into different lab techniques that build on each other from week to week. A weakness (although this isn't Dr. D's fault) is that if students aren't given their first choice lab they may not be able to take lab at all given the other classes they are taking. For example, Dr. D told us this semester that ~120 students put Friday lab as their first choice and there are only ~70 spots. For many of the ~50 students who didn't get Friday lab, that was the only day they could take lab, and had to endure the stress of a waitlist. Several of these students (many of whom I know personally) didn't get Friday lab, and thus had to wait until next semester to take lab. If students have to take orgo lab, they are most likely pre-med, and don't have the luxury of taking courses whenever. This is Yale. There should be a solution to this problem, especially since the increasing class sizes with the addition of the new colleges means the number of students who don't get their lab day will increase. I didn't think this would be an issue with orgo lab, since it wasn't in Gen Chem, but it was and it should be addressed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful because it emphasized all the right things: safety, lab techniques, preparation, and student learning. I thought the pace was perfect, and our instructions (both verbal and written in the course packet) were very clear and helpful. I thought there was a strong prioritization of safety and neatness. The lab itself was a very pleasant environment to work and learn in. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by more closely tracing the organic chemistry sequence and what we were learning there. It could be an excellent exercise/practice for the normal class, and could make the normal class feel more relevant and interesting, but felt pretty separate most of the time. ",
            "\u00a0Really well structured lab class-- so much better than gen chem lab!  The textbook for the lab should be recommended though, not required (I never used it once) ",

However, a major weakness is the written final examination, as none of the material covered on the exam was lab-specific. While the lab hopes to provide a better understanding of organic chemistry in general, I do not really believe that the proper resources had been provided to allow for success on this exam. Also, much of our grading was based on organization instead of actual material. ",

Compared to all the work put in previously it accounted for a larger percentage than it should have. Further there was not a great method to study for the final besides just reviewing the course packet. However a strength of the course was the value of the course packet and how effectively it was structured . The labs also built on each other which seemed prudent. "

It is not like other superfluous laboratory courses at Yale that are very hand wavey with little substance (aka PHYS165/Gen Chem). The instructor and TA want you to leave the course with practices and techniques that are actually useful. Even though some portions of the course may seem like odd (like the EP's) they are actually really helpful in allowing you to understand the WHY and WHAT of chemical processes. ",

This course is 10000000000000x better than gen chem lab and DiMeglio is not a tyrant like Dr. G. You will love the course. P.S.: If you get an A on the final written the exam, you get an A in the course no matter what, so study a lot for the final. Do the study questions listed at the end of each experiment. ",

There are weekly prelab assignments due but those also can be done in a reasonable amount of time.  The final is not too difficult if you reread the lab manual before the exam and learn what we did and what commands are used for what.  Overall one of the better and more interesting labs. ",

            "\u00a0The course is a lot more laid back than gen chem lab but by no means is a gut. EPs (pre-lab notes) are only worth ten points, so any mistake will result in a -1, which can make it difficult to raise your course grade because there aren't too many other assignments. The experiments are interesting enough, but sometimes frustrating; you generally get out around 4:00 though. It seemed to me that the lab follows freshman organic chemistry more closely than Chem 220, because a few of the experiments expected us to be familiar with mechanisms that we had not covered at that point in the semester in 220. The final exam was also a bit tough, especially with each question being worth 5 points (all multiple choice, so no partial credit). ",

Unlike gen chem, in orgo lab you can get everything done before the 5pm deadline--actually, you will found yourself getting out of lab way before 4pm. The labs are intellectually stimulating, and they are really fun. You are not graded on your yield, so you don't feel pressured to make no mistakes.
