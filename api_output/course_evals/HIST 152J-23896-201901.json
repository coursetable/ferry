            "\u00a0I learned how to better visualize the course of history surrounding the 13th amendment and slavery in general as a narrative. This class focuses intensely on the stories of those who have been enslaved and how to protect those stories while also preventing the same from happening again. I found this class a great confluence of law, storytelling, and public policy. I learned how to elevate the stories of survivors, as well as critically evaluate efforts being made across the world to stamp out human trafficking. ",
            "\u00a0I developed substantial knowledge of the 13th Amendment, its history, as well as an understanding of the manifestations of indentured servitude and slavery in both a pre and post-Civil War context, understanding the judicial attempts made to stifle its persistence, as well as the glaring and appalling measures taken by many in power to condone and even facilitate the persistence of slavery in the United States well into the 20th century. The class artfully ties history and law; Professor cDeBaca artfully provides both the more general historical context in tandem with the legal interpretations and applications of the law in the context of the anti-slavery fight. In the latter half of the course, you take a turn towards the present, learning about the modern anti-slavery fight. Overall, beyond the content component, you develop your ability to understand and articulate cohesive arguments through a legal lens, among several other skills. ",
            "\u00a0To critically analyze real world topics, and also to challenge my own biases ",
            "\u00a0This course gave a very in-depth look at slavery through history  beginning in the 19th century for context and working up to modern slavery that exists today. The course was very well structured and Professor deBaca brought so much insight to the class by speaking on personal experience and his wealth of knowledge on modern slavery. "

            "\u00a0This course is full of really interesting and valuable readings, but there are a lot of them. You can learn so much from reading Blackmon, Daniels, all of the court cases, and more, but at times I wondered if it might be better to further distill the material. This is so hard to do though, so I don't discount Professor C.deBaca's efforts to expose us to all of the important discussions and narratives relevant to the central themes of the course. \r\n\r\nI liked that the course contained different types of writing assignments and a presentation. Professor C.deBaca's extensive experience in the Federal Government and his connections all across the world make him a great resource both in and out of class. His real-life experiences filter into in-class discussions, and this makes them all the more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe only critique I have of this class is that Professor C.deBaca has a lot of thoughts (and even more metaphors), and this can sometimes take away from the generation of student-led discussion. This is a balance that is difficult to strike, but I think Professor C.deBaca is mindful of this. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic, as it was led by an extremely knowledgable and personable professor who was able to inspire insightful conversation among the seminar in which each participant offered a unique viewpoint. Large weekly-reading assignments were perhaps the only weakness of the course, although it provided a sound foundation so that class discussion need not be wasted on the basics and advanced to the more interesting questions surrounding the class's topic. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible amount of discussion, the two middle papers are almost busy assignments, could be modified somehow or possibly removed. Requiring earlier drafts of final paper would be good. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength was how Professor deBaca was able to convey information, tell stories, and weave together timelines in such a effective way. He really could speak with so much detail and knowledge about modern slavery cases (he has worked on many big ones). A weakness was probably the heavy workload (there was so much reading that it was hard to cover everything in seminar.) perhaps, less reading but deeper, more close analysis in seminar. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course to another student. Modern Slavery and the 13th Amendment was the most influential course I've taken at Yale. It was incredible beyond words the amount of things I learned, skills I was able to improve, and support I was given by Ambassador deBaca. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! The content of this course is unique in that it spans over a number of decades and developments in the language and policy surrounding slavery and human trafficking. There are critical discussions to be had about the way we think about slavery versus human trafficking and what images come to mind when we use both of those terms. By the end of the class, you start to realize that this discussion is practically endless -- yet there aren't enough people engaging with the difficult questions on a day to day basis. The structure of the class takes these questions on immediately, pushing students to think about the micro and macro manifestations of slavery in institutions that exist today. Lastly, Professor C.deBaca is an invaluable resource. He is kind and extremely giving with his time. He has so much experience, and he wants to share all that he can with his students. I greatly appreciated this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only is it taught by a fantastic, knowledgable professor (a former US ambassador on human trafficking under the Obama Administration and a former federal prosecutor in the civil rights division) but the subject matter is both fascinating and important. This class will push you to understand how slavery has persisted within our society from its very inception, understanding the social implications of this reality as well developing a knowledge of the legal methods used to fight (or facilitate) the pervasive institution. If you are interested in the law, American history, and particularly slavery, take this class! ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Professor deBaca is without a doubt the most passionate instructor you will find, must take. ",
            "\u00a0Id definitely recommend this clas to anyone. Being taught by Professor DeBaca, who is so caring and so insightful and wise, has been such a great experience. I knew close to nothing about modern slavery, and now I feel like I know a lot and am very passionate about fighting modern slavery. "
