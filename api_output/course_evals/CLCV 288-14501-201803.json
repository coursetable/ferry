            "\u00a0I am leaving this class with a better understanding of the political thought of the three authors we read! I can now, with confidence, summarize and cite several parts of their thought within conversations about history/politics/philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0A very solid grounding in Ancient Greek politics and philosophy, and a sense of the connections between Plato, Aristotle and Cicero. ",
            "\u00a0I got a comprehensive understanding of the political thought of Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero by reading their major political works in their extant entirety. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read (seriously!) the most significant political books from Ancient Greece and Rome from start to finish and assess the causal structure of the whole works while paying attention to salient details. I developed a far deeper sense of the history of political thought between Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero and a more thorough understanding of each author's thinking on ethics and value theory. I also learned how to write a graduate-length paper using   primary and secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the major writings of three pioneering philosophers of ancient political thought. I hadn't read any of the texts covered in this course previously and left the class with a firmer understanding of the foundations of western philosophy. The writing assignments also "

            "\u00a0I loved the open conversations that Prof. Cammack would help lead  it helped us all engage in the material based on our sets of interests! I think because of the difficulty of the readings and the heavier course load, we also were lucky to get a very engaged set of students who clearly cared enough about the readings to be there1 ",
            "\u00a0Great course. I wish we had connected the authors more and discussed their similarities and differences in an overarching fashion, and I wish we had read some Platonic dialogues such as Apology, Crito, etc ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is simply that it forces you to read such important works in their entirety without being too fast paced. It allows you to engage with the material without really ever having to skim. The single session per week seminar format allows for good extended discussion as well. \r\n\r\nI do think that this course could have benefited from the introduction of some secondary literature, but I understand that that would have made it more difficult to include the amount of primary material that the course had. There were times when I had to use obscure ancient sources to make pretty obvious claims, and while it was never too detrimental, it felt unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a gem and should be offered every year. I appreciated having the chance to consider the texts of Plato and Aristotle in full for the first time -- usually only excerpts are assigned. The syllabus was well crafted to show the development of each thinker's philosophies, especially through Plato in the Laws, Aristotle in the Rhetoric, and Cicero in De Officiis. Professor Cammack's decision to have us read the Loeb editions of each work (which include the original Greek or Latin text) was also excellent. She would guide students through each text to point out where Greek words (such as arete=virtue) would remain constant in the text where translators would substitute different words. \r\nI enjoyed having an hour and fifty minutes per week to talk about a single text, but I wish the class was broken into two separate hour and fifteen minute classes instead. The first class could be spent setting each work in its historical context and assessing its general structure and most important contributions in the history of philosophy, while the second could be devoted to close reading and discussing critical passages. That said, Professor Cammack did an incredible job managing the class each week and we were always able to get through the most important parts of the reading with one class. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is the strongest part of this course. Professor Cammack has curated a phenomenal syllabus. Weekly assignments were well paced and allowed time for thorough reading. I also enjoyed the essay-based framework of the class. The option to write one, two, or three papers over the course of the semester allowed for independent exploration depending on the interests of the student.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the weekly seminar was the weakest part of the course. Conversations felt guided primary by a desire to summarize the text. Discussion questions were geared towards making sure everyone understood the texts at a foundational level. Questions such as \"what is a polis\" and \"what is rhetoric\" were useful to get everyone on the same page and open the class. However, weekly discussions often sagged halfway through each session. I would have preferred a more involved debate-style seminar that encouraged students to tackle controversial questions and exchange arguments. Also, the class might have benefitted from meeting twice a week instead of once a week. The first seminar per week might be focussed on summarizing the reading while the second seminar might shift more towards more argument-based analysis. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend taking this course! If you want to have a motivator to read staple ancient texts and have thoughtful dialogue each week, I would recommend taking this. I would not have been able to learn this material in the same way on my own! I have a much better understanding now of the foundations of western political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Anyone interested in the Ancient Greeks should take this course. I would recommend some grounding in Greek philosophy and/or fluency in Latin or Greek. ",
            "\u00a0While an advanced course on Plato and Aristotle would be great regardless of the professor, the biggest draw of this course is Professor Cammack's approach to teaching. In all my time at Yale, I have never had a professor teach with so much enthusiasm, zeal, and passion for the course material and for her students. Cammack draws on an incredible wealth of knowledge about ancient Greek history and political philosophy to guide her students through these difficult, incredibly important texts. She dedicates enormous amounts of time each week to meet with every single student in her seminars, offering extra opportunities to engage with these thinkers and craft your own takeaways about the course material. On top of all that, she's done groundbreaking work on Aristotle as a scholar, which makes the class even more interesting. Long story short, just take this class. Lots of reading but it's all worth it. You will not regret it ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class or any class led by Daniela Cammack. She is amazing: super helpful, very knowledgeable, and endearingly passionate about the subject. It also is really great to delve into seminal philosophical works that might otherwise be glossed over or only partially examined in other class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I would recommend this course to others interested in political science, philosophy, and ancient political thought. ",
            "\u00a0This is primarily a reading course. There are a few papers you have to write and some standard discussion responses, but for the most part, your engagement in this course will be just reading the large amount of course material. This is a good chance to go more in depth into texts which you've probably only read in part or very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to everyone! It will be incredibly difficult to keep up with the reading if you haven't been exposed to political theory or philosophy before (we essentially read a book per week), but getting a solid grip on these three authors will affect the way you view any other course (and your life, really). The ideas laid out by Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero need to be assessed and discussed to fully understand our modern condition. I would even venture to say the class should be required for students of political science, classics, history, or philosophy; it's that important. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure that I would recommend this course to another student. The reading list is excellent and every student at Yale should have experience reading Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero. However, I'm not sure the class is quite well organized enough to provide students with anything more than they might receive if they read these texts on their own time. Weekly discussions were often slow and I don't think I got that much out of seminar discussions. Professor Cammack does provide students the option of writing either one, two, or three papers over the course of the semester. I enjoyed this feature of the class as it allowed for independent exploration. "
