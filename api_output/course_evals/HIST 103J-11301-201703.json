            "\u00a0This is a truly incredible class. The mind of Frederick Douglass is cavernous - you learn to read autobiography critically, understand history through the lens of a personal experience, and engage with different writings to reach an understanding of a person's self conception. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about nineteenth century American history vis-a-vis the life and writings of Frederick Douglass. In addition, learned different approaches to understanding Douglass' life, and the greater implications on the historiography of important historical figures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a fascinating figure and period in American history. I also feel like I explored a more literary way of studying history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to put together a really long history research paper, which I haven't learned anywhere else! ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about Frederick Douglas. Like, wow. ",
            "\u00a0I gained many skills through this course. I especially learned a lot about how to read autobiographies with a critical eye, and analyze changes in a person's beliefs through their writing. This class also had several papers which improved my writing skills, making it clearer and more precise, and helped me develop my research abilities. ",
            "\u00a0- How to analyze such an essential historical figure like Frederick Douglass and understand that he, too, was human and had faults just like all of us. Came around to seeing him as more of a man than a myth, and that is just as powerful.\r\n- How to conduct research in a manner that truly fulfills my intellectual inquiries. Research can be fun!!\r\n- To not only analyze the research on FD's life as well the writings that FD himself left behind, but also the context behind those writings.\r\n- To notice subtle changes in one's works and the significance behind those changes.\r\n- A more comprehensive version of FD's life, outside of what was discussed in high school.\r\n- The different kinds of abolitionism. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think many are fazed by it being about one person, but it's interesting how the study of a singular person can encompass so many topics. This is a class for everyone - most who took it only had a vague understanding of who Frederick Douglass was. Lots of reading, but so enjoyable and truly centred around your own points of interest. ",
            "\u00a0This course has so many strengths. The material is fascinating and a joy to read. The discussions were fun and productive. I always came away from class feeling like I understood the material much better, and feeling generally inspired about studying history. ",
            "\u00a0Less reading, and more detailed and careful focus on that decreased amount of content! There was too much to have cohesive class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0engaging course, great professor; heavy workload with a lot of readings, which were unfortunately not always discussed in class ",
            "\u00a0Professor Blight has a startling wealth of knowledge. I guess not actually startling. Hes spent his life studying Douglass. ",
            "\u00a0This class was absolutely wonderful. I learned so much about Douglass, the people (especially women) surrounding him, abolitionism, the Civil War, and Lincoln, among other things. The readings are long but engaging and entirely worth the time spent on them. David Blight is exceptional, and it is a privilege to be able to take a course with him. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Blight's plethora of knowledge on Douglass' life and the passion that he brings to the discussions. \r\n- The discussions are certainly mostly student led, but Blight adds in his comments when he feels that we should think on a subject a bit differently or more comprehensively.\r\n- Vistors from other historians, like Leigh Fought\r\n- Visit to Beinicke to see original copies of Douglass' books and papers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Tons of reading. Can get overwhelming unless you are fully engaged with the material. The readings are necessary, so I'm not sure how to cut back. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. Professor Blight is insightful, engaging, and generous as an instructor. You learn about a fascinating character, hugely relevant now, from an expert really committed to the undergraduate experience. This course really changed how I read and experience and think. A Yale must. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course. The reading is a joy, and discussions are both fun and productive. There is a significant amount of reading, but it's totally worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This was one of my favorite classes at Yale, so I definitely would recommend taking it if you get in. David Blight is fantastic. The readings took me a fairly long time to get through each week but were entirely worth it, and the writing assignments were a great way to die deeper into the readings, and, in the final paper, into a topic that really interests you. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! You learn to view Frederick Douglass with a more critical lens and understand all of his many contributes to society. ",
            "\u00a0David Blight's course on Frederick Douglass changed my life, and it was the best class I've taken at Yale. It inspired me to become a history major! "
