            "\u00a0I learned about opera, music, Shakespeare, theater, and old text. ",
            "\u00a0I got to read Shakespeare plays I'd never had the chance to before, discovered that I liked certain operas, got to see an opera in person, and learned a lot about music during Elizabethan times and how it was used in Shakespeare's plays and their adaptations. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about historical uses of music in Shakespeare productions and in the time period ",
            "\u00a0We covered musical the musical cues in a bunch of different Shakespeare plays and looked at how different adaptations interpreted them. We also looked at various musical/operatic adaptations of Shakespeare plays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Shakespeare in terms of history and critical thought surrounding Shakespeare & music. The readings for this class, concerning musical performance history, restoration Shakespeare, and other aspects of Shakespeare & music were incredibly interesting and thought-provoking, and gave insight into a dimension of Shakespeare as a performance art that is often missing from most classes that involve Shakespeare from the literary perspective. This course also introduced me to many different versions and adaptations of Shakespeare involving music that I had not known about previously, and made me so much more excited to engage with all kinds of different types of media through which Shakespeare and music come together. ",
            "\u00a0As the name suggests, I learned about Shakespeare and Music. This included everything from the music contemporary to Shakespeare's time (which could have been played onstage in the original productions) as well as adaptations of Shakespeare's work (operas). I knew next to nothing about opera before this class, so I learned about the different voice parts and Verdi's operas in particular. The final project was VERY open, so we kept learning from our classmates as we heard about their projects. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of insight into Shakespeare plays and interpretations "

        [
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting and fun because you get to actually read Shakespeare's plays, watch opera, and listen to various music. The biggest strength is the availability of various resources in class and at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0They never really check if you do the readings so it's easy to skip them, but then you get a lot less out of the course. If you were to do all the readings, they would take a long time. So it's tricky to find a balance/trade off. ",
            "\u00a0Great music to listen to, but also long and sometimes boring readings ",
            "\u00a0I think the course itself is very strong - it offers a very unique perspective, and I found that I gained a lot of insight as I read and engaged with the course as a whole. The course content is very engaging and structured very well - each unit was well laid out and gave time to sit with each play and its derivatives and reflect on the key differences and strengths of each. One major weakness in my eyes as a student was the discussion itself. Prof. Malafronte is incredible and the course content is excellent but what happened this semester in particular was that the class was filled with people that weren't necessarily all that excited about the course material; they  seemed to be more invested in the class as an easy A and humanities credit. Discussions were horrendously boring and hardly anyone had anything interesting to say  beyond regurgitating some aspect or point raised in a reading that was assigned and saying it was \"interesting\". This course has a lot of potential, but because it is a small seminar with very minimal amounts of graded assignments/work, it is easy to attract the wrong kinds of people - the kind of person that does not care much about enthusiastically engaging in the subject material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class is so approachable, even for people with pretty much zero musical or Shakespeare experience. We took a field trip to New York to see an opera at the Metropolitan Opera, and it was amazing. Hands down, it really made me realize the skill and scale of opera that you just can't get from watching recordings, so this was such a strength. The field trips to the rare manuscript museum and the historical sound center were perfectly placed in the course and made me aware of the resources we have here at Yale. The seminar style is nice, and there are some opportunities for discussion. Professor Malafronte is very knowledgable and open. The final projects were so much fun to hear about (and if you choose wisely something you are interested in) and do as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I think there could be more student driven discussion. Sometimes it felt like we would listen to something, then be asked: \"Did you like it?\" and not go much deeper. I think some of that is just with the amount of material we cover, you can't go in depth on everything. The first couple meetings especially are really lecture-heavy with not much student participation, but this isn't representative of the class as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Interesting, unique content, Awesome excursions to the Met Opera, Beinecke, and Music Library. Professor was very passionate.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Not very many "

            "\u00a0Yes, because you get to explore Shakespeare in a fun and insightful way with other students. You also get to watch actual opera and listen to real recording from the Elizabethan time! ",
            "\u00a0It's a fun, easy class. You'll get a lot more out of it if you actually do all the readings, but that takes a bit of time; in general I'd say you get out of it what you put into it. You actually learn a lot about opera too, which as a nice surprise because it made me realize I actually like some opera. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great and interesting class to help busier STEM students fulfill a humanities credit ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested or curious about music in Shakespeare plays, or how the plays have influenced musical composition, take this class. You don't need any real musical knowledge or background to take this class. However, if you are not particularly interested in the topic or you just don't like Shakespeare, then this class probably is not for you. If you are interested, you'll probably enjoy this class a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I will say this: this course has so much potential to be a fantastic class for anyone who is interested in Shakespeare as drama and in HIGH LEVEL music. The course emphasizes the performance aspect of Shakespeare - there is essentially no analysis of Shakespearean text in the way  that there might be in English literature courses. The readings cover many things ranging from performance history to primary sources from Verdi, but do not cover the plays' texts themselves. The music aspect is primarily rooted in Malafronte's area of expertise, in the more classical and high level area. If you like listening to modern music but don't have any interest in baroque music, contemporary opera, or lute fantasias, this class is not for you. Though the course touches modern (as in, radio-level modern) music the tiniest bit, the bulk of the \"music\" aspect sits in the classical realm. Prepare for a ton of opera and baroque music, as well as a smaller amount of symphonic music and incidental music. Of course, if you have no experience with these and are willing to try them, by all means! But do realize that if you do not like this sort of music, it will not be an interesting class and you will make the class awful for the other 10 people in this seminar who do. On the other hand, if you are very interested in both of these things and think that this class would be a wonderful addition to your course load, note that because it is a small seminar, there will be many discussions of operas and baroque recitatives that will be painfully dull and soul-sucking if the other members of the seminar are not invested in the material - if you find that this is the case during shopping period, consider turning around. It can still be an acceptable experience if the people are apathetic, as the course itself is very interesting, but know that 2.5 hours of your week might end up being rather mind-numbing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Please take a first year seminar, but especially this one. Professor Malafronte is SO knowledgable and open to having the interests of students drive discussion and the class. It's not overly stressful or an unmanageable work load. Don't feel like you have to have lots of experience with opera or Shakespeare (I had never seen an opera before taking this class). The field trips are fantastic and you get to know your classmates because of the seminar class size. Again, if you are on the fence, I say go for it! This was a side to Shakespeare I hadn't really looked at before, and it really gave me perspective on what goes into a theater production in general. Totally doable even with a heavier schedule, don't miss your opportunity to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone interested in Shakespeare, opera,  or music. It is a very relaxed and comfortable environment to learn a lot about art forms that one may not be familiar to students. It is also a great way to experience different resources that Yale offers students, such as reading rare books from Beinecke, listening to old recordings from the Music Library, or going on a trip to New York to see an opera. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this class. I really enjoyed it. The way Shakespeare is presented is really cool. Plus we did a lot of fun things. "
