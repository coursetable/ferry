            "\u00a0It is very good in its inducement to write the proposal on a set schedule. I have no complaints! ",
            "\u00a0I liked that we were able to read and critique our peers' research strategies in this course - however, I think this process could be somewhat improved. It was difficult to engage deeply with 6 research strategies in the course of a weekend, and I know my critiques could have been more in-depth with more time. \r\n\r\nOne idea I had was for students to critique one paper at a time, perhaps over the course of a week, where a student has 24 hours to give feedback on a research strategy before returning it to the student, who can then edit their paper before sending it to another student to critique, and so on. There may not be time for each student to read every research strategy in this case, but it might give more focused, targeted feedback, and avoid the inefficiency of multiple students pointing out (and getting distracted by) the same edits in a given research strategy. \r\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed this class and thought it was organized well! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Peer review as well as TA and instructor feedback was exceptionally important. Faculty feedback was of high value; course organization/ application breakdown was well organized; opportunity to practice presentation skills also highly valued. \r\nWeaknesses: Very few. One limitation might be the scope of fields available for faculty review component, although I understand this a consequence of the fields of students enrolled. "

            "\u00a0Yes, not only for those interested in applying for an F31, but anyone interested in applying for NIH grants in the future. Skills developed could be applied to any future grant as well as for improving science communication in general. "
