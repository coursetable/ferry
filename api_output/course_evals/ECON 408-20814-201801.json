            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how trade protection (import substitution, export subsidies, etc.) can affect different stakeholders in a nation (consumers, producers, industries, factors of production, government, etc.). You also learn about these effects for the rest of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Important frameworks for evaluating trade policy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned several frameworks with which I can evaluate the impact of various trade policies. I also learned where these models fall short and looked at real-world empirical data to back up certain claims. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are that it is small and Professor Maggi is always willing to field questions and provide help. The course is well-structured and the amount of content is balanced. The cons of this course are there is not that much time set aside to interact with and discuss the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Maggi is awesome, material is usually interesting, and the assignments are not overwhelming.\r\nWeaknesses: Mmmm nothing really. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class might benefit more for a little more open-ended discussion, especially since class participation was worth 10% of the grade. The only opportunities during which we got to talk were when we asked questions which felt a little limiting. Other than that, however, I don't really see how this course can be meaningfully improved. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student who is interested at all in trade. I had no background prior to this class and it taught me a lot about what the impacts of trade are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. There is a soft pre-req of ECON 184 for this course, but it really isn't that important to have taken beforehand. Even if you don't become a trade economist, international trade policy is very important today, and this is a great class in which to learn about it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. As far as Econ senior seminars go, this one was very engaging and felt like a natural extension of some of the material in macro/micro. It was also a pretty low-stress course; professor Maggi is very approachable and eager to help and the material is not very strenuous. Overall, this course was not too difficult while easy to manage and I still learned a lot and found the material to be more interesting than in most economics courses. Easily one of the courses I was most thankful to have taken at Yale. "
