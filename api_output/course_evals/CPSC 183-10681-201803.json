Brad makes his own rules about how he wants to teach his course and acts more like a colleague than a professor, which creates a dynamic in the class that makes students more comfortable to participate.

While the class focused on the law governing each of these areas, counterarguments and failings of the law were also discussed, and some topics were solely discussed in terms of their social impacts. Brad's life lessons, interspersed throughout the lectures, were also an important part of this course. ",

            "\u00a0This question is hard to answer because so much of the course was intended to challenge us qualitatively in terms of critical thinking related to issues at the forefront of law and technology.  The topics ranged from copyright, fair use, and the digital millennium copyright act (dmca) to a understanding of privacy, anonymity, and the law, to what's the deal with net neutrality and antitrust law. What I liked about the class is that we read what the situation in question was and the decision that was made, and argued in class what the decision should have been based on the law/previous decisions but also what the law should be morally/based on technology that exists. It was a good balance of explanation but also challenge to make our own assessments based on what we learned. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Topics are very interesting and so were the readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Brad barely taught the material. He would often go on tangents (that were engaging, to be fair) and talk to his favorite students for a large portion of the class. It was funny at first, but then it became frustrating. It felt more like a shoddy sitcom rather than a class. Also the grading was extremely disorganized and nobody received all their reading response grades prior to the final. Not really a gut either since the take-home midterm was insane. ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome and super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-\r\n-Incredibly engaging (seriously, I never was bored in this class)\r\n-Taught material well\r\n-Taught about material that other instructors would have left out\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n-Ambiguity with grading\r\n-Often too many irrelevant readings ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing and the class is very interesting. It's not like any class I've taken at Yale and I only have good things to say about it. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was amazing and feel that not much needs to be changed. The only thing I would stress is that reading responses should be graded in a more timely manner so that students can know where they stand in the class before the end of the semester. Other than that, I love the easygoing structure of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: content and readings are extremely interesting; Professer Rosen does a good job at making them relevant to the present.\r\nWeaknesses: Grading and feedback; grading standards are very unclear and how the overall grade in the class is determined is even more so. ",
            "\u00a0This class was engaging, relevant, and fun. The topics we covered were very interesting and were taught in a way that didn't require prior knowledge of computers or law. However, grading was very slow so it was very difficult to tell how I was performing in the course. I didn't get my midterm back until the end of reading week. While this was partially due to issues regarding the assignment of TAs, but it was still a source of frustration and worry. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an easy course for most students. If you do not like Brad's teaching style do not stay in the course though. Brad is very unique and different from most Yale professors, which I found to be amazingly fun. With only really 5 assignments throughout the semester and a couple of videos, the course load makes this class okay for most students. The only challenging part of this course is the midterm, but it is a take-home midterm. Overall, I would say that this course is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The reading assignments were excessive, and very dry compared to the exciting time in class. I wish there were more consistency i workload throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly entertaining course material, but some of the individual things we focused on were a little unrelated and could have been streamlined. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Brad is a very engaging lecturer.\r\n- The readings are generally engaging.\r\n- The topics addressed in class are interesting.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Deadlines are very vague and if you're a procrastinator, the readings and responses can start to build up.\r\n- The midterm took me 30 hours to do, not including the time it takes to do the readings.\r\n- I wish the TA's were more obviously available throughout the course and had office hours, especially to help with the reading responses, midterm, and final. ",
            "\u00a0It is an amazing course. The lectures are captivating and fun. My only comment would be that I had a lot of trouble knowing what would be accepted as a reading response, or really what was expected from my reading responses. I would have loved a more in-depth explanation. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job presenting the law on each topic while also encouraging discussion of shortcomings in the law or issues that can't be addressed legally. Lectures were the most engaging of any class I've had at Yale, with Brad encouraging personal perspectives and differing points of view while providing his own insights. The reading responses provided a good way to reflect on the material and flexibility to spread out the workload over the semester, though they were occasionally frustrating when readings weren't released until soon before the deadline. My main complaint is that some lectures focused on only a specific part of the assigned readings, avoiding discussion of the other readings that I felt more passionate about and would have liked to discuss in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think thats class was incredibly engaging, fun, and exposed me to a wide array of topics, but I thought that there weren't many opportunities for student growth or improvement, and it was difficult to track how we were doing and get supportive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Brad is very engaging, the material is extremely interesting and it is intellectually challenging. There is an insane amount of reading, though. I highly doubt anyone in the class would have been able to do them consistently even if they tried. The class was also fairly disorganized in terms of grading. I was very stressed the whole semester about grades in this course because everything is based on the midterm, the final project, participation, and reading responses. I was seriously considering taking this course Credit/D because I had not received a single grade back by that deadline, but Brad strongly advised against it. The reading responses are also two pages single spaced and take a fairly long time since they are basically short essays and he doesn't post the readings until the morning the reading responses are due (at 10:30 pm). I had absolutely no idea how I was going to do in this class which stressed me out, but I'm happy I didn't Credit/D it since I ended up doing well. ",
            "\u00a0Brad's class is unlike any other at Yale. It is largely dictated by his personality, which can either be a strength or weakness. It can engage students or push them away.   There was minimal feedback, but Brad is a very knowledgeable professor who is a good teacher.\r\n\r\nI think the course spends a bit too long on copyright, and could talk about other current issues related to law and technology (fake news, social media and mental health, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized, great readings, phenomenal professor.\r\nGrades are kinda meaningless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching style, cupcakes, and things learned \r\nWeaknesses: organization, and length it takes for things to get graded ",
            "\u00a0Taught in an extremely well and engaging manner ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging, and you learn a lot just by attending and engaging in the lectures. Brad is a great teacher and I loved each class. A weakness is the readings, they are posted late with not enough time to complete them all and therefore the reading response time is limited. The grading system also needs to be improved as I did not receive any grades until the course had ended. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the lectures and readings were very interesting. Weaknesses were that sometimes the readings were too long and difficult, and the lectures are hit or miss with relevance to the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The cupcakes are a strength, and also the professor's ability to recognize when and if he has crossed a line when engaging with a student during lecture and to apologize swiftly and appropriately (I mention this as a strength because he is more self aware than many of the professors I have had and also much more upfront about biases- and explains how he has come to his conclusions rather than assuming that people should just agree because he is the professor). \r\nIn order to understand the class lectures, you must do the readings. The readings are variably long, always interesting/relevant, and are all available online. I always looked forward to them being posted, but it might have been helpful to update the list a few more days in advance of lecture (but this was a minor thing and I always made time to do the readings anyway). Otherwise, I felt very supported asking questions and engaging with the material in the lecture environment. In this class, it is important to embrace the concept of being \"wrong\" as an often quite reasonable and informative point of discussion and opportunity to rethink a hypothetical. ",
            "\u00a0The course made learning about legislation and case laws about the Internet and technology more approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging and fun. No real weaknesses, except for maybe getting grades back a tad faster/understanding how my grades related to final grade. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was very great. One way to improve it may be just having an organized list of terms. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting and fun to listen to. The readings were very engaging and I enjoyed answering the questions. You are very prepared for the midterm, it is just a lot of work. I am glad I took this course and learned many insightful things from Brad. ",
            "\u00a0it's a large lecture course yet feels like a seminar, as brad will choose to call upon anyone who raises their hands in class. So it's easy to have the chance to talk every class, and also easy to never say a thing all semester. You definitely learn the most by attending lectures, so don't skip even though you can get away with it - the lectures make the class what it is "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0No. If you want to learn the material, get them off the syllabus since most of it is online. I regret taking this class since it wasted a credit slot I could've used for another, more engaging course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn a lot more than you think you will, especially stuff that's outside of the scope of the class. Plus it's super engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student because it was incredibly engaging and unlike any other course at Yale. It teaches very interesting material that is useful and relevant in the modern age. The workload is reasonable and the readings are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to another student. As a STEM major interested in attending law school, it was very interesting for me to see how similar the two fields can be. Brad is a great professor and I really do not have anything negative to say about this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially one who is studying computer science. I learned a ton from this course through Brad's non-traditional teaching style and think that anyone with an interest in technology should know about legal ramifications and experience what it's like to have Brad as a professor. Brad is a bit of a polarizing figure but I'd recommend shopping the class and taking it if you gel with his teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0Brad is wild. Make sure you like his style before you take the class. He can be a lot, but he really does care a ton about the students and you will get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0What you learn from this class is great for anyone to know as Internet users, but it's not necessarily a must-take class if you find other subjects more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would totally recommend this course to another Yale student as long as they are okay with Brad's teaching style. Brad tells it how it is, and I personally found that to be a great teaching style. The class was relatively easy with a light workload and would make for a pretty much easy A for anyone who wanted one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you like Brad or if you are interested in computer science law. I fell into the former group, not the latter, but still enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Very fun, not too much work, and incredibly educational. ",
            "\u00a0This one's complicated. The material is super interesting and the readings are worth doing, but I found the lack of organization frustrating (I didn't get my first grade back until right before Thanksgiving break) and found the classroom environment kind of annoying (the same people participated all the time). Listen heavily to Brad's disclaimers on the first day of class, because I felt uneasy about the class on the first days and stuck it out but I kind of wish I had listened to my gut. I am glad I took it though, because of how much I had learned about issues that I think are really important. ",
            "\u00a0It's overall a great course, but you honestly need to shop the class because Brad is very particular and you either hate him or like/love him. The course structure is also a little messy, but if you enjoy the material and lecture enough, it's not a big deal. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is not only interesting, but also pertinent in an increasingly digital world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! In addition to teaching the legal frameworks that have guided the development of the internet and social media, this course provides great opportunities to discuss practically any aspect of the relationship between technology and society. The reading responses are the main work of the course, and the informal writing style they ask for can be a great way to try out ideas without worrying about the grading of a particular assignment. Lectures are the best I've had at Yale -- very interactive and engaging, and often teaching me things that go far beyond the course content. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would because the content is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is engaging, but you need to be responsible for the timeline of the workload. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. Brad will tell you on the first day of shopping period: leave if it is not for you. He is insane and brilliant and he will \"trick you into learning\" if you are able to sit there for a full semester, but you should only do this if you actually enjoy his lecture style. This course was fantastic for me, but I am sure that not everybody at Yale would enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0It definitely depends on the person. If you are someone that stresses about grades or not knowing how you're doing, then no. If you are looking for an intellectually stimulating, unique teaching approach to an extremely relevant topic and can handle Brad and the somewhat disorganized nature of the class, then yes. ",
            "\u00a0It depends. I think that it is entirely dependent on the student. The material is very important, and Brad is very knowledgable and can be fun. That being said, it is a disorganized class, which can be stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely everyone should experience this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are ready for a very long and hard take-home midterm in the middle of the semester. Trust me - it's not fun. Feedback on course-work is incredibly slow - I received my midterm grade after I arrived home for winter break. As I type this up now, I still haven't received a grade for my final reading response.  The final project was pretty chill, though. If you're worried about grades, take this Credit/D. Don't listen to what Brad says about that, he'll advise against it. But honestly, unless you're really great at making legal arguments or like to speak up a lot in class, you're better off that way. Trust me ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very fun and informative. Professor is great. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, though I would warn a fellow student it is best to take it when you have time to do all the readings and to be prepared for a professor with a strong personality. It almost should be mandatory for anyone who uses the internet (or the internet.org) to help people understand the laws that regulate their behavior and the changing technology and norms of digital spaces. I also recommend it for 1st-3rd year students because if you enjoy the class and take 185 (IP in the digital age), there are ula positions. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe to a senior! The course material is interesting, but in terms of assessments there isn't really any timely feedback, which makes it hugely difficult to improve. In particular the five reading responses are expected to be like essays, with clear theses and evidence to substantiate it, instead of more loosely structured assignments typical of other classes, which is something I didn't really get until late in the semester. ",

            "\u00a0DEFINITELY take this class. People joke about how you were tricked to learn, because you absorb content without even realize it during lectures. However, use the first class or two to decide how you tolerate Brad's teaching style - it's not for everyone, but I've had a similar teacher in the past so I was used to it. "
