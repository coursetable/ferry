            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Roman Architecture and wall painting, and how different emperors, dynasties, political and historical context, and personality of each ruler shaped the architecture of the time. Also learned technical elements of Roman architecture: e.g. types of capitals, parts of a traditional castrum plan, embellishment terms, etc. ",

            "\u00a0There is a lot of memorization, but the professor and TAs are amazing - so passionate about the class and the material!! ",
            "\u00a0Strength-wise, Professor Kleiner is clearly fascinated by the Romans and is clear about this when lecturing. Also, the course is well laid-out as far as the syllabus goes. The monument lists are useful study guides and the e-book is essentially just the lectures in book form.\r\n\r\nWeakness-wise, the course is very dry as far as the lectures go and the exams require intense amounts of memorization of ~160 monuments per exam, which can be a real grind before the exam. Also, the final paper is tough to write, but definitely doable if you get a head start. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Kleiner was great; lecturers were interesting and almost like watching a movie\r\nWeakness: lots of memorization before midterms ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this class was a great survey of the field, and I feel very knowledgeable about the topic and want to visit Rome!\r\n\r\nI do think Professor Kleiner could have taken a more critical lens towards Roman architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely interesting and great way to tie in history. Lectures are enjoyable and well-organized. Lots of online resources to facilitate learning.\r\nWeaknesses: There's a bit of a disconnect between the material presented and the level of effort the class seems to need and what is tested on the midterm and final. It's just a huge amount of memorization - I didn't necessarily have a problem with it but I heard some people who struggled with it. E.g. I'm fairly sure a lot of people dropped the class after the midterm - while it seemed doable and was very interesting I just think people weren't prepared for the midterm which is sad because this is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting in its history and the connections that can be seen in the world architecturally. The research paper and the build your own city project was very engaging. However, having to memorize dates and so much information for over 200 flashcards / monuments / terms for every midterm took away a lot of joy in learning about the monuments themselves and their context. There were no practice exams, so midterms were really difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were sections! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are how it connects to modern architecture and how in depth it goes into architectures role in the Roman Empire and beyond. Weaknesses are how much memorization is required and how the lectures are not very involved sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of the class changes very quickly, as the regular class is fairly easy but accelerates a great amount during midterm time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the material is very interesting and the instructor is very passionate about Rome and Roman architecture. The ease of the online forum in place of a discussion section was also a strength, since it allowed students to engage with material at their own convenience. \r\nThe monument lists and flashcards for the exam made student learning very easy and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the class was very accessible to people with little architectural background, in that Professor Kleiner does a good job of explaining terms very clearly especially at the beginning of the semester. Also, the course's Canvas site is extremely useful and has everything you need to do well on the exams -- study guides, terms lists, prep questions. Overall, the class was extremely well-structured and well-organized. I thought that the lecture could be a little repetitive at times, and I would have liked to be able to spend more time going in depth into some of the more iconic/influential monuments. ",
            "\u00a0Class has a very standard/predictable structure. Grade distribution among exams and assignments were fair. A weakness was the speed at which the professor talked - I often was worried I miss details in my notes and ended up rereading lecture transcript. ",
            "\u00a0There was so much material we went over so quickly that it felt like we didn't learn about any building really in-depth, which was a shame. I would have preferred to go in depth in a few buildings instead of a brief overview of a ton, which meant I didn't remember much about any one building. Would have loved some more historical context as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Every new monument brings new insight into the grand scheme of Roman architecture. I am able to identity Roman architectural elements in my everyday life now, and know approximately how the elements came to be. The format of the course is well designed - about 24 modules and each module focusing on a portion of Roman architecture. \r\nPerhaps not a weakness but a concern in the course is that memorization skills are important to a student's grade. Each module has about 8-10 monuments, and although only about 16 are tested on each of the midterms, unless you have a good sense on what is going to be tested and/or have good memorization skills the midterms will be very difficult. I believe the difference from an A and a much lower grade like a C doesn't lie in what you know about Roman architecture in general, but in the specific monuments themselves. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of this course is Professor Kleiner herself.  She is clearly passionate and knowledgeable about all things Rome, which allows her to spin fantastic stories for each lecture.  Additionally, the way in which Professor Kleiner has organized the lectures (grouping some by themes, materials, or eras) is very intuitive and helps facilitate student learning. Professor Kleiner also made sure to have a very comprehensive and well-organized course website (something that is hard to come by in other courses).  And finally, Professor Kleiner connected monuments and themes throughout the entire semester, which only helped to further the narrative of how Roman architecture evolved overtime and its importance today.  That being said, I would say there are a few things that can be improved about the course.  First, it would be a very good idea to not have lecture at 9:00AM.  I understand that some classes must be held in the morning because of registrar scheduling.  However, having over an hour-long lecture in a dark room early in the morning lead to many people falling asleep or skipping lecture altogether.  Thus, I believe having it later in the day would be a benefit to everyone.  Another additional improvement would be replacing the online discussion forum with section meetings.  While the online forum was meant to create student conversations, I found myself not truly reading what other students wrote but instead just writing the posts to fulfill the participation requirement.  Having section meeting times would force students to engage with the course content, and, help us create stronger relationships with our TAs. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! One of my absolute favorite classes taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in Roman architecture or really need a humanities credit. If you have a great memory and/or are prepared for the exams, then you'll do fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great humanities credit for those who need it. The material is interesting and not too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro course if you are interested in the subject! Professor Kleiner knows everything there is to know about Roman architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great way to learn about architecture, art history, and history. I actually think it would be a great class to audit or Cr/D so you won't be scared away after the midterm. I truly enjoyed going to every lecture and learning from a department I never took a class in before. ",
            "\u00a0I would not really recommend this course to another student unless you are an upperclassmen and love the humanities and architecture. It is a rough course if you take it as an intro course. It was frustrating to have to memorize dates and other information about each monument, which I would constantly be forgetting. It felt like a memorization marathon. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you genuinely care about learning more about art. Dont just take this course for an art credit because you will lose interest. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I definitely would! This course is a great option for a easier 5th credit class, and has an amazing professor teaching who is very passionate about her work. I do not have too much background knowledge in Roman architecture, but this class made it easy to jump in and explore Roman art. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting course material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone, especially to those who are hesitant about taking an art/architecture class for the first time. The teaching staff is very kind and helps you analyze and write about art, come the midterms and finals. Very interesting material too! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. If you have any interest in traveling to Rome or learning about ancient Roman culture, there is much to learn about the city through its architecture, and it is fascinating to see the lead-up to the creation of some of the world's most famous monuments. Professor Kleiner is very passionate about helping students do well, and the workload is relatively low with only two non-cumulative exams and one paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in architecture or looking for a humanities credit outside of a STEM major. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not, because of the reasons stated above. I felt we went over a ton of buildings without really going in-depth into any of them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think learning about Roman Architecture was a very enriching experience anyone could benefit from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class, especially to anyone that is interested in Roman architecture/history. I have taken a variety of courses that focused on Rome and while we did go over some of the basics of the Roman buildings, Professor Kleiner goes above and beyond in telling the stories of the architects, the historical context of the buildings, and in explaining their architectural elements. I have truly learned so much and I am very glad I took it!  Having said that, I would make sure to start studying for the midterms (we had 2, non-cumalative midterms) well ahead of time, as there is quite a lot of information to memorize. "
