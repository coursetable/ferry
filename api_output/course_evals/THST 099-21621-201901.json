            "\u00a0My analytical and creative writing skills improved throughout this course. Even though we didn't have many writing assignments, Emily gave each student lots of feedback. We approached learning and research through movement which was very refreshing and different from any other Yale course I have taken. If you have the opportunity to take a class from Emily Coates, take it!!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about dancefilm theory through readings, films, and daily movement exercises. Dancefilm theory is very dynamic, as every artist has a different interpretation of how dance should be recorded on film, so we had very insightful discussions about what each artist was aiming for and how we see it reflected in dancefilm now. I became a better dance analyzer and dancer, as I had to pay attention to more details than I had before. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the relationship between dance and cinema throughout the last 150 years or so. We looked at various forms of dance and the means through which they are communicated, and I gained a greater appreciation of dance through movement exercises at the beginning of each class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a real appreciation for dancefilm, which was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze dance films through the lens of composition, movement, choreography, filming techniques and editing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive understanding of dancefilm as a medium that synthesizes two incredble artforms to become something even greater. as a result I became a more critical and aware consumer of art and developed the skills necessary to not only critique dancefilm, but create it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much taking this course! I truly hadn't even known that screendance existed as a distinct art form before taking this class. From this class I received a short history of dance and film. I now have an entirely different perspective when I look at films; I analyze the craft without even realizing what I am doing. It has been so cool to notice the way this class has changed the way I think! "

            "\u00a0My favorite part of each class was the movement studies. Maybe these studies could be expanded upon. I also enjoyed when we had guest speakers come into class. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class is the seminars we had the fortune to attend, including the D-Man in the Waters screening and the motion capture lab. These seminars gave us a greater insight how rich and dynamic dancefilm can be, both emotionally and technologically. My favorite class was definitely the motion capture seminar, as we created small choreographies with the same software that was used to create Fortnite. I greatly enjoyed the creativity this class has, as I was able to write a 9 page manifesto on how to improve YouTube dance tutorials as my final paper and create a short dancefilm in a group. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest weakness of this class is the lack of a set of notes which clearly defines what was covered in a given class - discussions are not recorded, and students are expected to take notes on discussions without a reference aid like a Powerpoint or document, making it hard to discern what the main ideas are. The instructor could upload a set of notes after each class to help students understand the main ideas of each dancefilm theorist. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Coates is amazing and such a delightful teacher. She was patient and encouraging and highly engaged, which made the seminar something to look forward to every week. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the readings are a little unnecessary, but overall it is very well structured so we could touch on many different types of dancefilm. ",
            "\u00a0Some readings are far too abstract and lacking in-class discussion ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of this course is Professor Coates. Her enthusiasm for dancefilm is contagious and managed to break me out of my shell, drawing me into discussions I never could have imagined myself having.\r\nThe weakest part of this course for me was some of the readings. Certain passages were so long and obtuse that I don't feel I gained much by reading them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- The small seminar style enables everyone to share their ideas and ask their questions in a truly welcoming environment (and it facilitated friendships between us)\r\n- The projects we did together, both inside and outside of class, helped further my understanding of the principles we studied in class\r\n- I loved having a class that met in a dance studio!

            "\u00a0Definitely. Dance on Film was my favorite class at Yale so far. The students in the seminar became very close and comfortable with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only if they have an interest in dance or film - without either, this class will be difficult to engage with, as no other topics are discussed. However, any student with a strong passion for either dance or film will greatly enjoy directly engaging with both, be it through readings, discussions, or actual movement and filmmaking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. While it certainly did not relate to my potential major or really anything Im considering long-term, it was fascinating to learn about this niche subject and it was a welcome change of pace from my other Yale classes. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! Professor Coates is amazing and the class is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in either dance and film studies, you can have a try. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any first-year. It was engaging, eye-opening, and unique. I don't think I could have found another course like it anywhere else. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend! It is not only informative but so much fun. "
