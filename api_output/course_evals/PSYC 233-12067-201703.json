            "\u00a0I learned how to write a psych research paper. ",
            "\u00a0This class was supposed to teach me how to write research papers as it is required for the psychology major. Everything I learned was from the textbook and not from the lectures or the professor. I learned how to do work by myself and attempt to figure out how to write a paper without much assistance. ",
            "\u00a0I really learned how psychology research should be conducted. It also helped me learn how to read and write psychology papers better. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave us the independence to conduct our own research which I learned a lot from! "

            "\u00a0The class was good but could have more lectures ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very nice and always willing to meet with students. It's a bit disorganized but overall, he is very flexible. ",
            "\u00a0We were barely helped with how to write a research paper. The first half of the class was lectures on emotion and then we were pretty much just done and supposed to ask questions, which was pointless because we weren't taught how to write a paper so we didn't know where to start or what to ask. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the textbook for this course was very helpful in teaching the class how to conduct research, but this is not something we covered at all in class (except for quizzes), which I think would have been helpful in our own research projects (i.e. if we could have asked questions about what we should be doing in our research). This was a small class so I could see how a bigger one might have helped to facilitate discussion. I also think that it would have been helpful to have a set syllabus (vs. one that kept changing) because I didn't know when things were due or what we would be doing in class. In terms of the research project, I thought it was a fun thing to do but it was hard to really start it in the final week of classes/reading period without much professor instruction. In other words, it would have been helpful to have had instructor presence while I was analyzing my data (given that I took Psych Stats 2 years prior and it was not a stats course) to help understand what my data was telling me and answer questions. However, the professor was always available to meet outside of class, which was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs to be a bit more structured and consistent. However I liked that it gave us independence "

            "\u00a0I would recommend to psych students who need to complete a research credit for their major ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for Psych majors that need to take the research methods credit. He is a great professor who is very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0No. This class did not teach us how to write papers. We pretty much had to do everything on our own. We would be told that we would get feedback, and then it would be a few weeks before we would ever receive anything if ever. Very stressful having to figure it all out on our own and not really knowing how we are doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0It depends on what you are looking for. For someone who wants to go into research, I would not recommend this because you are required to do a lot on your own. For someone who is just trying to fulfill a requirement, this might be a good course because it is not a lot of work except for the quizzes and project. "
