            "\u00a0I learned tons of stuff from this class. The most important thing I heard was how to analyze aesthetic objects anew. Semiotics is all about isolating the thing your analyzing - whether thats a literal object, an advertisement, a play, or even the object the surrounds an aesthetic object (ie, context).\r\n\r\nThe course started with the two biggies, Saussure and Peirce, and then continued with a bunch of scholars (mostly film semioticians or people related to film semiotics as that is Francescos speciality). ",
            "\u00a0Vocabulary to discuss in such discourses; Systematic understanding of the theories. ",
            "\u00a0The course aims to give a good critical knowledge of semiotic theories and how they might be used to analyze texts, images, films, and other cultural and social phenomena. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0ok so Francesco is a bit unorthodox and there arent really any assignments in this class except a presentation and reading and active participation. But if you actually do the reading, meet with him outside of class, etc, youll get a lot out of the class. \r\n\r\nPersonally, Id prefer more time were given to discuss (in round table, seminar style format) the philosophies undergirding the readings. So instead of having Francesco make summaries at the beginnings of class, we could do that together and build a collective summary. I might also suggest putting off the presentations til the last one or two meetings and just having entire meetings devoted to student presentations. This way, everyone has the entire body of literature from the class at their disposal. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Casetti's master of knowledge in the discourse; High level of engagement he can pull out from all the students so the discussions in class are always dynamic and inspiring. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! But please dont take advantage of Francesco. Its a privilege that he trusts his students to work without hitting them over the head with meaningless assignments. If youre in the class, take it seriously, meet with Francesco, and participate in class discussions.\r\n\r\nIf you are an undergrad, feel free to take the class! Francesco fares very much about his students and will meet with you to discuss the material outside of class if you so desire. I met with him outside of class many times and am grateful that he made himself so accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great complimentary course for architecture students. Academically it is very rigorous so that the class requires high attention. I think I have exercised my brain quite enough so that I never fell asleep. Great fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested not only in Semiotics itself, but also in honing their analytical skills. The structure of the course, consisting of both theoretical readings and practical exercises can benefit both those who enroll because of their interest in Semiotics and those who mainly seek to master a more structured analytical tool.
