            "\u00a0I learned more about th me brain and its functions ",
            "\u00a0Learned about key research findings related to various aspects of cognition. developed skills related to interpreting results and understand research designs ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the intersection of cognition and its underlying anatomical processes. It was a very informative course, and very critical. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I gained an ability to critically analyze neuroscience experiments and understand their implications for the brain's function. I also developed a more comprehensive understanding of the network perspective of the brain, and became more appreciative of its complexity. "

            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures, interesting material, and overall a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive but at times hard to follow ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the teaching team was very knowledgeable and helpful. The class material was for the most forward straightforward and interesting. \r\nWeaknesses: we went over A TON of studies each class and it wasnt always clear what results / findings were the most important, biggest takeaway points with respect to the exams ",
            "\u00a0This course is well organized. A few more exams would be helpful for more students, however. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in its specificity, its development of general principles of cognitive neuroscience, and its progression towards examining higher-level cognition. It required comprehension of a great deal of detail, but for the purpose of deepening understanding, rather than just rote memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Given the small class size, I think the format of the class could have been changed to incorporate more student discussion. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, while we covered a TON of studies in class, it would have been nice to synthesize things more during class (rather than trying to figure out how things connected completely on your own). For example, talking about more big picture things at the end of some lectures would have been extremely interesting (for example, many neurons are tuned, not just in the visual cortex, but in various other areas as well. What does this reveal about how the brain is organized, what other implications does this have, etc etc).\r\n\r\nAlso, perhaps more frequent assignments that checked up on our understanding throughout the course would have been helpful. Only having 3 grades was very daunting. Additionally, because of the structure of the class, it was easy to fall behind and then cram all the information during the week before the exam, but I think additional assignments could help with that.

            "\u00a0This is a solid course. I wouldn't call it easy, but I wouldn't say its all that difficult either. One of the prerequisites is the Human Brain, and I feel like in style it is similar. There are lots of lectures with lots of bits of information you have to learn, and then the midterm and final test to see if you've learned them.\r\n\r\nProf. Chang is responsive to questions in lecture, and if he can't answer a question in lecture he will send an email to the whole class with the answer later that day. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this to anyone who is a psychology or neuroscience major. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course, but material got a bit redundant and it was hard to stay engaged. Would have preferred to stay high-level instead of constantly looking at nearly identical PSTHs and fMRIs for different brain regions ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in neuroscience or cognitive science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0This course is very study based so it might feel a bit monotonous or repetitive sometimes, but overall I enjoyed it. Steve is a great teacher and super accessible, which is one of the biggest reasons why I enjoyed cognitive neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Good course to take if youre good at and fine with memorizing results and dont want to put in a ton of work on top of that. Only 2 exams and a short paper ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It is an extremely interesting course. I feel as though everyone can benefit from it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in understanding the brain in a fuller way, and are able to handle large amounts of detail, take this course. By its end, you will feel accomplished and edified. ",
            "\u00a0If you took human brain, you might like this course. Cogneuro builds on what you learn in human brain. Each lecture is basically a summary of various papers that cover a specific topic (like attention, decision making, emotions, etc). At times, it felt like too many research papers were being thrown at you and the lectures didnt have a lot of structure, but overall I found lectures interesting. After taking this class, I felt like I could talk about the brain and how various areas interact with much more fluency.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, this course is harder than human brain. In human brain, prof. McCarthy posts his lecture videos and super organized notes online, but in this class, it's up to you to take notes. On the other hand, in human brain, exams were graded extremely harshly but grading was much more lenient in this class. You won't have much work during most weeks (the readings are very optional), but during the days before the midterm/final, you'll spend hours and hours studying (similar to human brain).\r\n\r\nIf you have Clara Colombatto as your TA in this class, celebrate because she's the best!
