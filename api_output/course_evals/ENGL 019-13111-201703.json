            "\u00a0A better understanding of the universe and myself through analysis of surprising materials such as ancient religious texts and science fiction. Also, an understanding of how powerful words are, that one book can change the course of history and dictate how millions of people for thousands of years live. ",
            "\u00a0First, this course is designated as a writing, and it definitely improved my essay. I feel that my argumentation and style are better. There were also several exciting reads about which I would not have even known if I had not taken this course. The question of the start of the Universe has been pondered for millennia, and it has led to a most respectable volume of works across all time periods. It was interesting to see the differences and the many similarities between these theological and literary accounts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop unique arguments supported by not only evidence but my own ideas as a writer. I learned so much from the texts we read, mostly because they always pushed me to step outside of my own beliefs and familiar ideas to explore new thoughts, unthinkable to me before. This class has really helped me realize what I want to do in terms of my major! ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read a text in a critical manner and develop unique, text-based arguments. Additionally, the seminar format helped me to learn to debate my ideas and those of others amongst a group of highly intelligent and creative individuals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques to write essays in away that I would actually want to read them. I also learned many different interpretations of the world and our place in it, which was cool. ",
            "\u00a0My writing, critical analysis, and deeper-level thinking skills improved significantly after taking this class. I learned a great deal about how religion plays a critical role in current-day societies and had the pleasure of reading great pieces of literature. "

            "\u00a0This course did a wonderful job with covering a field which has piqued human interest for millennia. It's self-aware that it's only an overview, and provides many additional texts that allow you to explore topics in greater depth. It also offers a wide array of creative essay prompts to choose from (and the option to come up with your own). I think that there could have been a little more time in the course given to discussion between students. Still, this, first and foremost, is a first-year course, so its format makes sense. It also would have been nice to have received a compilation of supplementary texts near the beginning of the term, though that's more of a suggestion than constructive criticism. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar-style helped shape our understanding of the texts as we, students and professor, examined works both new and familiar. The reading-load usually was not too much. We had three essays which was great because we could focus more on reading and discussing cool texts. When we did have an essay, we were assigned into groups of 3 to 4 with similar topics to read each others' first drafts. Then, a whole class was devoted to us discussing our essays in our groups, and Prof. Rogers would also give everyone his comments. Then, the final draft would be due a week later. This strategy helped us improve by doing, and it definitely helped the essay scores. There is no Final Exam, just a Final Essay (one of the three essays). No weaknesses noted. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very fair in terms of workload and the texts are a lot but also so interesting. The only thing I would offer as a  suggestion would be to post assignments more ahead of time (in terms of reading) but that was never a major issue. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was that it was largely student led especially in regards to the discussion. All the members of the class spoke and helped to build off of one another, which was much more engaging than merely taking notes. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all of the readings, and felt that we spanned a good selection of works. At some points, however, it felt like we spent a lot of time on one subject, which we could have used exploring more ideas in cosmogony. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was phenomenal overall. My only concern was that I felt the material for essay 2 lent itself better for an academic final paper than the material for essay 3. This, however, could have just been a personal opinion. I very much enjoyed the class nevertheless. "

            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in the material, you should go for it. You get to survey numerous theories surrounding the afterlife, the soul, etc. in an open, spirited atmosphere. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, the professor is incredible and the work is meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0It's a First-Year Seminar, so you should choose what interests you most (definitely take one). If various Creation Stories, Mythology, and literary science fiction interests you, then you should take the course. Prof. Rogers is great, and I do not think that the workload is a killer considering other writing classes. ",
            "\u00a0YES! take this class. It is an amazing seminar and Professor Rogers is such a great teacher. The readings are great and the papers are not bad at all- the homework is the reading and discussions on them which allow you to see how your peers interpret the texts which is pretty cool. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that true learning occurs in this environment, as opposed to a lecture setting. Additionally, I think that the content of the course helps one to question their beliefs and place in the world, helping them to form a stronger identity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course not only helped me improve my essay-writing skills, but also explored lots of fascinating ideas to do with death, gender, sexuality, purpose, and violence. I'd recommend this course to anyone who is interested in any or all of those ideas, or in seeing how humans interpret their place in the universe. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking to broaden their horizons on religion and the different ways the beginning of the universe is discussed and related to everyday life within those religions. Professor Rogers is wonderful and goes a long way to help his students to improve their writing ability and develop their critical thinking skills. He is very engaging and very fun to learn from. "
