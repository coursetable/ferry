            "\u00a0This grad course was a great way for me, an undergrad, to explore computer science research and read some very interesting papers about new work in the field. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is very shaped by its students and their interests, so we spoke about a range of research topics during the semester which I found to be particularly memorable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class is pretty unstructured, which can be difficult at times to ascertain how well I'm doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Interactive format is good. Would have been better held in a small meeting room to encourage discussion. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the reading, presentation and discussion format was quite good. My one suggestion would be to have a smaller set of readings for each class and have everyone read each reading instead of having a selection of readings to choose from. I think this would have lead to more productive discussions. "
