            "\u00a0It was a really good opportunity to learn about research that other graduate students are working on and to get feedback on my own ongoing research. It was particularly useful presenting work to people who do not work in my own area of specialisation. "

            "\u00a0It was good that it was flexible to the students' needs (i.e. we did not force meetings when nobody wanted to present), and one paper per student was appropriate. I also really liked that the course instructor facilitated inviting other professors to come in to comment on student papers and otherwise participate in the Q&A. \r\n\r\nThe main downside is that not enough students participate. If only a small group of graduate students participate, that's a lot of pressure on the same few number of graduate students to give helpful comments on every other paper. Not only would it be more useful to have more students involved for whoever is presenting at any given time, but it would also decrease the workload on any one student - making it easier to take this alongside other commitments - and it would also do a lot for the graduate academic community.
