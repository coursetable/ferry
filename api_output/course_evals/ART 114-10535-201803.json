            "\u00a0this course improved my basic drawing skills and visual thinking ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a variety of art-related topics including: line, tone, and composition. I did a lot of work with graphite and charcoal. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a number of techniques regarding conveying images through drawing. I learned about line quality, tone, shape, composition, negative space, and tons more. The class was super fun and I also gained a lot of insight into a number of artistic techniques. My drawing and observational skills improved a ton as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of drawing: line, shape, shade, perspective, and formation of a composition ",
            "\u00a0I gained better foundational drawing skills and learned more about the history of art. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing, patience, engaging with work that doesn't particularly suit my fancy. I learned to find beauty in things I hadn't before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some technical drawing skills, common materials and practice for drawing and sketching. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about art philosophically. In addition, I got to weigh the pros and cons of 2D versus 3D perspective. Originally, I thought 3D perspective was definitely a progression in art history. But through class discussions and that one great Hockney documentary, I now see the advantages the 2D has over linear perspective. ",

            "\u00a0fun to draw and meet students with different interests than yourself. particularly enjoyed going to the YUAG and taking advantage of art school resources. could be improved by more trips outside of the classroom and more drawing during class time ",
            "\u00a0This course was frustrating in a few regards. First, I felt that studio time was not efficiently used. While I greatly appreciated the opportunities to step outside the classroom to take advantage of the YUAG or YCBA, it was frustrating when class was used to find objects for a still life or just review slides of random artists' work. I then felt like there was very little time in studio to complete the volume of projects that we were assigned, forcing students to spend numerous hours outside of class in order to complete their sketchbooks, weekly assignments, and whatever large assignment was coming up. There then was a level of judgment during critiques if the drawing wasn't fully finished or complete. On that same note, there was little to no concrete feedback throughout the semester on students' performance or progress. I would have much rather focused on a few projects and been given full time to complete them, rather than rushing through a large volume of work. Finally, there seemed to be an emphasis on creativity and unorthodox composition/style that would be liberating in a higher-level art class, but just felt confusing in a class that purports itself to be a traditional approach to basic techniques. Overall not the experience that I had anticipated for an introductory art class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the great strengths of this course were the times when we drew during class. I also enjoyed learning about other artists' techniques but I did not necessarily enjoy the few classes that we spent the entire duration of the class looking at other works. I loved the Long Wharf field trip to gather materials for a still life, I loved drawing at Sterling Library, and I really enjoyed experimenting with drawing in virtual reality. Overall a great class! ",
            "\u00a0Sophia is amazing and the class gives a excellent intuitive approach to drawing, with that being said I do wish we got to learn more technical aspects of drawing ",
            "\u00a0Course was very welcoming for all majors which brought in a lot of fresh, new perspectives. I wished we worked at a faster pace and created more larger scale drawings. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be a lot more learning by doing than by discussing. There were classes when we spent most of the time talking about work and never actually doing work, and in my experience, the practice of art is way more didactic than the discussion of it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it has a loose curriculum; it really gives you a lot of creative freedom to develop your voice as an artist. I think a weakness would be the crits which are sometimes very long and yield not necessarily productive discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely wished there was more instruction in this course - the work (both homework and the drawings we did in class) primarily just consisted of drawing from observation. I had thought there would be more directed focus on learning HOW to do things like shading, proportion, etc. However, that did leave a lot of room for creative experimentation which I enjoyed. "

            "\u00a0great course but be prepared to get out of it what you put in. takes up a lot more time than you expect so be prepared to spend time on your work, ultimately rewarding ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if you would like to get back into drawing or the studio. It is certainly not for someone learning how to draw, or without any previous artistic experience. Also, be ware that this class will require a decent amount of time outside of the studio hours. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students. No matter what your starting skill level is, you'll get a lot better at drawing throughout this class. The homework is pretty relaxing, especially when you can use it to break up papers and problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class, chill and fun. If you like art (even if you arent talented) I highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It was a fun class, and also pretty interesting. The drawing projects were intriguing and the group criticisms were a great way to learn about different ways of interpreting and valuing art. Overall I gained quite a bit! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, whether I beginner (like myself) or already an artist this class gives you the skills necessary to improve your drawings ",
            "\u00a0I will always recommend to anyone to practice drawing and art. I think the choice of which class one takes is in some ways irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0This class, specifically, I would not recommend. While advertised as being an introduction to drawing, the teacher and TA heavily focused on abstract \"meaning\" and expression, and often neglected to cover basic technical skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely a great way to learn about basic drawing without getting boggled down by the technical side of the visual arts. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a course that helps you get better at drawing simply by giving you dedicated time each week to do it, then take this. If youre looking for someone to teach you how to draw, I dont think this is the course to take. "
