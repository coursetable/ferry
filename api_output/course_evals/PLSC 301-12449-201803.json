            "\u00a0A much better understanding of the multiple changes that Greece had undergone over the span of a couple centuries! I really got to engage with a variety of material that was very well curated to the subject matter of the week! I now have a more comprehensive scope of ancient political systems. ",
            "\u00a0We look at Ancient Greece's development through an awesome variety of disciplines: history, political theory, a lot of orations, and a little theatre. I feel like I have an excellent understanding now of Athens' sociopolitical life in particular all the way up to Alexander. The papers are what you make of them, and writing them helped me come to a very deep understanding of the material. Prof. Cammack is also open to finding a prompt that particularly suits your interests. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the development of Ancient Greek politics, and, in particular, the trends within classical political thought. Topics we explored included citizenship, lawmaking, imperialism, and democratic theory. This encompassed learning how to read Ancient Greek texts. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the development of democracy in Ancient Athens and Ancient Greece history (mostly as it pertained to Athens). I also improved on my writing skills quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to closely examine Ancient Greek texts, make sophisticated inferences from source material, and choose a topic befitting of a classics paper. ",
            "\u00a0The close examination of political texts from Ancient Greece was paired with intense and meticulous discussion in class, focused on broader themes of the texts. The opportunity to write two essays allowed for closer examination of many of these questions. ",
            "\u00a0A broad treatment of various topics in Ancient Greek history, with a focus on the Classical period. While there is a  focus on the political development of Greek cities, we also focused on the economic and social phenomena that influenced and were in turn influenced by political systems. The course is more of a broad overview of various themes and topics, such as mixed constitutions and the nature of empire, rather than a focused study of a given area of interest. With that said, there are certainly themes that resonate throughout the course. \r\nThe course not only offers a valuable opportunity to compare different forms and conceptions of government in Ancient Greece but also an opportunity to examine topics of interest in depth. Professor Cammack gives students a lot of latitude in choosing essay topics, and even the focus of weekly discussion posts. There is a baseline amount of understanding you might gain/reinforce if you have read this material before, but you'll definitely enhance your understanding of areas that you choose to focus on the most. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to read and understand a lot of the historiographic sources we have for ancient greece. "

            "\u00a0Loved the reading and structure of this course. Professor Cammack is a fantastic conversation moderator, and she did a great job structuring a productive syllabus that was broken into logical chunks.\r\nI am unsure of how much I loved the reading responses each week, but I think that it was cool that she could draw on them to bring people into the conversation! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include an excellently crafted syllabus, an awesome professor who provides good feedback, and (in my opinion) a fun historical period. Workload is very low: do the readings and write a brief completion-grade response each week. Beyond that, write 25 pages over the term. I can't really think of a weakness, but I suppose if you don't find the material interesting it'd be pretty awful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include the material itself and Professor Cammack. Ancient Greek political thought is fascinating, only partly for what it reveals about the present day. Interpreting in rigorous detail the developments of city-states and the progression of authors' interpretations allowed me to gain a deeper hold on concepts we invoke flippantly today, such as sovereignty, justice, and law. In addition, Professor Cammack is incredibly dedicated to students' learning; her discussion-leading in the classroom is effective, and she makes herself incredibly available for office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are definitely Prof. Cammack and the readings! Prof. Cammack was always very lively and clearly passionate about the material. She always made sure to provide historical context for the day's readings, which was a great help for understanding the material. Further, she always made herself available to her students for assistance throughout the writing process. She clearly cares about her students, which made the classroom environment comfortable and seeking help easy. Around midterms (or maybe a little before), she asked the class for anonymous feedback for improving the course and she definitely incorporated it going forward, which was nice to see as it shows she really cares.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd recommend, if possible, is adding a draft component to the writing process. While it was great that she would read the first page of our papers, it would be nice to have more comprehensive feedback before turning in a final draft. However, given that the main focus of this class is not to improve one's writing, it is understandable if this is not a reasonable suggestion. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Cammack is wonderful! She is an especially gifted lecturer when talking off of the cuff. My only suggestion would be a bit more summary and historical overview for some weeks. I got so much more out of the class during the weeks we had short historical/contextual overviews at the beginning of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Cammack's deep knowledge of the texts and history of the time period. She often referred to the Greek text or commented on how specific translations could alter the meaning of a word or concept. One weakness of the course perhaps was the mix of undergraduate and graduates, which sometimes led to an uneven discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strengths of this course are the material and Professor Cammack; the material is engaging enough on its own, while Professor Cammack does an excellent job of guiding the reading and discussion. Apart from that, I would say that the reading can be a lot at times and that it is hard to learn as much from the reading during those weeks, especially when we don't have the opportunity to discuss all of it. ",
            "\u00a0I think Daniela is a great professor that is really good at picking out material for us to read and encouraging discussion. Really the only thing that I thought was a bit weak about the class was the fact that a lot of the students were hesitant to participate in discussion, which Daniela did a lot to try to foster and I think at this point was mostly just up to the class.

            "\u00a0YES! Much of Western political thought is based on Ancient Greece, and it is SO sad that we don't study it in greater depth. This course will give you an ability to think about mixed political systems, the pros/cons of democracy, the dangers of imperialism, and the role of orators/demagogues. Wow. Who doesn't want that? Also, Prof. Cammack is superhuman, and we do not deserve her  if she is teaching the course, you MUST take it! ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this class. Finally, a young professor who isn't uptight or self-important. She's very good about getting to know each of her students, and she'll do what she can to meet regularly about your paper assignments. Must take if you're at all interested in this era. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in political theory and know a bit of Ancient Greek history/language, then absolutely. This class will inarguably add to your knowledge of the archaic and classical periods, and it will reveal profound trends in the development of political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Prof. Cammack is a great teacher who is clearly invested in her students. Even if you are not very well-versed in the material compared to others (i.e. don't have a lot of exposure to Classics), she makes this class approachable to everyone. Additionally, the amount of support in the writing process makes sure that you will never feel lost. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially because Professor Cammack is so engaging and the class is structured so that it's friendly to people without a background in Classics. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student seeking to familiarize themselves with Ancient Greek political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is a hidden gem, and I was surprised there wasn't initially more demand for the class. The material is fascinating, Professor Cammack is great, and it counts as a writing credit as well. Professor Cammack always makes herself available to discuss the readings and essays outside of class, and is great about giving feedback. Regardless of whether you want an introductory overview to Classical Greece, or are looking to delve deeper and examine it from a new perspective, this class is superb. The reading can be a little bit much at times, but you can probably get away with reading *most* of it during those weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I really loved the course, I had never taken a classics course at Yale and I thought this one was in-depth, I learned a lot without being overwhelmed, and the discussions were fun! "
