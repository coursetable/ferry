            "\u00a0My Spanish writing and comprehension skills improved a lot! I hadn't taken a Spanish course in a few years, so this was a good way to ease back into it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about legal systems in different Hispanic countries and the differences between these. ",

            "\u00a0This class, especially the final essay, improved my ability to think about difficult/abstract concepts in Spanish and to do research in Spanish. I also learned a lot about how to properly talk about the law in Spanish (including vocabulary) and some basic legal theory. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of general information on legal concepts I had no prior exposure to, from elections, to citizenship, to supreme court nominations. We focused on a good amount of real world examples (the majority from Latin America), and had the opportunity to give interesting presentations and write some interesting essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to listen and speak to Spanish at a much quicker speed. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about legal concepts in Spanish that had a wide range of topics. We were able to do this through discussion, reading, writing, and listening to the lectures by Professor Carreras. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various legal institutions in Latin America, topical current events of global significance, and international mechanisms of justice. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting content, relevant to my life! Going to class was often fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: size (didn't get much practice speaking) ",
            "\u00a0It'd be amazing to have another class that is like a second part of this one ",
            "\u00a0This class could be improved by more student engagement and participation in class rather than lecturing. More group work should be incorporated. ",
            "\u00a0Overall it was great, but it would be better if there were more opportunities to speak in class ",
            "\u00a0I dont know how this could be changed, but it seems like a lot of people took the class because it wasnt a lot of work, which ended up with a lot of people not being engaged and made for a poor class environment. However, the material was super interesting and it was nice to be able to learn without the stress of worrying about an insane number of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think the presentations could have used a little more visuals, rather than just text/writing on the black board. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a fun course however it is easy to tune out given that you are never asked to know the material covered in the class lectures. This is a result of the lack of tests for this course. This could be improved by either asking the students to know the class material in some form or other, or having the essay or presentation topics relate in some way to the course material. That being said the class was still enjoyable and stress free. ",
            "\u00a0I like lecture so it was good and interactive too ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging and interesting, not that much work allows you to focus on just learning the material ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: won't push you to speak if you don't want to. Strengths: can be as engaging as you make it to be. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class could be improved by having more well planned out material, at times it seemed like there was not much of a overarching plan for what material would be taught from week to week. ",

If you are passionate about social issues/law and improving/maintaining your Spanish skills I think it is a good idea to take this course. It was more chill than the average course, which was much appreciated! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I'd take this class 100 more times if I could ",

            "\u00a0Somewhat. I really did enjoy the material, but the general class culture of disengagement was a big drawback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Carreras is incredibly helpful, knowledgable and nice. The content of the course itself was also super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course to practice writing/speaking spanish while learning about political science-related issues about both latin american countries, and the world as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was extremely interesting, and I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student. It is very stress-free and not too difficult however it is easy to get distracted and or tune out. You will get the most out of the class if you stay engaged and participate in class. Mercedes Carreras is a super nice teacher and enjoys teaching the class and so engagement is the best way to get something out of both the class and her teaching. ",

            "\u00a0As a non native Spanish speaker this was a great class to feel challenged in with regard to listening, writing and reading. There were chances to speak but just not as much. Very manageable workload and professor Carreras is amazing "
