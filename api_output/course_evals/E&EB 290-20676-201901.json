            "\u00a0Learned a lot about comparative anatomy and about how to study outside of class when there was no structure other than exams. ",
            "\u00a0A huge amount of insight on comparative anatomy and the evolution of traits. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the evolution and development of vertebrates. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent survey course in anatomy from the micro- to macro-scale. I feel much more confident in my understandings of comparative biology and evolutionary anatomical relationships. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount of anatomy. Since this is comparative anatomy, it covers both human anatomy and the anatomy of every other animal group, in addition to the evolution between these different species and the development of each anatomical structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to understand trends in evolution and how it impacts the similar or different anatomy of vertebrates. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good deal of in-depth knowledge about comparative anatomy and the evolution of different morphological traits. "

            "\u00a0The material can be interesting and the lectures are fairly clear. However, the exams (2 midterms, 1 50% final) did not facilitate student learning well. Basically, there was nothing structured to do except for them and then it was a total guess as to what you were expected to know for the first one because of this. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it not always clear when learning about anatomy that is sexually dimorphic what sex we're learning about. It seems we sometimes learn about males and females aren't even mentioned. For example, the correlation between stress levels/hormones and ability to become aroused to have sex. From the context, it was clear this applied to erection of the penis, but the absence of any mention of women's sexual arousal in relation to these hormones as confusing, as if they don't exist. It would be nice if both genders had equal representation in the science of anatomy. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and TAs were all great, but ideally there would be some other kind of assignments/checkpoints in the class besides just two midterms and a final. ",
            "\u00a0The information was so interesting! I think some practice problems before the first midterm would have really helped a lot, though there is so much information that its hard to process without homework or some sort of practice. The lab helped with that, but the courses dont completely line up. ",
            "\u00a0This course has A LOT of material to memorize for exams, though Professor Wagner curves the exams mercifully and the TAs gave great review sessions beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was incredibly interesting so even though it was frustrating that it was all memorization, I enjoyed what I was learning and didn't mind all of the memorization that it involved. I think there should be problem sets of some sort throughout the semester that may help students keep up with the information. Since the exams cover a lot of memorization of concepts and details, maybe these problem sets could be more conceptual. A class with only three exams of shear memorization for a grade is incredibly challenging, and I think having more assignments would increase learning and retention. Additionally, the class is currently set up as three 50 minute lectures a week. These lectures involve very minimal class participation, even though it was a relatively small class. I think encouraging more questions (I often had no idea what the professor was talking about but felt like everyone else did so I didn't ask any questions even though later other students told me they were also incredibly confused) and class participation in general would break up the monotony of lectures periodically and help to explain the material. ",
            "\u00a0I found the lectures to be excellent in terms of how they were organized. I left the course feeling confident in my anatomy knowledge and ability to understand the function and reason behind different forms. Another strength was the TAs: Lorena and Daniel. They were so helpful and knowledgable. \r\n\r\nTo improve the course, I would add quizzes to ensure students keep up with the material and see where they could improve before the exam. ",
            "\u00a0The course has no assignments, which is great, but means that all grading is based on exams, causing exams to be very stressful. It would help to have reviews throughout the semester or resources that tie the lectures together as a lot of material is covered in a relatively short time. The lectures material is also not entirely clear about what is important. "

            "\u00a0Not if you don't have to. Definitely not the most interesting or fulfilling course out there. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are prepared to sit down and memorize/try and understand A LOT of information. A LOT. ",
            "\u00a0Basically the same level of difficulty as physio, without the curve. Stay away! I wish there was a lot more to help us learn the material, like problem sets, quizzes, section, and practice tests. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fun class, and it was not too focused on the nitty gritty of anatomical naming, but rather on overall trends, which I appreciated. It required quite a bit of studying to internalize, but I would say was less work than physio. Very valuable material as a premed I think a primer on anatomy and gives context for different processes. ",
            "\u00a0A great introduction to comparative anatomy ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly difficult because of the amount of information it covers. However, I thought it was incredibly interesting and loved learning about everything! I would definitely recommend this class with Gunter Wagner to someone that is interested in science but otherwise it will just be a bunch of information that is very specific and frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this to anyone interested in medicine, whether human or veterinary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as it is an incredibly interesting class although the exams can be stressful and require discipline to study continuously throughout each week. "
