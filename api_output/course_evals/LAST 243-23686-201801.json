            "\u00a0This course helped strengthen my Spanish language skills, particularly that of my written Spanish. Before taking this course, I had felt confident in my spoken Spanish, but not so much in my written, which was ridden with grammar errors and incorrect gender agreement. After taking this course, I feel much more confident in my written Spanish, as well as my spoken. ",

            "\u00a0You learn so much about grammar, and you leave the class feeling like your Spanish has improved dramatically. The downside is that there is A LOT of work, and it often feels like busy work. Also, the exams are hard to do exceedingly well at since there are so many small mistakes that you can make. ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0it is very involved and causes you to thing hard about concepts you are not comfortable with. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the small class size, the constant homework to reinforce class discussion, the availability of the professor. Weaknesses: the course is fairly fast-paced and builds off of previous material, so it can be easy to get lost. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of assignments and sometimes they can be a bit too much. ",

            "\u00a0If you are interested in improving your written Spanish or are interested in taking higher-level Spanish courses, I highly recommend taking this course as a foundation for future use of the language. It provides you with the necessary building blocks of Spanish to be able to practice the language and become more fluent while using correct grammar. ",
