            "\u00a0I got to understand real life situations that I didnt even know existed ",
            "\u00a0This class starts with a more theoretical discussion of corruption, but then selves into specific ways in which corruption manifests itself. You realize that if you can think of a problem in the world (terrorism, illicit trade, etc.), corruption is involved. You learn who all of the potential stakeholders are and how pervasive corruption is. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided with a great overview of how corruption schemes function worldwide. I personally enjoyed gaining a new perspective of problems, especially those in my regaln and in my country (Mexico). The different backgrounds of students enriched the conversation and created a dynamic where we could all exchange thoughts and experiences, all of this led by Professor Dezenski. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely gained an in-depth knowledge into different forms of corruption and developed my analytic writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course was an extensive survey of different types of corruption (ie. institutional, political, corporate, etc.) that take place in different markets and sectors. It was a great balance of breadth and depth, with each week delving into new waters that drew from a progression of themes throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0A solid introduction into how corruption factors into the global political and financial systems. It helped explain real world scandals and real world problems which is a refreshing change from some theoretical liberal arts courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic theories of how corruption works, and potential solutions. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a wonderful introduction to the topic of corruption and succeeded in painting corruption (broadly defined) not as an ancillary issue in the field of development or of governance more generally but as an issue of chief importance. For a development major, this was a much needed deep dive into a topic that typically does not get too much concerted attention given its importance in fortifying developmental paths. Being exposed to different areas for reform and viewing the state system as one driven by incentives was very impactful for me.\r\n\r\nOutside of the syllabus, Dezenski's diverse experience in the public and private sector along with her willingness to serve as a mentor to her students allowed me to get an insider's perspective on work in a variety of fields all touched by corruption as an issue. Further, her connections are incredibly impressive, and her guest lecturers' perspectives were absolutely fascinating. Having the CEO of a major multinational talk to us about what it took to turn his company around after one of the most pervasive corruption cases in history is just one example of how impactful these perspectives can be. ",
            "\u00a0I developed greater knowledge on how corruption is intertwined with many of the political and societal problems currently present on a global scale. "

            "\u00a0It could be improved by having less class discussion and more teaching, but the selection of topics was perfect ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Probably a little more reading each week than anyone would actually do all of. Prof Dezenski was a great teacher and had such interesting insight, brought in really great guest lecturers. I thought she was great. ",
            "\u00a0The course is an important course for students to take because corruption is a serious governance problem. However, the class was not structured in the best way. It is a survey course, but it tries to cover too much. The class is not especially well organized and the syllabus could use an overhaul. Discussions were also not very well structured or facilitated. ",
            "\u00a0Better guidance so students don't deviate from topic of class. ",
            "\u00a0The course's final assignment was overly cumbersome. I think a shorter final assignment would have been beneficial. The readings did not always connect to our class discussions which was frustrating considering there was a significant amount of reading to do for the course. Professor Dezenski was incredibly knowledgeable and brought her personal experience into the course which gave you a real insight into the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: diversity of topics, the professor is an expert, guest speakers were great additions to seeing other perspectives, readings tended to be interesting, dynamicism of the class, overall absolutely stellar\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: lengthy readings at time, wish we could have met more ",
            "\u00a0The readings were engaging but class discussion sometimes was a little lacking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent coverage of broad range of corruption topics.\r\nWeaknesses: Reading list was too big. We were never able to cover all the readings.\r\nSuggestions: Reduce the reading list to only the most essential articles. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings were interesting, contemporary, and relevant. Guest lectures were eye-opening. Country presentations and final project provided ample space to really dig deep into a particular topic within the field. In fact, while the final project was very long, it was one of my favorite projects I've undertaken so far at Yale.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is so much to cover in the field of corruption, making it easy to get behind on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I think while overall it was very good, there was a little bit of redundancy during some of the lectures. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it because corruption is something that everyone should know of, qnd the professor makes the course highly interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes!. See above. ",
            "\u00a0I think if the syllabus gets restructured, yes, but as it is right now the course tries to cover too much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! What stuck with me the most is that, even thought the concept of corruption remains ambiguous - specifically regarding the distinct criminal codes and domestic normativities - the solutions to prevent it and avoid it are not so far to achieve. Professor Dezenski emphasized on the importance of being creative and critical when it came to designing solutions or proposals to fight corruption. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course, however, warn that it does have a significant workload. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend. Best/favorite class I've taken at Yale thus far. Perfect combination of theory and application, and it allows you to both explore your interests and learn new subjects within the frameworks provided. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of global seminars Id say this is a solid one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Corruption is an important topic which not enough people recognise. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any development student looking to peer into corruption as something beyond a footnote in the field. I also think it is great for upperclassmen looking for career direction or advice from an accomplished woman in the realm of international affairs. ",
            "\u00a0I would to anybody, particularly anyone in Global Affairs or interested in IR that focuses on security studies-- this class really shows why wheel greasing or lack of focus systemic corruption issues  aren't necessary evils but consequential problems when attempting to securitize a state.
