Qingshi (our TA) helped teach us the LCA program \"OpenLCA\" that our professor didn't even know how to use, even though we were responsible for producing a final project with it.  The professor just read from one giant PPT for the entire class, and readings (optional) didn't help our class understanding. "

The actual model building and analysis in life cycle assessment were relatively easy in comparison to the challenges of a) choosing a realistic project, given b) the difficulty in finding data on manufacturing processes.

Geared as it was for beginners in the technique, the lack of organization, disconnection between the conceptual and technical aspects of the class, arbitrary nature of some of the assignments, and inscrutable evaluation criteria frustrated any efforts to make this an effective introduction to LCA techniques. \r\n\r\nFrankly, I finished this class crestfallen. I have a strong desire to learn LCA techniques and, if another instructor comes on in the future, may elect to take the course again. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures and software tutorials are completely disjointed. It seems that there was little effort to harmonize the two components, and for me the lectures ended up not being very useful. Although the content of the lectures was informative and on the cutting edge of life cycle assessment studies, we were not able to translate this knowledge into our projects, because of the data limitations I previously espoused on in the previous question. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the professor is a nice guy.  He also gives good feedback on homework assignments, for about 50% of them.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Homework assignments had nothing to do with LCA work half the time, were outlined poorly, graded unforgivingly, and were essentially busy work.\r\n-The teaching style the professor employed was literally reading from a PPT.  Unforgivably poor pedagogy.\r\n-The final project had to be instructed by the TA 100% outside of the classroom.\r\n-The final project dataset was delivered 4 weeks before the due date.\r\n-The criteria for the final project was delivered the week before the due date.  Seriously?\r\n-Check canvas - the average HW grades dipped below 59% at times, and the professor blamed the students.\r\n-The professor moved classes to facilitate his personal schedule over student preferences. \r\n-This class warrants a tuition refund.
