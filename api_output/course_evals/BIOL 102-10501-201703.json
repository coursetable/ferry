Professor Mooseker is extremely intelligent and cares a lot about his students, but does not always seem to understand that we do not understand. I had to learn how to follow his lectures before I could learn the lectures themselves. Once I could focus on the lectures I learned how to interpret experiments and data sets from the experiments. By doing this we learned about the cell membrane in a way that is not just strict memorization. ",

I knew many of the different facts about cell biology from BIO 102 before actually taking the course, but this class helped me understand how those facts came to be accepted and helped me understand the theoretical and experimental background to these facts so that I now not only know them, but understand them.

It was also a good introduction to begin absorbing and learning a lot of information since there are only 2 exams, so you need to be able to know what's going on\r\n\r\nHelpful if you have had some biology laboratory experience!

In this class, not only did we gain the tools to perform our own experiments, but we learned about some of the greatest experiments throughout history, and what they proved. Along the way, I also learned a great deal more about the individual components of cells: Endoplasmic Reticulum, Golgi, Lysosome, Cell Membrane, Membrane Proteins, Actin Filaments and Microtubules. There was a large amount of material covered in this class, but it was manageable and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The most useful skill I developed from this course was being able to read and understand journal articles exponentially better than I could before.

            "\u00a0This foundation course in Cell Biology was an extremely impactful course for me in enhancing my analytical skills and critical thinking when applied to biological situations. Instead of focusing on what are considered the biological facts of cells and membranes, this course looked at the experimental techniques that were used in order to make and theorize these systems. I found that the lessons were very engaging and personal as we were asked to think and recreate experimental methods rather than simply memorize the ideas, and it made my learning process much more meaningful. ",

I came into the class thinking it was the hardest shit ever and I left thinking it was easy. It took a lot of hard work, don't get me wrong, but the skillset I acquired far outshines the effort I had to put into the class--100% worth it, especially for anyone wanting to go into the natural sciences in any degree. ",

I really liked how the course focused not just on facts, but on thinking more generally and having to think about broad concepts, like a scientist. I also learned a huge amount about cell biology. But like I said, I think the most important skills I gained were problem solving and thinking about concepts and thinking critically, not just repeating and memorizing facts. ",

            "\u00a0I felt that the class was moved at a pace where it was difficult to understand class material. As the class progressed, I was forced to learn the material on my own time. This was a new skill, as I had never had to review recently-learned class material outside of class. This helped me be more proactive in learning concepts that I didn't understand during lecture. When I learned how to better succeed in the course, which was during the second half of this module, I recognized that I had to put more effort and begin studying for the final much farther in advance than I had ever before for courses in high school. This made me learn the material at such a deeper level, and I felt much more secure in my knowledge of the material. Following the final, I feel very confident in my understanding of the second half of the module's curriculum. ",

I learned a lot about membrane composition, structure, and function, as well as numerous cell mechanisms from protein synthesis to muscle contraction. I learned so much from working in the PSets in groups and in the review sessions. The fact that the class was so challenging is also what made it a valuable learning experience, because it required constant effort and discussion to stay on top of the material. ",

Moreover, I learned to read research papers and discuss them in a journal club format. ",

            "\u00a0The best part of the course was Julie Park; I think I spent an average of 6 hours a week at enrichment, peer tutoring, and taking advantage of all the resources she put in place. I believe the professor really cares about learning, and I really appreciated the props he would bring in to illustrate key concepts, but I felt that he rushed through the material and often it was very difficult to understand what he was saying. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good at pushing its students. The main weakness is that the teacher is not good at explaining most of the information, which is essential given that most of the info is completely new. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class was not conducive to my learning styles. The professor only used scientific jargon and never simplified anything. He would ask these questions that we were expected to know, but never gave us the learning tool to answer them. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is the whistles that were passed out at the beginning of the course. I admire the purpose of them and they seemed to be helpful but for much of the course I was just so lost that I was afraid to blow the whistle because I could not even formulate a question of what I did not know. The class size really can't be helped because of the huge demand for the class, but having a smaller class would have really benefited me. I would have been more free to ask questions. A strength of the class is that the peer tutors and Teaching Fellows sit among the class in lecture. It really helped me to converse with the peer tutor, Alon Millet, during lecture and ask questions so I didn't get completely lost because of one small detail. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the teaching staff's knowledge of and experience with the material, and flexibility concerning being asked questions and slowing down to comprehensively teach material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses include the organization of the course material. Sometimes, it feels like a lot of information at once. ",
            "\u00a0For those who really enjoy biology, the way the course is set up caters to those with a great deal of interest and knowledge of the subject. For others, however, it can be difficult to feel like it's worthwhile to actually engage yourself. Even though there are enrichment sessions, that doesn't prevent the actual lecture from being troublesome. ",
            "\u00a0It is interesting with interesting material. I like the mid-term and the final. I think the peer tutors this semester were AWESOME! I think the class is too long and no matter how many demos are done or interactive questions are included, it is just hard for students to stay attentive all though the lecture and the way the class is, if you miss one part of the lecture, then you are kind of lost for the rest of it. The whistles are also a good addition I think. It would be cool to have lab visits and see in practicality what we are talking about in theory. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies entirely in the way it makes students think and forces them to absorb information and apply it instead of regurgitate it. The organization of the course was vexing. Although the professor encouraged us to ask him to slow down, we often didn't, and he zipped along covering 70-80 powerpoint slides in 75 minutes every class. The sheer volume of information was paralyzing at times, however his problem sets and exams were very fair and frankly, enjoyable, once you got the hang of it. While this is a minor suggestion, I would request that in future semesters when the powerpoints are posted online they are labelled not just by lecture but by content e.g. Unit 4-5.5 ",
            "\u00a0I honestly think the class time is too long, it's hard to be engaged throughout and actively learn over the course of 75min. I also wish we'd gotten more feedback on our tests, I didn't always fully understand why I had points taken off. ",
            "\u00a0This course was like drinking from a fire hose, but in a good way. The material is interesting and lectures/sections were engaging. More defined test prep would be helpful. We had no practice questions aside from the P-sets. These were helpful, but did not expose us to many types of things we were expected to decipher. Clearer explanations of mistakes on psets and the midterm would have helped. ",
            "\u00a0The content on cellular functions was wonderful and the demonstrations were great. Real-world applications and pictures being a part of the class were good because often biology classes miss out on that real-world aspect. I loved learning about the experiments behind these concepts, it definitely helped my critical thinking skills.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year we learned a lot about experimental methods and had to know specifics regarding the methods - i.e. reagents. I wish this had been more conceptual, for example not having to know the reagents for density-gradient sedimentation -- it's hard to remember if we haven't applied them in the lab. Generally, learning about these tools was very helpful for the class though.\r\n\r\nThe whistles were great, but I always felt too awkward to blow my whistle in front of everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Professor goes a bit fast ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest weaknesses is that lecture goes so fast. At the same time, I understand that there's a lot of material to cover, but if your biology background isn't fairly strong, it can be difficult to keep up. One of the best things about this course was enrichment, just going over the material in more streamlined fashion every week was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The content of BIO 102 is very comprehensive and is fascinating. Professor Mooseker does a great job of explaining the different experimental methodologies used and their importance. The sections are also well organized and improved through the semester, each covering a different research paper relevant to the course content. This constant interplay of theory and experimentation has been really helpful in allowing me to fully understand this content. \r\n\r\nThe course does go very quickly, and because of the way in which questions are structured, it is sometimes hard for students to fully grasp a concept before the lecturer has already moved on and is discussing something different. The whistles work for the students who are confident enough to ask questions as they think of them, but many students need more time to process the content before they think of questions or they realize they don't understand something.\r\n\r\nIn that vein, I think this class would really benefit from a flipped classroom style of learning. Having prerecorded lectures would make this course more organized by forcing the teaching staff to know exactly what they will cover before the lectures, and it would allow the students to be more productive in their questions during class. The Sunday review sessions were often much clearer and more helpful than the actual lectures for me because of how focused the questions were, given that the material had already been covered at least once. ",
            "\u00a0It would be better if there were more clear piazza answers/questions - a lot of the time answers were not monitored or made the material more confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mooseker is very knowledgeable, but is not the best at communicating this knowledge to students in a easy-to-understand and interesting way. Lectures were very boring and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I would make it possible to somehow have more hands on experience since the content is very very experiment orientated ",
            "\u00a0The Sunday afternoon review sessions were very helpful to stay on track with the course. I also felt that toolkit sections at the beginning of the course were useful later on in understanding experiments. The class does mover very fast, but the questions asked help slow the pace and make it easier to keep up in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much information from the class, but I do feel like the material went too in depth for an introductory class. At times, it was extremely hard to follow because the material was so dense, to the point where 90% of the material extended far beyond AP biology. The peer tutors were really great though, so it's really helpful to attend all of their sessions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was taught poorly by the professor since I couldn't seem to learn any material from attending lectures or any of his review sessions. I disliked how the focus of the discussion sections was on papers rather than the content of the class, but I understand the importance of that exposure and the relation to the material. I liked the enrichment sections and was able to learn much better from her than from the professor. I also liked the idea of the red questions and the whistles that allowed us to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the fact that Professor Mooseker really wants to help us learn the foundations of biology. Unfortunately, there are many weaknesses to this course, as with the entire intro bio sequence here at Yale. First of all, the content that was tested upon relied heavily upon research knowledge; this is fine in the sense that we are supposed to develop those skills in this course. However, people who had done research before coming to Yale had a huge advantage over everyone else, making it very hard to do well if you didn't have research experience before Yale. The other issue in this course is that there is very little support and clarity from the teaching staff. Everything is always very shrouded in mystery, no one wants to give an answer to simple questions about test material or content, and some of the TSs are not great. It was a frustrating course to go through because it seems like the course is entirely designed to trick students and make them dislike biology. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely covers a large volume of high-level material, but it can seem at times that some of the more basic material is either skipped or taken for granted. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths= Professor is extremely knowledgeable \r\nWeaknesses= too much information and not enough time to process it. Large lecture hall makes it difficult to truly understand information ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes Prof. Mooseker will go fast over the slides and not explain things too in depth, which can lead to a lot of people being lost in lecture, but for the most part, if you focus for the lecture, follow the slides as they progress, and \"whistle\" (they hand out whistles at the beginning of 102 so you can signal when you have a question, and Prof. Mooseker is very receptive to questions), then you'll be good and on top of things for the time being. Prof. Mooseker is very receptive on questions in lecture; sometimes it's difficult to hear him though; Prof. Park is amazing when it comes to discussion section and enrichment; Prof. Mooseker holds review sessions once every week to go over material and that is very helpful for refreshing the material - definitely recommend going to those if possible; also really liked having constant exposure to primary source papers - very helpful in knowing how to analyze and interpret figures and text ",
            "\u00a0The course is really difficult because the teacher goes super fast in class, it's hard to follow what he's talking about, and then the tests are really hard applications of what we learned. Discussion sections were good though. This could be improved by going slowly and organizing the information better in class. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout delivery of the material, there was consistent emphasis on experimental strategies, so most concepts learned were grounded in practical applications. I think this is a good place in the intro bio sequence to introduce us to more rigorous, and less theoretical, biology.\r\n\r\nHowever, lectures could sometimes be too fast-paced, an abrupt change from lectures in BIOL 101 which were delivered more slowly and carefully. While it is possible to catch on a few lectures in, perhaps the first few lectures could be slower, to allow students to process information before moving on.\r\n\r\nWhile Piazza was a useful learning tool, particularly to see what questions my coursemates had about the material, the sheer number of questions in the buildup to exams was not ideal for gaining information. There could be come mechanism for separating what are agreed upon as good questions, from those that demand explanations about material on the slides. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-formatted, professor was brilliant, TAs are helpful\r\n\r\nweaknesses: some TAs told students more info than others, it became unfair, too many slides happened in 1 lecture, sometimes terms were said without being explained (definitions could flash on the slides), too big of room ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class, while very difficult, gives students the time and space to learn the material. Whether it be in class, in section, or in peer tutoring, it is possible to understand the material in depth. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough people take advantage of the peer tutoring sessions. Those things got me through the course, and I think everyone could benefit from those hours. ",
            "\u00a0Much covered during the course but at times it felt as if it was too much that was covered. Although it was fine to ask questions during lecture, it feels as if not enough were asked of individuals, myself included, did not wish to seem inferior compared to peers who were fully knowledgeable on the topic at hand. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in that the material is all pretty new and very interesting. Also, the instructor and peer tutors and course director and TAs are all very accessible and very invested in student learning. I also find that the homework practice sets are really helpful and engaging for student understanding. The only \"weakness\" of this class is that the material is super fast-paced. We cover hundreds of slides every lecture (and basically all of the slides have important details on them). However, in retrospect, I feel that I've gained a lot of knowledge from this course as well. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was very well put together compared to my other courses. There were helpful TAs and peer tutors, and Professor Mooseker made it clear that he was always willing to be flexible with the class. He used whistles to allow students to stop the lecture and ask questions; this was the most helpful tool by far, and it made the lecture load more manageable. The homeworks were difficult but not unmanageable, and they didn't take hours. Also, the peer tutors were FANTASTIC!!! They provided extra practice and homework help when needed. Biology 102 was a very well-run class! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was how it taught me to \"think like a scientist.\" \r\nWeaknesses: it was very difficult to pay attention during the lectures. An hour and 15 minutes is a long time, and I think I would have been much more engaged if there were 3 50 minute lectures a week instead of two 75 minute ones. Also, it would have been nice to have weekly quizzes as in Bio 101, as that would have motivated me to stay on top of the material a lot better and thus be able to connect with what was happening in class instead of it all going over my head. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very fast-paced. It would have been helpful to slow down at certain points, especially since it's hard to process a lot of these concepts, the vast majority of which I had no background in. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very engaging course with a lot of material, but I did not find it overwhelming. Everything that was taught felt meaningful and the way we incorporated biological ideas into our toolkit of applied knowledge made my learning much more deep and impactful than I expected. If there was anything that could change, I think the discussion sessions where we analyzed peer review papers in groups should have group discussion of the entire paper prioritized rather than small groups focusing on one figure and sharing their presentation with the class, as I would understand the part I presented very well but have a more cursory knowledge of the other portions of the paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has the potential to be amazing. The problem is that this course is SOOOO much material that if one thing is missed then it is hard to keep up. I believe that this course should be filmed so students can go back and watch the lecture. I also think that this course is way too much to be only a half a credit. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class was great for people who learn really well from slides, but lacked other means of teaching. I also think that sometimes Professor Mooseker assumed we had a better knowledge of the material than we did in actuality. \r\nI wish that there were better review sessions especially for the first test because I didn't know what to expect. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very specific. I did not really like the lecturing style. Also, the material is highly tailored, so you have to be interested in certain aspects of cell biology to actually like the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers a lot of material and teaches us to problem solve in the field of biology by ourselves which was great. However, he covered too much material too fast and it was really hard to keep up with the material. Without enrichment, I could not have passed this class. ",
            "\u00a0The possible one strength of this class is teaching students how to read primary literature. The weaknesses, however, far outnumber the strengths. The lecture material is thrown at you at such a fast rate that it's hard to digest in any way unless you've already learned how scientists discovered basic principles of cell biology. In addition, there was much less structure than in BIOL101, where certain topics were scheduled to be taught on certain days. BIOL102, by comparison, feels all over the place. The lecture slides are much less helpful and lecturer even more so. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very informative but a great challenge. In my opinion, it is quite inaccessible to students without an extensive biology background. Without enrichment, I would have possibly failed the assessments. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course made it very easy to learn the material, as long as you did work outside of class as well. The concepts covered were very well explained, and I think this course was great about making sure the concepts were understood by everyone. The concept of whistles was a great addition because it helped make sure nobody got left behind. I also think throwing in the red questions was very helpful in making us think critically throughout the course and be engaged during lectures, rather than just sitting and listening for over an hour. I didn't think there were any big weaknesses. One thing is that on homeworks I sometimes was not always able to access the feedback, so sometimes I didn't totally understand what concepts I didn't get. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material that is very interesting. The lectures are very boring and difficult to follow. I don't think I ever learned a  lot of information that I later retained from a lecture. I had to rely on my own individual studying a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Though I enjoyed a majority of the  content of this course, I found it difficult to engage during lecture because I often had a difficult time hearing the professor due to mumbling. I also found it difficult to follow lectures and was very grateful for the peer tutors and for enrichment to catch me up. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the professor/teaching staff were incredible in that they were always looking for ways to help explain things, they were willing to meet with you to help with any questions, and they were all around very encouraging. I also loved the peer tutors and the organization of the class. However, I felt that the class often moved very quickly, and think it would be better if the class moved a bit slower and maybe have the material a bit more condensed. ",
            "\u00a0I love the idea of the class, but in reality, it was extremely difficult to follow most of the time. The material itself is quite interesting but perhaps there is just too much of it. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the lectures are difficult to follow even with Professor Mooseker's help. It would be great if we could receive an overview of the entire system before we dive into the specifics. The course does a great job of teaching its students more about biology than pure memorization. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are very dry and from the slides. The large size of the lecture makes it hard to change this and it would be much more beneficial to do discussion section type classes. ",
            "\u00a0The powerpoint could be vastly improved. It has a lot of good, important information, but it is not a useful tool for professor mookeker during lecture. There is too much information and small writing on each slide, so they are pretty impossible to read through during lecture. I also didn't like the \"pre\" and \"Post\" lecture slides system. Streamline the canvas folders and the presentations, and the course will be much better! Other than that it was pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0The professor urged us to \"blow our whistles\" to ask questions and get clarification. For me, this was great in theory but difficult in practice because I rarely had specific enough questions to ask. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved in terms of how it was taught. I (and all of the students in the class who I had discussed this with) felt that the pace of lecture was too fast, and too much material was covered in every lecture. In almost every lecture, I (and others) felt completely lost--so lost to the point that I couldn't even ask a specific question because I had so little understanding of the broader concepts. While Prof. Mooseker is a brilliant researcher and kind man, he isn't the best-paced lecturer. Some improvements could be changing the discussion sections to be more review-based since the course is so dense instead of doing the \"journal club.\" While I genuinely enjoyed reading the papers, I felt that it would've been more productive and helpful to our understanding if we reviewed course material during section instead of papers that vaguely related to the concepts from lecture.\r\nHowever, some strengths include the peer tutoring sessions and Prof. Park's general graciousness and help! ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of information in a short period of time. Thus, it would have been helpful if the lectures were more organized so that I could better grasp the material. Lectures tended to jump all over the place, making them hard to follow and somewhat confusing. One real strength of this course was enrichment. Enrichment was where I truly felt I began to understand the material covered in class. I think this is due to the fact that it was held in a smaller setting and was much more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the structure of the course, with learning about scientific papers in discussion section. I also enjoyed the interactive format of the lectures. If anything could be changed, I would cover more cell biology topics rather than the ones that we covered in detail. ",

Strengths include the applicability of the course content and exposure to lots of material. ",

I found that, especially because the course is challenging, the support given more individually to students was lacking at times. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses of the course: lectures are fairly boring, led me not to pay attention. Section leaders were unreliable in terms of knowledge and understanding. It was too easy to attend section without actually having read the papers. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths: The homework sets are helpful for learning. The course instructors provide lots of resources for students, and are open to student input and questions. The weaknesses: despite many efforts to organize the course, it is extremely disorganized. It is difficult to leave lecture with a concrete sense of what has been learned during class that day, because the curriculum jumps around so much.  The professor states learning goals, but fails to achieve these learning goals and certainly does not give a recap of the learning goals at the end of the class. I think this could help (answers to the learning goals included in the recap!). A weakness of this course is that students receive no feedback about their learning prior to the midterm, which is an enormous portion of the overall grade. Professor Mooseker, as he told us the first day, \"hates quizzes,\" but I believe there should be some other way for students to assess their knowledge, reinforce their knowledge, and potentially accumulate points along the way. The homework sets are not enough. Section leaders for this course are also a weakness.  My personal TA was very difficult to understand and did not seem to comprehend the course material well.  When Professor Park visited a section of ours (the final one), my TA had to be corrected multiple times by Professor Park, and Professor Park had to supplant her teaching with additional follow-up questions which apparently we should have been prompted to answer by our TA.  I felt more confident in the information shared by my peers than by my TA instructor during section each week. ",
            "\u00a0This course had an unengaging lecture. Mooseker went through the slides very quickly and did not explain the concepts well. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class overall has a ton of strengths: the application, not memorization, based tests, the reading of the scientific papers, and the red questions in lecture to practice for exams. The class did not have a lot of weaknesses by any means, but one is that we did received grades but not receive feedback on homework assignments, and even by comparing to the answer key it was difficult to understand why we'd lost points. ",
            "\u00a0I like how the test questions are mostly based on experiments, because it requires students to have a very thorough knowledge of both the actual material and the experimental techniques. \r\n\r\nI did miss the way BIOL 101 discussions worked, where we went over the material people were confused on. I think that would have been more helpful rather than having a paper to read for all 5 discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be better if we were to have weekly quizzes like in 101. It forces students to review the material as we go along instead of all at once at the end.

The enrichment sessions helped me a lot and made me feel comfortable asking questions. ",

It was pretty overwhelming and the concepts are not easy to understand already. If that amount of information had been spread over a semester, it would have still been a challenging course. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strengths of this course are the papers.  I have not taken biology for a long time, and it was very difficult for me to become reacquainted with the biological sciences and terminology.  I have, however, been reading scientific journal articles in other disciplines.  I was able to learn from the journal articles much more effectively than from the lecture or powerpoint.\r\nOn a similar note, the experiments presented in lecture made it very easy for me to understand the processes.  I think more time spend on explaining WHY we know what we know would improve the course. ",

If you didn't take a high-level biology class in high school, it is impossible to follow. Even if you did, lecture can be impossible to follow because there is so much material covered so quickly, and the topics do not flow logically from one to the other, which also makes it hard to keep up.

            "\u00a0The course is good at developing a scientific mindset in students, not just memorizing facts but applying knowledge in order to develop new insights and new discoveries. The course material is generally engaging and challenging, for an introductory course. I would prefer if Prof. Mooseker devoted more time at the beginning of each unit connecting the content we were going to explore to some of the more basic ideas and knowledge that we may have been familiar with in high school. That way, I would have an easier method of anchoring all the new knowledge to my previous knowledge. ",

While Bio 101 took jargon-filled information and made it interesting by building upon itself to the point where we could understand pertinent research papers on important issues such as HIV, I felt that this course was disconnected and left me with little usable knowledge about the cell. My TF was great, I must say, but I felt very little motivation to go to the actual lecture. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that this course split up the material into \"Units\" and \"Toolkits\" so that we could learn the necessary experimental methods for learning the content.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was that this course crammed a lot of information into so short of a time on top of having a long lecture. This made it hard to retain all of the information during the lecture simply because there was so much information coming at me. This could possibly be improved by having the course spread out over 3 days a week instead of having a long lecture twice a week. ",

The expectations for understanding concepts in this class were so high, and we moved so quickly. ",

The test and homework questions could also use some work.
