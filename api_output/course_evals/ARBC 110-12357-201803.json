            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Arabic, from writing the script in MSA to speaking about myself in the Shaami dialect. ",

            "\u00a0Reading and writing the Arabic alphabet, basic vocabulary, speaking, appreciation of complexity and culture. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed a basic understanding of the Arabic language and within four months came to be able to speak, write and read the language. I can have conversations now on basic topics, such as food, myself, my family and the weather. I thought the pace was fast, but the class was very rewarding. I also learnt about Arabic culture and came to be able to write and read in MSA and partially understand shaami. ",
            "\u00a0I learned skills speaking and reading Modern Standard Arabic and speaking the Shaami dialect. "

            "\u00a0Ustaadha Elham made this class amazing! She truly cares about us as students and people, and I was so grateful to have her as a teacher. I also got to know the other people in the class very well because the class was very collaborative in nature. The workload, though, was very large. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I learned a lot, but the course was very disorganized and hard to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: class time was always well-organized and engaging. While there is about 2-4 hours of homework every night, most of it definitely contributed to a better understanding of and engagement with the language. Final Exam (conversation with a native speaker) was extremely helpful and really showed how much you are able to learn in this class!\r\nWeakness: sometimes certain sections would receive more instruction than others which was particularly frustrating on tests when there would be material that your section didn't cover (make a group chat with at least one person from each section to avoid this problem). Online activities usually not very helpful (sometimes felt like busy work). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor and continual building of skills. Weakness: some days there is a lot of homework; other days there is very little to do. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course certainly gives a great background in the language and starts with basic topics, such as an introduction, family, and the weather. I wish it had incorporated more of the shaami dialect. I thought speaking Shaami only on Fridays was very difficult, because we never used the dialect in class the other four days in the week, especially at the beginning of the semester, when we barely knew any MSA. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, especially if Ustaadha Elham is teaching it and if the student is willing to put in a large amount of work every night. The syllabus states that 3 hours of homework a night are expected, and some nights, that's completely true. It is a humongous workload if you want to do well, but you learn so much and it is so, so rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they wanted to tangibly see results when learning a language. However, the workload is sometimes unattainably high with a rigorous schedule, so I would be hesitant to recommend it to students with difficult schedules. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to learn Arabic (which is generally pretty difficult to do on your own), this is the class. Be prepared for it to occupy a good portion of your time, but if you are committed to learning a new language, you should welcome the opportunities to work on your skills! Also, grading on speaking is not unfairly harsh (i.e. if you struggle with certain pronunciations, you won't be penalized too intensely!). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Elham is a truly dedicated professor. So patient and encouraging! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for anyone who wished to learn Arabic. I would warn, however, that the workload int he first six weeks is very heavy and up to four hours a night. It becomes more consistent after the first six weeks, though the workload remains intense. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend. I learned a lot more of the language than I expected from an introductory course. "
