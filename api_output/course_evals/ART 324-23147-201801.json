            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to observe a painting and understand the process behind its creation.  Among other specific skills, I learned how Old Master Painters mixed their gesso, how they created skin tones using paint, and how they utilized layers to create their final products.  Perhaps most importantly, though, I learned how to be patient both with material and with myself. ",
            "\u00a0I think that I learned a lot about oil paint as a medium. I learned how oil paint can behave when you add more or less solvent or medium. I also learned about the history of the medium. Mark is a great teacher, and he has a wide range of knowledge about the subject that he is teaching. "

            "\u00a0It covers a lot of material and has interesting assignments but could benefit from more time spent painting during the class. ",
