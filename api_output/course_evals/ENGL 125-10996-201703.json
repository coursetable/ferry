            "\u00a0I gained a knowledge of early English poetry (from the Middle Ages through to the 1600s) through the study of key works. "

            "\u00a0I think the course is well organised (syllabus-wise) and we cover a lot of interesting material. I think there were a lot of assignments in this course that made it a lot more work than perhaps necessary -- on top of 5 papers were biweekly reading responses and various small assignments which perhaps could have been reduced? \r\n\r\nOverall I really enjoyed the reading and writing and discussions! ",
            "\u00a0The class focuses on important poems in the history of English literature, and since we didn't have to read each text too quickly, we didn't have to rush through things.  \r\n\r\nWe read Shakespeare's \"As You Like It\" in addition to the poems, and though I enjoyed reading the play, I didn't feel like it really fit in with the rest of the works on the syllabus.  I liked the essay topic on the play, which involved references to Shakespeare's sonnets and centered the work about the play on poems, but overall the play seemed to stick out a bit compared to the rest of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. I thought that Professor Brantley was great at leading discussions, and I enjoyed the conversations that we had as a class. I also thought that the works were well selected and allowed for the study of a variety of poems/poetic forms. Grading for papers was also very fair, and feedback was helpful. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, the main issue was that grading took a long time for papers and that expectations were sometimes a little unclear. Papers were often not returned back before the next one was due which made it very difficult to incorporate feedback into the next paper. Also, there were sometimes last-minute assignments added and a late opportunity to revise papers which were not originally announced in the syllabus (earlier announcments would have helped in planning ahead). Finally, I felt like while I enjoyed the reading responses/online discussions, it might have been better to have had one a week rather than one due for most class periods. ",
            "\u00a0Super inconsistant across sections but my section was great. ",
            "\u00a0I was impressed by the quality of class discussions, which seemed partly due to the makeup of the class and partly due to Prof. Brantley's kind and productive leadership. The essays (5 of them) asked interesting questions and were graded generously. I liked the reading a lot more than I thought I would, particularly The Canterbury Tales, Paradise Lost, and Shakespeare's sonnets. We went too fast through As You Like It, though, and so didn't get a chance to dive deep. "

            "\u00a0125 is a great course because it seems important for an English major to read and think about some of the earlier important texts in the English language. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course and would definitely recommend it to another student. However, I would forewarn that it is hard to use it to actively improve writing due to the late feedback and the fact that writing/editing itself were not often discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Great class but make sure you take it with a prof you like and make sure the assignments schedule works with your other assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially with Brantley. I came in expecting to read dated texts, but learned to read The Canterbury Tales as positively post-modern and Paradise Lost as eminently relevant to contemporary literature. "
