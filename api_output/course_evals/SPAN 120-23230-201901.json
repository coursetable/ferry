            "\u00a0I developed a cultural understanding of various Spanish speaking countries, and I learned new grammar tenses for conjugating. There was a lot of insight learned with regards to Spanish writers and some of their famous works. ",
            "\u00a0It became apparent that I have a learning disability.  I discovered that no matter how much time and energy and practice I put into trying to learn a language at this university, I will not succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I became much better at speaking Spanish within the classroom setting and in general. I also somewhat got over my fear of speaking Spanish in front of an entire class, which was huge for me. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish speaking, writing, listening ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak better in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I improved at Spanish greatly ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an introduction to Spanish language and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better understand Spanish when spoken. I learned a lot of new grammar and vocabulary. I read books in Spanish. "

            "\u00a0Language placement can always be tricky because not every single person in the class is going to be at the same level, but if it were possible to group together the students going through the same struggles of learning another language, it would make the class environment more inviting and not as scary.\r\nThe structure of the course was challenging but useful for pushing one's language abilities. ",
            "\u00a0We covered material insanely fast, even my peers who were doing well in the course struggled with the accelerated pace. ",
            "\u00a0Very detailed, could have less skits and more review of grammar and key principles. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course should be graded more based on how far an individual has come with speaking, grammar, etc., not whether or not someone test takes well in general, which I feel like is how the course is tested on now. All of our in-class speaking assignments/exercises should mean more than they do. ",
            "\u00a0There could definitely be more speaking in SPAN 120 as well as more time to master the complicated verb tenses. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: organization\r\nweaknesses: a lot of work ",
            "\u00a0Strength: forced to get very good at spanish. Weakness: hard class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the small size of the classroom and the standardized course schedule made this class helpful for all students. There were a variety of assignment types -- speaking, listening, reading comprehension, supersite, etc. -- that really helped me learn all aspects of the language. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the material, like the vocab, was very practical and good to know. The weakness was that for the books and small stories we read I felt like they were far above our level and so understanding them was very hard. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they really want to learn Spanish. It is a huge step up from the L1 class, but it really solidifies a foundation for the language. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, but only one who is confident in their ability to learn a language. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot of work but valuable skill to have ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because professor Juliana really cares about her students and she wanted the best for everyone this semester. Having a professor who cares so much makes learning the material easier, even though it may not seem like it at the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good to know language ",
