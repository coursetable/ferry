            "\u00a0As someone without prior philosophy experience and minimal knowledge of the international sphere, I learned a massive amount of information in this course. I learned how to evaluate ethical arguments, different philosophical paradigms and how they can be used to assess the international realm, etc. Some of the issues/thinkers we covered were utilitarianism (Peter Singer), distribution of resources (John Rawls and Amartya Sen), gender injustice (Martha Nussbaum), immigration ethics and national partiality  (Michael Walzer, Alisdair MacIntyre), and so on. I feel much more informed about the injustice of the international sphere and have a better idea of what I believe my responsibilities towards others are. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge in the philosophical approaches to international affairs. ",
            "\u00a0A more in-depth knowledge of important global reflections. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basic concepts surrounding ethical topics in IA, like what sorts of duties we might have to other individuals and nations, and what sorts of approaches we might take to solve those problems. I also learned the basic arguments for these duties, as well as major strengths and drawbacks ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the fundamentals of ethics, and ethics from the view of 20th and 21th century philosophers. Taking this class promoted critical thinking, and gave a unique opportunity to think and write about many of today's important challenges: migration & open borders, international bodies, global health and patent system, ethics of international trade, global warming, global resource distribution, etc. "

            "\u00a0Professor Pogge is a really solid lecturer and a funny individual. Class time will pass by pretty quickly. As for the course itself, the vast majority of readings were very interesting and most were accessible to someone without any prior philosophy experience. Further, Professor Pogge makes the class an environment where anyone is free to express their point of view on the topic of discussion, so this class differs a bit from traditional lecture and has a more discussion-oriented feel. The weakness of this course is that some readings never get talked about in class, usually because of time constraints, so you don't ever get to unpack some readings in a way that is satisfactory. Additionally, I wish Professor Pogge provided more context for the readings before the class they were actually assigned for. I would often go into a reading not knowing how it fits into the overall unit we were covering that day. It wasn't until I got to class and Professor Pogge contextualized it that the reading would make much sense. ",
            "\u00a0More structured lectures/lecture slides. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely how fascinating it can be to discuss the topics of the class.\r\nThe weaknesses, however, range over many areas. The first being that class is often limited to the, although sometimes very interesting, slow speech of the professor. Encouraging more student participation, and some debates between the students themselves could be a way to improve in that area. It is also difficult to know what is expected that the student will retain. The readings are thick and often tough to read. What vocabulary or which arguments should the student remember or memorize? A set of notes the professor could help the students come up with would help better remember the course material and definitely assist them in the exams. Having more and less-heavily weighted (even shorter) writing assignments could help the student practice in philosophical writing. \r\nI found the data-filled first few lectures to be the most interesting and would have loved to have more use of historical cases and present global affairs in the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very small class size allowed me to connect with the professor even though I never talked to him one on one. The readings were very interesting \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TP kind of just threw me in the water with A LOT of reading. It definitely is very hard to keep up the entire semester, and I didn't.... Also as someone new to a lot of these concepts, I was never aware what to focus on.... See \"suggestions for instructor\" for more ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Topics and articles are very well selected. \r\n-Essays give you great opportunity to study the topics that you enjoy, and improve your writing. Professor is always happy to provide extensive feedback! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting topics and authors. Really made you think about the underlying philosophy and psychology underlying international affairs. Most of the topics used in the course are very applicable in daily life and how you perceive the world. This class will definitely influence how I take the rest of my Yale classes. Clear explanations on each of the authors.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the lectures were a bit dry and not all of the authors were covered to the same degree. Sometimes, I felt the professor introduced philosophy terms that were a bit unnecessary that could have been avoided. The class also lacked structure. "

            "\u00a0Definitely! Even if you don't have any prior philosophy experience, this course is still very accessible. I learned so much--truly an enlightening class. The exams are hard but fair. Professor Pogge knows this so you need not get a really high score to get a good grade on the exams. Don't think you can get away with not doing the readings, however. You might think you can at the beginning of the semester since Professor Pogge doesn't ask you detailed questions in class about the readings, but for exams, you should be familiar with the readings. Your life will be much easier if you just keep up with the readings and take good notes on them throughout the semester. As for Professor Pogge himself, he is a solid lecturer, funny individual, and truly cares about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think I will recommend the course to another student. ",
            "\u00a0Modern philosophy in an introductory class? unheard of but it's exactly the cool stuff you get to read in TP's EIA class. I understand that there is a lot of discussion about what TP did in the past. Honestly, it is the hardest thing for me to reconcile as a student, but honestly, the experience was great. TP is an amazing professor and an expert in ethics and international affairs. He is a pretty funny guy and very charming. I think you should give it a chance if you're interested.\r\n\r\n10/10 start this class off credit d... or I guess with the new system, consider later converting. It is a tough class to do well in. The readings are rather dense because you are reading the primary text. He expects a lot from undergrads, and it honestly makes it a more rewarding experience because you can say you read all the greats in recent international affairs? ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are very (very) interesting. Essay topics are carefully selected to give students the flexibility to write about what they really care. There are also joker sessions where you can study some other topics that you find important but were not put in the class syllabus. \r\n\r\n-Although there is a good number of assignments, each assignment facilitates the learning experience and helps you get the most out of the course. \r\n*I suggest doing readings on time to enjoy the class discussions more.
