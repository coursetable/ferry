            "\u00a0I learned so much! This was my backup class after local government law (at the law school) fell through, and I am so happy I took it. I learned all the basics of land use planning in the U.S. I learned how to read case law. I learned how policy at the local level is shaped and how it impacts residents, developers, and the environment. This class is really good for anyone interested in urban planning, but it also covers a lot of non-urban topics as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fabulous introduction to land use law. In addition to learning a lot about the structure of the regulatory landscape associated with property ownership, this class teaches you how to read cases and understand them. You will learn from case studies the best legal avenues through which to respond to such issues as the housing crisis and climate change. ",
            "\u00a0Useful framework for understanding the foundations of local land use law. Very helpful in bolstering knowledge about zoning, permitting, and the power of governments at all levels to control development and impacts to the natural environment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the local environmental planning and land use regulatory landscape in the United States as well as what a powerful tool local-level regulations can be in efforts to adapt to climate change. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided very in-depth looks into case law that have shaped land use and planning in the US. I learned a lot about how to read and interpret cases and how land use works at the municipal and county level. It was a very way of thinking about planning that I had not been exposed to before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about local land use law, which I found very interesting and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I gained understanding of the framework for land use law and environmental planning in the US. As land use law is primarily developed at the local level, the class focuses more on concepts and strategies than specific laws. It covers the federal regulatory framework and numerous topics within land use law, such as coastal issues, agriculture, environmental justice, smart growth, etc. Examples come from all over the US, with a focus on Connecticut. I also learned how to read and interpret case law. ",
            "\u00a0A solid understanding of land use law and its history. ",
            "\u00a0-Reading legal cases and the history of land use planning and its importance in environmental planning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned fundamental terms and concepts about land use law and planning. I particularly learned core concepts about how local land use decisions are made, appealed, and enforced. ",
            "\u00a0Since I had very little understanding of land use law prior to this course, I learned a great deal about zoning, environmental protection laws, and how land use claims have generally been litigated in the United States in the past. It opened up my eyes to the both ridiculous and credible reasons people sue over land use issues. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to interpret primary legal documents, including statutes and court decisions. "

            "\u00a0Way better than expected. ",
            "\u00a0The class was what I expected: an overview of land use law from an administrative, legislative and judicial viewpoint. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. Enjoyed the combination of case law (as outlined in the syllabus) and Marjorie's real-world experience as a practitioner in the field. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well with my expectations! ",
            "\u00a0Very well! Marjorie was upfront with what the class was going to look like and stuck with that. ",
            "\u00a0This class what about what I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. Since the class is structured by discussion of cases, it was hard to gauge how much I'd learned throughout the semester. But by the end I felt confident that I had the necessary skills and foundational understanding to be able to read and interpret land use law in a particular setting. I also gained familiarity with the various tools that environmental managers can use to effect change at the local and state level on a variety of environmental issues (water protection, urban resilience, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT, and have come out much better equipped to work in the land use arena. I was expecting a bit more on environmental legislation, and I felt like we didn't spend enough time looking at concrete examples. ",
            "\u00a0very well. ",
            "\u00a0The course was much more case law oriented than I expected, but the content covered was about what I expected. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: Marjorie immediately learned the names of all her students. She allowed us to be a little late and ask endless questions. She did such a wonderful job creating a classroom dynamic that was open and encouraged curiosity and exploration. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The book was prohibitively expensive. I ended up renting it and sharing it with another student, meaning I couldn't take the book home or underline the text - which made it difficult to stay engaged while reading it. I'm also not always sure if I understood the flow of the syllabus from one topic to the next. ",
            "\u00a0Great structure to the course. Homework is always a reading assignment that is then elaborated on in class and explained within the larger framework of land use.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses to speak of! ",
            "\u00a0The reliance on student briefings of cases was occasionally difficult (although also likely frustrating given they were assigned as homework), but it was helpful when Marjorie presented on a specific case, or presented some other groundwork for discussion and student briefings. Later in the semester there were more of these presentations, which was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe it's because I'm not a law student, but I wonder if there's a way to learn about environmental planning and land use law that isn't just through reading cases. I found the few articles that we read that weren't cases to be among the most interesting and helpful in understanding key concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This was mostly structured around case discussion.. I wish Marjorie had lectured a little more as she is deeply knowledgeable. At times it leaned a little too much on student led case discussion, although I understand that it is a law class and meant to be structured that way. It was always fun and informative when Marjorie sprinkled in her pragmatic experience in local land use and politics. ",
            "\u00a0I would restructure the course. I think it would be helpful to start with a basic understanding of the law. For example, this class could start with a quick overview of the court system, how to read cases, basic Constitutional law and property law concepts, etc. Then, I think it would make sense to teach the different takings tests before moving into substantive land use law. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best things about this course is that it is taught by a practitioner with lots of experience and examples to draw from. I think the class would benefit from less time on case discussion and more time reviewing concepts. Some of the material would be easier to follow and reference if it were presented in slides with tables that compare and contrast different options/entities (like planning commission vs zoning board, variance vs special use permit). Also, I liked that the there was no cold calling for discussion but perhaps students could sign up to present cases in advance (i.e. a warm call) to encourage more participation. ",
            "\u00a0The general format is great, but I felt like the last few weeks disintegrated a bit as the topics became less clear. I think there was a lost opportunity at the end of the course to engage students in looking at case studies of land use legislation more in depth. All in all, a great course though! ",
            "\u00a0Some of us didn't engage with the readings in a manner that would have helped the class discussions. Marjorie is such a good speaker and lecturer so she made the material engaging and used local examples in her explanations. It was great!!! ",
            "\u00a0I think that the strength of the course is that the concepts taught are very relevant to a variety of professions within FES. The weakness of the course is its focus on case law. I struggled to draw broader take-aways from the course because the majority of the time, we were focused in on specific cases. We often wouldn't then zoom out and look at how these cases apply or are significant in a broader context. I think that those take-aways were discussed in passing occasionally, but it wasn't drawn out explicitly, so I felt like you had to put the pieces together on your own. For my personal learning style, I need to see the big picture in order to synthesize information and draw concepts from the specific examples. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is the professor, Marjorie. She's very passionate about land use law and she's sure to insert her humor and sass into each lecture. The main weakness is that, most of the time, there was no summarizing lesson to be learned after reading cases. We generally just brief a case in class and then move on to the next one. It would be helpful to look back after a bulk of similar cases have been read and conclude that topic with an overarching lesson. I felt this part was left to the students to figure out on their own. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures, ample opportunity for student participation, final project allowed students to pursue an area of interest\r\nWeaknesses: lecture structure relied too heavily on voluntary student participation - the course might be improved by implementing a more structured system of participation "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in land use in the U.S. and/or want a primer for law, take this course!! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it! I took it as an undergrad interested in zoning. I am interested in pursuing a career within in urban development one way or another and the legal background this class provided will be helpful no matter which route I take. ",
            "\u00a0Very useful for anyone interested in land conservation or policy, but particularly for those in more urban/exurban areas. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure that you read the cases! This course gives you exactly what you put into it. You could go through and not do much of the readings, but you wouldn't get as much out of it if you did them. ",
            "\u00a0This class is definitely worth taking. Do the readings... it's important for class discussion and for the class learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class and I would suggest that the student engage with the material and bring questions that help make the material relevant to them and the places they care about. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who wants to work with or for local/state government and/or private landowners in the US should take this class. I also found the concepts I learned about zoning, planning processes, and agencies to be personally valuable (for example if I ever wanted to engage with a zoning board, buy a house, etc.). Marjorie encouraged us to \"adopt a town\" and learn about their land use laws to reinforce the concepts in class--I found this very helpful and highly recommend selecting a town early on. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot. Be prepared to actually read the cases--they are actually often quite entertaining.\r\nThe final project is also a great way to wrap up your learning. ",
            "\u00a0Read the cases and come to class prepared to talk about them. ",
            "\u00a0Getting the most out of this course takes personal initiative. You need to keep up with reading the weekly cases and participate in class. Otherwise, the course may easily fall down your list of priorities, and you will not get the most learning out of the materials and class time. ",
            "\u00a0Reading case law can be challenging if you do not have a background in it, but you will definitely learn the basics of land use law! ",
            "\u00a0Your ability to participate in, understand, and enjoy the course is directly related to the time you spend on the assigned reading. "
