            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish speaking, writing, and comprehension abilities substantially and feel more confident communicating in the language. The vocabulary memorization was at many times tedious, but it nonetheless helped in communication. Finally, a sizable chunk of the course focused on Spanish culture, which was very interesting and helpful for the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned essentially what was on the syllabus for the class, but I also learned a great deal about how I should approach learning a new language and why it's valuable to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to pick Spanish back up after having been away from the language for an entire academic year. I increased my comfortability with tenses outside the present and preterite and improved my speaking and listening abilities. This class met me at my level of ability and helped develop it. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of the language and the cultures surrounding it than all my years in high school. My speaking, comprehension, and grammar all dramatically improved. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about grammar associated with Spanish including tenses and grammar with \"se\". I improved my listening ability. I learned insights in culture including poets, Dia de los Muertos, and Spanish daily life. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first Spanish class in about two years. In high school, I hated Spanish every day and only saw it as a burden on my English. When I got to Spanish 2, a fair amount of the material was stuff I already knew, but for some reason, through the constant every day, full immersion of the language, I began to stop translating in my head and stop constantly hating it. I learned how to see Spanish on its own and I think kind of like it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very much based in grammar and vocabulary. It covers a lot of tenses to make anyone be able to have a more than basic conversation in Spanish. Also, we worked on audio comprehension, reading comprehension, and lots of speaking skills. Also, this course covered a lot of information about Spanish speaking countries. "

            "\u00a0If you are just starting in Spanish 120, the cost of the textbook is ridiculously high for one semester. Quite honestly, it almost deterred me from taking the course. Additionally, besides vocabulary and learning verb tenses, the book is of little help in succeeding in the class. The strength of the course was definitely the in-class communication exercises with peers and the instructor. They helped me develop my language skills and practice what was assigned for homework. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was really strong in that everyone was encouraged to participate and the activities we did were fun. I was a bit worried that the activities would be more serious in tone and I wouldn't be able to keep up, but then I got to pretend to be Leonardo DiCaprio for one of them which was great. So the activities were definitely strong because everyone wanted to be involved and would do the work to participate.\r\n\r\nOne thing that was a struggle for me was that I sometimes wasn't exactly sure what I needed to do to prepare for class. I think I learned more of what was expected as the semester progressed, but more clarity on assignments would have been helpful, especially in the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0The class demands a lot from students. Homework is assigned every night and the grading scheme is difficult and unequal across instructors/sections. The course would undoubtedly be improved if instructors better communicated and coordinated academic expectations. A B+ in one professor's class might well be the effort equivalent of an A in another's. The class's strength lies in its organization. The course had a thorough syllabus that outlined and dated assignments for the semester. We never derivated from the timeline and it was easy to make up missed work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Students are encouraged to engage with the language in all facets of the class. Much of the class depends on immersion, and this forces students to learn and adapt.\r\nWeaknesses- I wish there was a larger emphasis on speaking at the beginning of the class rather than the end. Though my grammar improved, it would've been beneficial for me if past concepts had been reviewed, as we learned new applications for them often. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course included the professor's commitment to her students. She was willing to meet outside of class for extra office hours. The course was very organized with its syllabus and resources. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught very well through the textbook in a very engaging manner with many good homework assignments and fair numbers of exams. That being said, there could definitely be improvements. Having to buy a new textbook to only use half of it was a very annoying expense. I also would've loved a little more in class culture that was used toward the end of the course throughout, as it was integral to my enjoyment of the language and understanding of its reality. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the level of depth and constant Spanish practice. The weakness is that this course can be very difficult to get a good grade in. Often, mistakes happen because of lack of Spanish knowledge instead of a lack of studying. "

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course, but only if you can take it with Julianashe truly made the course material exciting and engaging. If you're looking for an easy A course, this isn't it. Juliana is certainly a difficult grader, but it helps you improve your language skills and become a better speaker/writer. She brings so much energy to the course and truly wants her students to learn the language. Definitely take this course if you'd like to strengthen your Spanish in a challenging environment! ",
            "\u00a0I would but I would let them know that it was more work than I expected and since it is daily, they should be sure to take it at a time that works well for them. ",
            "\u00a0Should a student be looking to satisfy a language requirement, yes. However, I caution the individual who might have tested into L2 and therefore is compelled to take the L2 (as opposed to L1) class. Give yourself a moment to consider whether or not Spanish is the language you want to pursue in your valuable time at Yale. If your answer isn't a \"yes\" with considerable confidence, explore your options! This class grades hard, factor that truth into your decision. Popular sentiment has told me that L2 is the most difficult course in the Spanish sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student if they're serious about improving their language skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other people who want to learn Spanish. The professor is outstanding and enables learning in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This definitely is a great language to learn and taught in a great way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was a wonderful course, but it also requires A LOT of work. Take that into consideration. However, if you really want to improve your Spanish speaking abilities, this is a perfect way to do so. "
