            "\u00a0The course was an excellent opportunity to sharpen some of my more forgotten skill sets in communicating my research (to non-experts/laypeople as well as colleagues/colleagues-to-be)!  In addition, I was able to refresh a number of important concepts and skills in mixed methods and research ethics.  I had forgotten some of the term, e.g. type of mixed methods approaches! "

            "\u00a0The number one strength was the engagement of student ideas, experiences, etc.; learning through others' field experiences can be really helpful in cementing the oft-abstract concepts of methodologies and ethics in our lines of work!  I also really loved workshopping with the other students.  I can't think of any way the course could be improved. :) "

            "\u00a0Absolutely!  Even if you are a first-year graduate student, if you've been out of the field of global health research for a bit, this is a fabulous refresher.  From what I heard from the undergraduate scholars, they also loved being in a diversely interested and very engaged group! "
