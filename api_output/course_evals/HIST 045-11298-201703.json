            "\u00a0I gained much more insight on the Holocaust and the different perspectives that make the historical event so interesting to study. I also learned much about the Afterlives of the Holocaust in Germany, such as how Germans learn about the Holocaust and how they memorialize the victims, a topic I was always interested in but never taught. My writing skills also improved greatly in the class due to the comprehensive feedback from the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into the course, I was not sure what to expect. I am so glad I took the course because I could have never imagined that there could be so many aspects to a historical event. I learned so many different things about the Holocaust, from exploration of memorials to the commentary regarding the Nuremberg Trials.\r\n\r\nI never used footnotes in my high school, but I learned how to use those in this class. I also learned how to write a historical paper, and even though I still have a lot to improve on regarding my writing skills, I feel as if I have gained enough information to have a basis on historical writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount in this course. I learned how to be clear and concise in formal writing, and to build up different authors' arguments before offering my own critique and analysis as a writer. I learned how to be a close reader and an elementary historian, as well as how to compare and contrasts different historians. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. Beyond learning the facts, theories, and various historical accounts of the Holocaust, I improved my skills in writing and argumentation. One of my biggest take aways, however, was simply the notion from E. H. Carr that there is no absolute history and all histories have an argument. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better how to create an historical argument and back it up with historical evidence. I also learned how to evaluate and critique other historical arguments. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely taught me how to write a better history paper. Professor Allen consistently gave extensive amounts of feedback on how we could improve our writing and our historical analysis and argument. \r\n\r\nIn a sense, it was the perfect course to take as a freshman, as it taught us a lot about writing at a college level, managing heavy reading loads, and participating in discussion-based seminars.\r\n\r\nWe learned an enormous amount on the Holocaust, covering everything from how the camps operated to its the modern-day fallout in German society. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, writing, note taking, research, public speaking ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned how to write a history paper-- something I didn't realize I didn't know how to do until taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course enhanced my knowledge of the Holocaust and the impact that it has had on Germany. It made me reflect on aspects of the Holocaust that I had never focused on before and gave me insight into varied perspectives. The course definitely helped me improve my historical writing skills and forced me to think about my choice of words, organisation and structure. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me to read large texts in a short amount of time, while still retaining significant information. It also helped with simpler tasks, such as learning how to use footnotes. Overall, it aided in the broadening of my intellectual spectrum and enlightened me to the different ways in which events in history can be interpreted. ",
            "\u00a0Numerous ways to interpret the Holocaust and people place it in the scope of history, and how that can be done ourselves through research. Also greater experience with comparing historian's and their theses. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Engaging, Interesting topic with different perspectives \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings I felt were a little repetitive at times, but not usually. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the seminar aspect of this class because it allowed us to engage with each other. The readings were very diverse, and I enjoyed the discussion forum because it made me read the readings more carefully. The information is very interesting, and the class was extremely well organized - the syllabus told us exactly what topics we were covering, and really gave the class structure.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was just that I wish we had spent a little more time in class before the first essay going over how to write a historical essay. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly engaging. It forced me to think and write in wholly new ways. The reading was a lot, but I'm not sure that's something that should change, because each assignment was absolutely necessary. I will say that the canvas discussion posts could perhaps be replaced with something else. I recommended a site to my professor called Actively Learn, which enables students to read one reading on a communal interface and make both public and private annotations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the subject itself was fascinating. The readings for the course were well chosen and organized. I appreciated the Harkness method class discussions where the students could talk to each other rather than always to the professor. \r\nWeaknesses: Often for homework we would read slightly more material than we could cover in one class period. The class dynamic was good but it wasn't great. I felt like I didn't get to know the other students as well as I could have. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided good feedback and helped me get comfortable having class discussions. I think that having rough drafts that were critiqued by the professor before handing in final drafts would have been helpful. It was the first time handing in essays in college for most of us and we had no opportunity to get feedback from the prof before getting grades. ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths to this course. The first is that it is very fast paced in the sense that it covers an extensive amount of material each class. The readings are always very interesting and easy to digest. The fact that this seminar is truly discussion-based allows everyone to participate and formulate their own opinion/interpretation. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is not a lot I can think of that would substantially improve this course. One thing that I maybe would have liked to spend more time on however is the German \"memory-scape\" of the Holocaust, which to me was one of the most interesting topics that we covered. However, we only had so much time in this course, and it would be hard for me to say what more time on this topic should come at the expense of. ",
            "\u00a0I think there are very few weaknesses. I went into this course feeling as though I knew a lot about the Holocaust and quickly realized just how much I didn't know. I'd recommend it to any first-year student. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very organised and this aspect really helped us delve into each sub-topic in detail. The assignments were also very interesting and intellectually challenging. I do not think that there were any weaknesses as such but it would have been lovely if we concentrated a bit more on the international impact of the Holocaust. ",
            "\u00a0it was very engaging, with a lot of class participation allowed by the professor and introductions to interesting approaches to a subject that can sometimes feel like everything has been said. "

            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend it. While the readings are sometimes heavy, you are required to write up short reading responses to every reading, and the writing assignments are challenging, your writing skills improve and you develop a new way of looking at history. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class, and would definitely want others to take it. However, I would tell people to take this class only if they already have at least a general interest in the Holocaust or in historical events. I feel like if a person has no interest, the readings will be very difficult to get through. ",
            "\u00a0I think every student should take this class. It was mind-blowing and enlightening. It improved my writing immensely and made me a deeper and more balanced thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This course was engaging, stimulating, interesting, thought-provoking, and really allowed me to develop more as a writer and student of history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. This was a good class for learning about the Holocaust, how Germans dealt with the burden of guilt afterwards, and how historians deal with a past heavy with modern-day implications. Also, it's a good class for developing reading, writing, and arguing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing!! So engaging and was so enjoyable. There was a good bit of work, but I feel like my writing has improved greatly. You learn so much in so little time! I enjoyed every minute. ",
            "\u00a0I would only if the student is interested in being a History major. The workload and attention this class deserved is probably not designed for someone only mildly interested in history. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This was by far the best course I took my freshman fall. \r\n\r\nIt is taught by an excellent professor who really engages with each of her students, and is really dedicated to her class being discussion-based. \r\n\r\nThe workload is entirely manageable, and the essays are each on very interesting topics that only require a limited  amount of research (with the exception of the final paper).\r\n\r\nI think that this course is a truly excellent way of getting a writing credit in your freshman year. \r\n\r\nThe amount of reading can sometimes be challenging. I had to get used to doing roughly 50-70 pages of reading for each class (twice a week), which requires planning and organization as we had to submit online discussion comments on the reading for each class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was the most intellectually stimulating and rewarding class I have ever participated in. It will forever remain a point of comparison for best instructor and most organized course curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that every student would benefit from learning the skills and lessons that this course teaches. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student, especially if he or she is interested in German history or human rights. The class discussions were intellectually stimulating and forced me to re-think my prior opinions. The papers really helped me develop my writing skills and Professor Allen's feedback was very detailed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, as it was very a very interesting and stimulating course. It forced me to think intellectually in a way that was different from the other classes I took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student with an interest in the Holocaust, German history, or simply learning more about what it is like to be a historian. "
