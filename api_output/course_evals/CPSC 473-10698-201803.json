            "\u00a0Practice: designing and running a small-group research experiment from conception to final conference-style report. Theory: familiarity with robots, in context of human society, and understanding the purposes of various research fields. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about designing and implementing a robotics project from scratch. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a little bit about many different fields in robotics! Its pretty cool actually and a great opportunity to read papers. ",
            "\u00a0I worked on an HRI project, and designing and implementing a psychological study from scratch was a lot of work but very rewarding. Recruiting and running participants and then analyzing the data in only a couple of weeks was wild, but Scaz made it seem eminently doable which kept us going. I was pretty proud of what we'd collected by the end. ",
            "\u00a0More research experience and experience working with actual robots. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-structured both as a class and also to ensure that students are enabled to complete assignments. Thought-provoking and engaging. Weaknesses: discussions became a little repetitive towards the end of the course (asking \"why bother\" or \"why do we do this\" is an interesting question to consider various fields for, but does not inspire new thought patterns). ",
            "\u00a0While I think I learned a lot about designing a project and carrying it through, I don't think I developed the technical skills or gleaned as much from my experiments as I had hoped. I think more communication (regular biweekly meetings) with the instructor/TA would help in managing expectations, especially during the beginning, as students are developing their project ideas. ",
            "\u00a0You have to be very self-motivated to make sure youre on top of your project! ",
            "\u00a0I liked how hands-on and discussion based the course was but wish our team received more feedback and guidance on our project from the Professor and TF throughout the semester. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0A very well-composed class. The classes themselves consist of fascinating dives into social robotics  think CPSC472, but with discussion. Classes are chosen based on what the students want to see. The main project is sizable: design and run a research experiment. This is a valuable experience, and the course is structured such that, while there are some checkpoints, these are completely to ensure that the work is not all backloaded since you are very much in charge of accomplishing your own work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have a solid idea of what sort of project you want to do and what you want to get from it. I think the resources (guidance and materials) are there for you, but you definitely should be ready to communicate clearly and dedicate a lot of time toward making your project successful. Manage your time super well--I was up working on my project til 4 am at least six times during the last month. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it was definitely a great CS elective! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great way to being doing independent research. Scaz has taught this before and can help you scope something reasonable, but you may end up surprising yourself with how much you're able to get done. (Unless you go in expecting to finish a lot, in which case--semesters are short!) It's also a great jumping-off point for a senior project if you're so inclined. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in robotics and research I would highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is one of the few CS courses that really allows you to interact closely with the professor and grad students in a small classroom setting, and explore exciting areas of research in HRI and robotics! You get to conduct a semester long research project which depending on your topic and team can be really cool. "
