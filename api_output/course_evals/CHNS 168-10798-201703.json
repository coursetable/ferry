            "\u00a0Learned advanced Chinese, particularly business and political Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Chns 168 really gave me so much in the way of language leaning. Not only did my Chinese improve dramatically (I literally could not read or write basic Chinese going into this class- I could just speak to a middle school level), but also I developed the techniques necessary to continue with my Chinese and language development. For example, during the Chns 168 midterm, I really struggled with figuring out how exactly to study the material and internalize it (since I had not taken any Chinese since 9th grade- and the Chinese I had taken was much less intensive), but by the time of the 168 final, I had broadened my vocabulary, reading comprehension, and language learning skills so much that the test was much more manageable. I also saw a marked improvement in my oral presentation and essay-writing skills (I didn't even know how to get my laptop to type Chinese characters before taking this class). The teacher is so amazing, and I owe so much of my Chinese ability now to her. ",
            "\u00a0In this class we learned mostly specialized vocabulary about international and domestic Chinese businesses. Chen Laoshi also asked us to prepare news headlines before class so we could learn how to talk about current events in detail. \r\n\r\nIn addition to vocabulary acquisition Chen Laoshi also helped us prepare for public speaking and essay writing. I improved greatly in both of these areas over the course of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about Chinese economics and other contemporary Chinese events. I also expanded my vocabulary and saw my speaking and writing skills improve. "

            "\u00a0The material alternates between reading a news article and reading a chapter from the book. I found the former more exciting--the latter was kind of boring.\r\n\r\nThe main strength of this course is the amazing teacher.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is the lack of opportunity to speak, as there are 9 other students who also have to speak. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class is the professor. She is so dedicated and so passionate about teaching Chinese. Because I had started at a comparatively low level of Chinese (relative to the rest of the class, who were mostly upperclassmen), she supported me throughout the course. We met every week for additional office hours (that sometimes lasted over 1.5 hours), and she is so prompt at responding to email questions. She is also very understanding and provided a lot of guidance to me as I navigated my way through college level courses. Chinese 168 is such a great class. ",
            "\u00a0This course required us to learn hundreds of vocabulary words and chengyus. But, due to the high level of the course, a lot of the vocabulary was highly specialized and complicated. I felt that, for exams, we focused on the quantity of vocab rather than the quality of our understanding. Maybe in the future, the class can focus on the most important vocab words from the supplementary texts rather than just any word we pick out of the text. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting and engaging (and we process it in easy/difficult cycles). Students are exposed to a variety of Chinese skills- essay-writing, presentation/oral speaking, conversational communication, vocabulary, reading comprehension, listening to and summarizing the news, and exposure to Chinese culture. Chinese 168 really broadened my horizons intellectually and language-wise. Also, Professor Chen is truly just amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lot of work - but it is an excellent class. There is a nice mix of heritage and non-heritage speakers which created a nice balance to the class. You will be pushed in this class, there are weekly written tests, oral presentations, tingxies and essays. If you are looking to improve your Chinese at a higher level, you should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I think that this is a great class with a great teacher. "
