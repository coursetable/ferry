The questions asked on exams were mainly fair, but the grading for partial credit wasnt always fair.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The weekly workshops. They honestly did nothing for my learning, and I think a discussion section would be more beneficial, in which students go over homework problems with a learning assistant and/or professor. The problem sets due on Tuesdays were also too long. Granted, we had the whole weekend to do them, but many of us have many other problem sets and other work to do. ",
