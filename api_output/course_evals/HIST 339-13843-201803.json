            "\u00a0Knowledge of a broad timeline of Qing history. Approaches to the Qing dynasty through various lens: macro and microhistory ; political (warfare, imperial politics, international relations), social (demographic change, women, ethnic, religion, education), environmental (fisheries, forests) histories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about chinese history. only some though within the specified period. other than a cursory knowledge of the events, i don't feel like i learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a good overview of the history of the Qing dynasty with a good mix of covering the basics of events and major developments, while also going more in-depth in specific topics in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of Chinese history was vastly enhanced, especially considering I had never really learned about Chinese history before in any great depth. From class, readings, and from the ID terms that were on the midterm and final, I learned more than I ever thought I would have. I also developed my writing skills and worked on keeping my essay answers concise and specific, which I was forced to do due to the word count constraint. The two skills that I developed most from this course are writing and studying. I have never studied such a large amount of material before, so I stretched myself intellectually in that manner. I had so much to study because of all the material that I learned. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the Qing dynasty, starting from the later years of the Ming until the Qing's fall with the nationalist movement in the early 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned how to compare and contrast different historical movements along a long period of Chinese history. I also gained a much deeper appreciation for Chinese history. "

            "\u00a0It was truly comprehensive: Professor Perdue knows so much about the Qing. The comparative approach was also very helpful, in reminding us how the Qing behaved as a colonial power as much as the British and French, that the Qing also signed treaties and saw ethnic/cultural Others as of lesser civilisational status. The only missing elements were perhaps an economic and and an ideological approach.\r\n\r\nIdeally Professor Perdue should give all the lectures. There were two graduate student lectures and one Q&A session which, while informative, may have been of less immediate value in terms of knowledge gained and rounding up the narrative. ",
            "\u00a0I think the first half of the course is great. it is told pretty coherently and you can understand what is going on. However, once we came back from break, i really have no idea what happened. we lost all sense of time. we jumped around and it didnt feel like there was much structure at all. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class lost some of its structure in the second half. It became difficult to keep track of events in relation to other events. ",
            "\u00a0The real strength of this course is just that the material is so fascinating. I also thought the readings were generally well-selected and interesting. Peter Perdue is a fair lecturer, although definitely not the most engaging. The real issues with the lectures was that they never concluded in any meaningful way, they just kind of petered out (pun intended) without tying together any of the topics discussed. In the end I felt like I knew about a lot of unrelated events, rather than feeling like I had a real narrative of Qing history (which I guess some people could consider a strength since it allows us to draw more of our own conclusions, but it made studying for exams almost impossible because I didn't really feel like there were any themes in the course). Also, the papers were all too short to do what was asked of us. The main comment on my paper was that I should have expanded my intro and conclusion, but I was literally one word under the limit, so I literally didn't have the space to do that without cutting a significant portion of my argument. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very easy to follow, and the chronology of the syllabus made Qing history into an engaging story. The writing assignments were not very specific, however, and it took me a while to understand what the two writing assignments were each asking. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is really strong and unique in its use of visual materials, as well as its focus on upending common assumptions/stereotypes on the Qing dynasty. The chronological narrative of the class also makes it easy to follow. I think that towards the end, there were many important events (including the nationalist movement) that felt a little rushed, but overall it had very good pacing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were definitely Perdue's lectures. They were consistently enjoyable and he is clearly a master of the subject. I also really enjoyed the readings, although sometimes they were unrealistically long. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0nope. don't take it. it was good to learn chinese history, but there are definitely better ways. the teacher was meh at best and the ta was not any better. I wanted to be engaged but they didnt make me engaged at all. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course really only because the material is absolutely fascinating. The Qing dynasty is so interesting that even with Peter Perdue's pretty dry lecturing it was enjoyable. The readings were generally manageable, interesting, and relevant, and the exams and papers weren't bad (although the papers were honestly frustratingly short and the exams were a bit hard to study for since there weren't really overarching themes of the course and I didn't leave lectures with a sense of what was important). ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. The lectures were engaging and very easy to follow, and I learned a great amount of information across a very large time span. I looked forward to class each week. There is a lot of work involved in preparing for the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend it, especially if you're interested in Chinese history. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. While we did cover a pretty sizeable time period, I feel as though I have a very specific understanding of it. Perdue is also an expert in the field and gives wonderful lectures. I can't think of any down sides. "
