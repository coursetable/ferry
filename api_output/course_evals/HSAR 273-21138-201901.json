            "\u00a0This course definitely made me more comfortably conversant in the terminology as well as style of the gothic, and of architecture more generally. I learned a lot more about the socio-political environment of Europe from the 1100s-1400s, which, though perhaps not wildly relevant, was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting to learn context for creation of cathedrals and go through some of the most famous ones, especially in light of the recent fire at Notre Dame. ",
            "\u00a0For someone who has never approached this part of art history, I am shook by how much I loved this course. It is a terrific class on architecture, sculpture, visual culture, and christian theology. ",
            "\u00a0Overall course on 12 Gothic cathedrals built during the middle ages - like about history of the buildings and architecture. ",
            "\u00a0The development of Gothic architecture within the cathedral settings of France and Germany. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the historical, intellectual, cultural, and artistic value of the gothic cathedrals of medieval Europe. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what the term Gothic means, which was really great because it's a word that's thrown around so often at Yale. I also now know how to identify and distinguish different styles of Gothic across Europe. I learned what it meant to be Christian in the Middle Ages, and how that translates to Christianity today. Now I feel pretty good about my ability to identify sculptural figures on churches. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at art through a more historical lens. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read medieval art and architecture, and learned about the social, religious, and historical context of significant Gothic cathedrals. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped us visually analyze gothic cathedrals, examine their formal qualities and understand their historical contexts. Reading and writing were part of the class, and as all art history classes do, this class helped us retain and memorize facts. ",
            "\u00a0I refined my skills of visual analysis and learned about key themes and motifs that can be found in various Gothic cathedrals. ",
            "\u00a0This course delved into around 8 French and German cathedrals in-depth (including Notre Dame, Reims, Naumberg, etc.), covering the history of the building, architectural framework, sculpture, stained glass, etc. ",
            "\u00a0History, art, and architecture of some French and German cathedrals. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course was well organized, in that it focused on particular churches in a sort of sequence, not necessarily one of chronology but also of geography. I appreciated that we sometimes spent multiple lectures on one building to be able to delve into different facets of the structures, but something that was occasionally frustrating is that we didn't always seem to cover everything about the buildings, in that the time allotted for some churches was less than others, which meant that some elements of the churches were passed over due to time constraints. The format of a midterm then a final paper and a final was fine, but even though we got guidance on the paper in a vague sense, some more check-in type assignments along the way might have been helpful as there weren't a lot of guidelines as to how the paper was supposed to look and cover at the end. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so much fun. I genuinely enjoyed going to lecture, and it was fun to get to study some of the most amazing architecture in Europe. The workload is very manageable, and the readings were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! It was really nicely organized and the teacher and TAs were so passionate and excited about the material ",
            "\u00a0Prof Jung was an amazing and inspiring teacher. However, I think the TFs could have done a much better job of making the course material more accessible. Section at times felt more like an intellectual flex than a discussion. The review of lecture material in section was really helpful but a lot of the additional information provided by the TFs felt superfluous and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures, but I would have liked to dwell on the connections between cathedrals a little bit more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - class presentations and teaching \r\nImprovements - add more history to the cathedrals so we understanding what is happening in the surrounding area/during the same time in history ",
            "\u00a0I feel the main strength of this class lies with Professor Jung and her TAs, Kristen and Kristina. Their enthusiasm for the subject made lecture and section very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course is clearly structured and well-orangized. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting due to Professor Jungs excitement. ",
            "\u00a0The material is pretty cool, and the course felt more like an exploration than a burden. I don't think I got much out of the readings, but that did not take away from my enjoying the themes/analyses which were the focus of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think they didn't decide how they wanted to structure section until pretty late in the semester, so each section was different, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing. I think the image lists are kind of unclear. Because there are so many dates, it's hard to know which are important and what they correspond with in the life of the cathedral. The image lists were also simplified after the midterm, so it was a bit more difficult to review the second half of the semester. It's also confusing to go through lecture and look at many images, but not have any lecture pdfs posted. It's a bit frustrating to not have any images to review until right before the test. That being said, the tests were really fair and it was a great mixture of identification and your own analysis and interpretation of the material. The paper was interesting to write, and taught me a lot about how difficult it is to study Gothic cathedrals. ",
            "\u00a0This class didnt always provide as much room for visual analysis in section as I would hope, and I also wish we had looked more at social history surrounding the cathedrals (more about how lay communities used/ interacted with the space). But I really enjoyed the lectures they were very engaging ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jung is amazing, and her dedication and passion for the subject makes this class worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class. Best I've taken at Yale so far. The only thing that could make it better is actually visiting the cathedrals we studied. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the class, but the only thing that was a bit frustrating was the lack of clear structure for the final paper. The prompt was released relatively late and was quite broad. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jung is an excellent lecturer, and I appreciated the opportunity to establish a firm understanding of a relatively niche area, as well as a foundation for thinking about how architectural spaces shape and reflect cognition, affect, etc. At the same time, I wish the course were more flexible in bringing in other sacred spaces from outside its typical European/Christian focus, as the material could also feel repetitive by the end of the semester. I wish the class did more to engage with social history, like issues of medieval racism and anti-Semitism. Rather than rigidly sticking to the buildings on the syllabus, I would have appreciated more efforts to express the relevance of Gothic architecture today, possibly with some tie-ins to Gothic revival and buildings on campus. I also think that, rather than encouraging pure memorization of facts (1 midterm, 1 final, 1 final paper), it would be nice if the course emphasized visual analysis and writing more. ",
            "\u00a0Really no strengths I can think of! This is a great course! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a well taught course, and Prof. Jung is a good instructor. Just be prepared for the fact that it is, at the end of the day, 14 weeks of studying Gothic architecture. If you're not super interested in the subject matter, it can get a little dry and repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as it is an interesting subject that, while it may not seem immediately applicable, gives one a greater appreciation for our own campus with its collegiate gothic architecture. It is fun to learn about the history of these places and recognize their larger significance in our own history, even if we may not realize how connected everything is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Even if you're not an art history or architecture major, it's a really fun class that deals with incredible architecture. ",
            "\u00a0YES you learn so much and also learn how to look at pieces of the past with a modern lens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. A bit niche, but certainly accessible and interesting for any interest background. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a 800-1500 class, PLEASE TAKE IT. Prof. Jung is amazing and the material is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Great for anyone interested in art history, the middle ages period, Christian history, or architecture! ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to anyone looking to delve further into art history. There is a lot to memorize but it becomes second nature. The religious nature may not be for people who are unfamiliar with the iconography but the TAs and Professor Jung are extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to someone who is willing to put in a lot of time to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, its amazing, not too difficult, and I feel enriched by the knowledge I have because of it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great if you want to get a basic introduction to Gothic cathedrals and how they varied in style across France & Germany. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Lectures are really engaging and section pulls it all together. At the beginning of the semester I thought all Gothic churches looked the same and I'd never be able to distinguish which was which, but after this class I feel really confident in analyzing many details of the Gothic style. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a fun class with a lot of really interesting tidbits and facts! I think it would make a great 5th class or just a fun class for a senior (which is what I did). The workload is pretty light and the material itself is really engaging. You just get to look at a lot of pretty buildings and hear interesting historical stories. Also Professor Jung is so engaging and enthusiastic about her work, it's infectious! ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful class taught by a very enthusiastic professor. I encourage it for anyone interested in gothic architecture and its history and implications. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a pretty good intro art history but you have to be ready for a lot of localized European history, its pretty niche ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a wonderful course to take at any point in your art history education, and you will learn more than just art and architecture. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This semester was especially relevant for this class, considering the fire of Notre-Dame de Paris and other damage done to houses of worship. It shows that learning monuments is not just about art, but about the human communities that are behind them. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. If you love art history or architecture, youll love this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if youre looking to learn a lot about the terminology, aesthetic, and organization of Gothic architecture, especially if youd like to enhance your appreciation of the Gothic architecture at Yale. While the lectures are engaging, I did not find the readings, exams, or sections to be particularly enriching, and I feel like there are other courses in the HSAR department that deal more with social history and issues of relevance beyond the works of art themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Jung is incredibly knowledgeable and engaging as a lecturer, and the subject matter never becomes boring or repetitive. "
