Sudesh is a really really good teacher.\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes the homeworks have integrals where it takes 1 minute to figure out the procedure and 15 minutes to solve the integral. in other words, sometimes you spend way more time doing annoying algebra and trig substitution than you spend practicing the methods from class ",

More harder problems that require creative, non-formulaic thinking, that aren't readily apparent at first, and that can be solved through a application of the taught principles in a novel or creative way would be better.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting content.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/To be Improved: The distribution of content between the exams was somewhat unbalanced. There was too little content for the first midterm, too much content for the second midterm, and way too much content after midterm 2 that we were supposed to learn before the final. A healthier balance of content distribution should be pursued. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Sudesh\r\nWeaknesses: Grading is harsh. You can know all the material, but because there are so many steps it's easy to do all the right things and still get only half of the points. It's frustrating and feels unfair.\r\n\r\nAnother weakness: instructors. Sudesh is a god, but the others are severely lacking. Daping is good as well, though I only know through review sessions so my opinion may differ from others. ",
            "\u00a0I think the final should not be worth as much as it is put. It makes the midterms less of a big deal when so many students work so hard for those. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is instructor Sudesh Kalyanswamy. The biggest weakness is that not every student in Math 120 can experience his expertise. A great deal of information is covered in the course and the material moves rather fast and builds up on itself so it is very important to stay on top of things. Sudesh made worksheets to accompany every lecture and using these as tools to ensure my understanding was paramount to my success. Although it is very easy to fall behind, if you are willing to put in the effort you will be able to do relatively well using the many resources provided. Lectures were incredibly helpful but I would like to emphasize the fact that this is very much dependent on the instructor. Without a good instructor, it would be extremely difficult to do well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I had Sudesh, and he explained the concepts really well. Also, the weekly homework assignments are manageable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some students took multivariable calculus in high school, so they kill the curve. The course covers a lot of material very quickly, and the three exams are worth 90% of the course grade. Homework is assigned during the midterm weeks. ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught in a logical way such that the concepts you learn can be reapplied in various scenarios, which helped me understand the concepts better. This class can go pretty fast such that it may move onto the next topic before you really understand or practice the previous concept. This fast pace is just the nature of the course, and I think Sudesh did a good job in reinforcing previous concepts rather than just assuming everyone fully remembered previous concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I think the strengths and weaknesses lie with the professors. I shopped several sections and it was clear that some professors were simply more prepared with handouts and extra problem sheets (just overall more resources to help students succeed) than others. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a comprehensive overview of multi-variable calculus. However, it feels a bit disjointed at times, and the material does not come together until the end of the course. This might just be the nature of multi-variable calculus, but it would be nice if more cohesion could be attained sooner in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0MATH 120 in general is very well-structured, designed in a way that helps the student and insightful. For midterms and Finals, we had multiple review sessions. Office hours also help a lot and Professor Sudesh was very committed to make himself available most of the time especially during Finals period. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course by far was the professor. Professor Kalyanswamy is easily the best professor I have had at Yale. He is extremely approachable, and very intelligent. I have never had a question he is unwilling or unable to answer. His office hours are actually the greatest things in existence. I would always go to them with a billion questions and come out feeling confident in the material. His lectures were stunningly clear and well organized. He also made difficult and somewhat tedious material seems very engaging. \r\nOther strengths of the course include the limitless outside resources available for Math 120 students, and the community of mutual struggling the class can bring.\r\n\r\nThere were also many weaknesses for this class. The biggest weakness was definitely the nit-pickiness of the exams. Many problems seemed garnered towards lowering students' grades than actually testing material. Also, the sheer number of kids who have taken multi in the class makes the curve brutal. Lastly, the PSETS (although usually not hard) can become very tedious and unnecessarily long. "

Tons of office hours, review sessions, and very well-taught class. Also, Math 120 is NOT a hard class when you take it with Sudesh. It is the same (if not easier) compared to most of the other classes here. Sudesh is a MUST though. Friends in a different section (with diff professors) have had a worse time. Sudesh is definitely the way to go (also this is a FUN class) ",

Although Math 120 does cover more material, I am extraordinarily happy I chose to take it because a good professor is more important than the difficulty of the course. Sudesh Kalyanswamy is the best professor I have ever had and as a result of the endless resources he provided to us, I was able to do well. Although it is very easy to fall behind, if you are willing to put in the effort you will be able to do relatively well using the many resources provided. Really pay attention to lecturer though when making your decision because this variable profoundly affects your chances of success. ",
            "\u00a0I shopped both MATH 120 and ENAS 151, and since they both teach the same material but ENAS 151 focuses on applications, I chose MATH 120 for a more abstract understanding (and because I knew Sudesh is a great professor). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who would fine this math content applicable, especially if you get Sudesh. But beyond the content of the course I dont think you learn much mathematical reasoning or practice applications beyond the basics. Since the course moves so fast the course is mostly computational. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that this course is crucial for anyone in the physical sciences or economics (and math of course). It provides a solid foundation that will give you many tools to approach mathematical problems that will certainly be useful in later courses. ",

All the students in his class had a much firmer grasp over the material than students in other classes. Also, unlike many Yale professors, he teaches the material from scratch and does not assume we know things we don't. If you put in the work, got to office hours and ask him questions (he's super approachable), I don't see a way to not do well in this course. ",
