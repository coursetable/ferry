            "\u00a0I learned how to get the information necessary from a reading without having to read word for word. This class was very reading intensive, so this skill really helped me get through the readings. I also believe that my writing got better during this time as the professor gave useful feedback on our written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0It was interesting to learn about medieval Islam (which I knew nothing of before taking the class) from the perspective of the marginalized. Usually when studying a topic, the history of rulers and innovators is covered first, but in this class we started with the destitute, the disabled, and the enslaved. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great amount of unique and nuanced insight into the lives of people living on the margins of society during the early modern historical period in the Middle East. I had never taken a class on this historical period before so it was very beneficial for me. Professor Yadgar gave us a lot of information on very interesting and unique aspects of life during this historical period. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strength: great discussion. Interesting readings that weren't too complicated and hard to read. \r\nWeakness: Not everyone participated, so most of the time the discussion was just between the professor and 2 or 3 students. \r\n\r\nImprovement: Not sure what steps the professor can take, but it would've benefitted everyone if the rest of the students were encouraged more to speak up. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting topic! 9:25 Monday is just not the best time to have a super engaging seminar ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course were engaging and well-selected. Occasionally a reading was unusually long and difficult to understand, and we didn't end up discussing it very much, but this only happened one or two times. The discussions always began with a bit of historical context before we delved into analysis of the texts. Professor Yadgar was good at asking questions that sparked conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really good class, overall. it covered many different aspects of marginality in Medieval Islamic societies and included many interesting readings. ",
            "\u00a0I really do not think this course could be improved. Professor Yadgar did a great job leading the discussions during class and he made sure all the students were very engaged throughout the class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, if you really want to learn about Medieval Islam by looking at how the Medieval Muslim communities treated \"outsiders\" then you should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class. If you're remotely interested in the material, it's a lot of fun to delve into and we definitely laughed a fair number of times. The structure makes a lot of sense and the readings are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It is a pretty niche topic - marginal groups in Medieval Islamic societies - however, it was a really fascinating class that discussed marginality in many different forms. The class included diverse and critical readings and engaged with a lot of different societies and histories. Professor Yadgar was great and was good at facilitating discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student for the following reasons: 1) The material is very interesting and not commonly studied 2) Professor Yadgar is a great professor and provides great information on how to become a better historian, writer, and researcher.
