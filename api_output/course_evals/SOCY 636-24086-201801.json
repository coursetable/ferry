            "\u00a0I have a better appreciation and understanding of how the social world can become literally embodied, both for human beings and other animals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned general knowledge about the fields discussed each section - from defining the relevant terms: culture, society, groups, networks, etc, to the accepted knowledge and areas of continued research. I was able to take away some insights about the fluid nature of scientific process as we were able to see some of the findings be debunked and challenged by subsequent research. Not only from the instructor, I was also able to learn from the other students as well. One example is applying human-independent measurements to different qualities such as intelligence, social behavior, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Truly how to explore hard questions in the social and biological sciences from multidisciplinary angles. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a tour de force with Professor Christakis, touching on all sorts of topics at the intersection of natural and social sciences. I found every single class inspiring, exciting, refreshing and highly educational. Professor Christakis is fond of asking students, \"Are you learning?\" And my answer for this class is a very definitely YES. Professor Christakis is a rockstar, and I feel so lucky to have been part of this small seminar with him. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging teacher, intelligent classmates, interesting readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time! ",
            "\u00a0This graduate seminar is a relaxed environment of learning that feels more like you have been invited to Professor Christakis' house for conversation about some of the leading papers on a given topic. Because of this, there is great rapport between students and the instructor, which sometimes leads to tangential conversations. But at the core of the class is a group of interested students, who have diverse backgrounds - some of the students in this year's class included students from School of Public Health, School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and others pursuing a PhD in fields such as Sociology and Comparative Literature, etc. This translates to students being more vocal in certain classes that they feel more comfortable in, which facilitates learning from one another as well as from the instructor. One challenge of the course is that many of the papers require an understanding of statistics to understand how the analysis was conducted. This can be a challenge to students without much background in statistics and may be helped by covering some basic statistical analysis techniques to bring everyone to the same page. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course.  ESPECIALLY THE DIGRESSIONS.  I would suggest trying to get students who are more familiar with Nicholas to hold back a bit and let others participate. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed every session of this class. The readings were interesting (though sometimes long) and the class discussion was always engaging. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Whether you think you are interested in the natural and social sciences or not, do yourself a favor and take this course. You'll learn a ton and it will change how you think about the world and the interactions between living beings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Well, consider this. Take a look at some of the topics that are discussed: social epigenetics, swarm intelligence, gene-environment interaction, behavioral genetics, social networks. These are some of the most interesting fields of research right now and research that has real applications. If that is not enough to excite you, consider who is teaching. Professor Christakis is a big name in the field and has a lot of interesting questions to ponder that he will throw at you during class that you will think about for the rest of the week: i.e. did culture evolve as a way for humans to respond to short term changes in environment? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend any class taught by Professor Christakis with great enthusiasm. This class was a tour de force with Professor Christakis, touching on all sorts of topics at the intersection of natural and social sciences. I found every single class inspiring, exciting, refreshing and highly educational.
