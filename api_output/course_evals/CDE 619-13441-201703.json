            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and think that it will greatly help in my ability to critically analyze the work of other epidemiologists and to develop my own projects. I also appreciate having Dr. Risch as a resource for future questions - he is very knowledgable and open to helping students learn. \r\n\r\nHowever, I have a few criticisms about this class:\r\nI think this course could be more clearly organized. I would have loved if the lectures could be placed in context before we dove in to really dense material - i.e. why are we learning this? how does it fit into what we've already learned in epi 1 and epi 2? how does it link to topics we have covered previously and topics we will cover in the future? Harvey is clearly very methodical, so I doubt he picked the order of lectures at random but I often felt that I spent a good part of the lecture trying to figure out what topic we were even talking about. EG. Lecture 9 - it was entirely unclear until the last page of the notes that we were talking about Poisson regressions. Knowing this before starting would have made it so much easier to follow along and build upon previous knowledge rather than scrambling to figure out what we are talking about.\r\n\r\nMore broadly: I don't understand why epi 1, epi 2, and this course don't take advantage of the potential to be taught as a series (it's as if the instructors have never discussed their syllabi/ course notes) and it does a great disservice to the students at YSPH who are asked to reinvent the wheel each semester instead of being encouraged to build on their already existing knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the challenging ways the professor pushes you to think about epidemiology and the controlled, fair pace of material. The key weakness is the lack of TA, who could help liaise/translate some of the high level stuff to us. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this class. It was very challenging, but the topic is interesting and very relevant to my career path. "

            "\u00a0Harvey is a great professor and clearly very knowledgable about epidemiology. One critique I have of this course is that it was made MUCH more challenging (and I think less helpful for students' future work) because all of the coding notes were in GLIM. I understand that this is the program that Harvey works with, but it made the course much less applicable to our own work because it was so hard to follow along. The material is quite complex and I think most PhD-level students are genuinely interested in learning this information so as to become better epidemiologists and researchers, but I felt like the ability of this course to directly benefit our work was dramatically hindered by also trying to piece together a knowledge of GLIM. Either you have to devote time to learning GLIM so as to be able to check your code (which is not a productive way for a doctoral student to spend their time) or you have to do the assignments in SAS and R and if you don't get the perfectly correct answer you have very little assistance in finding your mistake. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Risch is one of the few professors I have come across who truly cares that we understand the material, and he will sit with you over and over again until your query is answered (or at least until you feel more comfortable).  The professor would be very much helped with a TA who could support students' understanding of the course material.  Also, this would add to the professor's generosity of office hours and meeting out of class, since this high-level material takes time and several rounds of explanation to absorb.  The one major weakness of the professor's approach was the sometimes hard-to-read for some of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed Dr. Harvey's lecturing. I would suggest switching to powerpoint slides instead of written notes and having a TA to help students understand concepts after every lecture. The material is really hard to grasp so students feel lost throughout although things come together at the end. It would be great to have someone that can also teach the material from a student's perspective. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this course to you if you are looking to be challenged in thinking about epidemiological study design in new and more rigorous ways.  Be prepared to feel lost at times during the lecture (even if you have a mathematical background!), but keep pushing yourself to keep up.  Fortunately, the Professor moves at a fair pace, so it's really about getting the concepts and how you arrived there. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to students in the Epidemiology track. Unless you have taken courses in Biostats and regression, the concepts are very abstract and more difficult to understand without the foundation courses. "
