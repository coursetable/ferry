            "\u00a0This course taught me so much about ROman history and was so well-taught and amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the Roman Republic. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding for the methods that are used to study ancient societies--for example, prior to taking this course I didn't understand how archaeology could inform an historian but after taking this course I understand how these two disciplines intersect. ",
            "\u00a0The Roman Republic was a sweeping introduction to the history of the Romans from pre-foundation to the death of Caesar in 44 BC. Prof. Johnston does a good job mixing thematic lectures with chronological histories, although the pace invariably picks up towards the end of the semester.\r\nThis class and the Roman empire are fun introductions to ancient history, which is totally different from modern history courses in terms of both the source base (sparse) and the secondary scholarship (extraordinarily expansive, with endless revisionism). Prof. Johnston does a fantastic job wading through all of this and extracting what feels like a comprehensive and relatively neutral history. ",
            "\u00a0Fabulous survey of the Roman Republic. Learned much fundamental historian that is incredibly relevant for Western Civ. More so than Directed Studies or similar intro courses, in that sense. ",
            "\u00a0A little bit of everything! how to engage with material evidence (surprisingly not common in history courses!) especially those in the Yale collection, how to read primary sources against the grain (again, should be better emphasized in other courses) through cross references, how to think about something as distant as Republican Rome in close conjunction with early modernity or even modernity! Fantastic course that would be a great gateway to history courses for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much about the early history of Rome. I also learned how to write better and express myself clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Great background and insight into a foundational Western civilization. Prof. Johnston's emphasis on social memory also allowed me to interpret history through a new lenswhich is crucial for constructing identity and understanding a peoples from their own place. ",
            "\u00a0-I greatly expanded my knowledge of the Roman Republic and the ancient world more generally\r\n-I became a sharper reader of ancient texts; I also developed a better sense of how scholars assemble an understanding of the past when the historical record is limited\r\n-I developed a far greater recognition of the role of social memory and the extent to which our understanding of the past is informed and shaped by the interests/values of the present\r\n-I came away with a deeper appreciation for the importance of historical narratives/myths in contributing to societal identity and cohesion ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: Roman Republic from its very early and murky origins to the fall of Caesar\r\nSkills: Analysis of source material, synthesis of historical knowledge ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fantastic overview of the Roman Republic and a great introduction to a history course for anyone who hasn't taken one. After having taken The Roman Republic with Professor Johnston I am seriously considering a history major. ",
            "\u00a0This course really enabled me to gain knowledge of civilization in the Roman Republic and to understand its evolution from its rise to its decline. ",
            "\u00a0A proper understanding of the Roman Republic, its development, and how it is remarkably similar to aspects of our society today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the over arching military, social and political history of the Roman Republic from the founding to the assassination of Julius Caesar. This went well beyond the basic straight forward narrative and included a variety of in depth analysis. These included modern interpretations of historical literature and revelations made through archaeological discoveries. ",
            "\u00a0From a historiographical perspective, the Roman Republic is absolutely outstanding, both due to the nature of the Romans as well as Professor Johnston; you will gain a much better understanding of how biases affect historical sources. Professor Johnston has a strong focus on critically reading Roman primary sources and assessing the biases stemming from Roman aristocratic competitive culture. More specifically, this class is an excellent, excellent study of the Romans.\r\n\r\nIn general, I feel that many professors tend to treat history as the decisions of objective and (relatively) rational actors. In contrast, this course does an outstanding job showing how the Romans' unique religion, culture, social order, political structure, and so on all affected the Romans. You will learn the origins of these topics, how they developed over the course of centuries, how the developments of some affected the developments of other, and so on. Not only does this create an extremely holistic picture of the Romans, but it also will make you a stronger historian. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an absolutely enormous amount about Roman history from this course. Looking back on the course, it's actually astounding. I was previously vaguely familiar with Roman history - names like Hannibal, Cicero, and Caesar were familiar to me - but I had never formally learned about it. I am so, so happy that I took this class this semester and finally did learn about it, and in a comprehensive manner. The history is absolutely fascinating, and Professor Johnston presented it magnificently. He both emphasized the key facts and ideas but also included many fascinating details. ",
            "\u00a0There are two major takeaways I have from this course this semester. The first is the obviously better sense of the story of the Roman Republic, by the end of the course I felt I had achieved a general familiarity with the ups and downs of the republic and some of the major defining events and figures. The second takeaway is a better ability to engage with traditions that are located in murky areas of history. Especially because early Roman history is essentially completely undocumented, this class was a great opportunity to delve into the issues of analyzing and evaluating cultural memories and legends, and I think the course did a good job of guiding us through that process. "

            "\u00a0The course had two papers and two exams, and the professor prepares you for everything. there is a lot covered in lecture but a lot is thematic and flows together well. preparing for the exams is a little overwhelming but the content is interesting ",
            "\u00a0**I've used all caps for emphasis, but please read capitalized words as if they are italicized, not angry ranting.**\r\n\r\nUgh. This course has SO much potential, and I think it could be one of the best history lectures at Yale if Professor Johnston changed just a few small, mostly administrative things:\r\n\r\n1. End the class on time. Period. Every week goes over by a few minutes. The make-up lecture went over by almost 40 minutes, causing many people to miss lunch because the dining halls closed (his joke that \"at least you don't have to go to another lecture\" because it was the weekend, while true, showed that he did not understand that many of us have important meetings and also like to eat/can't afford to go to a restaurant if we miss a dining hall meal). When an occasional lecture goes a minute over, that's understandable. When every lecture ends 3-5 minutes late, forcing students to run to their next class twice a week, it gets really frustrating. And I find it very hard to engage with and enjoy a course when I'm frustrated by its administration.\r\n\r\n2. Cover all the material in its intended lecture. Professor Johnston got off track this year, which led him to spend the first 30 minutes of literally every lecture after fall break wrapping up the previous lecture. This turns into a cycle, and it's disorienting and does not create a great learning environment when you can't cover the whole lecture in the day it's intended. I think the major problem with this is that Professor Johnston visibly LOVES the material he teaches and struggles not to share all of it with us when time is short. Often, he can't stop himself from sharing admittedly interesting but ultimately unimportant stories from Roman history that do not really help us understand the broader themes and messages of the course. Then, when time is REALLY short, he flies through more important historical and political developments.\r\n\r\n3. Restructure the course's readings. The readings in the syllabus are already more than most other history lectures at Yale, but what was not apparent when shopping this class was that there are ADDITIONAL READINGS FOR SECTION, not included in the syllabus. I think this raises two major problems. FIRST, the syllabus should contain all the required readings. Sections should be to discuss these assigned readings, not ignore them and talk about other readings thrown at us that week. If the syllabus readings are intended to compliment lecture and the section readings are supposed to supplement this knowledgeas I now think was intendedMAKE THE CURRENT SYLLABUS READINGS OPTIONAL AND REQUIRE THE SECTION READINGS. Do not tell us we need to read everything if we won't be discussing or engaging with most of it. SECOND, the sheer volume of the readings hit a critical mass where it dismayed many students from reading ANYTHING at all. This was painfully obvious in my section at times. Professor Johnston should focus on quality over quantity with readings. Personally, it got to the point where I stopped doing any readings because it was simply too much time for material that we would not engage with.\r\n\r\n4. This one is more of a personal preference--although I know I'm not alone here--so I hope its inclusion does not discount my previous points, but I think it would be best to move the weekly quizzes to some other time, like mid-day Saturday or before the next week's first lecture. I take full responsibility for my poor planning and forgetfulness, but it would require two hands to count the number of times I had to leave social gatherings on Friday to go home and turn in the weekly quiz by midnight.\r\n\r\nI want to emphasize that I really do like Professor Johnston, and he seems like a genuinely wonderful guy and I would like nothing more in life than to have a beer with him and talk about Rome and life in general. I'm just being forthright in my response here with the hopes that he implements these changes to allow his class to achieve its full potential. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course and it's strong in that it has a lot of interesting material for anyone interested in classical civilization, early European history, or the Romans in general. Secondly, this course is strong in that Professor Johnston is clearly interested and brings an amazing amount of energy to his lectures and office hours. The course simply requires way more that I would expect for a history lecture though. \r\n\r\nThere is way too much reading. The readings for discussion section do not necessarily align with the readings assigned for lecture. Frankly, the course could use a bit more unity between discussion section and lecture. We spend too much time on readings instead of actually discussing questions from lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Johnston's lectures are engaging, thoughtful, if not a little disorganized at times. He focuses not simply on the events themselves, but the process and difficulties intrinsic and studying the history of such an ancient civilization. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely strong; Prof. Johnston's classes are among the best I've taken at Yale. The learning is well balanced between lectures, readings, and sections.\r\n\r\nImprovements: perhaps offer guidance on how to balance reading the primary and secondary sources assigned each week, as it can be tough to fit both in (in addition to the separately-assigned section readings) and it can be tough to guess what the most important items are to read each week.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I'm sure Prof. Johnston knows, the lectures would work better if they didn't consistently spill over into each other, so maybe try to hone them down a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0Sections, as with any lecture, are not the most interesting or helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic and I wouldn't change a thing. Some would say that the workload is significant, which is true except that all the work does help and nothing really could be cut from the syllabus without hurting its effectiveness. ",
            "\u00a0It is a lot of reading and information, but I think it is a fantastic course. I really gained a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0This course contains such a sheer amount of infowhich is both a benefit and weakness. Trying to understand all of the Roman Republic in a single semester is difficult and Prof. Johnston certainly tries but this means that students are often overwhelmed with information. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the material is extremely interesting and Johnston is a fascinating lecturer, which are definite strengths to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-The most obvious strength was Professor Johnstons gifts as a lecturer\r\n-The TFs were also excellent\r\n-The lecture handouts were helpful\r\n-I particularly enjoyed the reading/section discussion on the limits of archaeology \r\n-I appreciated having the freedom to choose our final essay topic\r\n-I liked that Professor Johnston always included suggestions for further reading; this enabled us to dig deeper when time and interest allowed\r\n-I found the weekly quizzes valuable, particularly come exam time. They made sure we stayed on track with digesting/internalizing the course content \r\n\r\nSuggestions for Improvement:\r\n-As someone new to the study of ancient Rome, I would have appreciated a crash course lecture at the start of the semester. Such a lecture would have given a birds eye overview of the Roman Republic and previewed the material to come\r\n-Professors in some of my other history courses have kicked off the semester this way, and Ive always found it very helpful\r\n-I would have appreciated more complete summaries at the end of each lecture/slide deck\r\n-I loved the coin room visit, but would suggest moving it to earlier in the semester ",
            "\u00a0Primary source readings are hugely appreciated ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Comprehensive and well-organized\r\n- Very engaging lectures and section\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Could have released section materials earlier (at the start of the week) instead of some time in the middle of the week. This gives us more time to actually prepare for section. ",
            "\u00a0The Roman Republic was very well organized, and Professor Johnston was great at making the material comprehensible. ",
            "\u00a0There were no weaknesses with this course. The professor and teaching fellows were so inspiring, invested in their students, and made it very easy for students to study effectively as well as be engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Professor Johnston's lectures, which are by far the best lectures I have ever sat in at Yale, as well as the course's ability to cover a vast amount of information in a very manageable and digestible way. No weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly well organized - within lecture, over the semester, and in the files on Canvas; a lot of extra reading materials available to those who were interested; though I hated taking them every week, the quizzes did help to solidify the basic facts that we learned in lectures\r\nWeaknesses: too much work for it being a lecture class - I don't believe that the sections should have extra readings outside of the readings already assigned for the week and I found it a little absurd that we had both a final exam and a 10 page paper (thank you for the blanket deadline extension though) ",
            "\u00a0The Roman Republic is one of the best-organized classes I have taken at Yale. The key themes are clearly laid out and well-explained; and their developments and co-developments are excellently used to demonstrate the history of Rome. Relatedly, I feel that the first half of the course was stronger than the latter half. This may inevitably due to the nature of the material and primary sources: earlier history tends to be more general and thematic, whereas later history is much more documented and specific. So, whereas the course begins with more macro-trends, the rest of the course focuses more on specific actors like Pompey, Cicero, and Caesar. ",
            "\u00a0This course really only has strengths. First, the content of the course itself was fascinating. Second, Professor Johnston's lectures, discussed below and above, were tremendous. Third, the assignment structure was reasonable - two essays, a midterm, and a final. The course has no major weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0As far as strengths, the course was pretty nicely balanced between narrative history and reflecting upon themes, and I felt that it was done in a non-confusing way. Additionally, the exceptionally high quality of the powerpoint presentations for lectures added a lot to the course and made studying a lot easier. I could tell that a lot of the animations took a long time, but I really thought the powerpoint were well above par. Third, although it could be easy at time to miss the deadlines, I think the weekly rhythm of quizzes and questions was a plus for the course. The questions forced me to reflect on the course material, and the weekly quizzes were a good way to leave a week behind more confident that I had understood the important concepts and characters. Finally, I thought the place assignment was an innovative and fun writing assignment (though one that still required effort).\r\n\r\nAs far as weaknesses or improvements, I think sometimes prioritizing the readings was difficult to do, although I think Professor Johnston did try to point to the more important parts at times. We also ran behind in a few lectures at the expense of some material that I would have liked to see. I appreciated the effort to conduct an abridged version when we started running behind, but it was a little strange by the end of the term when we could fully expect to cover half of the previous lecture and half of the current each class.

            "\u00a0If you genuinely want to learn about the Roman Republic, then this is probably the best way to do so, at least at Yale. Moreover, Professor Johnston is a genuinely really nice and passionate teacher, although he can get absorbed in the minutia during lecture and leave major themes undeveloped. But before you sign up for this course, you should be aware of several things:\r\n\r\n1. The lectures will often go 3-5 minutes over. If you have a class on science hill immediately after, be wary of signing up for this course.\r\n\r\n2. There are additional readings for seminar that are not in the syllabus. Most of the syllabi readings will never be discussed in section either. \r\n\r\n3. Grading is fair and similar to most history lectures at Yale. ",

For the record, I took the Roman Empire before I took the Republic and the switch in order was no problem (and actually kind of cool), so if you can't take the Republic this term just make sure you take the Empire in the spring!\r\n\r\nProf. Johnston is a fantastic lecturer with extremely well-made presentations that he goes through naturally and easily. He will take questions and is always happy to talk to students after class. I actually found the first lecture to be a little dry, but the course really picks up from there, so fear not if you missed the first lecture or weren't sure about it. He's also really friendly and fun to talk to in general.\r\n\r\nThe sections are low-key and Prof. Johnston and T.A.s work together to come up with some pretty fun discussion topics.\r\n\r\nThe workload is substantial but not killer. The roughest part is probably writing a ten-page paper AND taking a final exam, but the final honestly isn't that tough and gives you a lot of choice.\r\n\r\nTake it! You won't regret it! ",

The workload is a lot but Johnston and the TAs are incredibly understanding and accommodates for it, do not let the workload put you off. Be mindful though that he only offers it once in two years, so don't sleep on this gem. ",

            "\u00a0It is so hard for me to make a clear \"yes\" or \"no\" answer to this question. The class is great in the sense that you will learn so much and from a fascinating professor. However, I do think that there are structural issues with the class that made it difficult to learn. Prof. Johnston does tend to go overtimesymbolic of how much material he puts into each lecture. This is something you will have to reckon (and study) with. The lectures are thematic, making a chronological understanding of the course rather difficult. His weekly quizzes are beneficial to one's grade. But it requires regular studying and this class has such a significant amount of reading that it is near impossible to complete them all. Primary, secondary, and then additional readings for section (whereas most classes discuss the primary and secondary readings in section, not assigned additional). Take it if you are up for a challengebut do not treat this class as a gut. ",

I think any thoughtful inhabitant of the Western world ought to study this history. You will become a more complete human being and a more informed global citizen. \r\n\r\nMoreover, Professor Johnston is wonderful. He is articulate, passionate, and engaging. The reading is interesting and the workload (weekly quizzes, 2 papers, and 2 exams) is meaty, but manageable. In short, highly recommended! ",

Granted, I took this class credit/D and didn't do most of the work but I would have lost my mind if I was taking it for a grade. I wouldn't recommend the class if you're not truly invested in and excited about the Romans or ancient civilizations because the workload will quickly crush any less-than-enthusiastic feelings. ",
            "\u00a0The Roman Republic with Professor Johnston was absolutely one of my favorite classes I have ever taken. (In fact, this opinion was shared by friends who took this course as well). For background, I took this class fall of my senior year credit/D and have studied Roman history extensively, both in 7 years of Latin as well as other courses. Nonetheless, I learned a tremendous amount with every single lecture. Professor Johnston is perhaps the single best educator I have ever hadI know that is a very grand claim, but I found almost every aspect of The Roman Republic absolutely fantastic. It is evident that Professor Johnston is passionate about the topic and has devoted countless hours to crafting this course. Professor Johnston does an excellent job incorporating written primary historical sources, archeological evidence, sociological and anthropological studies, etcall to create an extremely holistic picture of who the Romans were, what motivated them, etc.  Moreover, The Roman Republic is perhaps one of the most thoughtfully-organized and well-structured courses I have taken; you get a clear sense of the most important themes and trends throughout Roman history, how these develop and affect one another, etc. Ultimately, Professor Johnson considers himself a cultural historian, and this has a strong, positive impact on his class. Whereas many professors tend to treat history as objective, timeless actors, Professor Johnston on the other hand excellently demonstrates how the socio-cultural, religious, and political contexts affect these great historical figures. Even if you aren't particularly interested in the Romans (well, you should be), this class will make you a better historian and provide invaluable background about the history of the Mediterranean and Europe as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any and all students at Yale. I think it is frankly a shame that classics aren't venerated in this day and age as they used to be. Perhaps by taking this course students in my generation will begin to realize how magnificent learning about the ancients can be. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Even if you are not interested in Roman history (I wasn't) Johnston will make you love to the material and make you want to be a classics major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in Roman history of course and interested in the legacies that the ancient world has left us. The course not only provides a huge amount of interesting information, but the class also gives you tools to analyze historical traditions and even to analyze one's own culture. There is a postmodern slant to the lectures, so strong opponents of that kind of perspective might not like that part, but it seems that this class often incorporates some of the best insights of that tradition. There are a lot of readings, but it is also easy to economize if you are pressed for time or particularly uninterested in a certain topic. Weekly quizzes are easy to prepare for (but easy to forget), and the examinations are preceded by ample information as to what to expect. "
