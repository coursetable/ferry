            "\u00a0This course is definitely designed for people who are very passionate about mol epi. It's pretty long, and the slides can get a little bit dull, and sometimes it's hard to completely understand the instructor - sometimes it seemed like this was the first time he was seeing the slides. That being said, it was great that we got to do labs, and I loved the approach that the instructor took towards assignments, which was essentially, write what you want on this overall topic and turn it in when you can. This really let me put more work into these assignments since I wasn't crunching for a due date. I LOVED that we got to take genetic testing kits. It's very easy, I will say, to put virtually no work into this class. ",

I found that the first few lectures covered very basic material and wished the course were a bit higher-level/ more in depth. It seemed that the majority of those in the class were not familiar at all with molecular or genetic techniques and had never lifted a pipet. I wish that there was a bit more class discussion and more thoughtful attention to the course. However, Professor Zhu is wonderful and understood how busy everyone's schedules were. ",

            "\u00a0This course is weak in that the primary instructor has difficulty communicating difficult concepts. The homework was distributed in an informal fashion without clear due dates or expectations. On the day of final presentations, the professor left the room, for a mid-presentation break, and failed to return for at least 20-minutes and did not schedule a re-start time. \r\n\r\nOverall, a lot of material was covered. However, learning of the material was inhibited by the professors lack of organization and communication skills. ",

            "\u00a0Very nice course. It explains really well molecular and cell biology concepts and makes you think critically about potential studies that can be set up to attempt to explain the mechanisms of environmental exposures and their link with diseases. It is a new field of study that has the potential to ascertain mechanisms of toxicity or explain away variance that would be otherwise unexplained in classical epidemiological studies. \r\nIt can also identify certain pathways and genes that can be really helpful for treatment or explain the effect of environmental exposures.

He takes a very relaxed view of teaching, clearly prioritizing us learning rather than teaching to a test or assigning busy work.
