            "\u00a0I learned to write character-driven fiction. I really appreciated the overall structure of the course--the tutorials on \"reading for plunder\" and characterization that Caz gave in the beginning of the semester were clear and easy to understand and made a great difference in my fiction and other genre writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of focusing on character development in short-story writing. Prof. Phillips taught us numerous strategies to enhance our character design and to facilitate strong story structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to workshop my peers' stories, discussing and providing feedback. I learned more about how to write a character driven story and also learned different story telling devices. What makes a story good, and what drives it. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a foundation in the writing of fiction. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to develop my short story writing skills and my ability to critique other people's stories. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what my pitfalls were not just as a fiction writer, but as a writer in general. I learned how to construct a believable world and how to read like a writer. I find myself rereading books with a new set of eyes these days. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: The clearly scheduled and established guidelines on story length (8-15 pages) and workshop dates (each person will workshop two stories over the course of the semester) made scheduling my writing for this class very straightforward.\r\nWeaknesses: Not really a weakness, but by virtue of the timeline/being at the mercy of you and your classmates writing to the last minute, the bulk of the pre-workshop reading (a total of 16-30 pages of your peers' writing) would happen in the two days immediately before class. (For Fall 2018, this meant that you would receive two stories on Sunday night to read in advance for Tuesday afternoon workshop). So although you can write on your own schedule, just note that you won't necessarily be able to distribute your readings for this class over the course of the week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Caz gives good feedback. Solid workshop dynamic. Brings in occasional outside materials to teach us by example.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved to learn even more of Caz's formal/structural strategies for short story writing and character development. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are being able to meet with Professor Phillips for feedback and the workshops were also very helpful. I also thought the couple writing assignments at the beginning were useful and interesting. A weakness was that at times I wasn't sure how my writing actually was, and couldn't tell if I was headed in the right direction. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course would be Caz' insightfulness and dedication. He is a fantastic teacher, who is extremely helpful in terms of improving one's instincts as a fiction writer. Private conferences with him are the most useful, I'd say, as the workshop itself tends to be on the critical side. In fact, Caz' might be the single most critical workshop environment in which I've participated at Yale. I can remember several 15-20-minute workshops during which not a single compliment was uttered regarding a particular story. This isn't to say the stories were bad; it was, rather, a product of Caz frequently beginning workshops by asking: What's wrong with this piece? Often, we never circled back to saying what was working in a particular piece. Positives of a piece would often come only during private conferences. ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 465 is like other fiction courses at Yale - which means it was great! My only slight complaint is that I would have preferred that students' pieces were due a full week before the workshop, instead of the Sunday before a Tuesday workshop, because then we would have more time to carefully read the other students' pieces and comment on them. ",
            "\u00a0This class is honestly incredible. No complaints here. Since a lot of the class is mostly driven by student discussion, I could see how having a class with a low level of engagement could really affect the overall experience. But I guess I lucked out. Everyone in class truly cared and gave careful feedback. "

        [
            "\u00a0Caz does a great job teaching the class how to write character-driven fiction. The class is well-scheduled, and the class expectations were established early on. \r\nJust note that the mental workload of fiction writing (you never really stop thinking about your stories/how you want to write them) is very different from academic writing. I took Caz's class in addition to another creative writing workshop, and, although there is no longer a restriction on taking multiple creative writing courses in a semester, it can be a pretty stressful experience. It's totally ok--and maybe even ideal--to focus on one creative writing class at a time. ",
            "\u00a0I've taken all the fiction workshops Yale has to offer, and Caz does it excellently. He really hones in on character development, so don't plan to mess around with formal tricks in your stories. Gives great feedback. Obviously this course depends on the class dynamic and ours was great, so keep a close eye on who else is in your class, and if you think that they take writing seriously and will offer you feedback, do it. Caz takes you seriously and can help you on your path to being a fiction writer! ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any student who wants to pursue fiction writings and wants to improve and have time to read other students' writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Caz' capacity to diagnose the main problems in a piece in a subtle and specific way is unparalleled.  That said, his workshop manner, so to speak, can sometimes feel dated. More on that later. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as you are prepared to put in the personal effort to improve your writing - you'll get out of this class what you put into it in terms of time spent revising your piece, talking to Caz and reading contemporary short fiction.  Good whether or not you want to go into writing as a career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely. Very rarely do you get the opportunity to have everyone's eyes on your paper. In this class, you get that opportunity twice. Take this class even if you are not a fiction writer. It will improve your nonfiction writing as well as your skills as a reader. "
