            "\u00a0Flipped class is awful. The videos don't supplement lecture well, and you often end up confused. They also often don't teach you enough to do the post-video quiz well. Luckily, Sudesh was a fantastic instructor and made up for the videos. ",
            "\u00a0Flipped classrooms suck. Being tested on material from videos before you even walk in the door sucks. However, you can still have a positive experience with this class if you get a good professor (100% recommend Sudesh). ",
            "\u00a0I think this class would benefit from changing the style of videos that were watched before each class. The videos (b/c this was a flipped class) weren't very engaging and often made the topic more confusing than it should have been. Also, some of the professors seem to have been better equipped to teach than others, so definitely choose your professor wisely. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there are many review sessions and practice tests given before exams that prepare you well. However, the pre-class videos are very time-consuming and unhelpful. The class is very dependent on who your professor is. Luckily, I got a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0This course was horrible. The flipped classroom didnt work at all because the videos we had to watch each night did not really match the problems we were given so my math teacher had to end up just teaching us all class because we were so confused. And then we didnt get to do many practice problems. Horribly designed course. ",
            "\u00a0The videos aren't much help and felt unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0I know that this is a very unpopular opinion among students of this course but I actually found the videos very helpful. I found the prep quizzes even more helpful. I encourage the university to maintain this course as a flipped course. However, perhaps the contents of the videos can be changed to better suit the students' needs and tastes. I found my lecturer (Sudesh Kalyanswamy) and his teaching style absolutely excellent and I encourage the other lecturers to adopt some his teaching methods. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the teachers were very engaged in teaching the material during class time. However, others did not teach but rather, provided only practice problems for the students during class. The flipped course style was not very helpful in teaching the students. The videos were not adequate for the students to self-learn the material and many students seemed to have trouble understanding the information just through videos and practice problems. ",
            "\u00a0The pre-class videos were not very effective in teaching the course material and did not seem to be very relevant to the class. They were good examples of real world application but I do not feel they aided in the learning of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the fact the material is organized in a logical way and the midterms were broken down appropriately. However, the \"flipped classroom\" aspect of this course as a whole was tough for me as a student. I learn better through lecture rather than through video. Additionally, the examples shown in the videos were not conducive to my understanding on the quizzes. Therefore until I switched into the section with my current professor, I was really having a hard time understanding what was going on. Thankfully, my section Professor decided to include lectures anyways, helping me learn.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the videos, I suggest that if they are going to be a component of the class, that they show 3-5 examples starting from the basic problems to more advanced questions like those found in the quizzes. There could also be in-video links that can take viewers directly to the hard problems if that's all they need. ",
            "\u00a0My time in class was extremely productive and educational.\r\n\r\nFrom what I've heard, the teaching clarity varied a lot by section. I was very lucky to be in the section I was in, but some sort of standardization may be helpful. My answers to questions 4-6 are about my instructor (Sudesh) in particular.\r\n\r\nThe review sessions could use a lot more transparency.\r\nFirst, it would be helpful to know when they are further in advance. Yale schedules are busy as is, so squeezing two hour blocks into the schedule can be hard on a few days' notice. Plus, some sessions were scheduled at times that were clearly a burden on students (e.g. 5-7, which is almost the entirety of the dinner hour). \r\nSecond, knowing which lecturer is leading which review session. As mentioned above, different lecturers' were of varying levels of helpfulness in review sessions, so it would really help to know who is leading in advance. Especially during reading period, time is really valuable and leaving the library to sit in a session for 30 minutes and realize it's not useful can disadvantage students.\r\n\r\nI'm sure others have mentioned this as well, but the videos varied in helpfulness. I, unlike a lot of my classmates who voiced their opinion, did find the videos to be useful, but some of them were more confusing than helpful. The videos that tried to apply concepts to problems that would not be tested were especially confusing (e.g. special relativity). As a non-physics major, the addition of new concepts on top of the math I was learning only further confused me. ",
            "\u00a0I like how this course is a flipped class, however, the videos were not always helpful. For example, the examples that John Rolph went through in the videos did not help with the quizzes or the problem sets, but the overall important information he went over did. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that a lot of people in the course have already taken and excelled at Calc BC in high school, which makes it harder for people who are seeing all of this material for the first time. I think that there should be more restrictions on who can take this class. Also, there is a lot of material for this class and it moves pretty fast. ",
            "\u00a0The last half is a bit rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths was the course material but the weakness was the flipped classroom model. I fortunately got placed into a class with a great instructor, but other students were not so fortunate and struggled with the flipped classroom. ",
            "\u00a0If they changed the video and quizzes before class, it would be better. My teacher was very good. He was clear and concise ",
            "\u00a0The instructor for my section was very good. I really appreciated his efforts to explain the essence of things we were learning, rather than just giving us the formulas and methods for solving problems. However the course is trying to cover to many topics in just one semester, so we were able to only skim over them. This may result in students forgetting some parts of the course, and not being able to apply it in settings different from ones that were covered in class. I also didn't like the flipped course concept, because it was very time consuming and not very helpful and the videos were very often poorly structured and not directly related to the material covered in class the following day. ",
            "\u00a0course was well organized and effective. the online homework videos and quizzes however weren't always helpful and were sometimes even more confusing. in addition, the course wide review sessions for the midterms and final could also be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses - videos were too long, videos only gave simple answers to simple examples, exams were more difficult than they needed to be especially compared to the exams given in years past ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course is the flipped classroom setting. The videos often gave examples before fully presenting the material, making concepts more confusing than they needed to be. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped nature of the class (watching videos online first and then coming into section) did it little favor. The videos were very introductory compared to the level of challenge presented by the problem sets, though Sudesh did his best to supplement it. In general, the class went on as if it wasn't flipped, but simply had a higher expectation of work. I would suggest not allowing it to be defined as flipped, and have the videos as extra help or introduction to people who need it. Teach in class, as that's what we're in college for. "

            "\u00a0For a person interested in engineering or math like I am, I would recommend this course. However once again, I would suggest that this course be structured more traditionally. I would prefer the material to be lectured upon first and THEN followed by the practice problems that same evening to test understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - and I would especially recommend Sudesh. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Workload wasnt bad but it was a good amount. My professor was amazing. They should change the videos and quizzes before class or get rid of them altogether. ",
            "\u00a0I would, the topics could be covered in a better way, but the course covers some of the fundamental topics and provides students with knowledge crucial to any stem major. ",

            "\u00a0Don't take it unless you have to or you love math.\r\n\r\nIf you do take it, take it with Sudesh he is AMAZING ",
            "\u00a0The experience you have in this course seems to be pretty heavily linked to your instructor, so I'd recommend shopping a few sections. I took it with Sudesh, and actually enjoyed it for the most part. "
