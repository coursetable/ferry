            "\u00a0This course is very fast paced, and while the reverse lecture style course can hep some students, it made some topics more difficult to understand and learn. Overall, the explorations were not productive because of this. I would have preferred to complete them after class. ",
            "\u00a0The psets sometimes had materials or problems not covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is definitely working through practice problems in class. Another strength is the ample review sessions offered before exams. A weakness of the course would be not receiving as much feedback from completed problem sets to use for practice before exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think that my class was taught well. However, from taking to other math 115 students, I think that the course is taught differently in each class, depending on which professor you have. I think each class should be taught in a similar style (not exactly the same). But, I remember going to a review session and the professor was reviewing a topic in a totally different way from how I was taught it. Also, my class was taught through guided notes while other classes. Overall, I just found it odd that the same class was taught so differently based on your professor, but then every class would be assessed by the same tests. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it is unfortunate that this class is so hard for people who have never taken integral calculus before. Many students who have taken it are at an advantage when it comes to taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0Having a flipped class was difficult ",
            "\u00a0It is well organized. However, a weakness is that I wish there were a better way to prepare us for midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Better and more lenient opportunities for students to improve their grade ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot in a very short amount of time. There is not enough teaching done for the difficulty of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Organized class in which expectations for problem sets, pre-class explorations, and tests were very clear. Course coordinator does a great job of facilitating everything. In-class packets are very helpful. Weaknesses: Practically no feedback on problem sets, just a grade. Psets are submitted online and very rarely are you able to view a corrected PDF of your problem set. Students should be able to receive more feedback on their learning. The class features pre-class explorations where students walk through the concept before coming to class (and fill out an easy quiz that you can take multiple times that's essentially graded on completion), and while the explorations were sometimes nice in helping to orient my mind for a concept, I think the class should keep them to multiple choice only. There was never any feedback on the explorations, and since written answers aren't graded by the computer (and are often more confusing than a multiple-choice question), they created more confusion than clarity. ",
            "\u00a0Great coursw ",
            "\u00a0I did not find the exploration assignments before class helpful at all. The review sessions before exams, going to class in general, and office hours were strengths because most of instructors for Math 115 are pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are straight forward and the class is clearly designed for student comprehension and engagement. "
