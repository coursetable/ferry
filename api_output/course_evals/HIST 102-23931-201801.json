            "\u00a0I garnered a deeper understanding of world history - both specific to the world circa 1500 and a general lens for how to interpret historical events. This class helped me think like a historian while illuminating trends from the 15th through 17th centuries around the world. I learned about environmental history, looked at the roles of different minority groups during this time like women in the Harem and in convents in Europe, and thought about themes of capitalism, colonialism, and imperialism. I also enjoyed looking at the same event from the perspectives of different groups of people (like the fall of Constantinople). The comparison of different perspectives was enlightening. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge regarding global interactions in Afro-Eurasia and the Atlantic in the Early Modern period. I developed skills of analyzing events from multiple perspectives, such as the European and Ottoman perspectives of the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that the world is more complicated and, principally, larger than I could have imagined. Even in 1500, the globe was as difficult, contested, and contestable place as the one we know today. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course seeking a credit in my concentration, World Economy. I feel that I earned it, inasmuch as economic history was concerned.  However, I felt that the Ottoman history was much more novel and interesting than the European section, most of which was repetitive after taking an introductory European history course in high school. ",
            "\u00a0A decent understanding of the World Circa 1500, though I found it to be somewhat superficial at times. I think the course helped me improve my writing, though mostly because of the nature of the assignments, rather than the feedback I received.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting parts of the course were those that went into greater detail and depth. For example, I particularly enjoyed learning about how gender and power intersect in the production of glass in Murano, Venice. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how interconnected the world was circa 1500. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at history more globally, and I really appreciated that. I had never taken a world history course before, and I really appreciated the different perspectives on different historical events, empires, and peoples. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned about trading and the relationships between countries and empties in the world circa 1500. We learned about how different parts of the world were interconnected and how they maintained power. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an increased knowledge on how the world circa 1500 was connected and also, how it was not. This class taught me the importance of cultural developments, among each nation, in coordination with other nations and states. ",
            "\u00a0A broad overview of historical processes that began/changed around 1500 ",
            "\u00a0Recognizing the role that religion played on the political stage of the World Circa 1500. ",
            "\u00a0Great class and overview of everything that was happening in the world around year 1500. Learned extensively about the period and not only about the rulers and major events. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about the world circa 1500 and the events that happened during the time. What was it like to survive climate during the time, and the ways in which people had to adapt to the changing world. "

            "\u00a0This course could offer a more consistent reading load each week. Some weeks the reading took under an hour; other weeks it took several hours. This made planning my schedule each week harder. \r\nThe course, however, had no other drawbacks. I enjoyed the whole experience - what I learned, what I read, what I wrote about, and what we discussed in section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course places much more emphasis on learning than on work. Lectures are clear and insightful, and readings offer deeper insight into the material. Section is very useful; taking notes on IDs during each section makes studying for the final quiz much easier. The assignments are quite reasonable and straightforward, and there are no tricks.\r\nWeakness: There is no way to get the material from a missed lecture aside from asking somebody else for their notes, which, if hand-written, may be illegible. If lecture notes (written either by an instructor, TF, or paid note-taker) were posted to Canvas for each lecture, it would be quite useful. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had been given lectures on all the distinct regions/civilizations at the time. We didn't get enough on Africa or Asia, though the class covered Europe, the Middle East, and to some extent China and the \"New World\" quite exhaustively. The professors and TFs made constant references to \"themes of the course\" without articulating much of what those themes were exactly. A simple, straightforward handout of themesand of civilizations/regionswould have cleared this up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nexcellent professors\r\nMiddle Eastern history is under-covered at Yale, so it was good to have a foundation in it from this course.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nEuropean history section was repetitive and didn't fundamentally change the way I think about European history. \r\nGuest lecturers are uneven. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very useful selection of readings, short and always interesting. Fascinating professors, and motivated TAs. Very reasonable workload. The highlight was a lecture on maps by Prof. Ayesha Ramachandran, who delivered what was maybe the best lecture of the semester. Mind-blowing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not very challenging. Section could be basic and not very rigorous, even though I realize this is supposed to be an introductory survey course. \r\nThe major weakness, however, was that the broad themes that the instructors wanted us to take away from the course were only flagged very briefly early on in the semester and again towards the end, rather than signposted throughout the semester. This meant studying for the final exam required a certain amount of re-organization to understand how all the different parts of the course connected with each other. Also requiring us to learn 112 IDs to test us on 5 feels slightly unfair, especially on very broad ones like \"the Ottoman Empire.\" Also, I wish we had read at least one article by Sanjay Subrahmanyam, particularly when we were studying early modern individuals. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Attention to specific points of data throughout different periods of time; connecting dots (ie Coffee) between vastly different and spread areas, crossing general fields of study; whereas normally only an Ottoman scholar would discuss coffee in the Ottoman world and only an English historian would discuss coffee in England, this class discusses both settings.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too broad to really do the entire world justice in only one semester. It had a tendency towards simplification and spheres of study, rather than a holistic field of study. Discussing the Italian Renaissance is all well and good, but in a course about the entire world it would help if that discussion included impacts beyond Italy itself. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a challenge for the professors to really give an all encompassing perspective of the period, given that every professor has a specialty. The class definitely focused a lot more on Europe and the Ottoman Empire than maybe it should have.\r\n\r\nI think overall this was a great introduction to the period and touched on every major region at least briefly.\r\n\r\nI appreciated that guest lecturers were brought in periodically to cover specific material. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes time to examine the role of women and some historically disenfranchised or ignored peoples in most world history courses. However, I wish that it had taken into account the role of people of color in a more active role. We learned a lot about the Muslim world, which was great, but any discussion of Africa was cursory or for the role of pointing out European domination. There were African kingdoms with real power around 1500 and I felt this was really ignoring those stories, which I was disappointed with. A global history class should really be global. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked how you had to attend class in order to understand the material and take good notes because the slides did not have a lot on them that were uploaded. This made students more engaged in the class and forced them to listen in lecture and actually go to class. I liked the material that we learned about--both lecturers were very passionate and were very knowledgeable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought that sometimes it was a bit tricky of a class--like for example, the map quiz was tricky and not straightforward like they said it would be. The class could have been organized better and for helpful with assignments and preparation for tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of developing narratives of histories in multiple regions of the globe. However, I thought the course could have involved more information regarding Chinese culture and history during the time period of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the scope and topics covered, as well as the team-teaching format that provides multiple sides of a topic. Weaknesses are a loose organization of curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is an interesting topic and easy to pay attention to.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses are that some of the information seems a little arbitrary and it is difficult to access information with no textbook and limited information on the powerpoints. ",
            "\u00a0The course is way too broad. It scrapes the surface of trends from 1300-1700, very occasionally diving a little deeper into one episode of politics or religion. It's a class that teaches facts, not how to think. ",
            "\u00a0Very insightful into the history of our world. ",
            "\u00a0The class is exceptional at outlying how the World was changing during this time and comparing how it related to previous times. Great at showing how some important characteristics of the human society such as globalism, toleration, cultural exchange, slavery, racism developed during this time. The problem is that the class covers actually a very broad period of time and hence it is difficult to go into more depth in certain topics. Great assignments for the class that helped in the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting course with a lot of material. It was difficult at times to stay organized and during a certain time period since it was a broad class, but that also helped me learn a lot more. Great Professors. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you're interested in history, world themes, or geopolitical foundations, then I would recommend this class. Obviously these topics aren't interesting to everyone BUT I do think it's a useful class that lots of people should take. It has aided my general understanding of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Whether you are a deeply invested history major or a STEM major trying to get a humanities credit, you will learn a great deal from this course. There is a low workload, but a great deal of learning. The assignments and quizzes are all straightforward. The professors said that there are \"no tricks,\" and they meant it. If you pay attention in lecture and section and do the (relatively short) weekly readings, you will be very successful in this course. Plus, all assignments and quizzes happen before reading period starts, so you can focus on studying for other finals during that time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take. The World Circa 1500 is a fascinating and complicated place, essential to our understanding of the present. Professors Trivellato and Mikhail are wonderful, and deeply invested in student satisfaction and learning. ",
            "\u00a0Depends. I needed this course to get a credit towards my major, and am glad I did, but I wouldn't recommend it for fun. I think a different Middle Eastern history class would be much more useful. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if 1) you are trying to learn how to be a good History student, 2) you are interested in the early modern era. But even in the case of 2), I would rather recommend more advanced courses taught by Prof. Trivellato or Prof. Pincus or Prof. Wrightson. The early modern era fascinates me, and I wish we had spent more time on some of its most interesting aspects, like trading companies or the intricacies of the Portuguese maritime empire in the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, if you are a first-year or a sophomore just starting off in the major, this is an ideal -- perhaps essential -- place to start, and an easy PI credit if you are still looking for one of those. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to those who want a broad overview of the early modern period. This class is not a lot of work, but the lectures are engaging and you learn a lot. The reading is super minimal compared to other history classes, and TFs give great feedback on papers. Also, the major writing assignment involves analysis of film, and it was actually really fun to do. \r\n\r\nThis is a good class for non-history people to take for a taste of the history department at Yale without all of the work typical of history classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good introductory history course and makes more of an effort to include a diversity of narratives than many other history courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! The material and regions studied were diverse, and discussed the period from a variety of perspectives. I really enjoyed learning about the role of gender, food, and law in the societies we studied. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student as it combines the knowledge of historical narratives along with the importance of understanding the intent and perspective of authors and plots. The teaching is fabulous and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a good introductory history lecture for someone with a broad interest in world history ",
            "\u00a0I would if they enjoyed history. ",
            "\u00a0The course is mediocre. Professors Trivellato and Mikhail are talented, but the material is painfully broad and only scratches the surface. Lectures often felt unnecessary- nothing you couldn't learn from Wikipedia. It's a class that teaches facts, not how to think. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely for anyone interested in learning how globalism, slavery, cultural exchange, racism, (lack of) religious toleration developed over time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course with great professors and TA's. Very helpful to know about the past. "
