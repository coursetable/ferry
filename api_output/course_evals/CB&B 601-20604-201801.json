            "\u00a0Lecturers were engaged and interested. Material was broad and interesting. Great! ",
            "\u00a0There should be a clearer outline of the absence policy, and I think allowing students to miss one class and make it up by writing a summary would be more fair than requiring the class be repeated. Also mentors and papers should be assigned based on the interests of the student in order for us to get the most out of this. ",
