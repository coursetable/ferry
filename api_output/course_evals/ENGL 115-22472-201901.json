            "\u00a0I read a diverse selection of literature by Asian diasporic authors, and got a sense of the most important thinkers in Asian American studies and other related fields. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course during my Yale experience and I'm so glad I had the opportunity to teach it. Being of the Asian Diaspora, this course allowed me to look through similar experiences through the lens of socioeconomic mobility, gender, sexuality, and racial interactions. Before this course, my examination of literature has been confined to white writers, resulting in a fundamental disconnect between the characters and value presented in those novels and mine. I'm so thankful to have had this course to learn about not only my role as an Asian American in the elite space I occupy, but also just writing styles and ethical dilemmas that ethnic writers face that aren't apparent for white writers. This course bolstered my writing by teaching me to dig deeper with my analysis and how to structure long, complex thoughts. I can't thank Yale enough for this course. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned to write much better. Specifically, my ability for close analyses have improved tremendously. I am much more confident in my writing, and I have learned how to write a long research paper while the information engages the thesis. ",
            "\u00a0This was truly one of the best classes I have ever taken during my first year at Yale. As an Asian American, it was incredibly empowering to read texts by authors of the Asian diaspora. It was fascinating to read literature through the lens of class, race, and gender. Moreover, I learned how to streamline my writing, analyze texts through multiple perspectives, and even write creatively with a music review at the end! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to craft an argument through the lens of the asian diaspora. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop skills for improving writing skills regarding analyzing fiction on Asian Diaspora in addition to learning so much about the discussion on the topic. It was overall a very intriguing and worthwhile experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read and engage with texts more analytically. I also learned how to write my own research paper. ",
            "\u00a0-a lot of theory, literature, and current perspectives on the Asian diaspora\r\n-how to elevate my prose in academic essays "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course had several readings, some more interesting than the others, but overall a new experience apart from literature we usually read in school. Overall the seminar style was very interactive, and the course topic is so interesting that it's hard not to be engaged in class! ",
            "\u00a0This course facilitated great discussion of vital topics pertaining to the diaspora and was just a great medium for me to explore the Asian diaspora. If anything, I wish we could have gotten funding for a class field trip to a diaspora museum perhaps to add to the experience. ",
            "\u00a0Scarlet is a very wonderful person. She is able to meet with you often for your writing and for a good time. I greatly enjoyed her one on one meetings with me. Another strength is the environment of the class created by Scarlet and the students, where people are able to comment and Scarlet is able to extend that idea and ask new questions.\r\n\r\nI did not like the writing workshops very much. I felt that was not very productive. ",
            "\u00a0The class was especially engaging and the choice of texts were incredible. I do wish that some of our discussions were slightly more structured/ we talked a little bit more about specific parts of the text instead of general ideas- but there was generally a good balance between the two. ",
            "\u00a0weaknesses - I think ENGL 115 should have more meetings with the professor as a part of the course. \r\nstrengths - I loved learning and looked forward to classroom discussions ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a wide array of readings over the course of the semester, but I wish the material was less East Asian-centric. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: What an amazing class! Scarlet has a very thoughtfully crafted syllabus filled with amazing Asian diaspora writers, such as Jhumpa Lahiri, Chang Rae Lee, and Min Jin Lee, as well as must-know scholars like Lisa Lowe. The class emphasizes a very intersectional approach, so our discussions of race, diaspora, and immigration also considered gender, sexuality, history, geography, context, and above all, nuance! I also like that we read a mix of scholarly texts and literature, and I think the process of reading both strengthened my understanding in each. \r\n\r\n(An aside: I wish I could take ten more classes like Writing the Asian Diaspora, but Yale is sorely lacking in Asian American studies classes.) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any at the moment. Maybe I wish we had more readings but also I think the workload was enough as is. "

            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in reading Asian authors and talking about the Asian diaspora and history, this course is so fun and will at least expose you to new literature and pioneering Asian scholars. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! This was hands down the best class I've taken at Yale. Whether you're a member or not of the Asian diaspora, this is a fascinating topic to explore through amazing literature and discussions with the class. Highly highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I definitely recommend this course to another student. This is my favorite class I have taken at Yale  the teacher is great, you improve your writing, and you are able to get close to other students in this learning-conducive environment. Although you may struggle a little in the beginning, your writing will improve if you meet with her and talk to her about your writing (or just talk to her for fun!) ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! I learned so much about myself through these texts. The improvements in my writing has already affected my writing for other classes. This was also an incredibly fun class. The professor is fun and engaging and she really tries her best to meet and help each student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Asian diaspora and Asian literature is such a hidden gem in English literature courses. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to learn more about the history of Asian diaspora and engage with all types of texts. I would highly recommend to anyone interested in taking a class about Asian history. There's something special about being able to learn about your own cultural history and see writers of color on the syllabus. Our class had a really great connection, and I wish there were other classes similar to this that I could take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 200%. \r\n\r\nFirst, Yale has basically no Asian American studies classes. I took Asian American History and I took this class, and those two classes make up something like one-third of Asian American studies classes at Yale. So if you have a chance to take an Asian American studies class...take it! \r\n\r\nSecond, reading the works of Asian diaspora writers is something I already enjoy doing, so this class just allowed me to take a hobby and call it homework. Scarlet is also the perfect person to lead discussions about Asian diasporic writing with, so I felt that we had extremely rich discussions on all our readings that made me feel a lot more confident about our readings. \r\n\r\nThird, Scarlet Luk is an amazing instructor, and taking the class is worth it for the reason of getting to know Scarlet!
