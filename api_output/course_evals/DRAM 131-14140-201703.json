            "\u00a0The course felt like a very broad overview of many different aspects of marketing, and while the visiting guests were welcome additions(in all but one case), we never got to dive into any specific aspects of marketing in depth. Consequently, I felt underprepared going into the final project and did not understand what was expected of me. "

            "\u00a0I understand that instructions for the final project were purposefully vague, but it made the feedback on this project (which carried the most influence on my final course grade) feel like it was as much the instructors fault for not setting clear expectations as it was mine for not meeting them. For example, a comment was that my choice of presenting theater may not be realistic and that I didn't talk about finances or revenue enough. But when I presented my idea and presenting theater for approval the response was \"I'd like to see that show\" and when I asked how do I know what are realistic financial expectations, I was given an arbitrary number. If this was going to be factored into my final grade, I would have liked more critical feedback earlier in the process of putting together that presentation. "

            "\u00a0The final project was challenging in certain aspects as there were aspects that I felt unprepared for.  For example, further understanding of a budget and roll out schedule would be helpful. While there are many ways to do a marketing plan, it would have been very helpful to look at one for the more quantifiable aspects of the project. ",
            "\u00a0If examples of marketing plans are not going to be provided, I would have an intermediate draft submission so that students can make adjustments and corrections before their final presentation. "
