            "\u00a0I think Erich is an excellent resource. Any failure or lack of understanding on my end is merely due to my hard-headed nature of trying to figure things out on my own before asking for help- I usually waste an unfortunate amount of time with this methodology. I feel like I learned a lot- definitely enough to communicate what I want out of a Beckhoff system, and would have learned even more if I had a more open production schedule this semester.\r\n\r\nThe syllabus was probably too ambitious, so I would recommend having both an A and B portion of this class. I think while I learned a lot - I just wish I had more time with it in a class environment. ",

",
            "\u00a0It would be really nice to get some facetime with a Beckhoff Rep as a part of this course. To better understand how they look at entertainment, and to figure out some of the stranger parts of the software. "
