            "\u00a0This course was an awesome introduction to the world of research in Neuroscience and its application to our daily lives. While this class was focused on the development of the adolescent brain, I learned a lot about how Neuroscience research done and its influence on policy formation and our daily lives.  In addition, I left the class feeling more confident with my ability to read research articles and think critically about said articles. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding as to how brain functionality changes across the lifespan, as well as an appreciation for how the developmental trajectories associated with brain development may account for differences in behavior, especially during adolescence, and how these developmental changes are taken into account in therapies and the legal system.

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-very engaging material\r\n-incredible professor \r\n-not too much weekly work\r\n-exams are short and Professor Casey's reviews are very good at letting you know what will appear on the exams\r\n-the debate is engaging and a lot of fun! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-while the exams generally are pretty easy, each question is worth a lot of points, so if you get two multiple choice or True/False  questions wrong, you are already down to an A- (on the exam). I would rather Professor Casey ask more questions so that each question is worth less. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings were very concise and helpful in introducing the lecture topics; the lectures were very helpful and engaging \r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Fun, interesting, applicable, engaging course!! BJ Casey is a fantastic professor who is clearly very passionate about her work and teaching. She makes it easy to do well and really cares more about you understanding the material than trying to trip you up with unnecessarily hard tests. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Generally fairly engaging, material is interesting but never challenging (unless you're not a nuero/bio/psych major, but even then it's not bad at all), BJ Casey is a very pleasant professor who is responsive to e-mails and puts on the best review sessions that will (over)prepare you for the in-class exams. The in-class exams are pretty easy too - this was one of the easiest A's I've ever gotten at Yale. Weaknesses: This will vary from person to person, but I didn't enjoy the debate too much. Preparing for it felt pointless, everyone was just memorizing their own parts (and making them as 'amusing' as possible - Professor Casey heavily favors those who make a joke out of the affair) and the grading seemed extremely arbitrary. Also, Professor Casey was gone for quite a lot of the semester (talks in Paris and elsewhere and then illness) and the material covered can be a little narrow-focused and repetitive,. This is fantastic for when exams come around, but the class definitely covers much less material than other similar neuroscience classes. ",
            "\u00a0BJ Casey is an amazing professor! The course is well structured with one midterm and one final, and one in class debate. Super fun! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: BJ Casey is super knowledgeable, kind, and caring. The course info is always taught with reference to specific studies. Weaknesses: the exams are so short that a few questions wrong means you can lose a bunch of points. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting topic, great professor, the perfect amount of work\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and informative, although I wish they were less repetitive so we walk away with more knowledge each class (we often began by reviewing the content from the previous lecture and the class always end fifteen minutes early). ",
            "\u00a0Professor Casey made this class a lot of fun. The material was interesting and the way it was presented was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Casey is very kind and really amazing. She does a great job of keeping us engaged, and reviewing the material often. I think we could have maybe covered more material though. ",
            "\u00a0I thorrogly enjoyed the corse. I did not find any weaknesses. The strength of this corse is the professor, BJ Casey and her passion for not only the neurosceince of the adolescent brain but also her students. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of this course is the way in which it is taught: a rather intimate, thoughtful setting in which questions, collaboration, and creative thinking is greatly encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting studies discussed. Class was fun and had interesting activities. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting.  I felt like the exams were a bit nit-picky ",
            "\u00a0This was a good and fun class. However, I think the information covered in the second half was pretty dry and simply involved a lot of memorization rather than learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing! Professor Casey really cared about and knew the material so well and it translated really well in her teaching methods. Lectures were very interesting and Professor Casey always made sure to constantly review what we were learning and make connections between materials. She made class fun and made it a priority that everyone felt comfortable, engaged, and not stressed. I can tell she put it in a lot of effort in this class and it really showed and paid off. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great - the second half of the semester was slower considering how many more classes were dedicated to debate prep so the first half felt a lot more information heavy, but I understand there's not really a way to better balance that. ",
            "\u00a0A great class! ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course and very little homework. I loved the debate part. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was presented in a great way and enjoyed coming to class. I think spending so much time on the debate took away some time from learning more material and think it would be beneficial to spend less time on it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the exams and the debate were engaging and challenging, although I think I would have benefitted from working on another more hands on assignment in addition, such as a research project, to further understand the material. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely not! One of the worst classes I have taken while at Yale. Definitely much better courses offered at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Overall yes! It's a very low stress Neuro credit that's often fairly interesting and looks at the 'bigger picture' as well. It's very easy to get a good grade if you pay attention in class and put in at least 1-2 days of studying right before. It isn't the most interesting or challenging course, but that was also a positive for me in an otherwise heavy semester. A perfect 5th class! ",

            "\u00a0This is a great course to take, even if it does meet at 9 AM. Professor Casey is extremely understanding of the fact that Yalies have a lot of other classes/commitments and will be extremely accommodating as far as workload goes. Plus, the material is really interesting and useful! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you had background in the class (particularly The Human Brain). For reference, I didn't take The Human Brain, and I think I did fine in the class, it's just that you might feel like other people in the class are more prepared than you are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are a neuroscience major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to other students. The material was interesting and the class was very engaging, but without an overwhelming workload or amount of stress. Because of this, I greatly enjoyed going to class and it was an overall positive experience in which I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Interesting subject and great professor. Classes are engaging and you can learn a lot with little effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it if someone were looking for a low-stress, fun Neuroscience class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Amazing class with a small workload but great material. Professor Casey is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! SUPER interesting! ",
            "\u00a0This is a wacky course. \r\n\r\nThe debate, which is worth a significant portion of the grade, is so bizarre. Truly one of the weirdest experiences I've ever had in a classroom. This is a good science class in that it applies the science to real world through discussion of policy, etc. The content is definitely interesting, but the course structure is frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! BJ Casey is an amazing professor who really cares about student learning and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A solid class. If you've already taken a lot of psych/neuro classes, the content might feel a bit repetitive and boring, but BJ Casey is an enthusiastic lecturer who keeps the class entertaining. This class would definitely be good for someone is interested in the intersections of neuroscience and public policy. Workload is very manageable, and there are only 2 exams.  \r\n\r\nThe class really centers around the debate, where the \"arrested\" team (the team arguing that changes in the teen brain are maladaptive/deficient) debates the \"adaptive\" team (the team arguing that changes in the teen brain are advantageous). The debate is fun and informal (for example, some groups did a rap or a skit to illustrate their argument). ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is interesting and worth taking for all students, even those who arent neuroscience or psych majors. ",
