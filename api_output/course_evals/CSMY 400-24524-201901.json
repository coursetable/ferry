The first half of the course covers a wide array of different schools of thought, and the second half is more about case studies of individual issues (reproductive rights, sex work, family, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with legal theory and how to craft philosophically rigorous arguments. I learned the wide array of ways in which feminist theory can be applied to many topics in society. "

Also good for people considering law as a career as many of the writings engage the possibilities of law for creating feminist change. ",
