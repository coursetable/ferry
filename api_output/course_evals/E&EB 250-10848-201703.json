            "\u00a0I came into this semester not even knowing what arthropods were.  If someone had asked me in August to name an arthropod, I truly would have been at a complete loss to name even a single species.  \r\n\r\nWith this course, what you see is what you get.  You will learn a tremendous amount about bugs and gain a newfound respect for what they do in ecosystems.  \r\n\r\nAs far as developing skills, I cannot say that I came away from this class with any new skills in particular, although I did enjoy learning more about anatomy. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Ecological knowledge, much about how everyday decisions change the environment, and so much about how cool bugs are! ",
            "\u00a0LOVE bugs!! Marta Wells is fantastic. Must take and interesting for non STEM majors to. ",
            "\u00a0Learned all about bugs and bug-related-things. ",
            "\u00a0To recognize and appreciate the biologica diversity of arthropods and their importance to the ecosystem ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Wells's course offered a fascinating overview of the arthropod phylum  not only did it help me get over my fear of insects, but also gave me really helpful practice reading and writing about scientific research papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an awful lot about bugsa genuinely interesting topic that I appreciate immensely. Jumping spiders, and specifically the sparklemuffin peacock spider, are now some of my favorite animals. I feel like I have a newfound sympathy for arthropods of all sortsalthough they still sorta gross me out sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about the biology of a wide variety of arthropods, just as the course name suggests. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a basic overview of arthropod physiology, diversity, and behaviors. It was difficult to go into more than an overview given the staggering number and diversity of these creatures. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to gain a close insight into one of the most abundant and important phyla on the planet. I feel as though I now understand arthropods on multiple levels, from the microscopic to the ecological. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. This has been my most enjoyable course this semester. Prof. Wells' excitement is contagious and each class offered new insights into the fascinating world of arthropods. Its not the most \"intellectually stimulating\" class I've ever taken, but to b honest, that wasn't necessary to make it absolutely worthwhile: you learn about many important principles in biology and get to look at incredible bug interactions at the same time. You'll learn under what circumstances suicide makes sense from an evolutionary perspective, how bees defend their territory by \"cooking wasps alive\" and how spiders outsmart pretty much everybody else (even other spiders). A great, fun and thoroughly enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about bugs and ecology. Had a great time. ",

            "\u00a0By far the greatest strength of this course is the professor, Professor Wells.  Marta is an absolute gem of a teacher; her passion and love of the subject is manifest in every lecture.  With another teacher, this material could easily be dry and boring, but she does a great job of making the subject fascinating and approachable to one such as me with no science background apart from what I did in high school.\r\n\r\nI truly cannot think of a single weakness to expound upon here.  I would recommend this class highly to any student, science major or not. ",
            "\u00a0The course engages with very interesting material, so basically you can't go wrong. the incorporation of secondary literature into the course is also very well done. The readings on the textbook, though, has been more fun than helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the informative videos. Martha found a video that succinctly explained most every topic. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the breakdown of the course lectures and the enthusiasm of the professor. ",
            "\u00a0One of this course's greatest strengths was how comprehensive it was  starting from a basic overview of the arthropod body plan, we gradually incorporated more details about insect evolution and social behavior, peppered with truly fascinating examples. I did think, however, that the lectures could be a little better organized  even though there was a reasonably good overlap between the slides and what was covered on the exams, I did sometimes find Prof. Wells's explanations hard to follow. However, she was extremely receptive, and gave great responses, to student questions, which really helped with clarity. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! Testing was very fair, lectures were interesting, and the videos we watched during every class made me excited about bugs in new ways. ",
            "\u00a0One of the major things this course has going for it is that bugs are just inherently kind of cool. And getting to understand how they work is like getting to peer into this special secret universe below ours and see how it works. Professor Wells is very knowledgable, kind, and a joy to study with. \r\nThe course could be organized a tad more efficiently. While each section of the course covers a specific topic, many overlap and might be better if placed closer together chronologically. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was great in that it kept students interested through videos and the macro-scale importance of arthropods. I do wish that the course had a section, however, as at times I felt unsure of what were the major takeaways of certain lessons. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing lectures, exams make sense. Might benefit from a section or organized review sessions, but otherwise super strong. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not super a fan of lecture classes in general, but as far as they go, this one was all right. I appreciated the use of videos to Listen. I know you think you know where you are. You are wrong. There is no floor, but there is a ceiling. Good luck.make the lectures more interesting, and give nice concrete examples of the things we were learning. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to to any student in any year at Yale, regardless of major.  Professor Wells is a fantastic teacher who makes this subject fantastically approachable and interesting.  The grading and assignment structure is extremely fair--three midterms (keep your best 2 scores), one short (1000 words) paper, and one cumulative final.  A must-take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was highly interesting ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty laid back in terms of work, but it does have 3 midterms, a final, and a short paper. The instructor is passionate an helpful, but there is basically just a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it: excellent science credit and a welcome relief for a writing heavy semester. Would be a fantastic 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT ",
            "\u00a0Good course. great bug videos. Martha is awesome. But really only cool if you want to learn about bugs. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It's an interesting course with an amazing professor, and whether or not you like science is worth learning. It can even help you overcome a fear of bugs ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! You'll have to do a lot of memorization, but it's worth it for such a deep and fascinating dive into a group of organisms you've probably never thought much about. Prof. Wells is really engaging and friendly, and although the exams are tough you'll come out of it with a much richer perspective on the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended!!! The best kept science-credit secret at Yale! No need to have taken any other science class, and you get answers to all the questions you never knew about BUGS like, how they breathe, or reproduce. Marta Wells is also one of the most passionate and caring professors I've hadyour enjoyment of the course truly matters to her, and she goes out of her way to make sure of that. Definitely take this course, even if you don't need a science credit!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who needs a science credit and/or someone who is simply interested in bugs. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a science credit or a fifth class and you have an interest (or at least lack an aversion to) bugs, then this is the course for you. This class isn't too much work but if you pay attention, you'll get a lot out of it and you'll do well on the exams. However, if you don't like bugs, don't take this. You'll learn a lot, but there's so much information that even someone who likes bugs may be sick of them at the end. That said, the professor is excellent, and there isn't too much work. Three exams and the lowest score gets dropped, a final paper and a final. Great class. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging in that it truly made me believe that arthropods are fascinating and worthy of study, but I think that much of my interest in the lecture course came from my commitment to the lab, which had us work firsthand with all manner of arthropods and gain a strong understanding of individual orders. If I did not take the lab and in the absence of a section, I think that the lecture on its own would have seemed lackluster, but still interesting enough to hold my attention. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. This has been my most enjoyable course this semester. Prof. Wells' excitement is contagious and each class offered new insights into the fascinating world of arthropods.

A great, fun and thoroughly enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing science credit-- not too much work but dope content. ",
            "\u00a0Sure. If they are interested in arthropod biology, then this gives a good overview of the field. If not, then a different course might be better. "
