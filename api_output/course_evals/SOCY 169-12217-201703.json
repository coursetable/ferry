            "\u00a0You learn so much in this class! You learn about social interaction in public spaces, and how visual aspects of society influence our actions or thoughts. For example, you learn about museum behavior, public behavior at statues or monuments, line formation behavior, advertisement messages, and how public space is used to create social interactions. ",
            "\u00a0In introduction into viewing the everyday world from a sociological perspective, and the ability to ask specific questions about how society functions in everyday life. The course introduces methodology that focuses on a visual approach to evaluating sociological questions. ",
            "\u00a0As a documentary filmmaker, I found the course to be a tremendous resource into social and visual behavior. Not only did I learn a great deal about my audience but also about the subjects featured in my work. A structural and refined introduction to ethical practices as well was a tremendous help to my development. I plan to implement interviewing skills such as structuring visually stimulated interviews through photo elicitation and auto photography to name only a few sills I will take with me into my practice as an artist and a filmmaker to infuse my work with socially responsible and thoughtful approaches. Knowledge of how we look at and or read situations, interpret signs and symbols, move and exist in spaces offers me great insight into visual languages that transfer usefully to the screen. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly interactive, very engaging, very very interesting material which made me love doing the readings and participating in class. The people in the class were also very fun to have discussions with. Professor gave a ton of feedback and always provoked us to think more or from a different perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Really engaging and requires the students to really know the material. Professor Smith did a great job in making sure we understood the material. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely 100% recommend this class. It's one of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and it completely changed the way I look at a lot of public social interactions. The professor is absolutely amazing and hilarious, and the readings are incredibly interesting and I always enjoyed class. The seminars were 2 hrs long but they always flew by because I had such a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a senior this was one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken. Professor Smith and my TA Till were both incredible mentors and very willing to help improve the class experience. Professor Smith has a great sense of humor and the material we engage with is fascinating and relevant to everyone. This is an incredibly unique course, that is made up of two projects and a low-stress exam. The projects give you the opportunity to actually implement things that you have learnt throughout the course and are a good introduction to social research. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best classes you can take at Yale. Professor Smith is extremely knowledgable and engaging, and makes class fun every week. You read really interesting material that covers a huge variety of research. A great class, definitely take it!! ",
            "\u00a0It's a really fun class, but you still learn a decent amount so yes, I would recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0I was told by professor Smith that I offered a new and exciting dynamic to the classroom with my background as an artist and filmmaker. I mention this because of the relevance it has to a gap that can exist between arts and sciences. I felt no discrimination and found that my path as an artist was embraced as complimentary to the course and was encouraged that I should find it useful to my practice. I couldn't agree more. I could recommend this class to a variety of different types. ",
            "\u00a0One of best classes Ive taken at yale. You have to put in work work and do the readings but it is ejoyable to go to class and material is interesting. "
