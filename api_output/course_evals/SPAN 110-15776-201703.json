            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Spanish vocabulary and grammar. I learned how to speak and hold a very basic conversation in spanish. I have the ability of a beginner at reading and listening to spanish. Basic spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Elementary Spanish grammar and vocabulary. ",

            "\u00a0The main strength is that the course was everyday so I could not forget material as fast. The weakness was that over the weekend I did not converse in spanish so I forgot it. That's really just a me thing though because you are not going to hold class on the weekends. Another strength was that class was held entirely in spanish. This was good so that we were forced to learn spanish by immersion. ",
            "\u00a0i wish we did more speaking in class/speaking in spanish was better enforced to make sure that we were really learning that component. ",
            "\u00a0I tilled how the classes were very small. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it does a great job of introducing spanish at a do-able yet still fast pace. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very useful language to learn. The course is straight forward with an easy to follow syllabus. This is very strictly adhered to so it is easy to look ahead for the course. The course has a lot of coursework but it really helps to fully learn the material. Don't just do it to get it done, focus on doing it to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well-organized and you improve dramatically over the course of one semester. The instructors (I shopped multiple sections) are all super nice and supportive. You may end up in a section with students who have taken multiple years of Spanish in high school but that's you will be fine for all the evaluations (oral exams etc.) are tailored towards the materials taught in the course. You can get a nice grade if you are willing to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you want to learn another language, doing it in a classroom environment is definitely the way to go. "
