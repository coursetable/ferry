            "\u00a0I learnt how to manipulate spatial data in ENVI, access satellite data, manage said data, and perform a comprehensive study using satellite information. I also learnt about the theoretical underpinnings of satellite observation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to use satellite remote sensing technology to observe different objects of interest. ",
            "\u00a0A great foundation for remote sensing- both the theory and applications. ",
            "\u00a0Understood the science of remote sensing, and was able to get hands-on experience on applying remote sensing to a project through the final term project. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an in-depth exploration of satellite technology, remote sensing and their applications. The theoretical foundation created in the first half of the course is very interesting and accessible to people without any background in the filed. The second half of the course, along with the weekly lab exercises and final project, demonstrate how you can analyze satellite data to draw conclusions about a myriad of environmental features (land, ocean, atmosphere, urban sprawl, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the theory and principles behind remote sensing, especially the physics behind light sensing. I also learned how to use software for analyzing satellite images, and I learned about various satellites and their products that are useful for remote sensing for environmental purposes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the field of remote sensing (i.e. observation by satellite- (or airplane/drone) -mounted cameras that capture one or more bands, such as visible light, infrared, microwave, etc...) works, the basic science of light, what its limitations are, some of its many applications, how to do research with remote sensing data, etc...\r\nThe course could not cover some of the most interesting modern applications of remote sensing (e.g. hyper spectral imagery, which can be used for automatic detailed classifications of scenes), because of time and because some of those applications require very expensive and specific equipment. However, I feel like those applications are accessible to me now, in that I would know what I was doing if I had the opportunity to work with them. "

            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it is well structured and clear. I felt that the guest lecture by Mark Ashton wasn't as useful and could have been swapped for a different presenter. ",
            "\u00a0It's very well structured and the teaching staff were helpful! ",
            "\u00a0I thought we spend a bit too long and in depth on the theory side of remote sensing in the beginning and not applications. This made it harder to know about all of the things you could do for projects, and lead to a lot of people doing similar things. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-organized course, with a good mix of theory and applications. Final project gave good hands-on experience to students. ",
            "\u00a0Stregnths: well-organized, lots of helpful feedback, hands-on learning provided valuable experience, you leave the course with proficiency in the software ENVI.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures were a bit dry and hard to focus on. I would have preferred 50-minute instead of 1 hr 15 minute classes. The lab exercises get longer and longer throughout the semester so these will take up considerable time outside of class which makes it hard to find time to start the final project till the very of the term. Also, the software is unavailable anywhere else on campus, so you have to make the trek to the YCEO computer lab at all times of the day. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructors who are willing to help you out as much as you ask them for help. Also the class covers a nice range of topics, just make sure you take a look at the topics list before starting your final project because you continue learning new things after you are supposed to have begun. So check to make sure there isn't something that seems interesting to you that you haven't gotten to yet. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great course to learn about how to work with satellite data. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who's curious about satellite remote sensing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great intro to remote sensing and GIS.. after taking this class you will know if it's something you want to do more of or not. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Remote sensing is a very important skill to know in many different majors, and the excellent structure and organization of the course makes it very easy for everybody to learn remote sensing regardless of prior backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But only for a student who actually believes they will use remote sensing in their future studies/career. It is primarily a skill-based course and you'll definitely walk away with a solid background in remote sensing or jumping off point for future studies. The class is probably a bit too technical for anyone with just a passing interest in the field. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to remote sensing and gives you the practical skills you need to analyze satellite images on your own. The labs are a lot of work, but they really allow you to actually learn the hard skills. The lectures focus more on theory, which is an interesting approach to teaching a course on remote sensing, but they can sometimes feel long and somewhat dull. Overall, it is a great class and you will learn a lot of practical knowledge if you plan on using remote sensing in any context in the future. ",
            "\u00a0yup, if you think you might get some use out of the skills you learn, or if you just think the topic is cool and wanna learn how it works "
