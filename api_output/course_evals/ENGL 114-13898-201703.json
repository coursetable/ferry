We dealt with a variety of writing styles, so I was able to improve my ability to write in multiple styles and for multiple prompts. I definitely learned a lot about photography and its implications for the world we live in and how we live. In general, my writing improved greatly overall. ",

Some of the readings are not the most exciting and a bit difficult, but I learned a lot from them. \r\n\r\nSome strengths: The professor is very receptive to the students' desires and is always trying to improve the course for his students. He gives you many opportunities to improve your grade and is not an unfair grader. There really were not an overwhelming amount of readings, and he scheduled them in a way that was very manageable.
