However, the concepts we broached through the readings, in lecture, and most of all, in seminar, have fundamentally changed the way I understand the world. From the basics of human existence to the foundations of morals, the questions and discussions gave me deeper insight into my own assumptions and taught me to live life critically and analytically.
