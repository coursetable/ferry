            "\u00a0Writing a thesis was much harder than I expected; I was excited build off the skills I learned + things I read in some of my other classes, but crafting an argument out of my interests, outside of the constant discussion/throwing-around of ideas that happens in classrooms, was quite difficult. Learning how to do all of that was an invaluable experience. "
