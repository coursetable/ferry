            "\u00a0Learned to question everything about what you're eating, but that it's ok to feel conflicting about a lot of things. There is a lot wrong with the food system and there's no answer to fix everything. ",
            "\u00a0This class made me think more thoughtfully abut food than I ever have before.  I developed my critical thinking skills in regards to watching documentaries and then discussing them in class.  I utilized my research skills in writing papers for the class and used creativity in thinking up my final project idea.  I learned a ton about our food system and how many different considerations there are when asking the question \"what shall I eat?\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned more real world, useful information in this class than in any other Yale class. The guiding question of \"what shall I eat,\" although never fully answered, allowed me to look more critically at what and how I eat, and ways to change it to better my health and eat more sustainably. The documentaries were varied and overall really good, and reading is light. Work was concentrated at the beginning of the semester, which was nice as it balanced out with other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Problems within food systems ",
            "\u00a0Really solid grasp on the way the american food system works and the challenges facing it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the issues of our food system as well as environmental and waste impacts. This course gave me a new perspective on what I should eat and has allowed me to grow and understand the way food is produced. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically watch food documentaries and unpack the positive and negative aspects of that type of environmental communication. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of how food issues are depicted and discussed in media, particularly through film. General scope of food issues in the United States and abroad ranging from environmental (runoff pollution from animal feedlots), political (entrenched supermarket lobbies), social (immigrant wage labor) and cultural (mercury poisoning of whale meat in the Faroe Islands).

            "\u00a0Strength: Prof. Ian is awesome!!! By far one of my classes I've taken at Yale. Super engaging and really interesting, and also relevant to life. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions we had about the documentaries we watched were fantastic.  That is really the meat of the class and where you think deeply about food issues.  Professor Cheney does a great job of guiding our talks and it is a great environment in which to share your ideas.  I thought all the documentaries we watched were great choices.  The only thing I would change is allowing us the option to watch the documentaries on our own time instead of at the weekly screening which was on Tuesday nights.  It was just a difficult time to try to squeeze into my schedule and it would be more beneficial if we all could watch them on our own. ",
            "\u00a0Documentaries were mostly engaging, and readings were interesting. I really enjoyed talking to some of the experts featured in the films during class. However, we usually didn't spend too much time actually discussing the documentary. Presentations, while interesting, cut down on discussion time. The first and last paper were really fun to write, but the midterm paper topics weren't as interesting or unique, and I would have liked more freedom in what to write about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Ian is funny and a real documentary maker , so he has expertise; many documentaries are on interesting content \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class gets very repetitive about halfway through the semester as content doesnt really change; you get in this sort of cycle of talking about the same issues within industrial agriculture (subsidies, GMOs, etc.).; no real focus on documentary as a form/craft despite watching so many ",
            "\u00a0Really well organized and facilitates good discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exceptionally well-designed. I think Ian is a realist when it comes to how to run a seminar--he knows we don't want to be sitting around talking about some arcane text for two hours. So, he breaks it up, with some time going to talking about the film, some to talking about the readings, some to Skype calls with awesome food people (like Marion Nestle), and the rest to student presentations. I especially loved hearing my fellow students' presentations. One thing I would suggest would be more anti-racist critiques. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided great discussion and I really enjoyed writing the second and third papers. One weakness was that I felt the papers were very loosely described, but then graded harshly for things we did not know we were expected to do. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course is that it covers a diverse set of topics within the food documentary field. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and content are fantastic. Ian is dynamic and engaging yet insightful at every turn. "

            "\u00a0YES ABSOLUTELY!!!!! My favorite class at Yale, Ian is one of the best professors I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class.  This was one of my favorite courses at Yale because I feel like I'll actually carry this information with me for the rest of my life.  The class has changed how I eat and view food and has made me more aware of issues surrounding food.  It's a super fascinating course and the workload is very manageable - take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a really interesting class, and the format was different than most classes, making the work more fun and less like a chore. You have to commit to going to documentary screenings every week, but the movies were good and reading was light. I learned a lot of things that I'm already applying to my life, and am now much more conscious about what I eat. ",
            "\u00a0Best class Ive ever taken at Yale\r\nSuper interesting super fun and not hard \r\nYou get to write about fun stuff ",
            "\u00a0Its definitely a fun class, but I didnt feel like I learned too much past a certain point early on. Low workload! Interesting course content. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely yes! Its a really great way to learn about the complex, multifaceted food system, and overall a fun and interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great instructor, good course material, and interesting and important work! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was extremely interesting and informative. I learned so much about a topic, which we interact with everyday but one that often gets overlooked and accepted without high standards. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a good course, but if you have significant prior knowledge in food/agriculture in regards to environmental studies, discussions can be a bit repetitive and superficial. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. Not much work at all for fantastic intellectual discourse around a fascinating topic with a great, down-to-earth professor. "
