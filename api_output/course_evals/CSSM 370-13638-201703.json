            "\u00a0Michelle and Hyatt did a great job of getting us to think about policy issues with an eye for the legal question. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about prison  case law and various aspects of the rise of mass incarceration. ",
            "\u00a0This course both taught you how to think and write about prison law and policy issues related to the criminal justice system, but also imparted quite a substantial bit of knowledge about the subject. Therefore, I found it to be an excellent balance between analytical skills which got us to read, think and write critically about the content we were reading, but also just the opportunity to absorb a lot of information about prison law and policy. I really liked the two writing assignments and I thought the feedback I received was helpful. I also really enjoyed the interactive activities we did in class, such as the mock oral arguments and the debate. These activities were not only fun, but they got us to practice additional skills which in part replicated what it would be like to actually be a lawyer or a policy maker debating issues concerning prisons in the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the legal foundations of the prison industrial complex. I also learned how to read case law effectively, alongside quite a few argumentative skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me critically important information about United States prison laws and policies, as well as a great introduction to the greater legal system on the Supreme Court and lower levels.  The criminal justice system in the United States is too often ignored by the general public which will not be directly impacted by it during their lifetime. Every person, I think, can learn more about how the United States values individuals and makes policies by looking at how the government treats this exceedingly vulnerable population.In most cases, deeply entrenched and deeply problematic dynamics are revealed. Everyone should know more so that they can do more. I'm extremely thankful that this class provided an opportunity for me to do just this.\r\n\r\nIn this course, I developed my critical reasons and analysis skills in writing and in oral argument through the weekly reflection papers and during each class.\r\n\r\nI was impressed by how this course turned each of us into better classmates -- by the end of the semester we were better at engaging with each other's ideas and building off other's arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the formatting of cases and how to read a case. I learned impacts of imprisonment that I had never considered before. From pregnancy in prison to elder care, there was so much valuable information I learned, always balanced with case law and also social issues. ",
            "\u00a0This course served as an overview of the jurisprudence on prisoners. We read about the frameworks which the courts use to adjudicate these issues, and in class, we discussed the advantages and disadvantages of each approach. I came away from the class with a comprehensive understanding of the system, and I think I am prepared for a career in this field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the prison system in general in the U.S. and about all of the injustices that are perpetuated on a daily basis in prisons and when putting people in prisons. I felt like I knew a fair amount before taking the class, but I learned so much from this class and from the many court cases relating to prisons that we studied. I enjoyed this class immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing Supreme Court cases, which were a seminal part of the course, definitely became a much-improved (and crucial) skill. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a completely new understanding of the prison system through this course. Although I came in with a background in law, I found our discussions on how to read cases to be really helpful. I think Professors Howard also encouraged diverse types of thinking and engaging with material. ",
            "\u00a0How to understand texts ",
            "\u00a0I learned about prison law and the rights of inmates. We covered areas such as the right to practice religion in prison, access to medical care, access to personal belongings and entertainment, solitary confinement, three-strikes laws, women's prisons, and the experience of specific groups (such as transgender inmates, the youth, and the elderly). We studied a lot of Supreme Court (and lower court) cases, so the course improved my ability to understand legal writing. I also learned about the experiences of prisoners first-hand through an optional visit to a local prison. "

            "\u00a0The course was honestly a great time - the only way it could've been improved is if we had more time with Michelle and Hyatt. Since it was a pretty popular listing, only people who really had an interest in the class ended up taking it, and because of that we always had super productive and well informed conversations in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was concise, in-depth, and well-taught. The only improvement I can think of is that I especially loved the interactive class activities we did, such as mock court cases and other smaller-group activities, and I would have loved to do even more of that. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely phenomenal. The professors, the students, the course materials, the structure, and the speakers and prison visit combined to make this the best course I have taken at Yale during the past three years.\r\n\r\nProfessors Howard and Howard were always professional, well-prepared, engaging, dedicated, and enthusiastic about working with us. This was their first time  teaching a Yale course after graduating from Yale College only a few years ago, and they absolutely excelled at it. As I am entering my last semester, I have taken more than 30 courses at Yale, but this one stands out for many reasons.\r\n\r\nToo often I find that seminars are run as purely discussions between students. I highly valued that Professors Howard would include at least 20-30 minutes of instruction to expand on the course readings.\r\n\r\nI also find that in too many seminars (and lectures), professors assign so much reading that no one can get through all of it. This inhibits real conversation and discussion between students. This course was not light on material, but we were not assigned an excessive amount. As it was engaging and important materials, I know that each student did the readings, and that really helped with discussion.\r\n\r\nMy year, this course drew a fantastic set of students and that definitely added to the quality of the course. I appreciated each student's perspective and respectful engagement.\r\n\r\nAs I expanded on in the previous section, I believe that the material for this course is extremely important.  The criminal justice system in the United States is too often ignored by the general public which will not be directly impacted by it during their lifetime. Every person, I think, can learn more about how the United States values individuals and makes policies by looking at how the government treats this exceedingly vulnerable population.\r\n\r\nFor this course, we read court cases, news, articles, and books. Each of these materials combined to give us a well-rounded picture of prison law and policy in the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was obvious that Professors Howard put great thought into the structure of the course. We looked at a different sub-topic each week, for example, transgenders in prisons, elders in prisons, and 8th amendment rights. As we progressed through the course, we increasingly drew on previous materials, legal arguments, and criteria used to review claims and cases in court.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must mention the speakers and prison visit. Professors Howard brought in a couple of great speakers who told us about their experience in prosecution or as a judge. This was a great way to introduce us to different perspectives on the system. Our trip to the Danbury Federal Correctional Institute was a great opportunity to see first hand what we had been learning about during the semester. It was a harrowing, fascinating, and well-run trip. \r\n\r\nI don't think this course had any weaknesses; it was truly a gem and I'm so happy to have taken it this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! It was extremely organized, approached an interesting topic each week, balanced student discussion with guidance from professors. No weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were excellent! And in particular, the professors did some great simulations! We were able to practice litigation in ways that few classes enable us to do. We participated in mock negotiations, hearings, and trials. This was a great deal of fun, and I think we came away with some unique insights. ",
            "\u00a0The readings each week were very interesting, and I felt like the discussions we had really furthered my understanding of the prison system and were very relevant with current events. The professors are the best part of the class. They care so much and were willing to help in every possible way. They knew so much and put a lot of time and effort into making the class interesting and relevant. I appreciated that so much. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible structure, fascinating material, and wonderfully engaged professors. My only suggestion would be to allow slightly more free-flowing discussion of the texts and cases rather than going over them in an introduction. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the different types of activities that we did in class. Despite the rather undesirable time of the class, I think that Professors Howard did an awesome job of keeping us engaged in the material. Both were excellent as well at guiding discussion in a productive manner that encouraged students to ask questions and share opinions. ",
            "\u00a0It deeply allowed me to engage in America's prison system ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well planned as-is. It had a logical flow and covered a lot of different topics related to prison law and policy. The execution of the class was also great -- discussions were lively and interesting. The guest presenters and Danbury trip were a good addition to the course. \r\n\r\nIf anything, I would suggest for the readings to be shorter or to add pointers on what specifically to look out for beforehand (e.g. pay attention to Justice X's justification of Y), as a lot of our class discussion tended to focus around one or two points of each reading that didn't always stand out to me when I was reading it the first time around.

            "\u00a0Yes! If you get the chance to take this course, definitely do it. ",
            "\u00a0This was a college seminar so I dont know if it will be offered again. But if it is, oh MUST take it. The syllabus is packed with interesting material. If youre at all interested in Law, take it. If youre at all interested in public policy, take it. If you want to change your opinions on subjects a dozen times during a semester, take it. ",
            "\u00a0100% ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - I hope it is taught again. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It was clear that each of the student's in my class really cared about these issues prior to taking the course. Still, I think that anyone who wants to learn about this issue, with previous knowledge or not, would get a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student! This is the best course I have taken in my time at Yale and it was taught by two of the kindest, most thoughtful professors. The material was so thoughtfully put together and the feedback was consistent and detailed. I am so thankful to have gotten a spot in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you're at all interested in learning more about how prisons work, the rights afforded to those who are incarcerated or the criminal justice system more broadly. Professor(s) Howard were great and did an amazing job of laying out the case law and explaining how best to understand how to read court opinions and descents. Importantly, the professors crafted a great syllabus that paired technical case law with personalized stories that humanized those who are incarcerated from works like Bryan Stevenson's Just Mercy. Moreover, the professors explored the variation among demographics in terms of the way that various populations are affected differently by imprisonment - from juveniles to transgendered persons. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of my favorite classes at Yale! Incredibly important topic, exceptionally passionate professors, and truly amazing discussions. Definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If they offer this class again, you must take this class. It's my favorite class I've taken at Yale, and I looked forward to it every single week. Please, please, please take this class if you can!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The syllabus is incredible - wonderful blend of Supreme Court cases and classic works on criminal justice. Professors are dedicated and engaging, and often prepared interactive class activities such as mock trials, etc. A must-take for anyone interested in criminal justice and law. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. It allows you to understand America's prison system in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This class is FANTASTIC and you should absolutely take it if you get the opportunity. Professor(s) Howard are amazing and you can tell that they've put a lot of time and care into making this an engaging course. The workload is definitely manageable: a one-page reading response every week with a by-week, a 5-page midterm paper, and 10-page final paper. Class discussions were never boring because the information was delivered through Supreme Court cases which themselves were interesting. The highlight of the course for me was the trip we took to Danbury Federal Prison. We took the trip towards the end of the semester and it was a great way to put everything we had been reading and writing about into real-world perspective, which is rare for a course. Michelle and Hyatt are young Yale alums who practice what they teach about. Both of them are incredibly nice, they set clear standards, and they give helpful feedback on both the reading responses and the papers. All in all, I can't recommend this class enough. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class if you're interested in the topic. You get to learn not only about laws and policies, but about the rights and experiences of prisoners. The professors are really friendly, helpful, and easy to communicate with, and discussion was usually pretty lively. The main assignments when I took it were a 5-page midterm essay, an 8-10-page final essay, and weekly 1-page reflections on the readings. The actual books for the course are pretty interesting, but also be prepared to read a lot of long court cases and legal writing! "
