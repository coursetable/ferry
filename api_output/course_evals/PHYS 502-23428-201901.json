            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of physics pictures and examples are provided to help learning.\r\nWeakness: progression of the course is slowed down by the abundent topics covered in electrostatics. Really interesting topics in electrodynamics such as scattering theory are unfortunately not able to be covered. ",

Could be better split into two semesters such that the hard/interesting topics are given more time.

            "\u00a0-- Strengths: \r\n\r\n ::1. Covers a lot of content\r\n\r\n-- Weaknesses: (ordered from least sever to most)\r\n\r\n ::1. Textbook: Zangwill is a great text IFF you actually spend enough time going over the extreme depth it provides. This book is around 1000 pages in total, and we covered around 750 of those in a single semester. 20 Chapters/750 pages is too much for a single semester given the extreme depth of the content. This led to a persistent question common among all of the students in the class: \"What are we actually focusing on?\"\r\n\r\n ::2. Problem Sets: Directly coupled with the above statement, there was not nearly enough actual practice and application of the content discussed. 10 total problem sets with 5 problems on average each is not anywhere near enough practice to grasp the immense amount of content covered. I ended up doing many, many, MANY practice problems before the midterm and final exams in an attempt to prepare myself and still did horrible on both exams. \r\n\r\n ::3. Exams: It is hard to decouple the above points (1) and (2) from this one, but the exams were terrible. If a concrete thing can be said about them, they were far too long. 4-5 questions each with many, inter-dependent parts is far from acceptable for an exam of this length. I understand that this is a direct result of the immense content covered, but it made it impossible to finish the exams, and if you made minor mistakes in the beginning that you discover later on, you had to go back and re-propagate that correction through all components of the problem--much time was lost due to this. Relating to that point, little-to-no partial credit was given when a mistake was made. Regardless if you understood many fundamental principles that the problem relied upon, a small algebra mistake lead to nearly zero credit for a problem, as the grader interpreted that algebra mistake as a vast conceptual error, ignoring the variety of nuances that are presented in this subject. The average on the first midterm was around a 50%, and instead of recognizing that 'hey, maybe this exam was too hard if a class full of Physics PhD students failed it', we were scolded for 'not understanding basic fundamental physics.'\r\n\r\n ::4. Lectures: I have a hard time determining if this should be listed before or after the exams, but I felt very uninformed by attending these lectures. Often the content was pulled directly from Zangwill while opting to ignore the rhyme or reason behind the instruction. This needs to be massively reworked. You should set out with a clear goal at the beginning of the lecture, and make sure that that is accomplished by the end of the lecture. It is incredibly important during instruction that the point of what is happening is clear at all times, or the audience is easily left to confusion in a sea of vague algebra and calculus. NO MORE POWERPOINTS. The powerpoints in their current form are unanimously useless to everyone in the audience. They are just illogical, unlabeled collages of equations, very obviously copy-pasted from texts, and it does absolutely nothing for students to just see some equations without derivation or reason. You might be able to make an argument for posting such content online after the lectures to summarize what was key to understand from a content, but during the lecture, it serves no purpose to just put slides up and talk about them. Students cannot possible hope to copy all the content down fast enough or absorb anything from briefly viewing them. Even in the exception mentioned above, these slides would need to be majorly reworked to provide useful information, such as actually discussing the significance of their contents. A student is much better off just Googling and looking for another institution's presentations at this point. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course if they need to learn E&M here at Yale, but this should be taught in two semesters.  If the faculty is so set on reducing the course requirements, then make the class just on dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0You don't really need to take this course or go to the class if you are already familiar with the material. However, I would recommand this course to other students because the physical picture and intuition the lecturer provided during the class is invaluable for a physicist. ",
            "\u00a0Required course. Covers a fair amount of E&M which is probably good enough for most people. Quite difficult if you have not seen it before, especially towards the end. Homework schedule was quite inconsistent until the end, in which there was a lot of homework every week.\r\n\r\nMidterm exam questions were very strange/hard but the final seemed fair. ",
