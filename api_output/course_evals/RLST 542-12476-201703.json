            "\u00a0Continued development of translation skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt many basic Buddhist knowledge, as well as professional Buddhist terms in English. \r\nMy translation skill has also been improved by the many translation. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned how to translate Chinese Buddhist texts into English and how to understand the philosophical meaning, which is important in grasping the core of traditional Chinese culture. \r\nAlso, a very pragmatic skill is how to read the Dunhuang manuscripts. Equally important is the critical attitudes towards the attribution of these texts and the so-called idea of school in early Chan. ",

            "\u00a0To me this course was really good. ",
            "\u00a0It is a small class, so everyone has the opportunity to speak out.\r\nThe combination of first sources and secondary sources is helpful for us to both develop our own independent thinking and learn the academic paradigm in reading the texts. \r\nI believe the three lectures given by the guest professor, Chunwen Hao, are too many. Perhaps one is enough. His teaching on the social life of Dunhuang monastics is not directly related to our Chan text reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the translation assignments are interesting and the readings help me to explore the history and different lineages of early Ch'an. \r\n\r\nI think maybe we could have more time to discuss the readings in class.I cherished the teaching and discussions which were thought-provoking and inspiring. I think I need to know the main streams in the area, and I hope next time we have more time to discuss the readings and share our understanding in class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to those who interested in Chinese Buddhism and be able to handle Classical Chinese. The Chinese reading might be challenge to non-native speakers whose Chinese is not good enough. ",
            "\u00a0The course seems rather specialized and research oriented. Still, I would recommend it to those who have the linguistic capabilities but not know much about Buddhism. It is a pleasure to explore the mysterious yet down-to-earth  Buddhist treatise and conversations. One can always appreciate the humor in them and the atmosphere is relaxed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because of Chinese Buddhism, especially Ch'an Buddhism is really interesting. And in this course, we can learn the thoughts and theories of different sects. If the student is good at Chinese language and is interested in Traditional Chinese Buddhism I would like to recommend this course to him/her. However, this course needs the student to be proficient in ancient Chinese, which is not easy for most students. "
