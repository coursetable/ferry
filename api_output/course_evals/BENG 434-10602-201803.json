            "\u00a0Got a good overview of biomaterials in terms of what's available and being used and the properties associated with certain biomaterials. This naturally led to thinking about possible applications of what I was learning. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me a much broader understanding of the differences between bio materials and how a materials properties can affect its clinical use. I felt the material was very Applicable to real world biomedical engineering problems. ",
            "\u00a0Metals, Ceramics, Polymers, Glasses! Learned about biocompatibility, degradation, drug delivery, basic stress/strain mechanics, immune responses. Mostly had guest lecturers and student presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Really....honestly...not that much. Like a hazy cursory knowledge of like crystallization and bone growth, maybe a little bit about the major classes of biomaterials. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different biomaterials and their applications and strengths. A great overview that will hopefully be useful later. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the advantages and disadvantages of biomaterials such as polymers, glasses and ceramics, metals, and composites. We learned about the different ways materials can fail. And we learned about key properties of various biomaterials that make them useful in certain applications. ",
            "\u00a0Lots and lots about biotechnology and the field-great class with current insights about the field ",
            "\u00a0Learned about various aspects of biomaterials research and materials science "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class gives a very broad overview of different materials, as is the nature of the course. It doesn't really have time to go in depth into everything, but the books were good materials for more in depth reading, should anyone choose to do so. If not, it's a good introduction to the field of biomaterials. ",
            "\u00a0There was a heavy focus on conceptual understanding of the material and how the knowledge could be applied to understand clinical interventions. I think this approach made the course very engaging and manageable.  Professor Gonzalez is also a very engaging professor and did a great job explaining concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The material and lectures themselves were mostly interesting. However, it was pretty painful and stressful in terms of organization. So much busy work in terms of the blog posts - the standards initially were very high, and then TA didn't even have time to read them. Psets seemed to be recycled from years ago and often had irrelevant problems that we had to learn ourselves. Lots of grading errors. Not great communication between students and TA/professor. Prof Gonzalez is such an amazing person - I just feel like she doesn't have enough time to invest into this course. I hear the other biomaterials course is better considering these points, but I still learned A LOT in this course! ",
            "\u00a0This class was MESS! I was SO EXCITED to take this class because everyone RAVED about it. It was really not good!!!! Slides were SO BAD! There were like 4 lectures taught by another professor that was not Anjelica??? Then there were like 3 other guest lectures. And three whole classes of student group presentations. Anjelica did SO LITTLE for this class, which was atrociously organized. There was little feedback on anything we turned in, there were no clear expectations for anything, and there was such genuinely BAD instruction. ",
            "\u00a0The breakdown and division of material and topics is well done and helps facilitate learning and understand as well as connection of concepts. \r\nProfessor Gonzalez is awesome and makes students excited to come to class and learn\r\n\r\nSlightly more timely feedback and higher relevance between class and readings would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting and you go through a lot of biomaterials and applications that are very cool. Some weaknesses is that there is a lot of busy work in the class between blog posts, PSETs, and group presentations. The homeworks feel as if they are from older versions of the class and sometimes there are questions about topics that weren't covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of pretty easy work make the material memorable without being too burdensome although some students felt like the work was busy work. The course materials is presented clearly and the teacher is very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The material is sometimes uneven and the lectures not always helpful for the hw. The textbook is not directly applicable to the material tested sometimes. But the course is very informative "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting, so definitely take it if you're interested in materials and how materials interact in the body. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Gonzalez was the main reason why I chose to take this course, and she taught well and really made sure the class was structured for learning. I thought there were too many guest lectures, and I was disappointed when I'd come into class and she wasn't teaching for the day. Otherwise, the material we covered was interesting and not too hard to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a great bme elective with engaging material and manageable coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Take it with friends and be prepared for some nonsense. I am still glad I took it, though - learned a lot about biology and different materials (wow!). ",
            "\u00a0NO. I feel lied to when people told me they loved this class. I hated it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. For students interested in the crossover between mechanical and biomedical engineering this class is a must take. ",
            "\u00a0Really good course, I felt like I actually learned about applications of biomaterials a lot not just about the materials themself ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING course, lovely professor and the material was presented clearly and evaluated fairly ",
            "\u00a0This class is okay, not the best. The lectures with Anjelica are interesting, but the class is so disorganized that it can be difficult to follow. Problem sets didn't seem to match up with what we had covered in class and we never really had any feedback. The weekly blogs are pure busy work that don't seem to have much of a purpose, and we never were given any grades or feedback to know if we should be doing things differently. Exams were not impossibly hard by any means, but seemed disproportionately difficult given the way things were presented in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very informative and useful for people going into materials or biomaterials reserach "
