            "\u00a0From this course, I learned about integration, series and sequences, and parametric curves, but no thanks to my instructor. My instructor was very confusing and I learned nearly all of the content outside of class. I learned these skills from my textbook and Khan Academy. Sure, I learned the math through these out-of-class methods, but I wish Yale would provide better faculty so that I could actually answer this question. ",
            "\u00a0Solidified math concepts in Calculus II. ",

It's not very exciting or fun, but it's not the kind of thing that really can be with the demands of the standardization across sections, so it was fine all in all. ",

If I had taken it after only one prior year of calculus, I think I would've felt pretty rushed and possibly confused. It's also a prereq for lots of stuff, so it ends up being worth your time. ",
