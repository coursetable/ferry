            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Spain and the Spanish colonies in Latin America through the lens of primary source documents. I feel as though I better understand the concept of micro-history as well as the importance of studying history through the lens of cultural, sexual, and religious minorities. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of knowledge about the social, political, and economic structure of early modern spain! Skills of reading carefully and making arguments based on historical evidence, insights on how perception and reality were dissonant both on an individual and state level. ",
            "\u00a0Through the course I learned how to look at history from a more personal and social perspective. Every other history class I had taken focused on great writers or high level history, and this was a very valuable change in focus. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are Professor Jordan and her wonderful syllabus. Professor Jordan was limitlessly kind and very generous with her time, and her syllabus was well thought through and engaging. The course could have used a little more structure, but honestly I enjoyed the freedom of it. We also never really received graded feedback, so I am a little confused as to how I did in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jordan is beyond lovely. So knowledgeable, helpful, and kind. The reading were fairly diverse and mostly really engaging and even fun. Professor Jordan did a great job creating really good class discussions. The student presentations were a nice way to organize class. The only weakness I can think of is that it would have been nice to get some grades back before the final paper: we got comments and feedback but no grades, so going into the final paper I didn't really know how I was doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Was a bit disorganized. But it had plenty of interesting readings and had a broad view of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the discussions, the presentations were awesome as well. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! A gem of a history seminar, especially if you're looking for one that is a little more relaxed but still intellectually engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! See comment about strengths and weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn a lot, Maria is super knowledgeable and contributes really interesting additions to the discussion, and there is not a ton of work, around ~2-4 hours of reading each week, 3 3pg reflections, and a 10-12pg final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to read interesting primary sources with an interest in Spanish history. The workload and grading are very fair. "
