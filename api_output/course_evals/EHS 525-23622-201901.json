            "\u00a0I think this course isn't really necessary for students, especially second year students. EHS is one of the only departments that has mandatory weekly seminars for both years. I understand the importance of learning about current research in the field, but often times some of the subject matter is so out of my area of focus that I don't understand the research and I feel like I could have a better use for my time. ",

            "\u00a0The seminar was an improvement over past years in which there was minimal student engagement. I think lack of student engagement is still a problem however; since students do not receive credit for this class, it is difficult to ensure that anyone actually does the reading or pays attention in seminar. ",
