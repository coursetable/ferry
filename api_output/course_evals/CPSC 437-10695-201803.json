Going to class was not necessary and more than half the people didn't go to lectures and just read lecture notes instead. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, since I was able to learn by reading on my own at my own pace ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are not very engaging, I stopped going after the 3rd week of class.  However, if you are looking for a gutty CS elective where you can brush up on SQL and databases, you can skim through the lectures pretty quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nice instructor and great project ",
            "\u00a0There were only three problem sets throughout this semester. They were vaguely helpful for learning material, but I wouldn't say they really helped with understanding of material for the exams except for the parts where you write SQL statements. I also wish there had been some kind of preparation/sample questions for the exams. I mean *anything*. Avi and the TAs were not able to give us any type of information about the types of questions that would be on the exams. For the first exam, this was not as much of an issue because we were obviously going to be tested on SQL and relational algebra. For the second exam, it was much more up-in-the-air what questions there would be because we covered so much content and all of it was theoretical.\r\n\r\nOne strength of this course is that you do not have to attend class in order to perform well on exams or problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Avi lectures straight from slides that are straight from a textbook. Most days that I attended, it felt like I could just be studying on my own, and I think that most of the class felt similarly. The problem sets were pretty chill, and learning SQL was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Having the final project was great and I learned a lot through it\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Not really sure what the practical relevance of a lot of the course material is. We spent a lot of time on the issue of what happens if the power shuts off and the database turns off in the middle of a transaction.\r\n- Should have spent more time on BCNF and 3NF. Still confused about what this is.\r\n- Javid is a truly awful TA and everyone in the course that interacted with him had a terrible experience with him.\r\n- The midterm exam was a disaster because Avi changed the test in the last minute and the TA's gave conflicting information about Avi's intent when writing questions. The exam also went over by 15 minutes because of all the confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Good material; perhaps more enthusiasm could be better. ",
            "\u00a0This class is not a lot of work compared to other CS electives--which could be a strength and a weakness. I didn't feel very academically challenged with the assignments, but it was a good course to take with a heavy schedule load. ",
            "\u00a0The course focuses a lot on the theoretical aspects behind databases, and relatively minimally on executing efficient SQL queries or other, newer database schemas such as NoSQL. ",
            "\u00a0Something that I liked was that the lectures were all posted online and were very detailed. It was pretty clear what we were going to be tested on and the general flow of the course was generally pretty good. Avi also never assigned too much work which was nice.\r\n\r\nThe lectures got a little dry and sometimes all of the discussion about different designs seemed a bit repetitive and unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of material was covered, but sometimes felt disorganized, lecture slides were often a bit sloppy. Assignments were very sparse and did not feel incredibly timely. Expectations and clarifications to course material were often not explained very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0This class can be much better organized. The TAs don't know what will be on the midterm etc. It is clear that the professor has been teaching this class for years and has a preset lecture. When questions are asked, often they are not coherently answered. Many students do not come to class and get the same information off the slides. ",
            "\u00a0Final project actually takes more time than you anticipate, heads up.  Maybe week or more of solid time. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Avi is great and the course material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Avi is a great professor and the content was very interesting\r\nWeaknesses - the course was immensely understaffed TA-wise, and the class was so large that it didn't lend itself well to discussions in class. It would be nice to have more courses, so that students hav ethe opportunity to interact with their classmates and professor. ",
            "\u00a0It's kind of interesting but learning is very unorganized so you kind of have to teach yourself ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: we had a pretty thorough introduction to SQL and workload was manageable and fair\r\nThis course could be improved in three ways: (1) rewarding attendance by giving test questions that reflect specific things discussed in class, (2) giving forward guidance on the test format (multiple choice/free response) and how best to study, (3) providing intermediate deadlines for the course project to keep students accountable and provide feedback (so the TA's aren't overwhelmed near the end of the semester with questions they may not have time to answer) ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: There were not enough TAs for this sized class. There was also a lot of miscommunication. On the midterm, we were told that the exam would be multiple choice. Many of us prepared accordingly. On the actual exam there were no multiple choice, and the scores for the midterm reflect that. Often times there were not enough office hours offered to help with the homework. In short, the basic support that is expected from other cs classes (telling us the form of the exam, adequate office hours) was not in place. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the group project was fun. The lecture slides and textbook were also quite comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0The only vague strength of this course is the group project, and that just because there are too few group projects in the CS major classes.\r\nProfessor Silberschatz showed, from the very first day, that he was almost entirely apathetic about the class. The first thing he said was something along the lines of \"I hate teaching 9am classes,\" and it showed in his completely disinterested, boring, and downright disappointing lectures. 80% of the class never attended lecture after the first week or so, because the \"lectures\" actually consisted of Prof. Silberschatz merely reading the vague 100-slide presentations that are published with his textbook that the class uses. It's a complete waste of time to go to class, because his presentation actually makes the content more vague and hard-to-understand than simply reading the book for oneself.\r\nProblem sets were an absolute joke: the first was entirely \"multiple choice\" (when else have you seen that in the CS major??), and reminded me of a homework from my elementary school days. The second was just a bunch of questions that were simple SQL queries that you could write (and I did write) using the SQL one learns in CS50, not having looked at the class material at all. The third pset was mainly short response questions and was probably the best, though that's not saying much. To reiterate, yes, there were THREE homeworks in a one-semester class. I spent a total of two hours and 34 minutes on them, combined (I timed it).\r\nThe upshot is if you're looking for a gut, here you go.\r\nThe exams are even worse: the midterm was a complete joke because of some sort of miscommunication with the (relatively bad) TAs and Prof. Silberschatz, so it ended up being a copy of an old exam with content we didn't even cover in class (so we literally had no way of completing it). The final was much easier (almost as easy as the homeworks), and even included an elementary geometry problem about the area of concentric circles (???) on it, because that makes complete sense for a class on database systems!\r\nLastly, the TAs. From what I heard, one TA was relatively good with advising final projects. Our TA was a complete joke. We met with him once, and he barely glanced at our proposal before approving it, giving us absolutely no feedback. When we emailed him periodically through the semester asking to meet as we were TOLD to on the project assignment, he ignored our emails or simply provided completely cryptic answers.\r\nIn short, CPSC 437 is an utter joke of a class and a disgrace to the computer science major and field of study, if not to the institution of Yale as a whole. Shame on whoever is involved with allowing the class to continue. "

            "\u00a0If you're a CS major looking for a cool elective to enrich your CS education and truly expand your learning, I would NOT recommend this course. You learn some things about databases here and there, but you really don't gain any practical skills nor do you ever enjoy the class. Class attendance is about 10% for the entire semester after the first 3 classes, and the majority of students learned the material via reading the textbook on their own.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who does not mind the 9 am class time. If one is willing to attend lecture, this class will be fair. However, it becomes very easy to start skipping lecture, especially due to the infrequent homework assignments (we only had 3 relatively short problem sets). And then when the midterm and final time comes, the cramming becomes stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Recommended if you are interested in database architecture and design (lots of hardware-related stuff), or if you are looking for an easy elective ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a gutty CS credit, then take it.  You don't have to go to class, there's only 3 easy psets, and a pretty easy final project.  It's not super rewarding, so I would keep that in mind if you are someone who feels totally unmotivated if you aren't intellectually challenged.  I think it's elective to take if you are simultaneously taking a difficult CS elective or core class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Great to learn about database ",

I think there is a lot to be learned from this class, but unfortunately the lectures are wholly uninteresting and the work is not well structured for understanding of the material. That being said, SQL is good to know and good to have on your resume. ",

            "\u00a0This class is okay. Avi is a pretty good professor but he goes through the slides quickly and superficially so you end up having a lot of material for the two exams that you have to relearn. The project at the end was a nice because you have something at the end that you can put on your resume. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who are looking for a theoretical understanding of how databases have been built in the past, and want a CS elective that is relatively little work during the year. However, be warned, the tests will sneak up on you and cover a large amount of material. Go to lecture so you know which slides you'll need to know and which weren't covered. That will cut down on your studying load. ",

You do learn useful information about database design and get to do a project at the end. However, in all honesty, a lot of the information is self teachable. Avi just reads off the slides, and a lot of people don't end up coming to class. The class is sometimes disorganized as the TAs don't know what is going on. That being said there are two midterms, a project, and 3 problem sets (all pretty simple). ",

Its perfect if youre looking for a CS credit but want to have time to focus your energy on other classes or projects this semester.

Knowing sql and having a finished group project at the end of semester are both things you could put on your resume. \r\n\r\nThat being said... this wasn't the most fulfilling class. Lectures were dry and I left feeling like I didn't actually learn that much. Sql and database organization are things you can learn on your own.

It is, however, very reasonable when it comes to time commitment (which is really saying something when you're talking about cs classes). \r\n\r\nBottom line: I would say take this class if you have a really high workload in other classes but you still need another cs credit. In pretty much all other situations seek out courses that are more fulfilling to you even if they have a higher workload. ",
