I learned a lot about how to improve my public speaking, writing, and negotiation, but I would have liked to have more practice. I also learned about resources I didn't know existed on campus and I found this very helpful. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the hands on training in the art of public speaking, breakout sessions with fantastic public speaking coaches, the interactive activities to obtain and incorporate peer feedback, and overall great guidance from William and his co-teachers. The only weakness to the course were that it lasted only 4 weeks for 3 hours each. The course could be extended to more class sessions and focus more on the written communications side. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- The content of the class. Everything I learned in the course has been useful to me.  \r\n- The style of the professor William is very clear and gives many examples when explaining concepts/ideas which is very useful to understand them. \r\n- The structure of the first classes (my favorites!). It was great to received feedback from communication coaches and our classmates. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The time of the class. It was difficult not to feel tired and hungry during class, thus, I recommend having this class earlier in the day to take more advantage of it. \r\n- The sessions were too long. I recommend having shorter sessions twice a week or making the course longer (i.e. six weeks instead of four). ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that the class size was small so that there was more attention directed towards individuals. \r\nThe guidance from practitioners really helped and the constructive criticism was provided. \r\n\r\nThe Sage Hall was too big of a class for such a small group of students. It was hard for me to understand the instructor. ",

Your professor, co-teachers, and colleagues will all be providing you with positive feedback and constructive criticism for you to continuously improve your communications skills. Also, you must keep up with the weekly assignments as they are referenced and made part of every course session. ",

It is important to do them because you will use them in class and you will take more advantage of professor Vance's lecture if you actually put in practice what he says. Engage in the exercises and overcome the discomfort of analyzing a recording of you. Bring snacks! ",
