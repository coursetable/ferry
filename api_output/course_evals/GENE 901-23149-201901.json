            "\u00a0During this course, we were trained on how to critically think of science from a communication to an analytical range. We design a research aims page outlining our research project, goals and how we aimed to achieve them as part of our scientific training. Moreover, we participated of the mock of reviewers discussions to see how to address weaknesses within our grant applications to guarantee success. ",

            "\u00a0Different instructors have different style. Some are interesting some are not ",
            "\u00a0I understand that covering research ethics is an NIH requirement and as such there may not be much flexibility in the curriculum, but I found many of these lectures exceedingly boring. Of course it is important to know and understand the history that led to the development of many important policies, but I think anyone who has ever been added to an IRB or worked with a model system has already learned these things, so I wish the lectures had been a little more dynamic since I don't think this material was new to many people. Furthermore, I know at other schools, the required research ethics course includes more discussion of scenarios we may encounter as graduate students/a workbook of scenarios so that you actually learn practical ways to handle tough situations.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for the sexual harassment lecture, some (male) students commented that this lecture was unnecessary. I absolutely think it is necessary, but I don't think the woman who gave the lecture this year did a very good job, and honestly she did not inspire confidence in the way sexual harassment is handled at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would say the strength of the course is how engaging and dynamic it was and the topics it covered. As for a weakness, I would say it was too late in the day. ",
            "\u00a0Grant writing portion was very helpful. It could be even better by moving it to the end of the semester so we know what lab we will be in and our likely thesis project. \r\n\r\nThe human and animal ethics classes were very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Covered topics are interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The grant writing portion was SO INCREDIBLY HELPFUL!! It just needs to be after we pick thesis labs (after spring break)\r\nWeaknesses: Most of the ethics lectures weren't taught by ethicists. It would be great if they were because it would be more engaging and thought provoking than sitting there having a list of rules read to you.\r\nIt would be really cool to have a lecture dedicated to an actual biomedical ethicist to come speak about actual ethics and how it's applied to science and some of the basic ethical principles we can think about in our own work.

The human and animal research lectures were interesting, but did not really address the specific procedures for doing this type of work at Yale.\r\nWeaknesses: The science communication class was not really helpful or enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I found the grant writing sessions helpful for understanding the overall process of grant application and evaluation. I wasn't too sure if the homework helped because at that point most of the students did not know what their thesis projects would be. I think it will be very helpful if we had a grant writing course in our second year. ",
