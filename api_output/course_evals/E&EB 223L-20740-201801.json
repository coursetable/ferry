            "\u00a0I learned about the major trends in the tree of life.  I learned how plants and animals (and other living things!) are actually organized, and I got to see an enormous number of creatures up close during this lab. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great introduction to the principles of biodiversity and phylogeny. I also gained practical lab skills that will be useful to me as a future med school student (dissection, observation, analysis). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how diverse the tree of life is and how different organisms are classified, and I learned how to appreciate nature more. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much from this course. I am a MCDB major, with minimal ecology background. I loved this course and it was super fun, interesting and engaging with amazing TA's and professor Marta Wells! ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to do field work in biology and generally a lot about plants and all domains of life on Earth. It was pretty comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introduction to working with living and non living specimens from the entire tree of life, and understanding the connections between them. ",

            "\u00a0This class was ran like a well oiled machine. The work expectations and labs were very clear. My one complaint is that the canvas site could have been more organized (maybe folders for each lab). Other than that, 0 negative comments about this lab. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes I have taken at Yale. It is hard to find a class that balances knowledge/skill gain with entertainment but this class really did so. Provided a very hands-on and fun opportunity to learn a lot about the functional traits and organisms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-good explanations on how to use things\r\nweaknesses-labs sometimes felt a bit too long/wasn't always sure why we were doing what we were doing\r\nquizzes could be more structured ",
            "\u00a0The professor and the TAs are all super enthusiastic about the material, and want to make you excited about it too and happy in general.  The biggest weakness is that it feels like a survey of all living things without any driving experiments during our observations; however I think this is pretty typical in ecology/evolution labs. ",
            "\u00a0This class is already pretty great. Marta is a fabulous professor. Perhaps making the requirements of the course a little clearer would help. Between the iPad, the physical notebook, and the lab handouts, I was never sure how best I should use my time. E.g. should I take physical notes or just take pictures with the iPad? Streamlining that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and the instructors are passionate. I really appreciated the hands-on approach to learning about different organisms' structures. I liked the field trip to Sleeping Giant and doing ecological work. However, the course was disorganized and sometimes I felt like we were doing busy work, especially on the lab reports. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: there is so much variation. One week you're in a stream, the next you're looking through a microscope at plants. It is SUPER engaging and fun, and worth the time commitment.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it is pretty time consuming with long lab reports but it is definitely worth it! The quizzes can be challenging but thats the nature of Yale classes! ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job introducing students to a wide variety of types of life. The one improvement I would suggest would be to make the lab tasks a bit more clear and organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very good because it covered a lot of ground, and we learned a lot and did serious work but also were able to do very fun things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - super fun, great curriculum, great professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - lab reports, even the small ones, are too tedious. They took relatively little critical thinking given how long they took to do. I personally took far more out of actual class time. ",
            "\u00a0The grade on notes can be improved. I loved the use of the iPad but taking notes that I could compact into one file for the last note grade was kind of difficult. "

            "\u00a0This is a great class, but it is a lot of work. Definitely doable, but be prepared to spend time on the lab assignments and studying for the weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are not a super-biology person but need a lab requirement for either pre-med or something else, would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this class unless you are VERY interested in ALL organismal diversity (read: bugs, gross slimy invertebrates, TARANTULAS, etc.) and are willing to get your feet wet (literally-we went outside in the rain a lot and waded in streams). That being said, if you're into these things, the TFs and Dr. Wells are really nice and the lab could probably be enjoyable. I was not and that was probably obvious to everyone around me when I cried while dissecting squids!! ",
            "\u00a0You should definitely take this lab, especially if you're looking to fill a bio or pre-med requirement.  The lab is chill and fun, without busy work.  The lab reports are reasonable and straightforward to write. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would! A great class, regardless of whether you are pre-med or thinking more about the basic sciences as a future career. Even a great class for anyone who just wants to get their feet wet in science, even if they are a humanities major, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you need a bio lab and love learning about nature. It is very hands on--we go to a creek and catch invertebrates at one point--so if you don't think you would like that sort of thing I would skip this. The workload isn't awful but the lab reports can be time consuming and feel more like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0100%. If you enjoy biology/ecosystems then take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah - its honestly a great course, despite the stress of the lab reports and quizzes at times ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Especially if you're premed or need a bio lab for a requirement, this class is good because you learn, but there's no other class like it because of all of the interesting activities we do and field trips we take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if looking for a fun bio lab. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. This course is like taking 1 week each of the other organismal diversity labs (plants, arthropods, mammalogy, ichtyology, etc). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved the class and loved Professor Wells! Marta is awesome! "
