            "\u00a0This course gave me more insight into the methods and applications of calculus, with discussions of the use of calculus in the real world. The course encouraged me to appreciate mathematical theory alongside the actual calculations, which is something that I hadn't experienced prior to taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Even though I already took calc in high school, this class made my understanding much more solid and was amazing to be taking at the same time as physics. Things like the basics of diff eqs and optimization became more clear to me because of this class and were very applicable. ",

            "\u00a0Very informative, but the midterm questions were awkwardly weighted (T/F questions made up a significant portion). ",
            "\u00a0The course encourages group learning and collaborative working with peers, which can be very helpful but also can lead to some uncertainty. Completing exercises in class with peers was a great way to understand and apply concepts; however, I often felt that the difficulty of the problems covered in class was not representative of the difficulty of the problems on the P-Sets and the WebAssign, which (although expected) often made the homework rather laborious. ",
            "\u00a0I like the class sizes, which allow for a personal relationship with the teacher. I wish I had been told before the class started that we get an online book included when we buy web assign because I wouldnt have bought the hard copy. ",

            "\u00a0I felt that the quality of the course varied on who was teaching it. There were sections that seemed to well taught and others that were not at all. I also found the textbook/ webassign homework system used to be incredibly inefficient and over priced. The software costs $100 dollars. There are other homework systems that work far better for far less. ",
            "\u00a0Pam was such a great instructor. It was extremely clear from the start that she cared about her students and their learning. I loved how engaging her class was and how helpful she is, in and out of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0The first problem set focused too much on pre-calculus material, which seemed to scare a lot of people into dropping to Math 110 even though that material didn't drastically affect my ability to take the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was the pace at which the content was taught. The weaknesses are the psets. They have questions beyond the scope of the course and this gives the students the mindset of 'trying to complete the pset (by going to peer tutoring)' rather than 'trying to practice the concepts through doing the pset'. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of homework is a weakness. Doing both a Pset and 2 web assigns per week was a much greater work load than my other courses, and the webassigns were rarely helpful ",
            "\u00a0This class taught things in the weirdest way. I had prior knowledge in calculus, but I know a lot of people who didn't. A lot of the concepts went over would be really difficult to learn if you weren't in calculus your high school years. Even then, the course would teach things already touched upon in high school calculus. However, the way and order that it had to be taught in were more like a big review instead of an actual teaching. "

She is very helpful and always available for students who need help. She also explains concepts remarkably clearly, which is invaluable in a math class. ",

            "\u00a0If you are a student looking for a QR credit, I would suggest taking another course. There are many other QRs that are much more well structured and easier than this. However, if you want to review the underlying principals of calculus I would recommend the course. I you are new to calculus this course will be challenging as the pace is incredibly fast. Many of the students in my class had already taken calculus in high school. Only two people had never seen the content before. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good class. I understood calculus for the first time. Despite learning a good amount of the material in high school, I finally understood how it all relates to each other (for example, a derivative is the slope of the tangent line at a point). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it was a prerequisite or if the student enjoyed learning calculus. ",
            "\u00a0As a basis of calculus it is necessary to take this course, but as a course itself I wouldnt recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were debating whether they're not interested in math or whether math was just challenging for them. "
