            "\u00a0This course really emphasized engagement with the different texts that we read. I was one where I didn't just feel like I was just taking I what I was reading like a spectator but I felt like I was having a conversation with the authors of the texts. The Professor also forced us to ask strong questions about the material which lead to incredible conversations in class. I honestly learned so much. My only critique is that sometimes it was hard to see how everything fit into modern human trafficking and sometimes I wasn't sure what direction the course of was going with that topic. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: pretty robust reading list, an extremely knowledgeable and passionate professor, really good class atmosphere\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: seminar discussions rarely touched explicitly on more than ~30% of the reading, which could be frustrating because readings could be a few hundred pages long; it was difficult to find time to meet with Prof. Peck outside of his office hours; Prof. Peck also sometimes overdominated seminar discussion "

            "\u00a0Yes I would. For all the reasons I mentioned above in the strengths. Also the Professor makes the course not feel like a class but a table discussion with friends. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, but Peck is a visiting professor! But if Yale manages to poach him, certainly take a class with him. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if I would recommend it to another student. The subject is wonderful, the readings are great, and Prof. Peck is truly passionate about what he is teaching. That being said, I sometimes found seminar to be a little frustrating, because Prof. Peck spoke a lot during class, which made the flow of conversation more forced and limited. ",
