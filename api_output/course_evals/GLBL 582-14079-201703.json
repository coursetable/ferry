            "\u00a0A great class to learn about the financial crisis and develop the tools to actually understand the implications and things you read in the WSJ or Fin Times. ",

Professor Garten is great and his assistants as well, always helped us when needed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Just one class per week of 3hs is quite intense\r\n2. The homework was just making summaries, sometimes having questions to answer or a particular assginment maybe could guide us better ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nCourse Instructor is excellent\r\nVery Well structured course\r\nGrand Overview of the topic\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nTechnological developments were discussed for less than two hours in the class. The readings in technology & global finance - were not adequate.\r\nEmerging economies was dealt for less than two hours. The readings were highly inadequate in this subtopic. "
