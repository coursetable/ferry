            "\u00a0He will be a great professor and has a great method for teaching and facilitating discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Well read and incredibly knowledgeable in a wide range of subjects.\r\n\r\nSome tendency to dominate the conversation in section. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel Loncar is smartest human being I have ever met. His sections are well-organized, well-paced and logical. Best section I've had so far at YDS. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel is obviously gifted. He has a simultaneously broad and thorough understanding of not just medieval theology, but most theology and philosophy it seems. These gifts mean that he is able to have high-level conversations about almost any subject. However, I found that this was to our section's detriment. Because Sam can so easily move to second and third order conversations, we often skipped the first order/foundational conversation. This meant that I usually left section feeling dumb for not always understanding the conversation that was being had, and I also did not get a basic grasp of the material. I don't think I was alone in this experience. Sam has a tendency to make section a conversation in which we frame the text based upon what he's thinking and knows, rather than a space to help students to a basic understanding of what we are reading in a given week. This is a shame, as I'm sure he could explain the basics simply and well. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel is an excellent Teaching Fellow.  He was courteous and patient as we worked to understand main ideas during section, and he clearly has a passion for his field.  I am thankful he was my TF. ",
            "\u00a0Sections were extremely informative, but not much synthesis of course material was undertaken. Ideas were inspiring and exhilarating and the philosophical background was so helpful! But I never got a sense of the texts or people in conversation. \r\nLectures were incredible! ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Samuel's openness to discussing the pastoral implications of the texts we read. In a class that too often became a philosophy of religion course at the detriment of focusing on its theology, his openness made space for me as I sought to apply our learning to my priestly formation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely well-read, offered very helpful, narrative-based and contextualized overviews of our texts and their cultural/historical backgrounds. Great conversation facilitator, open to questions and comments.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes assumed a wide knowledge of a topic or historical background that was not known by me/the class. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel displays extensive and keen knowledge of his subjects. He is a brilliant lecturer. \r\nHe is also welcoming and encouraging of discussion and differing opinions. \r\nHe is also always available to talk and gives generously of his time. \r\nThank you. ",
            "\u00a0Very good at providing high level overview, connecting themes and points between topics and reading to help us great an overarching narrative. Could have been a little more specific at times. Also, please respond to emails even if it is just to say that this is something better worked out in person. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel was a very good facilitator of class discussion and his passion for the material was evident. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel was a phenomenal teaching fellow. He is brilliant and has the incredible ability to synthesize a lot of material into clear, convincing points. The sections helped me so much in understanding this difficult material. He balanced sections well between teaching and leading discussion so that everyone always had the opportunity to speak and discuss but he wasn't afraid to get up and explain the topics that we were having trouble grasping. He is a very knowledgable philosopher/theologian and a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Samuel did a great job of facilitating discussions during out sections. He was always open to different voices and perspectives, and often helped encourage me to speak up. I also found his lecture on Aristotle, and additional section on platonism/Neoplatonism very informative and helpful. "
