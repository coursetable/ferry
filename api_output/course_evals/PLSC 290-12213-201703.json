You don't really need to do all the readings (or any of them in my case) in any great depth because Professor Erikson breaks them down really well in lecture and explains in an interesting, engaging, and relevant way.

Briefly covered a vast array of theorists, while diving a little deeper into some theorists such as Marx, Weber, and Du Bois. Started with super abstract theories of Kant and went all the way to the early theorists of race (Du Bois) and gender (De Beauvoir) which was pretty cool. Lectures don't cover everything from the readings, so if you really want to understand and get the most out of the course, you should at least skim and understand the main points of each reading. Doing the readings often wasn't necessary though, as most of what you need to know is covered in lecture and especially in section. I would suggest doing the readings that you can and the ones that are interesting to you so you will have some ammo for the big paper that you write at the end. Reading summaries online was usually enough for the longer readings and for the better-known theorists. ",

            "\u00a0This course was a really great survey of core philosophic thought regarding social theory. As my first sociology class and having not taken many philosophy classes prior, I thought the readings really highlighted the evolution of thought regarding the state of nature, modern society, and the systems that are constructed with human association. What was especially interesting was reading some foundational works that are often found in other classes, such as Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality or Marx's Communist Manifesto, in a sociological framework and applying a different lens of analysis when you're thinking about what these theorists thought about society at a more macro level.

The course moved quickly from theorists to theorists, but if you did the reading, i feel you gain a lot of insights into social theory.

            "\u00a0Some of the reading material and lecture was kind of dry and pretty impenetrable, especially for someone who had never taken sociology before. The advertisement as a \"foundations\" class sort of misled me into thinking it would feel more like a total intro class than it actually was. Would have been nice to cut out some of the jargon / super abstract stuff. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were beautiful but mostly geared to teach about the scholar themselves rather than parse out the theory itself. I liked the biographical information, but given lectures were so short, I would have appreciated more of the professor's analysis of the theories. Erikson's insight is always lovely and helpful. It is a classic survey class. As a survey, it can't really be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I found myself regularly participating early on in the semester, because I did many of the readings and enjoyed the content. However, I was frustrated by the mismatch between my understanding of the content in class and my performance on assessments-- having much more specific grading criteria might have helped alleviate this. Lectures were wonderful, but finding that I wasn't doing well on assessments, I became too shy to contribute. My professor was very warm and caring, not to mention eloquent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nAMAZING lectures. Caring and thoughtful TAs and good sections. You really learn a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIf you already have a good foundation with people like Kant, Hegel, or Du Bois, you might want to skip because it is a survey course. ",

My grader wrote \"write more clearly\" on one of my assignments (25 min multi page essay, while friends with much messier handwriting got better grades) This should be done online as a take home assignment, and better feedback should be given. But it didn't matter due to the survey nature, not motivating anyone to give better feedback. ",
            "\u00a0We got through a lot of material in this course, which I think is its biggest strength and weakness. I often times felt a overwhelmed by the number of different authors we read, but it was also good to get a cursory understanding of many of the \"classic\" texts. I don't think any of the assignments in the class were helpful to better understand the theories. The in class writing assignments were too quick, often the feedback I got was along the lines of \"you should have expanded this point more\", but with only 15-20 minutes it's hard to even organize your thoughts. I liked that for the midterm we had the questions in advance to think more about it. I appreciated the freedom we had with the final paper, but I felt completely lost as well, with no support or guidance on what was expected of us. ",
            "\u00a0The level of engagement with the material in the class was not great.But the class was overall well structured and is useful in understanding social theory. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a good range of theorists, and I especially appreciated the diversity of theorists toward the end. However, I found the lectures disorganized and hard to follow, and felt that the assignments/final didn't match up well with what we were learning in class. Some of the reading assignments were really long and complicated, and without any direction to read them, were  little overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0lectures were very interesting.  professor erikson is extremely engaging and fun.  section was kind of boring though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: cover vast array of theorists and learn their main theories. Section was great and helped you understand all the material. \r\nWeaknesses: didn't go in-depth on many of them, but that's not too bad considering you cover a lot of breadth. Lectures were pretty hard to follow b/c they weren't that organized. \r\nIt's a tough course to make amazing as a professor because it covers so much breadth and is mostly abstract and theoretical. Overall it was a decent course, pretty straightforward and not too hard at all. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a broad introduction to philosophers and social theorists, and we get a general overview. This is a good thing because it lays a foundation for those who wish to study more in this field-- which is exactly what the course should be. I wish we could get more interactions with the TA's that graded our work, because the TA we have in section is not who grades our papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great and well-structured. ",
            "\u00a0I do not understand the purpose of this class. Fundamentally, it is weird. We are reading seemingly unrelated social theories, and we are not seriously interrogating them. These theories seem to lack real-world applicability, and any attempt to apply them to the real world is dismissed by the teaching staff as \"not the point.\" There is no historical link between the varied theories in all but a few cases. Thus, the intellectual exercise of the course becomes more or less the functional equivalent of a high-concept Star Trek forum. It is not applicable or useful outside of the class, there is no historical ramification that we are contending with, and even the mental exercise of analyzing these theories is limited to accepting then applying them as interpretive frameworks. It seems similar to doing chemistry through philosophy, and similarly flawed in that it has no real world input. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: survey course, good coverage of sociological theorists for a political science student. Leaves more lines of questioning for exploration of the two disciplines together. The final paper gives such a route for exploration.\r\nWeaknesses: The coverage of philosophers, such as Kant and Hegel, were surface level. Tocqueville was also not covered fully in-depth and accurately, in my opinion. There were some moments when I questioned whether the philosophy was accurate or being watered down too much for the survey nature of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings were well organized and made sense together, and the lectures were really great. The short in-class writing assignments, along with the final paper, also worked well to solidify the knowledge gained through the readings and lecture. Professor Erikson also always had really great lectures and since the slides were less text-heavy, you really had to go to lecture and pay attention to get the most from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought we went over each thinker too quickly. It was very hard to keep up. Also, not enough guidance on the paper. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is a very good summary of readings, well organized ",
            "\u00a0I loved how this course touched on certain themes throughout, such as free will. The course, in this way, had an overarching narrative rather than a disparate group of facts. Discussion section could be improved. Instead of summarizing what we learned in class, I wish we had expanded on certain points or gone into the readings more in detail. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging with interesting snippets of the theorists lives and the TF also tried to make the course more understandable which was nice. The assignments were broad enough to ensure individuals interests. However, the grading felt quite random at some point and there was also really no grading rubric given to us. Uncertainly in grading made it a bit hard to enjoy the thinking process. Some of the prompts were also unclear, and I felt that only some of the people had a sense of what they were expecting as answers which again felt unfair. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the class focused on one sociological thinker at a time, but felt the lectures were difficult to follow. Although the slides were available online they were not very helpful and I ended up learning more from youtube videos. ",
            "\u00a0I was super disappointed by this course. The readings were fantastic, but everything else was subpar. Erikson did not lecture well--she got sidetracked, she explained concepts poorly, and one time she just turned on a biographical documentary about Franz Fanon in apparent lieu of engaging with his scintillating prose. Her lecture slides were either a single, only-tangentially-related-to-the-matter-at-hand image with a one-word caption or a giant, hard-to-parse block of text from the reading. \r\n\r\nThere were 3 in-class short essays, one longer in-class midterm essay, and a 10-ish page final paper. The prompts for all of these lacked imagination and were, on more than one occasion, grammatically incorrect. I just got the feeling that very little care was exerted in preparing and executing the syllabus. As a partial result, very few students seemed invested in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course has potential to be a great into sociology course, but instead just gives a brief history lesson on a number of philosophers and social theorists, without going into depth enough. This course might be better if the department/prof chose 5 or 6 critical figures to go over and actually spend significant time on each of them. ",
            "\u00a0Meeting with teachers were very helpful, maybe more directed sections but they were really helpful to understanding the material, more interactive class. ",
            "\u00a0I think one strength is the reading list  this is why I took the class; I wanted to read from Marx, Weber, Durkheim, Du Bois, Nietzsche, etc. The lecture format worked well in helping me navigate what sometimes were very difficult readings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the lectures were a little dry, and I think it got too rushed toward the end of the semester. I feel like it would have been better to devote more time to the authors at the end of the semester  Arendt, Kristeva, de Beauvoir, etc.  and less on some of the people in the beginning. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that lecture would be more tied to the readings because sometimes there's a disconnect between the reading material and the lecture. Also, seminars could be more engaging because sometimes they became mini-lectures instead. ",
            "\u00a0The material and Prof Erikson were great, but the quizzes/tests weren't always clear about what they wanted from students. I only figured out how to study for this class through trial and error. It didn't help that there was a confused TA grading arrangement where the TA who teaches your section ISN'T the one grading your stuff. Hopefully this will be fixed by next year. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  The professor was very kind and really tried to help us break down the philosophers' arguments. I also liked the set of philosophers we read.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere were also basically no opportunities for students to receive feedback on their work. There were 4 in class essays and a final paper this semester, and little feedback other than a final grade was given. The course could be improved if the TA was the grader, since that would allow for more feedback/interaction. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Erikson and the lectures are incrediblethere's a fair bit of reading for the course, and some of it can be complicated and dense, but she does a wonderful job of highlighting themes. The lectures are very good at creating a dialogue between the various sociologists. There are some central questionse.g. where agency exists for individuals in a societythat connect the arguments made by the theorists. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Erikson did an amazing job lecturing and was clearly very passionate about the subject material. The syllabus went in a very well planned order, so that we were constantly building on past theorists work. One improvement would be to spend more time discussing intersectionality. Obviously, since there are certain theorists that must be covered, the last section is more limited than is ideal. However, I think there should be at least some critique even of this section in the form of a more extensive discussion of intersectionality. "

I was not as interesting in a 200 level philosophy class.\r\n\r\nIts not alot of work if you don't do the readings that close (duh). I think I spent too much time nitpicking to no avail at the readings, rather than learning the big picture concepts, as this class was clearly focused on.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed some of the *sociology related* readings, thought the lecture never really went in depth, and felt like my in depth knowledge never drastically improved, as the most difficult readings and translations were only superficially touched upon, and I was not very good at the in depth readings. This frustrated me, and my other STEM friends. Many dropped when they realized this class was not for them.\r\n\r\nI learned best from my amazing TA, but there was not enough time to do this, in small 1 hour weekly sections. ",

It doesn't treat any authors particularly in-depth, but that's to be expected in a survey-type course. You can definitely take this class to gauge your interest in the thinkers' work, and then do additional coursework/readings based on the work you were most excited about. ",

Going in without much knowledge about sociology and not too thorough a background in philosophy, I thought this course was a great introduction to basic social theory and a survey of the foundational thinkers who have shaped modern sociology. Some of the readings were a little hard to get through and understand, but between Professor Erikson and the TFs, the main takeaways were not too hard to grasp. I would definitely recommend attending lecture and sections; Professor Erikson does a great job of breaking down the readings and sections are always great to discuss the ideas further and really delve into each theorist.

The syllabus is great  you read all the big names in the field, and Professor Erikson's lectures help synthesize the dense parts. The class made me think about new things and offered a new approach, and I appreciated the perspective. It was not a hugely demanding class, and the lectures were not always the most engaging, but I would recommend the class as an introduction to some really important thinkers and concepts that will help you understand other disciplines and everyday interactions. ",

But I don't regret taking it, and I recommend it to anyone new to social theory, or DS kids like me looking for a sociological lens on the stuff we read. I think it's best to have some philosophy background before diving in, since we move quickly through some pretty dense material. It might be more of an intermediate class than an intro class? But Erikson's always happy to explain things if you need. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class for the sociology major. You get a run through of all the major philosophers without going too much into any one of them, yet you still learn a lot from reading parts of their works.\r\nI'm not sure if I would recommend it if you were not a sociology major. It's just a basic survey course. It is, however, I think, a lot better than some of the survey courses run in related fields (e.g. poli sci, philosophy) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Erikson is amazing, and the lectures and material were consistently interesting. If you've taken DS or a lot of social science/humanities classes, you would probably find this course rewarding. It does a fantastic job of connecting and tracing the strands of arguments between theorists. ",
