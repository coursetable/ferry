I didn't like the textbook at all and there should be a better textbook in the market for learning Japanese. ",

Yes there is daily work (more than other languages) but the work is fun to do and you will learn so much Japanese it's crazy. The professors are some of the best people I have ever met. ",

It is challenging and the workload is a lot because it meets everyday, but the teacher support I received was much better than my other classes. The teachers really care about you and the small class size allows you to really get to know your teachers. ",
