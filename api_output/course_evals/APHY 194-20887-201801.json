            "\u00a0The course is very self-contained and follows the textbook closely. However, the topics are explained very quickly in class so it's hard to keep up, especially after reaching PDEs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the many available opportunities to get help. There were two different review sessions held every week and two different sets of office hours held every week as well. This was incredibly important for student learning and success in the course, as the teaching fellows who ran these review sessions were excellent and made the class so much easier to understand. Another strength was that the homework directly reflected the difficulty of the tests. Weaknesses included that lectures were not engaging and were often difficult to follow. Many times students were so confused that we didn't even know what questions to ask before the instructor moved onto the next topic. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was not too difficult and can be used to understand processes in different subjects such as physics. Although the material wasn't impossible to learn, the lecture was not always the best place to learn it. ",
            "\u00a0TAs were awesome. You need to get to know them and go to review sessions if you are going to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Class is difficult and in many ways poorly taught. The teacher tries, but the course moves fast and the lectures can sometimes be unclear. A strength is that the professor stops to summarize core ideas, label things and where to find them in the textbook, and does many practice problems in order to help keep students who may be lost on track. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the problem sets were too focused on tedious details such as integration rather than applying the methods we actually learned in class. Otherwise the class was fine. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the course is objectively difficult, and the lectures never actually covered how to solve differential equations-only derivations and proofs. The text book material was not in-depth enough to cover the course material that was tested on. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were sometimes confusing. Help was provided and available which is a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty standard enas math course ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the semester was clear, and the material of the course up to the second midterm was reasonable. After that the topics were not as clear, and the lectures did not help understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0this course gives a decent introduction to differential equations but is limited by varying mathematical backgrounds of the students. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were pretty slow going but I feel like that's the case with any math class. The psets weren't too tough and the TA sessions were always very helpful if I had any questions. The material is extremely tough but it was also rewarding learning the stuff. We covered a large amount of material, which I think is good because the course taught me a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class's homework was not as hard as other QR classes I was taking, the p-sets were manageable. However, I don't feel that the class was well taught because the subjects were taught too fast and if I did not learn the material by myself, the lecture would not be so helpful ",
            "\u00a0The class has many cool things to learn, but it is so fast paced, you get very little time to appreciate the beauty of the math. It becomes just a hustle to finish problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Diff Eq is always pretty hard to teach, but it would be awesome if the last part of the course could be slowed down. I really didn't get a lot out of PDEs, I still have a really surface understanding of them and think they really brought me down in the end. ",

            "\u00a0Would recommend for students who need to take differential equations, but would not recommend to those who want to gain an understanding of the \"why's\" behind solving problems. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who was interested in taking differential equations, as I think the set up of review sessions in addition to lecture made the material extremely understandable. ",

            "\u00a0Yup. You have to take it. Rough class but doable if you keep up with the content of the psets. Exams are fair, Final is rough. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not very interesting but likely very applicable for higher level courses ",
            "\u00a0Not necessarily, only if they have to for the major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it's helpful for your other engineering classes, at least that's what I've heard. No major knowledge of multivariable needed so you should be fine depending on who is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you have to, but don't do it if you're just interested. ",
            "\u00a0Not at all, actually. I like math, and in general I like understanding how things work. But this class was really boring tbh. But also it wasn't that hard. I think in previous years it used to be really hard, and she made it easier this year? Anyway, I felt like diff eqs was just a game of eye-spy-- see what kind of equation it is, then spit back the correct method to solve it. I guess it was kind of satisfying to get a better understanding of concepts that I had seen a little in physics or engineering , but overall it wasn't too inspiring. "
