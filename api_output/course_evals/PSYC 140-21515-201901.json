            "\u00a0I have learned so, so, so much from this class. It's probably the most I've learned at Yale. I know 100x more than I did about psychology and development, and more than that, I know more about how psychology works and how people design studies and carry them out and explain their findings. I also learned about the different careers you can have as a developmental psychologist. I learned some things from the books and some from the lectures, but both were so interesting and taught me so much. I say this with little irony: people should be required to take this class to become a parent. It taught me so much about children and about how we can help them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about developmental psychology as well as how to propose and defend a research project in this field. ",
            "\u00a0Learned SO much about developmental psychology and how babies develop into kids and learn about the world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the developmental process of children and its relevance to human psychology as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about the brain and behavior connection and why we develop the way we do. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the minds of babies and children. ",
            "\u00a0Substantial insight both conceptually and experimentally into the field of developmental psych. Understanding of cognitive, perceptual, social, emotional, personality, moral, etc development. Understanding of key themes that unify development. Improved literacy with experimental techniques used in the field, both in understanding them and devising novel experiments. Most and best of all: a new interest and possibly even passion that will influence the courses I take in the future. ",
            "\u00a0It really changed the way I think studying child psychology and gave me a very solid foundation in the field ",
            "\u00a0A very in-depth knowledge of childhood development. This course has been super helpful and I have already applied it to other disciplines and classes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about developmental psychology in this course. It's hard to frame exactly what this means, but I learned to consider things from a developmental perspective, as a system that undergoes changes under developmental constraints and reaches its final state. "

            "\u00a0I can honestly think of no weaknesses. Expectations were clear, lectures were lively and engaging and hilarious. Professor Keil and our TA were really approachable and eager to help with anything development related. Even though we knew so much less than them, we were able to present our ideas and have them taken seriously. It was so encouraging for me and made me feel like I was actually capable of understanding everything I needed to. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely amazing course. The professor is clearly so knowledgeable about the subject as was the TA. It was so interesting to listen to him talk, even without slides, a fantastic lecturer. It was awesome how he could speak on a multitude of specific research studies, especially ones going on in Yale labs. I loved the extra project proposal part of the class. I learned a lot from it and it was a generally great experience to discuss a topic of interest to me. The textbook was great as well, the first textbook I'veever wanted to buy. The only weakness might be that it was a bit too easy. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is Prof Keil's expertise in the field and his engaging lecture. One weakness is that the lecture and reading are overlapping content, which makes sense, though can make the lecture less engaging when one does the reading assigned for the class. ",
            "\u00a0N/a ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- professor engages well with the material and excites learning in the students ",
            "\u00a0The test format and overall percentage breakdown could use some improvement. ",
            "\u00a0lecture style is boring and monotone, class time was too long for my concentration, but material is fascinating. not too much work  just weekly reading responses and Prof Kiel gives you 30 exam questions from which he pulls 5 to be on the exam a week before, both for midterm and final. Each question is loaded, so requires a lot of committed prep and is by no means easy, but its all super manageable if you have the textbook bc Keil himself wrote it. The index will be your best friend! Took mental lives of babies and animals in the past and would recommend that much more than dev psych for similar concepts but far more engaging lectures. All that said, I really appreciate that this class tested conceptual and application based knowledge rather than regurgitating memorized facts like in intro or abnormal psych. For that reason, It makes for much more humane and intellectually rewarding exam experience than other classic psych lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: an extremely knowledgeable, passionate, and approachable professor who gives thoughtful, responsive, and engaging lectures on fascinating material. An overall class structure designed not to put pressure or stress on the student, but to encourage a dynamic and self-driven understanding of the material. A light but meangful workload. A grading system that is probably the least stress inducing out of any class Ive taken so far: for both exams, questions are taken from a larger subset handed out a week prior. For the first exam, there is the option of a retake. Weekly short essay questions, of which 3 are skippable, and you get two tries (with excellent feedback if your answer isnt quite right the first time) to get full credit. Finally, a thought-provoking (and pretty low stakes) extra credit opportunity. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: cant really think of any. Absolutely loved this class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were icredibly fun and engaging, and I loved that our instructor was open to questions. However, sometimes we would get off track in the slides which made later studying difficult ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very knowledgeable professor, engaging lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: slides are sometimes hard to follow. I sometimes got lost in his train of thought. Exams are an absolute pain to study for. ",
            "\u00a0We went through a lot of material very quickly, but in a manageable way where the lectures helped you actually understand the material. I don't think the course had any major weaknesses "

            "\u00a0I feel like this should be mandatory. I want all my friends to take it. It helps you understand kids so much better, helps you understand yourself so much better, and teaches you the details of so many fascinating psychological processes. It's been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far and has helped me decide to major in Pysch. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. Professor Keil is one of the best lecturers at Yale. You'll learn so much and you're mind will be blown after each class. It's gotten significantly easier to do well and it's just one of those classes you have to experience, whether you're a psych major or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved the professor and the material. I also loved the way the class was conducted, which facilitated discussion and learning ",
            "\u00a0yes! The topic was very interesting and Professor Keil is an amazing lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Dr. Keil is a great lecturer and I would definitely take another class with him if he taught one. He's also a genius. ",
            "\u00a0Without any reservations. Please please please take this class! You wont regret it. ",
            "\u00a0definitely would recommend! Keil is a great professor and loves the subject! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Developmental psych is fascinating even if youre not a psych major, and the lectures can be really fun ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend it because it is interesting and very informative. Preparing for exams is very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Keil is an amazing instructor and developmental psychology gives you a well-rounded perspective that I haven't gotten from any other course. It's a way of thinking, and I find that very special and useful for my personal and intellectual lives. "
