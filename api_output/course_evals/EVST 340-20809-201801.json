            "\u00a0It's structured such that in general, you learn the qualitative material in lecture and the quantitative skills needed to do problem sets in section. However, not all sections sufficiently cover the problem-solving skills, so problem sets can be frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0no clear feedback on any of the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course seems to lack direction.  We learned about topics in a piece-meal sort of way that made an overarching theme difficult to parse.  The problem sets were consistently confusing (What does it mean for a population density to be measured in one dimension? That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  Are 286 humans standing in one single-file line? Even if it's 286 humans in the circle with a one-mile radius, what, is it another 286 in the next circle with a 2-mile radius?  Is it a series of concentric circles each with the same number but a proportionately decreasing density of humans?  What kind of world is this?  We can calculate the area of a circle in square miles, which is the standard unit for population density in the US, and then multiply that number of square miles by the average population density per square mile to get the estimated population for that given region.  When I asked about this, I was told that it was designed to make the concept \"simpler\" to us but it is in fact more confusing.). Also, more diversity in variables is important.  For example, \"D\" is meant to be \"demand\" \"density\" \"damage\" and other d-words, and things start to get a little unclear.  Apart from the disjointed nature of the course, it's all very interesting.  Furthermore, students seemed to be getting different educations one discussion section to the next. ",
            "\u00a0This course was frustrating because Professor Mendelsohn's lectures rarely related to the work we were doing on the problem sets. It was not a cohesive course and the TFs were not well prepared by the instructor to facilitate our learning. ",
            "\u00a0One of the worst courses I've taken at Yale. Mendelsohn is too good and interesting of a professor to have a course like this. The material and lectures were great. Readings were interesting and engaging. But overall, the class was terrible. The problem sets were full of errors, and were \"supposed\" to be taught in section - sections where the TF would ask pointless questions, do problems full of errors and then say \"you'll figure that out later\", and belittle anyone who asked a clarification question. I went to office hours several times, did the pset with the TF who was grading that week, and still didn't do well. Also, there's huge variance in grading - the same answers on psets were graded differently. The midterm was a mess, with questions that didn't actually ask a question. One of the TFs told a section of students to assume that a midterm problem was asking about a certain principle; when the midterm was graded they were all marked wrong. Trainwreck of a course. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were sometimes unclear, but TAs were always quick to respond to any questions ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting but the lectures are almost irrelevant to both the exams and the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mendelsohn's lectures are a little slow, especially for a 300-level economics class. They could relate more to the problem sets. However, the information presented is very clear, engaging, and fair. ",
            "\u00a0There should be a textbook, a clear syllabus, and better faculty and TA choices. The lectures were meandering and seemingly unconnected to one another, and the sections were profoundly unhelpful, in which the TA just hands out the answers to the problem set as if that is meant to facilitate learning. Honestly, this class ought to be cancelled or seriously reexamined. ",
            "\u00a0Simply put, this course had no strengths and it's frankly embarrassing to Yale that it remains in the Blue Book. The course was badly taught, with little to no effort shown by the professor or the TAs. The workload, while minimal compared to other Yale classes, consisted of problem sets and a midterm tangentially related to what we learned in lecture, but the issue was that we never went over anything quantitative in lecture -- the broad ideas taught in lecture really only showed up in ambiguously written short-answer questions on the midterm and final, and had no influence on the day-to-day workload in this class. This was incredibly frustrating to me. If the problem sets are going to be quantitative, teach quantitative stuff in lecture. Leaving it to section leaves us to the mercy of our TAs -- and my TA was not an effective teacher, nor did she even seem to want to show up to section every week. Get better and more enthusiastic TAs, more uniform grading policies, and teach relevant things in lecture. That would be a start. ",
            "\u00a0Sections were helpful - but course and section did not overall in material which wasn't good ",
            "\u00a0I liked the design of the course- lectures, readings, problem sets, and sections, with one midterm and one final. Obviously I was pleased with the content too. My one concern is a lack of standardization amongst TAs- for review sessions, they would sometimes come up with different answers than each other and present completely different formulae in their sections. ",
            "\u00a0I found the material interesting and the class disseminates some great economic intuition as well as some counterintuitive methods of addressing climate change. As to any critiques, I found the problem sets vague and did not directly correlate to what we learned in class. Further, the exams were fairly vague. That being said, section was a great cap to the week. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so disorganized! There's a huge disconnect between the basic concepts introduced in lecture and the quantitative problem sets we were assigned. Usually, the math in the psets was not difficult, but because we were given no idea how to set up the problems it was difficult to get started. Also, the problem sets would be very unintuitive (i.e. giving population density per mile instead of sq. mile so instead of taking the area of a circle and multiplying it by density per sq mile you had to do the circumference*density per mile and take the integral over the radius length). Also, the problem set answer keys had frequent mistakes, the Final Review session was very disorganized, and the exam included things we never learned how to do. ",
            "\u00a0This course needs a lot of work...I honestly can't think of any strengths other than the fact that it has the potential to be incredibly interesting, but in it's current form, it should not be allowed to be taught again - it is that poorly organized, and it ultimately hurts the students. There is little to no correlation between lecture and section. Lecture is strictly qualitative, while section is dominated by quantitative stuff. The PSETs are so poorly written that it is hard to understand what the questions are actually asking. It's almost like they are trying to disguise what the question is asking, so you have to read their mind to figure it out. This same trend is also found on the exams, which is extremely frustrating. The exam questions are so poorly written, to the point where it's simply embarrassing how many students got up during the final to ask questions. There were literally lines forming in the lecture hall to have TA's interpret what was being asked. This is incredibly unfortunate when the final exam is worth 50% of a students grade because a extremely large compression curve will ultimately determine every students grade. This basically means you are being graded on how well you can decipher what is being asked rather than how well you know the material. Another problem is the lack of practice problems given. You only have 10 problem sets, and the solution keys posted just have answers and no work/explanations. There is no practice for the qualitative part of the exams either. This course needs some serious revamping to actually help facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0The only strength of this course was the interesting material that Professor Mendelsohn had to share. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of this course are FAR too many. It was so disappointing that such wonderful material with a bright professor was marred by a horrendous curriculum and unsynchronized teaching fellows. The problem sets are always vague and entirely quantitative but the lectures are essentially entirely qualitative. The teaching fellows are the only hope you have for learning the quantitative portion, but in some cases  they don't even know what they're talking about. There's no explanation for the economic concepts in certain cases, and there have been cases when one teaching fellow in particular (Angie) was incredibly condescending in helping the students, and even misleading and self-contradictory. Really, really disappointed because this class could be so wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0There are so many typos in the piece sets, the professor doesnt care to fix them, many of our piece sets we have to do on Excel, so we dont learn. Some TFs are better than others. So many kids cheat in this class-on piece sets, the final and midterm. In lecture, we learn qualitative stuff so we cant apply what we learn to do piece sets. It could be improved with more office hours, more quantitative examples, and less cheating. We basically only learned one main concept that kept repeating itself. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this course is so easy to get an A in by simply going to section each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: very badly run. The TF's aren't coordinated, the psets are badly written, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Everything is a weakness, the class was awful. Especially that half the TAs were incompetent (doesn't get better next year) and that NONE of the questions make any sense at all. Don't take this class. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures only sometimes had slides which was problematic in situations in which I missed something the teacher said mid lecture and then could simply look it up later in the lecture slides. However, the class was very informative. ",

I wish that the professor had released the PPT presentations earlier in the semester. ",

            "\u00a0NO. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There are other Econ classes that might have you do more work during the year, but are at least fair in grading and well structured. The reading and materials were interesting, but the psets were annoying and full of errors. The TFs were incredibly unhelpful, and at office hours would tell you answers were correct and then proceed to mark them wrong when actually grading. Midterm/final had unspecific questions with no clarification. During the year, there wasn't much work - readings took about an hour and pset would take maybe 2 if you really worked at it. But honestly this class is the worst - horribly structured and incredibly frustrating. If you do take it as like a 5th class maybe Cred/D it, but honestly there are such better courses out there. The emotional toll itself is too high a cost. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to learn about the economics of the environment. It does help though to have a previous economics background! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an interesting course and refreshing since it's about natural resources. Not the most difficult though, but it's very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need it as an elective requirement. ",
            "\u00a0NO. Do not take this class under any circumstances. If you are looking for a class with a lower workload, I'm sure there are other classes that meet that description and are not so profoundly mismanaged. Not only will this class be a waste of time and energy, but you will come out of it knowing almost nothing more than you knew going in. The exams are a test of your ability to regurgitate class material verbatim and also contain problems that there is inexplicably no reference material for. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. See above. Econ 330 was by far the worst experience I've had in a class at Yale, and I'm a STEM major who took the Bio 101-104 sequence so I know a thing or two about the worst classes Yale has to offer. Simply put, do not take this class. It might seem like a gutty econ class, and it might seem like a cool way to learn about environmental policy from a quantitative standpoint (which is why I took the class). It is neither of those things. The workload might seem minimal, but you won't think this class is a gut when you're up at 2am the night before the problem set is due, wondering which of the contradictory formulas in your TA's section slides vs. your friend's TA's slides will actually get you the points on the problem set. Or when your TA says she'll answer questions on canvas and never does -- or, worse, answers people's questions with incorrect information and then takes points off anyway. The most frustrating thing about this class was that the level of intellectual challenge was relatively low, but wading through the seemingly irrelevant lectures and contradictory section slides to find the few helpful pieces of information to do the problem sets and study for the midterm and final made it feel like the hardest class I had this semester -- simply because there was no effective teaching on the part of the professor or the TAs. An illustrative example: people were literally lining up in the aisles of SSS during the final today to ask the TAs what the two questions in the quantitative part of the final exam meant. They couldn't even write a two-question final without confusing at least 75% of the class. If that doesn't scare you, I don't know what will. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty relaxed course ",
            "\u00a0It was an ok econ elective, but an occasionally confusing and poorly structured class ",
            "\u00a0I think every Yale student should take this course. If you have more of an Environmental Studies background, it will profoundly change/make you reconsider your views about best practices for managing the environment. It will also give you a good foundation for Econ. If you already have an Economics background, this class will help you apply economic theory practically. Professor Mendelsohn challenges you to open your mind, which is the hallmark of a great Yale course. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this course. It's an interesting angle of economics and centers on much logic and historical evidence. The weekly work is about an hour and the exams are not too difficult, but fairly vague. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not until the class is better structured and the teaching fellows know what they're doing. It seemed to me like the professor would just give the problem set answers to the TFs who then had to \"backsolve\" or come up with their own method for solving the pset -- which is why often times the problem set keys had mistakes in the \"method\" but not necessarily the final answer. This also would explain why the final exam review session was such a mess because the TFs didn't know how to actually do the problems, but just what the answers were supposed to be. I don't blame the TFs for this, but I do think this needs to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. You will literally learn nothing and just be frustrated with the lack of organization. While the workload is light, your grade is a crapshoot because it all depends on the final exam, which there is no good way to prep for. I read reviews just like this last year before I was about to take it, and I thought I was smarter than what the reviews were saying...I wasn't. You can study all you want for the midterm and final, but there is no way to prepare - you get blindsided by questions you have never seen before and are asked to solve for completely new variables. They basically tell you how to do the homework in the last 10 minutes of a weekly mandatory section, and other than that small period in time, there is literally no other way to obtain knowledge on how to solve it. There is no anonymous feedback tool either, so you can't actively complain to try and implement change without hurting yourself. Just don't take this class and save yourself a lot of time and frustration. ",
            "\u00a0I ignored a warning to not take this class when I was shopping, and I really wish I had listened to it. I would absolutely not recommend this class to any student that was juggling any other time consuming classes. However, I would say that this class had very interesting lectures and covered interesting topics. Too bad, the content was really wonderful  the teaching was executed so poorly. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. Although this is known as a gut, the tests are not all that easy, people just cheat. Sad. ",
            "\u00a0If they were looking for an easy 5th class, absolutely. Otherwise, I'd advise them to look for a more stimulating course that has better real-world applications. ",
            "\u00a0No, worst class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not because not only is the teacher very scattered and rarely stays on topic but the TAs as a whole weren't very knowledgable and if anything confused me more than they helped me. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student for the econ major, as it is a good way to fulfill the distributional requirements and is a fairly good elective. Must be relatively interested in the environment or at least find environmental control interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, its a good Econ class for the major. ",
            "\u00a0This class has the potential to be really good. The content itself is actually interesting because you're learning material at the cutting edge of the field. Unfortunately this course was one of the worst-taught classes I have taken at Yale. The professor does not cover any of the material for the problem sets in lecture, saying that \"that's what section is for.\" Section is just simply not enough time to learn everything you need to know. Also, the quality of TFs varied so widely this approach was genuinely unfair. But I must say that the worst part about this course is that (I hate to say this but) whoever writes the problem sets clearly has pretty poor English and they don't seem proofread so I kid you not that I spent literally twice as much time just trying to figure out what each problem set was trying to say as I spent actually solving the content of the question. I've never experienced anything like it. So take this course of the content appeals to you but don't expect a wonderful learning experience or competent teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yup! A lot of people take this class with the attitude that it will be a \"gut.\" Indeed, the workload isn't too heavy and the material isn't too difficult to grasp. But simply relegating it to a gut doesn't really do the class justice because the content is actually quite interesting. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. I think it is a very good course to acquire an overview intuition about the economics of the environment, which is a very important topic, especially going into the future. Even to non-economics majors, I would recommend this course. Also good that it is not one of the most rigorous courses in the department as this makes such an important topic accessible (at least at an introductory level) to most. ",
            "\u00a0No, actually the worst class at Yale. Hard because you have to guess at what they are asking you, with a bonus that you learn absolutely nothing. ",
            "\u00a0No. This course was a complete waste of time and a total pain to try and do the work for. It seemed like the professor just showed and rambled on topics tangentially related to the course and then gave us PSETs that had nothing to do with what he taught. ",
            "\u00a0nope not until they figure out how to make lecture more relevant ",

            "\u00a0No don't take it - not as a QR, not as an Econ course, and definitely not as a good one. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the lessons a lot, and it's generally an easier class. However, the teaching structure needs to be redone to make quantitative applications of the lectures much clearer. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course on a content basis. It was very interesting content-wise and if you can get past the poorly structured lectures, it has some intellectual gems worth learning and understanding if you're interested in realistic ways of addressing environmental issues that incorporates the multidisciplinary nature of the field.
