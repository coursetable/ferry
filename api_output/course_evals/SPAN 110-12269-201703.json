            "\u00a0The best way to learn a language is by studying it a little bit everyday instead of grappling with it at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish L1 covered a lot of Spanish for an introductory course. As someone who started Spanish from scratch I learned a lot of vocabulary, conjugation, superlatives, preterite and a lot more. Just from taking a semester, it is evident that I learned a lot of Spanish, enough to read basic texts, speak in complete sentences, and listen to Spanish conversations. Since this class meets everyday, be prepared to do a lot of Spanish if you take this class, but it is quite worth it and you see improvement and new knowledge gained everyday. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great basis of the Spanish language . ",
            "\u00a0Basic Spanish writing, speaking, and listening skills with must-know vocab in the present and preterite tenses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak, read and comprehend basic Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0How to shower, get dressed, and walk to class in under 20 minutes.  Usually successful.  Also learning to doing the online things on time!! ",
            "\u00a0I strengthened my critical spanish skills and was thoroughly introduced to the study of language on the college level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Spanish and how to write paragraphs. I also learned about culture and how to speak beyond just basic sentences. This was my first time learning Spanish and so I also learned how to conjugate verbs and different tenses. This was a such an encouraging way to start my journey with Spanish and I am so very excited to learn more! ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the Spanish language through development of my reading, listening, oral and written skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic Spanish vocabulary and grammar, expanding my ability to read, write, speak, and comprehend a new language. "

            "\u00a0Well organised, the instructor was great and the exams were well spaced out ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong because it is fast paced and a lot of information is jammed packed into the course. Sometimes the information may not feel integrated but as you learn more more and more of the phrases and vocal and grammar learned all fits together. Another strength of the course is that it meets everyday so you can practice Spanish everyday in class and with the homework. One weakness of the class is that many different students of varying exposures to Spanish are all in the same class (due to the placement exam being apparently quite difficult) so you may feel behind for a bit if you are starter. However, don't worry as there is plenty of chances in the semester to catch up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great course book, great amount of homework, great speed of learning\r\nWeaknesses: videos did not match well with the lectures ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized. At first I was worried that, because all the Spanish 1 courses are following the same syllabus, the class would feel overly structured. This wasn't the case, however, and the course felt natural and well paced. It was nice knowing that all the Spanish 1 classes were taking the same exams and learning the same material, even though my class felt unique and personalized. My biggest criticism of this class is the textbook - the online access code is really expensive, and gets you a service that feels like it was developed in an undergrad CS class. The book itself was a little better than I expected, but I would still prefer the information to be presented more clearly and succinctly. ",
            "\u00a0The VHL (supersite) assignments were actually very helpful and reinforced classroom learning at home. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught very well. We did a lot of examples to practice each grammar topic. The professor gave us extra practice at home and in class. Additionally, the Supersite homework and videos, while annoying, was great practice. ",
            "\u00a0Its generally enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Sybil Alexandrov was super engaging and fun :) ",
            "\u00a0This course is very supportivel of your individual development. ",
            "\u00a0I can think of no weaknesses besides the fact that I wish the grammar tests were all weighted the same. I did worse on the test that was weighted more and unfortunately that made my grade lower. I like the set up of the rest of the course though! \r\n\r\nStrengths include my wonderful professor. I had Sybil Alexandrov and she was handsdown my favorite professor of this semester. She really wants to get to know you and she also cares about us so much (so much that she brought us donuts 3 times this semester!). ",
            "\u00a0The interactiveness of the course helped me succeed, ensuring I kept up with my work and fully understood each new concept. The course packet could be improved to better complement activities in class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course thrived in its seminar style. The best part was speaking to other students and the instructor in Spanish. I felt this really increased my proficiency. The other main strength of the course I found was the structuring of the syllabus. Reading and studying a skill as homework the day before class and then practicing that skill and speaking in class the next day is a really effective method for me! I think the main weakness of the course is just the speed through which we pass the material. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Spanish is a very useful language and it was very well taught ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in starting Spanish as I had. If you already know Spanish, this class is still quite a challenge as it is very fast paced and the assessments are quite difficult. For a beginner, the course may feel overwhelming at first but there are definitely a lot of resources to help you, like the Spanish tutor program and instructor office hours. Overall, if you want to learn Spanish this course is perfect for that purpose if you are ready for Spanish work everyday. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - this class is so much better than any language class I have ever taken. I really enjoyed this class, even though I definitely don't consider myself to be a \"language person\". ",
            "\u00a0Yes! SPAN 110 is a great introduction to Elementary Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to be able to speak and understand a language that if very relevant in the world, then you should pick this class with this professor. By the end of this class, one will be able to understand basic Spanish (and understand basic grammar structures) very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very well taught, outstanding introduction to Spanish ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students. ",
            "\u00a0YES if you want to take Spanish, take it! This course is absolutely amazing. Even if you have already fulfilled your language requirement, you can most certainly take this course as well if you wanted to learn Spanish. This is a very manageable class and the tests are not challenging as long as you study and keep up. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It's a great introduction to the Spanish language that is conducive to beginner learning. "
