            "\u00a0I gained an insight on how fMRI and PET imaging studies are conducted. I learned how to critically analyze published paper and studies involving these two forms of imaging. ",
            "\u00a0I had no experience with imaging, and this course was an absolute STELLAR way to get background in imaging studies and understand the types of questions imaging research can answer.  In addition, the mathematics behind PET and fMRI imaging modalities are explained well.  The design aspect of the course truly helped me improve my understanding of how to use imaging to answer neuroscience/psychological questions.  I can read imaging papers well now, and I have gained the ability to critical evaluate other groups' experimental designs. "

            "\u00a0Strength - the professors are knowledgeable about the subject; we interact with the materials and are encouraged to stay up to date on the material through weekly synopsis\r\n\r\nWeakness - wish we covered more imaging studies regarding the effects of other drugs besides tobacco and alcohol ",
            "\u00a0This course has the perfect workload and is extremely welcoming of people who want to learn more about the field.  I was never afraid to ask questions, and the design-a-thons were a GREAT way for me to learn about experimental design in imaging with my peers.  The assignments were helpful in improving my background in PET and fMRI.  The only thing about the course I would like to see changed is to have the background information presented in the beginning about each imaging modality be available the entire semester for reference.

            "\u00a0YES! It's a well taught class that doesn't require much work in order to succeed. You learn a lot if you show up to sections and the professors are very engaging. Students are active participants in the class! ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!  I think this is a great course to beginning am imaging odyssey.  The course staff is extremely knowledgeable and willing to help their students.  I never left class not learning something new or not smiling.  Professor Morris, in particular, has a passion for the material that is contagious.  I loved this class, and it is probably the best class I have taken here.  Moreover, the workload is just even to learn but not too much to feel stressed out or behind in the concepts. "
