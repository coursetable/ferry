            "\u00a0This biggest takeaway I got from this class was a deeper understanding of the American school system and how complex issues surrounding education can be. A good portion of the lectures really delved into some of the major problems around education policy and how these issues came to be. I found a lot of the information discussed in this class to be really intriguing and really helped expand my knowledge of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot more about teaching and challenges faced by low income students ",
            "\u00a0Literally nothing. Honestly, this class had so much potential based on the course title, but in the end it was a waste of time. It ended up being a really, really, really basic stats class (like, use the normal distribution but not z-scores just the 68-95-99.7 rule) with the occasional historical or personal anecdote from the professor thrown in. We did so much useless crap like spending an entire class session \"learning\" what a median is (we know what medians are!!!!!!). The only interesting part of the class was when Prof. Jaynes told us stories of his cases/personal experience. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that you get to receive credit for tutoring students in at New Haven Academy (NHA). A weakness is that the grading of coursework varies a lot due to the subjective nature of the homework assignments. ",
            "\u00a0this class was so disorganized. no one had any clue what was going on and I dont think anyone learned anything new. ",
            "\u00a0This class's only strength was that the workload was easy enough that I didn't have to pay attention. I learned nothing valuable and Professor Jayness was so unorganized. The TAs never knew what was going on. I took this class my senior year and strongly feel like it was a waste of my last semester. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the class was the SAT prep class! It was so fun and rewarding to go into the school once a week and work with the students. The debate was also fulfilling, and as a nice change of pace from the standard paper or final exam.\r\n\r\nThe statistics portion of the course felt a little underwhelming. I felt like the material covered was too simplistic for those experienced with stats and not comprehensive enough for those with little stats experience. I thought the most valuable parts of the course were the ones centered around policy choices, whereas I'm not sure anybody gained much from the cursory treatment of regression, etc. ",

            "\u00a0The TAs who graded the psets were way too aggressive on their grading. This was highly discouraging ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the course is the lack of organization surrounding the tutoring aspect of the class. We were given the responsibility to help lead SAT prep courses at New Haven Academy which in concept was a really cool thing. The only thing was that we had to basically develop and entire curriculum that had to be taught in essentially 6 days (1 meeting per week for 6 weeks). This made whatever we did have to be either be extremely brief, or else we couldn't make our way through all the material we needed to be covering. This was extremely frustrating, and at the end of the day, it didn't feel like we really achieved much with the students. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers information that is pretty interesting but it doesn't cover much of it. Don't expect to have your mind blown, though you'll learn some about funding and policy. ",
            "\u00a0One large weaknesses is that because there were so few grades, it seemed like everything was graded very harshly.  More points in the class would be better. ",
            "\u00a0It was a little scattered and unorganized for the practicum ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: No work. Jaynes had some interesting stories.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Everything else. Arbitrary grading on assignments that were pointless and stupid. Pretty unreachable professor. This class treats its students like they're all massive idiots by simplifying concepts to a middle-school level, which was incredibly frustrating. No one came to class because it was useless. We didn't actually learn anything substantial about the American education system, and the things we did learn were taught with absolutely no nuance. The practicum (teaching SAT classes in a local high school) was problematic in the way it was approached--namely, we took actual class time when we had no experience teaching SAT classes and barely had any plan to do so, as if Yale students were more qualified than the actual teachers at the school. ",
            "\u00a0very disorganized but interesting content ",

            "\u00a0This course has a lot of potential, but is very unorganized. It could be improved by sticking to the syllabus and establishing a more concrete lesson plan with the schools that students visit to teach. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest weaknesses was in the grading of this course.  The TAs graded incredibly harshly, and, at times, even unfairly.  Additionally, there were no solutions provided online to check over work, or to understand where problems arose in homework assignments.  It was, therefore, not easy to learn from mistakes, or understand what was expected of you in class.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, one of the midterms was canceled, which sounds great at first, but led to a recalculation of the overall class grade (that is to say, the homework became, as a larger percentage of the grade, and midterms became less), which can positively and negatively impact a students grade at a whim. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by focusing a bit more on the history behind why school systems are the way they are today, mostly by focusing a bit more on the economic history as opposed to learning basic regression formulas that are not too applicable outside of the course because they are very simplistic. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great experience to tutor New Haven high schoolers, although this aspect of the class was pretty disorganized. It was never clear if the tutoring session was cancelled on certain days, and there was very low accountability - tutors went to class on their honor system. Lectures themselves were very slow, although this might be a good thing, as you might want a slower class so early in the morning. However, some of the lectures on statistics were definitely very slow. Final project is fine, allowed me to actually review the material and engage with it. One of the greatest weaknesses was the arbitrary grading on problem sets. Apparently a very simple and straightforward question needed a ridiculously specific phrasing of the answer - even if the answer you write is 100% correct. This was frustrating, and I never really got a straightforward explanation on what the correct answers were supposed to be. "

On one hand, the structure of the course is unique, particularly the opportunity to teach an SAT prep class, my favorite part of the course. However, the light workload means that the class is full of seniors looking for a spring gut, which proved to be frustrating for those of us genuinely interested in the material and engaged with the class. It also means that many non-seniors who are genuinely passionate about the material are barred from taking the course due to the high demand. ",

            "\u00a0A cool course to learn about education.  A lot of people never show up to class, and probably got nothing from the course.  However, if you attend lectures and actually engage with the material, it is quite interesting.  Professor Jaynes is a really knowledgeable professor. ",
