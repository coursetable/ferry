Forces students to truly think about the issues at hand rather than just regurgitate answers.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere were a lot of readings that seemed more \"interesting\" rather than \"necessary\" in terms of what we needed to know for exams. Demarcating personal interest vs. exam material could be of help for busy Yalies. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was poorly done. The instructor was un-engaging, and said a lot of questionable things. Did not explain things well. Was difficult to understand. After the midterm he basically told us we all were horrible students and should have tried harder. But when you have an exam average in the 70s, then something is wrong with the exam or the way it was taught. There were many visiting lecturers which made it difficult to get in a rhythm or know what was going to be on the exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Jamie Childs is a wonderful instructor with so much experience, and an interesting person. The variety in topics keeps it interesting.\r\nWeaknesses: It was somewhat unclear going into the first exam what exactly it would be like, and what the best way to prepare was; I think that the assignments might be better as shorter weekly/biweekly assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course could do well with more/different organization and trimming. It felt like a lot of random information put together from different subject areas for one pathogen. For example, we talked about molecular biology, immunology, medicine, policy, ecology, etc for every pathogen. \r\n\r\nAlthough the writing assignments were interesting, it would have been nice to have more variety in the topic and maybe a little more related to course content.

            "\u00a0Having so many guest lecturers was awful. The constantly changing teaching style makes it hard to learn. Also some were just awful instructors and some were very problematic. The majority of public health students are female. We should not have a majority old white male guest lecturers. Yes they are experts but I KNOW there are women and people of color available to guest lecture. Representation is crucial especially at Yale. We don't need a guest lecture for every topic. That just turns into a seminar and not a course. ",
            "\u00a0There were some great concepts taught in this class but the way they were taught was occasionally very confusing with different speakers often coming in. While  the different speakers  provided specialized information it was difficult to know what material would be needed to know for exams and lacked organization to study. I did really enjoying learning about zoonotic and vector borne diseases and how we should approach these in a public health setting. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the topics we covered in this course and I like Dr. Childs, but I think it was difficult to know how to succeed in this course. Many lectures were given by different teachers which made things more interesting but definitely more difficult to know what parts would be important for exams. ",

I've known professors to hound their students for circumstances that may be out of their control, while Dr. Childs is understanding about personal situations as well as honest when he's dissatisfied with our performance. He has high expectations but also gives us the benefit of the doubt. ",

He said things that were both insulting to students and people of different countries when talking about international work. Often times when asked a question, he wouldn't or couldn't directly give an answer even when it was on the subject material. ",
