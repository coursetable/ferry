            "\u00a0I got a lot better at painting! ",
            "\u00a0The habit of painting watercolor regularly and studying master works to apply their lessons to my own practice ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of watercolor (British school and American school) and about various techniques to work with. I learned to really look for the color in everything and to look at small details and architecture around me for subject matter. I found that Yale is a truly beautiful place, full of interesting corners and buildings, and that it is full of color. Buildings that I normally just passed by stand out to me now. I also learned to let go and to loosen my work up - to let go of an expectation of a perfect painting. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful class, I am so glad that I could take it before I graduated! I learned to observe and appreciate art - something I knew nothing about, and to have confidence in my skills and developed an interest in continuing with watercolor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the art of watercolor - how to paint, critique paintings, and understand the varying styles of watercolor artists. I also learned how to write about watercolors and engage with the art form on a regular basis. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to hone my skills in watercolor through experimenting with new techniques and studying the styles of the masters. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: knowledgeable instructor, beautiful campus to paint, good access to supplies (it was very helpful for the supplies to be provided by the instructor)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: class ran over time a lot, which was challenging if I had somewhere to be right after. Always seemed like there was more that the instructor wanted to do than we had time for. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellent and filled with strengths. The only weakness is that grade wise I never knew where I stood. The Professor never provided any midterm feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: materials are provided for free, and they are high-quality (not like in some art classes the basic/not so great quality materials are provided, and you have to buy the better expensive brushes/paints etc). Everything in this course - supplies, course packets, framing/matting for the show - is covered. That is rare at Yale, especially for an art class. It was especially encouraging as this was offered for beginners too. Other strengths include the format of the class- emphasis on reading and lecture first, then painting/practice, with visits to the galleries. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are obviously that Professor Van Doren teaches it. He is wonderful and everything I could have hope for in a teacher - humor, wit, knowledge, care, and talent. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the structure of the course - learning about specific artists and / or styles and then painting for the rest of the class. It allowed us to apply what we had learned and critiqued to our own art. I also enjoyed painting at different locations around campus. We could paint at different spots that would allow us to paint subjects other than architecture more often - perhaps a portrait / figure focused class. ",
            "\u00a0This course only had strengths! Every moment of it was pure enjoyment. I learned a great deal from Professor Van Doren, and I hugely admire his work and knowledge of the medium. I would not change a single this about how this course is organized. The trips to the museums were fascinating and the excursions to unique areas of campus made this class an adventure with a continuous change of perspective. "

            "\u00a0Great class that I would recommend! Nice change of pace from other Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a great way to learn about the art of watercolor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely - this was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Professor Van Doren is so encouraging and provides helpful feedback, and also he's a really funny guy. I think if you do take the time to do the work for the class - to make a lot of paintings and to try and challenge yourself - you can change your worldview and really learn to appreciate your surroundings. The amount of opportunities here is huge - you also get an end-of-semester class exhibition. It's really a class for all levels and is just a wonderful experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you can. No matter what your skill level (I started at 0) you will learn to appreciate watercolor, build your skill base, receive useful feedback, and will learn about all kinds of artists and their techniques. Plus you get to hear Professor Van Doren speak about art which is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any other student regardless of your past experience with art - you will learn to become comfortable with watercoloring and have a very enjoyable experience with the art form! ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, this is the best course I have taken at Yale. Do not hesitate to take this course if you have the opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful class for both beginners and skilled watercolorists alike (if you can get in). This is not a gut, Prof. Van Doren truly expects your full participation and willingness to learn and improve. You will paint in class as well as on your own. You must maintain a sketchbook and take the time to appreciate even the mundane around you. Sometimes you will be instructed what to paint and other times you will have free reign. You are provided with supplies, get to visit some great vantage points around Yale, and examine art in the nearby galleries. Watercolor is an often undervalued art and you will learn techniques from the greats. Van Doren genuinely wants to convince students to pick up watercolor painting as at least a hobby. Depending on your learning style, I would say this is the #1 art/painting class to take at Yale especially if you haven't done this kind of work like this before. "
