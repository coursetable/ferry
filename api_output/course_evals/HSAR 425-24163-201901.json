            "\u00a0This is amazing course that explores a fascinating subject matter. The class developed the students' abilities to create arguments from visual analysis  specifically, a more complete argument in a longer final paper that drew from the methods we practiced in class every week. The class' inclusion of a presentation on our final project research before the final paper was such an important step that helped the writing process so much (a method of thinking that I will bring to other classes).

            "\u00a0I thought it was great! ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths completely depend on the attitude you bring to class, but the small size of the seminar means that you have an astounding set of opportunities to learn through conversation with Professor Jung and from your peers. If this course has any weaknesses, they stem from the limited nature of the syllabus, but maybe limited is the wrong word. We study exactly one work of art per week, which makes it feel like we only scratch the surface. However, the degree of granularity with which we assess each piece and the scholarship surrounding it almost makes up for the narrow scope. ",
            "\u00a0This course was planned excellently with topics to focus on each week and an interesting array of reading for each class meeting. Professor Jung led the seminar very well and really welcomed students into the conversation and encouraged them to think critically and speak up. ",

            "\u00a0This class is awesome. Professor Jung is a genius, and the works of art you deal with are super fun and exciting. The workload is completely manageable (just weekly readings and one final paper) and even if you've never taken a History of Art class before (which I hadn't), it has a lot to offer. ",
