            "\u00a0The course laid a basic foundation for German grammar, as well as for elementary speaking and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Gained a very good understanding of the basics of German, including syntax and structure. \r\nI also learned about Germany and German culture to some degree, although the focus was more on an introduction to the language itself (which is to be expected from an L1 course). ",
            "\u00a0I learned elementary german. We also learned about german culture through film and in-class projects. "

            "\u00a0I love that the course meets daily and that there is a great opportunity to get to know your peers. The course provides a lot of variation in activity, increasing engagement with the materials. There is little to no rote memorization of tables-- the course seems to place an emphasis on experiential learning. I liked the \"webquest\" exercises quite a bit (although I wish the presentations were graded or received in depth feedback). I do wish that \"webquest\" projects would be done between chapters, after an exam. \r\n\r\nMy only truly negative comments are about the textbook: it is both pricy and a bit unhelpful. Grammar is not always explained clearly and the exercises often seem odd or perhaps not well thought out. ",
            "\u00a0High degree of immersion in the language in class. I found the course material to be engaging enough, not exciting but not boring either. \r\nThe best parts of the course were activities conducted in German outside of the textbook material. These included watching music videos, film clips and an entire movie in German with German subtitles (Der Ganz Groe Traum). These provided a more realistic insight into the use of German in everyday life. \r\nA lot of the listening material was clearly geared toward beginners, which is natural for an introductory language course. However, it would have been better if there was more 'natural' listening material, especially later in the course. There was still a decent amount of material such as interviews with German people about their everyday lives, which helped a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I do not prefer the immersive method of teaching language. I would have liked a concrete lesson on grammar and specific exercises to go along. Instead, it felt like we were expected to pick up on the grammar before being given the rules. I think that is a fault of the book more than the class itself. A weakness of the class was the final project. I do not think that a group project is a fair assessment of personal progress. I liked the cultural aspects of the class, like watching the film and listening to music. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is very confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like all of our in-class time was used very effectively, and I had a really great experience in the class. \r\n\r\nOne thing I really struggled with was the online homework; my instructor's feedback was great, but on most assignments there'd be a few of the auto-graded questions I checked over and over again (especially the ones where they say one word, and you had to spell it correctly) and could never get right, and it wouldn't tell you the right answer once submitted, which didn't help me improve. \r\n\r\nA lot of students were perpetually late to our meeting time despite our instructor's emails, and it bothered me that the first five minutes of class or so were perpetually wasted.\r\n\r\nThe video project was really stressful. My group didn't really understand the quality expectations at first, but our instructor was really accommodating of that issue. I thought the script writing was a great exercise in German, but the actual filming was very, very time consuming. Our group also had some internal issues that majorly impacted our ability to do the project. We talked to our instructor about this, and didn't get as much accommodation as we'd hoped for in the wake of it. In the end, with the accommodations we had, I was really pleased with what we'd managed to scrape together, but our grade still fell a little below what I expected. Also, I wish more guidelines were shared about the presentations. When other groups presented, it seemed like they went in really different directions with the presentation, and I didn't understand their films very well. "

            "\u00a0Yes, of course. Learning a language is both fun and rewarding. The design of this particular course is very engaging as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It is a great introduction to a great language, and the entire German department at Yale is fantastic. It covers enough such that, if you study the material well enough you can hold a basic conversation and read simple German. Would definitely recommend this course if you want to study language from scratch. \r\nIn addition to the course, the events organised by the department such as lunch tables and movie nights are very helpful for engaging with the language in a fun and immersive way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even though I do not like the textbook, I enjoyed learning German. "
