            "\u00a0Seriously learned what an ethnography looks like and how ethnographic work is conducted! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a bunch of anthropological and sociological methodologies which were very inspiring in thinking about my own future research.  I also learned how to think about topics from a very multidisciplinary angle. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about social scientific theories, ethnography, and analyzing researcher's methodologies. Content-wise, I learned a lot about a variety of dimensions of the lives of youth of color, from the hypercriminalization of young men in Oakland to the effect of violence on the collective memory of youth in Medelln, Colombia to the transnational racial formation of young Afro-indigenous men in Honduras. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like more than anything I learned about different ways to employ ethnography as a methodology, as well as about the youth control complex and the many ways that societal anxieties are placed upon youth. ",
            "\u00a0critcal thinking, writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge surrounding the place of youth in both the United States and Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me improve my critical thinking skills and critically question and evaluate the way that I think about the space of youth in society and in the Americas.  It offered a strong interdisciplinary approach through which we examined these questions, using a wide and interesting range of sources, from film and music to academic articles.  As Professor Ramos-Zayas is an anthropologist by training, the course had an anthropological bent which I found really interesting as a non-anthropology major, because I learned a lot about anthropological research and methods.  I appreciated the opportunity to create my own research project in an area of interest for the final paper, and really enjoyed exploring a question I had always had for myself. "

            "\u00a0This course seemed full of potential, but it was poorly organized. Readings were all over the place and unduly long. Discussions were poorly managed and often lulled. And the assignments lacked creativity or construction. ",
            "\u00a0The course syllabus was altered several times throughout the semester, which was at times difficult to keep up with. A more concrete syllabus would be helpful for keeping up with Yales undergrad academic pace. Additionally, at times readings which were listed under the syllabus contained incorrect links and could be difficult to find online. It would be very helpful if class readings could be scanned and posted on Canvas or linked as scanned PDFs in the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Great reading selection honestly and Professor Ramos-Zayas' mini lectures at the beginning were always great! Major writing assignments are also thought provoking and wonderful. Just amount of reading was extremely heavy for one weeks worth at times, and class discussions sometimes dragged on with not all students engaged. Weekly reading responses were challenging. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this class were amazing, and I loved the discussions each week.  I thought the final paper process could have been a little more structured (I know a lot of people left it to the last minute). ",
            "\u00a0The readings are almost always interesting, however, some weeks have a lot of reading. The discussions are sometimes slow but mostly engaging. The assignments are set on a good time line and allowed you to write on your interests. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were a good mix of student and professor/TA participation. The syllabus covered a wide range of topics and subjects which was awesome. The freedom allowed on the final paper was great, I got to write about something I had been thinking about on my own and I could see that other people were excited about their topics too. We also watched movies and videos a few times during class, which was interesting because they related directly to what we were reading (and were of good quality) or to current events that related to the class. Would've maybe appreciated shorter reading responses, I often felt pressured to cut the reading short and just write a response on what I had already done because I was afraid I wasn't going to finish all the readings and write the response in time. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the heavy focus on anthropology was a surprise to me considering that the course was not cross-listed as an anthro course, so this isn't so much a weakness as it is something that I wish was advertised better. I feel like I would have appreciated knowing that basically every reading we would do was going to be an anthropological study, especially since I personally do not prefer anthropology/ethnography in terms of methodology. Still, the course was well organized and the professor and TA were very knowledgeable on the subject and were clearly passionate about their work. ",
            "\u00a0strengths were class discussion, clss material didnt seem to have one overarching argument, was a bit broad but each weeks unit and topic were seperately engaging ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in the interesting reading material that always facilitated interesting discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This was a strong course which I really enjoyed.  The weekly one page reading responses were not super challenging and gave me an opportunity to contemplate the reading more.  The class discussion was interesting and well guided, and I learned a lot about how to think about youth and youth issues and realities in the Americas, particularly through an interdisciplinary but anthropological related lens, which as a non-anthropology major was an interesting and welcome opportunity.  The final research project which we got to propose was nice because I was able to do research about a topic I was really interested in, and Professor Ramos-Zayas and the TF Clara Wilson-Hawken worked well together to help throughout the course and in the process of writing the research paper. "

            "\u00a0This course seemed full of potential, but it was poorly organized. Readings were all over the place and unduly long. Discussions were poorly managed and often lulled. And the assignments lacked creativity or construction. You will end up writing a summary of the weekly readings and then a 15-20 research paper, all of which you will feel little investment towards. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely!! Professor Ramos-Zayas is legendary and getting to read her ethnography and then hear her talk about how she conducted her work was incredible. She also let us Skype one of the people interviewed throughout her 10 year long ethnography and it was unreal. Take this class if you love youth, want to read amazing ethnographies throughout the course of the seminar and start learning how to write one too.  Also, there is a 5 page autobiography assignment early on pertaining to your own youth that, at least for me, will probably be the most memorable writing assignment of mine that comes out of college. Take the seminar if it's offered again ! ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course!  it touched on so many different themes - race, gender, sexuality, migration, and different aspects of youth cultural practice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course could appeal to a wide-variety of interests/majors. The readings were engaging. The workload was completely manageable. The class allowed me to reflect on my personal experience and to consider broader, systemic questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're comfortable with reading and writing a significant amount, and if the things you'd be interested in learning about include modern social sciences esp. subjects pertaining to race, class, gender, or, a bit more specifically, globalization, neoliberalism, transnationalism, cultural production, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, but I think I would be more clear on the fact that there is an anthropological focus. I would definitely recommend it to people interested in the subject matter and interested in ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0yes ARZ is amazing!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly someone who is interested in the Americas, and questions of youth and youth agency and realities.  It is not exclusively a U.S. focused course, which is a good thing, and anyone with an interest in Latin America will be able to enjoy and appreciate the diverse reading list of this course, which included but was not overwhelmed by U.S. sources and viewpoints.  The interdisciplinary nature of the course was great, and I learned a lot about anthropology and anthropological research methods.  The weekly reading responses were not very difficult, and the ability to do a final project on a topic of your own interest was really nice.  Professor Ramos-Zayas is a really wonderful and warm person, and a very helpful professor, and I loved taking a class with her. "
