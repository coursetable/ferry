            "\u00a0Not many. On the plus side, the course provided a basic overview to an increasingly important topic, probably THE hot topic right now in private sector engagement on environmental issues. However, it was heavy on expectations and light on content. The course did not provide adequate preparation for the outputs required, making it necessary for students to learn complex topics on their own or rely on previous knowledge of their peers. The course left out the finance basics that should have been the basis for further learning, especially for a course with no pre-reqs.  It would have been great to actually learn the tools of financial analysis. Jake's TA sessions tried to fill this gap (and they were great), but they weren't enough. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a pretty good understanding of the challenges related to investing in socially responsible businesses or alternative energy from the shareholders' and investors' perspective. I learned a lot from the speakers coming from various backgrounds and how they (or their companies/organizations) approach the concept of sustainability in finance. ",

            "\u00a0Overview of what the sustainable finance history and landscape look like, from green banks and green bonds to ESG investing and conservation finance. Most importantly, I learned to look at how considerations of sustainability can and should play into the modern financial system, and how sustainability can actually add business value. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a firm understanding of the landscape of Environmental, Social and Governance factors as they are considered and incorporated (or not) into financial decision-making. The knowledge I developed was mostly in relation to how to evaluate Exchange Traded Funds, and to some extent securities. I gained skills in assessing the ESG validity and considerations of a given fund or security. ",

            "\u00a0I came to understand more the finance world, how a portfolio is created and managed. I learned what is ESG and how these criteria are considered by funds, and the difficulties in measuring and reporting the ESG performance. I learnt that ESG can play a significant role in how a fund outperforms. ",

Learned that these are actually accessible topics and that there are real tangible ways to get hired into this type of careers. ",

            "\u00a0I think the knowledge, skills and insights that I gained were in line with the expectations that I had going in. It was a very well constructed overview of many different aspects of sustainable investing, and while I would've like to have developed more skills that were directly useful for investing, that was not the thrust of the course per se, and hence I didn't really expect to have that be a core component of the material covered. The insights have inspired me to dig deeper on finance and that was something that I didn't expect necissarily, but really appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned fairly closely--I wish more time had been spent on the other forms of innovative sustainable finance options, instead of such an emphasis on stocks and company approaches. The few days on green bonds, social impact bonds and conservation finance were very interesting and seem to present greater opportunity for innovative thought. ",

            "\u00a0Very well ",
            "\u00a0Conceptually it met my expectation. I would want more financial and quantitative training. This is especially true for FES or other non-SOM students. Early on in the class there should be more TA sessions, and resources should be distributed so that students can learn on their own, rather than waiting until before the final presentations for these resources to be distributed. If there are free online courses like on Coursera that the instructor can recommend to students, that would be great. Until the end of the course I still don't feel like I understand how to really value a company or a fund. But to be fair there are other courses such as Accounting and Corporate Finance that students can take at SOM to learn traditional finance. ",
            "\u00a0This was much more of a general survey course than I anticipated. There was almost no applied quantitative methodology. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had been taught harder skills ",
            "\u00a0Given that in the shopping period the professors said that it was not necessary to have any finance background to take the course I expected there would be a rapid introduction to finance, the terms and the language at the beginning of the term. Even though  there was a TA session on the basics of finance, in my view this was not enough. \r\nThe midterm exam and the final financial valuation required specific knowledge and skills that were never taught in class. In this sense the most important skills that were gained by the course had to be self taught with no guidance or instruction from the professors. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class and really got everything I wanted out of it. The range of topics was amazing and I learned a ton. I had a cursory background in financial concepts and some experience as an individual investor, and this was enough background for me to really get a lot out of every single lecture. The course would be better called \"sustainable investing\" than Sustainable Finance, because it really didnt consider the topics from the corporate-side very often. For example, how or why would a company structure and present themselves one way or another in order to attract the interest of the ESG investor? Is it worth it for them? Overall though, absolutely loved the material from start to finish. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very thoughtful and comprehensive overview of the ESG investing landscape. Professors are very engaging and knowledgeable. Great use of in-class guests and student presentations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Variable student participation/attendance. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this class was having Jake Resnik as a TA. He helped pull together the course content, fill in students gaps and make sure that we were all able to get a lot out of the experience.\r\n\r\nHaving two professors was nice, though Cary's presentation style could sometimes be less than engaging, and it seemed as though there could have been more preparation.\r\n\r\nI would have appreciated having class time to go over some of the more technical financial concepts. I believe some of the lectures could have been made shorter.\r\n\r\nThe guest speakers were great!\r\n\r\nI liked the final project, I would recommend having shorter presentations, because 3 ful lclass days of presentations is excessive and not necessarily productive. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a very weak course. A strength is that it is essential for students with an interest in the business-environment intersection to understand the role of investment in shaping change, so I'm glad the course exists. However, the course felt hastily slapped together and lacked any semblance of structure. I would recommend adding a clear, thoughtful structure, starting with the basics. Also, don't waste time with endless group presentations, unprepared guest speakers, and collective GoogleDoc editing sessions. I understand it was a new class and a bit experimental, but it felt like amateur hour. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the content of the course was very thought-provoking. I also liked the fact that a lot of information covered throughout the course was up-do date, relevant and realistic. The course helped me understand not only the challenges but also the major trends and various perspectives within sustainability finance. The professors really cared about this topic too.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish the classes also covered DCF analysis, actual methodology on how to approach company valuation and do sensitivity analysis. It felt very challenging at times to learn on your own and therefore, come up with a good quality final product (assignment) that was expected from us. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: provided a pretty holistic overview of the sustainable finance field. We had interesting speakers come into class, which were some of my favorite lectures. Otherwise, some of the course material is delivered in a really dull way. Professors could both work on their organization and delivery of material to make it easier for students to understand and engage. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are definitely the professors and TA - they all had a wealth of experience and knowledge in the field. Weakness were some slight disorganization at times but they picked up the slack with ease. ",
            "\u00a0The course as I mentioned was a very strong overview, or survey of the investment universe. Many of the lectures, particularly those by Todd Court were very strong. Also the reading list was very relevant and well selected. The main weaknesses stemmed from there being too many visiting speakers, and the slightly less directed nature of their lectures. But this too again reinforced the strength that the survey aspect of the class was powerful and useful. Excellent course overall. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture could be a bit more dynamic. Sometimes it got dry. Both professors were very understanding and had great insights on the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Very poorly organized. Poor quality graphics, figures, powerpoints, and chalkboard lectures.\r\n\r\nOften lots of repetition, slow pace, and misused time in class (i.e. 45 min in class writing assignments?!)\r\n\r\nLack of rigorous technical content or analysis. No presentation of counter positive opinions.\r\n\r\nTA saved the class from a trainwreck of poor notes and lectures -- the best learning was pushed to the TA sessions. ",
            "\u00a0THere's a lot of outside learning that is needed, which isn't necessarily a weakness, but this should be stated upfront. ",
            "\u00a0Pros: Great speakers, good reading, in fact one of my favorite classes at FES ever. It's on a cutting edge topic as all public agencies and NGOs are realizing their financial constraints and look to leverage the private sector's resources. This class should be offered every year.\r\n\r\nCons: Not enough quantitative/traditional finance. It'll be hard for a student with just this class to get a job in sustainable finance. Todd's lectures were very well-organized and clear. Cary's lectures can be disorganized, it'll be better if Cary begins with an outline of what he's going to cover in that particular lecture, and then at the end summarize the key points that students should take home. ",
            "\u00a0Some disorganization due to the newness of the course. Assignments were mostly helpful. Cary was obsessed with forming a portfolio through the course that felt like a forced add on. The final presentation - a stock pitch, maybe should have been the midterm with a full portfolio as the final (if professors really want to stick with the portfolio scheme). Good guest lecturers. Get rid of the in-class writings, those were useless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- the topic is incredibly interesting and complex. \r\n- The invited lecturers were generally very interesting\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- there is a lack of a necessary introduction to financial terms and structures. In this sense it would have been beneficial to have an introductory class or recommended readings to gain an overview of what are the basic terms that are constantly used in class.\r\n- The midterm Bloomberg analysis and the final company financial valuation did not reflect what was taught in class. It would have been appropriate to teach these skills during the course.\r\n- We were shown the different ESG indicators but we did not look into how they were calculated, and which one is appropriate to use according to diverse context.\r\n- There were very interesting topics such as Green Bonds and Social Impact Bonds that could have had more time and more attention.\r\n- There was one particular class on systems thinking towards the end of the semester that would have been more appropriate to have at the beginning of the course, and if the idea is to prioritize a systems thinking approach to sustainable finance then it would have been interesting to organize the classes with this structure in mind. Just to mention systems thinking as an additional topic did not make much sense. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-- not including Cort strengths/weaknesses here, see below. Most of the guest lectures were good, although I would have preferred a couple more class periods of actual course content and a couple less guests. The guy who skyped in, for example, was a bore. Krosinzky lectures were a bit more uneven than Cort but in general also good, and I appreciated his real-world, non-ivory-tower slant on topics. He was a great guy to have in the room and had lots of specific examples and experience. Appreciated the fact that we could choose our own topics for assignments and make our own choices of companies to study. That was great and allowed me to pursue a couple topics I was really interested in. The TA was fantastic and very very helpful. Drawbacks were very few: The final project was not organized well-- too many class periods spent on the group presentations, and not enough explanation of why we should CARE whether this imaginary portfolio did well or not. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the syllabus, the guest lecturers, the midterm exam and the stock pitch, and Jake Reznick. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was I felt there wasn't enough finance background and therefore I felt I was learning about a topic without understanding the topic's foundation. The TA did an excellent job hosting review sessions about finance, but I wish there had been more, and that there were more assigned background readings for the non-MBA students. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't get much out of watching the final presentations and they took up so many class sessions. I would have loved to learn more from our great teaching team. ",
            "\u00a0it's a great overview of sustainable investing, but not necessarily sustainable finance ",
            "\u00a0Please see my responses to the Business school evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were sometimes difficult to follow because there as a lot of financial jargon was used, that I was not yet familiar with. Eventually, I became familiar with the terms. The TA session that went over basic financial concepts were good. But could have used a little more finance basics before using the terms in class. ",
            "\u00a0Since this course was almost evenly split between SOM and FES students, it would have been nice to offer an option finance boot camp for the FES students. I believe I would have gotten more from the course with a deeper understanding of the finance topics ",
            "\u00a0More background material being provided, having a mix of SOM with actual work experience in investing and FES with none was difficult. The TF carried a lot of the background material, otherwise I would have struggled even more than I did. ",
            "\u00a0This course is accessible to people with little background in finance. The readings and course lectures, while interesting, did not really prepare students for the midterm and final assignments. I would have liked to have spent more time critically evaluating methodologies for ESG ratings. Overall the course lacked structure, and I have difficulty pinpointing exactly what I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great guest speakers. Felt the class assignments were valuable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures felt disjointed at times. In retrospect, I would have preferred to have become more familiar with financial concepts prior to taking this course. Perhaps it would have been better as a second-year, rather than in my first semester at FES. "
