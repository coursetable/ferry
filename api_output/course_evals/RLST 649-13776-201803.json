            "\u00a0This course helps me to think carefully about how cultural memories can shape one's writing of history. Reading many competing narratives, such as the different perspectives on Constantine and his conversion and the divergent approaches to ecclesiology  between the Donatists and the Catholic, train me to be more conscious and careful before I reach any conclusions of the historical events. In fact, any definite conclusions are short lived. Professor Davis brings out the complications of constructing a historical past. He challenges me to see the ambivalences and to work them through. ",
            "\u00a0A wide-ranging understanding of early Christian history. This class is a fantastic intro to the subject matter, and an equally good intro to the disciplines of history and religious studies. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the transition to the Islamic part is somewhat unnatural. The reading and the lectures on Islamic literature seem to be a rush. In some way, I found the time expansion that the class intends to cover is a bit ambitious. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great reading list, great lectures, effective set of assignments. Syllabus and weekly discussion questions do a great job of structuring things. Steve is super responsive, funny, and a terrific professor in general. If I had to change one thing, I'd have the course spend more time focusing on early Islam. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I will. I want to recommend this class to anyone who is interested in early Christianity or religious history overall. It's worth to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Again, it's a terrific humanities course all-around. Anyone interested in Christianity, history, or religious studies should take it. "
