            "\u00a0There's so much out there to learn about this subject but only one Professor teaching it in undergrad. You spend two weeks on each topic really diving in and discussing the material. You learn to think about both sides of a coin and open your mind to a plethora of different ethical questions that you didn't realize existed in certain topics until you talk about them. ",
            "\u00a0great in depth look at current issues in bioethics ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of the topics discussed in class as well as the field of bioethics. I gained a immense interest for the field and hope to possibly do some work in it in the near future. ",
            "\u00a0I received a lot of practice in evaluating arguments' rigor, and in thinking of rhetoric and causality. The aims of this class are intentionally vague, and while you learn some information on certain bioethical topics, much of what I learned was through evaluating written arguments for clarity and completion, rather than content. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING COURSE!! Latham leads a very relaxed, thought-provoking seminar that adds little stress to your semester, but can lead to great discussions! You'll debate about big bioethics topics: abortion, end of life care, organ donation, assisted reproduction, etc. Great course to take if you liked Bioethics and Law and want to engage more fully in the ethical arguments about these! No econ background necessary! Also great to write a senior thesis, you only have to do one paper all semester- no other assignments! You read a book per two weeks along with other selected readings! Very chill, it is what you make of it! ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fascinating insight into bioethical questions that (I wager) few Yale students have ever seriously considered. My modes of thinking were intensely challenged, as were my means of backing up arguments previously considered secure. A wonderfully introspective course. ",
            "\u00a0Arranged by theme, this class offered me an introduction into the most contentious arguments in the field of bioethics (abortion, assisted suicide, CRISPR...) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Professor Latham spends most of the class talking, so there's little hearing other student's opinions. But I like how we spent 2 weeks on each topic, it let people get their thoughts out if they really wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0Latham mostly lectures the whole time but he is so engaging and really knowledgeable in all bioethics topics that time goes by pretty fast ",
            "\u00a0This course has fascinating topics and readings. The readings make for very interesting homework, if you like bioethics. The seminar itself was defined by the people in it, and when argument flowed in my class, it was mostly from a few of the students. Professor Latham has a lot to say on each topic, and is very knowledgeable, but tended to ask very broad questions of the class when trying to engage us, which were hard to engage with. The lack of evaluation aside from the final paper made it difficult to know how to write said paper. The final was a fifteen page argument on a bioethical topic, which was not really supposed to be based on outside research, and seemed to be modeled after philosophical readings of the class. This was new to me, and a challenge, without previous evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Latham is the best and the topics were incredibly interesting! I liked that he took student interest to guide the last topic discussed (he leaves the last 2 weeks after thanksgiving break open and the class gets to pick what topic to cover)- which in our case ended up being genetic engineering via CRISPR CAS 9. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a variety of issues in bioethics, and the books / articles we read for each topic were eye-opening. I enjoyed the classroom discussions, but the debates would have been more interesting if more students had been engaged in class. I believe a seminar like this should have a participation grade. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent all around. Material is fascinating; the assigned books for the course are perfectly suited to facilitate intellectual discourse. That being said, students should ensure they are willing to participate before taking, as class discussion is one of the more crucial parts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are very interesting and the topics themselves are very applicable. Ive learnt a lot in this class. That said, the level of engagement is relatively low because many people are taking this class for senior essay and do not participate in class discussion. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class to another student! The discussions were always really interesting and so were the topics we approached in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely if you can get in and are interested in bioethics. Its a great way to hear from an expert. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was an interesting and easy political science senior seminar ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Latham is an incredible and knowlegable instructor. This is a seminar so there is a good amount of discussion yet prof. Latham easily guides the conversation while providing background information to ease the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class for the topics and readings. The work is to read a book every other week, and some articles, and these are not hard to do if you like bioethics. Professor Latham is interesting as a speaker, but did not lead a terribly effective seminar, so class conversations would be somewhat stilted, and not address a great deal of the reading. Not bad work, and he has a lot of knowledge to offer if you have questions about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely if you are interested in bioethics! It was great having this face to face time with Latham after having taken Bioethics and Law, his much larger lecture! ",
            "\u00a0This ranks among my top five classes at Yale. Professor Latham is not only an incredibly gifted scholar and lecturer, but a wonderfully devoted teacher and an excellent intellectual resource. The bioethical conundrums he poses are compelling in ways that even the best-taught classes in other disciplines cannot be; if you have the opportunity to learn from him, jump at it. "
