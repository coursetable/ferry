            "\u00a0I picked up a new wealth of vocabulary geared more towards formal essay writing rather than the conversational terms I had been more used to using at home and before taking this class. The class also focuses a lot on on-the-spot responses for translation and nuances in vocabulary usage, which allows us to use both our recently acquired knowledge as well as general familiarity with the Chinese language in practicing for fluency. ",
            "\u00a0Significantly improved reading and writing skills and learned many new terms; also have a better understanding of culture ",
            "\u00a0My proficiency in reading and writing in Chinese greatly improved through this class. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this course with little to no knowledge of how to read or write Chinese characters (ngl I think I shouldve been placed into 132) but my speaking skills were fluent. For the first lesson, I had to search up almost every single character in the article in addition to the 130~ new words that were part of the lesson. By around lesson 4 or 5, I could read most of the articles and sentences in the homework with just the glossary provided. This class will greatly improve your reading and writing abilities, but it is a lot of work in the beginning if you come in with nothing. Aside from the course material, I also learned a lot about Chinese history and culture. Su Laoshi has a very interesting life with lots of wisdom and stories to tell. It made class enjoyable every day even if we werent necessary *on topic.* ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read, write and speak advanced Chinese clearly. I also enjoyed developing a deeper sense of Chinese culture, customs and idiomatic perspectives. Overall, my Chinese improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new Chinese vocab words and idioms that are useful for everyday conversation. All of the texts that we read were about very relevant and typical topics (ex: food culture in China, music culture in China, educational inequality, entrepreneurship, etc). The articles also had a variety of sentence structures and transition words, which I was able to apply to my writing. My Chinese essay writing definitely improved throughout the course. Su laoshi is also very very knowledgeable about Chinese history, art, culture, etc, since he grew up there. It was great to learn about China in the second half of the 1900s through his personal stories. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to improve my reading and speaking skills dramatically, increase my vocabulary a lot, and also gain a lot of knowledge about Chinese historical and pop culture that I would otherwise not have had exposure to. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a lot of Chinese vocabulary and essay-writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to greatly improve my overall Chinese skills and learn Chinese culture & history in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I learn the material in the book, I also gained a lot of insights into Chinese history, philosophy, politics, and contemporary events. "

            "\u00a0Because the class size is so small (around 12 people), there is a lot of interaction with both the professors and peers. I am really good friends with my classmates, and our class even made dumplings together during reading period, which goes to show the support network that goes behind preparing for this class and doing the classwork. The course is structured well too, with regular quizzes, homework assignments, presentations, and essays.\r\n\r\nWe also have speaking practice, which is graded by the TA, but the TA never responds and gives us useful feedback, which is a shame. ",
            "\u00a0Su Laoshi kind of defines this class, and a lot of people end up really liking it for the reason that he is super energetic and happy and a wealth of culture/literature/history. That being said, the parts of the class that are actually graded/practiced are very much to the book, which you may be fine with or be a bit put off by. Our year, the class was abnormally large (~17 in our section), which wasn't conducive to practicing speaking/conversation and getting a lot of personal feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The one thing I would improve about this class is the amount of speaking that occurs in class. While my reading and writing skills greatly improved, my speaking abilities became weaker due to the fact that there are very few opportunities to speak in class. If there were more opportunities presented in class of discuss the material, I think this issue could be easily solved. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the consistent structure of the course, as it made me create my own learning rhythm and patterns, and I was constantly practicing new vocabulary every day. Su Laoshis integration of chengyu and his life stories also makes everything we learn feel extremely valuable, and it puts Chinese language into a particular context. The only weakness I would say is the lack of speaking opportunities we get during class. We only usually practice speaking when we get called on to answer a question or make a sentence, or bi-lesson presentations. This is a heritage class though, so it makes sense that there is more of an emphasis on reading and writing. I would also have liked if the sentence patterns that were mentioned in the articles were printed out into a list per lesson, so that we could practice with them more easily. They arent in the vocab lists, and aside from a brief mention of them in class, we dont really interact w them ever again. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quality of education, depth of material, breadth of material, stories from the professor\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: More personalized essay guidance could be helpful, have everyone print out the online schedule so there are no confusions about course assignment due dates, and whether an essay or presentation is due in any given week ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The topics that we read and discussed were all very relevant and useful. I am a heritage student (my parents both grew up in China), but I still feel that my vocabulary is very limited. I can hold a casual conversation, but when it comes to topics like politics or pop culture, I am not fluent at all. It was great to read about things like China's food culture, music culture, public transportation system, etc because I can now use the vocab I learned in my speaking. Su laoshi is also a really really great teacher in general. I have met very few teachers who are as passionate as him or who have as interesting of a life story as him. A big strength is that I was fully engaged every single class. He made every class very enjoyable because he loved to tell funny or intriguing anecdotes about his life experiences or his previous students. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The biggest weakness was that the class was larger than normal this year (there were about 18 students), which means that I had very few chances to speak in class. I learned a lot of new vocabulary that I can use when speaking, but I don't think I improved my speaking or fluency at all. Su laoshi will call on people to speak during class, but since there were so many people, each student was only called on once or twice per class. I think there should be more sections or smaller classes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was a well-organized course. We followed a regular schedule and had some flexibility in completing assignments. The course content was also challenging enough that we were pushed to grow our knowledge of the language a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty satisfied with how the course is structured; takes a lot of time to do the studying and preparation. Only thing I would change is make your current grade slightly more apparent (lots of times I had no clue how I was doing in the course). ",
            "\u00a0You can learn a lot of idioms and cultural aspects of China although a few expressions are outdated. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is a fantastic class, and it doesn't need to be improved. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Very fun course! Take it if you want to greatly improve your fluency of Chinese and master essay writing (as opposed to conversational abilities). ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it builds up your vocabulary greatly, regardless of how ready you feel coming in, and even the tangents Su Laoshi goes on illuminate some part of Chinese history, language, and/or culture. If you're coming in as a heritage speaker with limited proper grammar instruction, though, you won't necessarily be satisfied on your improvement on that by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class is critical to any student who wishes to move further in their Chinese studies. Professor Su is incredibly engaging, and you truly learn a lot through the weekly dictations and essays. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to improve your written Chinese, then yes! Su Laoshi is a writer and has so much knowledge about Chinese culture and chengyus, so class is always enjoyeable. It is challenging, but the workload is consistent and you wont fail if you put in effort. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I learned a lot about current issues in China as well as different aspects of Chinese culture. I learned so much new vocabulary and a variety of sentence structures. In addition to what we learned in the textbook, Su laoshi also taught us so much vocabulary, idioms, sayings from different parts of China, etc. It is really worth taking this class to just have Su laoshi as a teacher. He is so passionate; Chinese started out and continued to be my favorite class this semester. Because he is so passionate and so excited to teach everyone, you, as a student, feel more excited to learn. I think the biggest reason why someone should take this course is that from this course, I realized that Chinese is beautiful. It is a really beautiful language. My speaking did not improve as much as I had hoped since the class was too big, but Su laoshi taught me how to appreciate Chinese as a language. He wanted all of us to \"taste Chinese\". As I learn more Chinese in the future, I will certainly more engaged and excited to learn than I was before I took this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I believe my language skills improved dramatically in a short period of time. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! Su Laoshi is great. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great for both who want to improve their Chinese and who are interested in Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think anyone will takes this class will find it to be extremely rewarding. "
