            "\u00a0In this class, I learned from not knowing the name of the tools to building a small steam engine by the end of the class. This was my favorite class by far. The instructor was always happy to help and his efforts for me to learn how to use the machining tools was very high. And the class was always fun and interesting as we learn new ways to make parts in each class. I would like to thank you the professor for his knowledge and effort to help me succeed in this class.

            "\u00a0Strong \r\n--Well structured, that's the goal of the class was to teach us the fundamental skills in the machining by making us build a final steam engine with a lot of parts that required most of its parts to be as precise to function. Therefore, that helps to experience different ways of making tools and as the course progress I was able to speed up because I was able to learn how to use the tools efficiently.\r\n--The professors input for us to learn the course was very high \r\n--The opportunity to come in a different day and make up if I missed a class in a different day\r\n--The class was really fun which makes it to learn the tools always interesting \r\n\r\nWeak\r\nI don't think, I found any weakness in this class, but I would say to have more classes like this how to use and build things such as a laser printer or 3D printer or advancing machine shop, that will enable us to learn a lot of skill based knowledge. In short, I like to have more classes like this. ",

David is a prepared and relaxed instructor and a great person to learn machine shop skills under. In this class students build a one-piston steam engine, but the real treasure is the friends made and skilled learned along the way. ",

The class can be taken by any student (ie from different backgrounds from even humanities or art classes..not just science) because the professor is really helpful and always there to help teach the class.
