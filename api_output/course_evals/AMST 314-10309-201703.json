            "\u00a0I learned to analyze and pick apart texts I did or did not agree with to reach a more nuanced understanding of the material. Understanding the intersections between transgender studies and Native American studies was particularly helpful for developing a rounded critique of transgender/queer studies, which can seem like an unquestionably progressive field. I developed research and discussion skills and got a foundation in transgender studies and how it has developed over time. I came out much better at providing evidence from texts to support my understanding of them. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped with developing analytical reading skills for complicated theory. ",
            "\u00a0A whole new worldview about gender theory and transgender studies (while some in the class may have come in with a greater knowledge of gender theory/wgss courses, I really didn't have any background in the field. so everything was new, and wonderful to learn about!) ",
            "\u00a0This course is an effective survey of the development of transgender studies as a field in academia.  I feel like I got a good sense both of the texts we read and of their historical context.  The end of term research project was one of the more involved ones I've done at Yale, and I definitely developed some new research skills in the process of writing it. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I was really pushed to develop a concrete  understanding of theoretical texts in ways I never have been in other WGSS classes. I also felt like a got a meaningful political history of trans issues from movements. I felt like I developed strong critical thinking skills overall. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a greater understanding of the scope of trans studies, as well as critical thinking skills for reading all sorts of academic sources. Also learned about key concepts like biopolitics, theoretical insights by authors like Butler and Foucault, as well as key historical events in the history of trans studies. ",
            "\u00a0Gender and Transgender is a great introduction to trans studies and to gender studies more broadly. It could be helpful to take a more introductory course beforehand, but that isn't necessary. Professor LaFleur encourages students to think about big pictures, and think about the ways that gender studies/the politics of gender interact with race, indigeneity, class, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Understandings of gender and sexuality that I've never learned in other courses. Learned an interdisciplinary approach to trans studies that I will be able to use in my further academic work and activism ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to think critically about gender. The breadth of scholarship on trans studies was much greater than I previously imagined and I feel much better informed having explored it. Also, Greta conducts the class in a way that forces her students to engage with these topics critically and with an open mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the foundations of trans studies. I learned to engage with critical theory and to synthesize various theoretical ideas in writing. I learned to interrogate neoliberal ideas around identity and selfhood, and I gained a lot of insights into the narrowness of my own approach to texts, synthetic analysis, etc. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was brilliant and gave a wide scope of the development and contemporary state of transgender studies. It put abstract ideas into real contexts which made them much more understandable - biopower, neoliberalism, etc. Every week we were learning new words or learning to use them, which has left me able to engage in these discussions. The range of texts - poetry, novels, academic essays, memoirs, documentaries, etc. applied the theory to many different media. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the ideas behind the syllabus organization should be clearer. We started out with really intense, difficult theory, then went back to look at older medical texts, then moved on to what felt like intro-level theory, then went back to some medical texts--I know there were reasons, I'm just not sure what they were, so I often felt confused. Also, the response time on grades was often not very quick, and we'd have another assignment due before we'd received feedback on the last one, which made knowing what to do kind of difficult sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful readings, loved the teacher. I would really like to see more sources by and about FTM people, however. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the foundations of transgender theory as an academic subject, and I feel like I've finished this class with a much more comprehensive understanding of the field.  I wish there had been a bit more groundwork laid for some of the readings though; sometimes we would learn things after the fact that would have changed our readings of the text if we'd been given a bit of context. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a fantastic course. Strengths were everything. Greta is brilliant and I could listen to her talk for hours. The readings were so compelling and interesting. I think there was sometimes some mismatch where people in the class were a little unsteady with theoretical texts or kept feeling drawn to mapping the texts onto all trans people everywhere  I think there were a lot of people from really different academic backgrounds and while sometimes that was awesome maybe we could've used a theory primer first? Also group discussions could get a little stilted. But I loved this class, I loved how whenever anyone said something Greta would just go off into the nuances of that for a block of time, I felt like I learned so much just by coming to class. My only other thing would be I felt a little nervous turning in my final paper because I felt like our response papers weren't really graded for how well-written they were so I was worried about the quality of my actual writing being up to snuff. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really excellent professor who is great at facilitating class discussion, compelling readings, self-selects for people who are committed to the topics, great assignments as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not many. Sometimes we didn't get to discuss all of the readings so it could be good to pair down the amount per day so that we can delve deeper into the rich sources we learn about. ",
            "\u00a0The combination of a thoughtful syllabus and Professor LaFleur grounding most of the academic readings and memoirs in history make for a really enriching class for students interested in gender studies. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in its syllabus, which is expertly selected and curated, and its professor Greta. Greta has a masterful ability to both conduct discussions in a way that allows everyone to organically explore their own opinions and perspectives--and also offer her own wisdom on each topic (which is infinite). The only weakness I can think of would be perhaps more feedback on written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0It was a fabulous course, I really don't know what could be improved ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths were Greta's impressive ability to effectively communicate complicated concepts, the readings, the distribution of assignments and reading responses, and the students drawn by the course. It's hard to articulate a weakness of the course besides perhaps the fact that we didn't get the opportunity to talk about every single text we read, but this comes with the territory of reading so many rich texts. I really enjoyed the exercises in which we broke up into smaller groups to discuss certain texts (as a person who struggles with anxiety in seminar settings), and would personally enjoy such a class if that technique were employed more often. "

            "\u00a0This is a concept-heavy course, but the curriculum insists on placing those concepts within real experiences and specific historical or contemporary cases. Be prepared to apply your critical abilities in this class, but if you do what you learn from it will be eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers really important material. Professor LaFleur is really engaging, but the class can often feel overwhelming in the amount of work and in the difficulty of the theory. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Incredible class discussions, wonderful readings, and a great professor. I may be a bit biased, considering I had no knowledge of gender theory/wgss topics before entering, but every day I left with my mind blown. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, just be aware that it's a course about transgender theory, not about transgender experience or history. ",
            "\u00a0This class (or something like it) should be mandatory for all Yale students. Prof. Greta LaFleur leads you through a rigorous intro to trans studies, and is probably the only professor at Yale right now who is quite such a brilliant expert in the field. She's straight up one of the coolest AND also sharpest and most attentive and challenging professors I've ever been blessed to take a class with. I don't know how she manages to be so chill while also so such an energizing instructor. I hope for everyone's sake (especially WGSS majors) that Greta continues to teach this course. If she doesn't get tenure, it will honestly be a disgrace. ",
            "\u00a0A really great introduction to trans studies as an academic field. Definitely a theory-heavy course but that's not a bad thing at all! Rush WGSS! Greta is brilliant and you will learn so much just by listening to her speak. I felt like this class really challenged me intellectually without ever becoming a drag. Definitely one of those courses where I was scribbling down everything the professor said and then talking my friend's ear off about it when I got home after class. I felt like this was a really mature, interesting, serious seminar from which I learned a lot and grew a lot  what more can you ask for? ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely highly recommend this course to another student. It has been one of the best classes I've taken. Prof. LaFleur is fantastic and knowledgeable about many topics. It is a privilege to be in this class learning from Greta and talking with the other students about these rich sources. I felt incredibly lucky the whole time I took this course - I was grateful that such a class exists as it seems to question the power inherent in academic institutions in a way that only makes schools like Yale a better, more inclusive place. However, the subject-matter, combined with Prof. LaFleur's engaging and gracious teaching style also creates a community in the classroom where people can push back on each other and learn from each other in discussing the texts while also remaining grounded in support for one another. It's really something everyone interested in this material will appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student! I hadn't taken a lot of WGSS classes before this but still found it really accessible, enriching, and helpful to my further studies. Professor LaFleur is extremely helpful and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn so much about gender and sexuality and the valuable lens that trans studies can provide to understanding community dynamics and inequality. You also get the chance to learn about important theories and Professor LaFleur does a great job of making theory understandable and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. I would recommend any American Studies major, but really any student, take a class with Greta because she's such a wise and inspiring teacher. This class really expanded my understanding of Gender and sexuality (more than you could imagine) and I think any student would benefit greatly from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! TAKE IT. It will make you a better human being. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was probably one of the most well-organized and well-taught courses I've taken at Yale. Greta is probably the most intelligent person I've ever met. I would have even loved this class in lecture form. But I also really appreciated the contributions of my peers, and I think the way the readings were distributed facilitated connections that encouraged conversation. Personally, I struggled with the readings quite a bit, but I still learned so much from the class. I imagine that different people benefit differently from this class. Some will meet regularly with Greta and get book recommendations on the side, while some will feel a little behind the curve the whole time, but will come out of the semester with insights into new critical frameworks, as well as their own academic weaknesses.
