The workload of the course is very reasonable. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There is no time for the facilitator to go through homework with us. There are still some questions for me left behind. It would be better if some common mistakes can be explained during lectures. ",

The homework workload was however a bit excessive at times and was at some times slightly tedius since most of the homework assignments involved writing down exercises that were quite simple on many sheets of paper.

            "\u00a0Professor Holzer was a good teacher, and class was easy to follow.  \r\nHowever, the TA was nearly impossible to understand and follow, and I was absolutely unable to communicate with him or figure out what was going on in the section, which unfortunately graded all my problem sets. The other students in the TA section all also spoke a language other than English, and I was not able to overcome the language barriers in the Section.\r\nMaking matters worse, the textbook was full of incorrect answers, which I pointed out to the professor, so that made the sets difficult to complete with accuracy. There was no communication to students about the incorrect printed answers, and combined with the TA Section problems, it was not easy to know what to expect in terms of accurate problem sets and grading. I actually really like the subject, the professor, and trying to solve the problems, I just did not have an easy avenue to review problem sets, which other students were able to do to achieve perfect results.
