            "\u00a0Everything. I have reached a new level of intelligence after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Further interest in writing and developing stories in screenplay format; thinking about the structure of story and what compels people to keep watching something ",
            "\u00a0Students develop, write, workshop, revise, and submit a twenty to thirty minute screenplay. ",
            "\u00a0Further developed my ability to write a screenplay. ",
            "\u00a0Intro screenwriting laid down the basics (how to format a script, what kind of writing to use, how to do coverage, etc.) and this class offered an opportunity to apply and develop skills throughout the semester by writing a 20-30 page screenplay and doing a small amount of coverage. Much more class time was spent assessing each others' scripts than in intro. It was laid-back, but useful and fun. I think I grew a lot as a writer. ",

            "\u00a0There is nothing bad I can say about this class other than that it did not meet more often. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had spent more time talking about structure, and definitive/concrete ways to approach storytelling. Sometimes, it felt like I was left to my own devices, struggling to figure out how best to structure certain scenes or storylines. I'm not suggesting a prescriptive approach, but a few more guidelines on structure would be great. ",
            "\u00a0A little more storytelling theory might be helpful. I think that, in the absence of coverage assignments, my attention to structure hit a bit of a plateau. I think if Lapadula were to spend just a little bit of time at the beginning of the semester explaining different ways to structure a story in thirty minutes, we would have come into our workshops with slightly more refined products. ",
            "\u00a0It could at time use some clearer direction, but since it's a workshop class, it's mostly built around workshopping so that's fine. ",
            "\u00a0Really great, but need students to submit scripts sooner to the class, so that everyone has time to read them in advance. ",
            "\u00a0I like this course and it should stay the same. "

        [
            "\u00a0If screenwriting is even remotely interesting to you, definitely take intro to screenwriting. If it's still something that you are attached to, take this. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if they have a vested interest in screenwriting and are working up to writing a full-length script. That being said, this really does feel like an intermediate step in which you will receive way less homework and help than in Beginners, and have less work than in Advanced. As someone who can't take advanced senior thesis, I felt a bit lost in the class because most people were treating their scripts as a halfway point and I was treating mine as an end all to be all. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a passion for screenwriting and storytelling, then yes. Unlike Intro Screenwriting, there is little assigned work that you are responsible for turning in. That frees you to spend as much time as possible developing and writing your story and to use Professor Lapadula as a resource during the process. Whether you choose to take that opportunity is up to you to each student. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely take this class to hone your skills as a screenwriter and storyteller. ",
            "\u00a0If you're thinking about taking this class, you already know about how it's going to go because it directly builds on Intro Screenwriting and you're probably taking it so you can do a thesis screenplay but it's a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great environment to develop your screenwriting abilities in. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course for someone who wrote an introductory screenplay and wanted to write an intermediate screenplay. "
