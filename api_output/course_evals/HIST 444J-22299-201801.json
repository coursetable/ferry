            "\u00a0The course provided a pretty good overview of history of scientific instruments and made me think about these instruments more deeply than I had assumed was possible. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn new methods historical research and the relationship between theories of science and the physical objects used in science. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to think more analytically not only about what makes an instrument scientific, but also about the theories embedded within these instruments and their effects on instrument-makers, scientists, and great society. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater insight on the topic of scientific instruments, the definition/role of an instrument, and the associated roles of each user and creator. ",
            "\u00a0This course primarily focused not on the history of scientific instruments, but rather on the ways to analyze and question the authorities and spaces that these instruments hold and occupy within their fields. My main take-aways from this course were the themes that resurface many times within the field of scientific instruments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically read HSHM papers (EX learned what questions to ask, learned about concepts that helped me frame different articles we read), how to approach scientific instruments as material objects, and how to use the peabody and medical historical library for researching objects. ",
            "\u00a0I got to think about science from a completely different perspective. Im a STEM major who usually focuses on understanding the truth to science, but in this class I got to explore how that truth has changed and developed over time. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first course I'd taken in a long time with a sizable chunk of weekly reading and discussion based on that reading. For a history class, from what I understand, this is par for the course; however, for a history of science class, the course was highly theoretical with shades of philosophy. I had to flex brain muscles that I had long forgotten about in my regular academic pursuits. In doing so, I learned to form stronger and easier connections between historical concepts and ideas, and to analyze the interplay between the physical and the theoretical. "

            "\u00a0The course was fairly interesting and the topics each week were well chosen. I thought the readings were well-matched with the themes and brought up interesting ideas. I do feel like the class felt a little repetitive at times: class presentation, group discussion, and then discussion with everyone. The discussion often felt shallow and circular, returning to the same ideas over and over again. I think this often a problem in seminar classes where people are afraid to disagree with others. Also, I took this class for the writing credit and I did not feel like my writing improved at all. Because the essays were graded with essentially a checklist of items, I felt restricted in my writing and did not feel like I could fully express my ideas. However, I did enjoy doing research on the final paper, despite these limitations. ",
            "\u00a0The readings at times were long and philosophical, which made some of them unaccessible. I would recommend going into this class with either a background in philosophy, or at least an interest in learning how to tackle philosophical texts. However, class time is always engaging and accessible, even the weeks that I didn't understand the readings. Charlotte has the talent of making a two hour seminar fly by, and class was fun even when I did love the discussion topic. The drudgery of the homework feels a bit mismatched to the lively, engaging classes, but it was nevertheless a trade worth making. ",
            "\u00a0This course was directed in a way that all students were able to actively participate and engage in each week's discussions. The Professor excellently averted vague discussions and thoughts, instead urging students to approach each topic from different viewpoints. The readings were designed to align with each weekly topic, and student presentations further enhanced our understanding of these readings. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this course, and I can't think of any improvements that would have made this course better. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly readings in this course were well-chosen and interesting. I liked how they were rarely about the week's instrument, but rather about a common theme that tied the unit together. However, our discussions during class became repetitive overtime and we often strayed from our readings (sometimes for the worst). While I liked that we had freedom in choosing the topics for our midterm and final papers, it bothered me how strict the guidelines and rubrics were. Instead of helpful, I found the rubrics restricting, and I had a lot of anxiety from these assignments. (I once had a nightmare that I didn't fulfill all of the rubric's requirements and had turned my paper in.) So while the class was well organized and the workload was fair, the paper requirements and grading scheme were not. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: wide range of topics and readings, very cool to get to physically interact with instruments, interesting paper topics; Charlotte provides great feedback, and I found meeting with her to be very helpful\r\nweaknesses: the rubrics for the papers were very specific and somewhat confining (though having the structure was also probably helpful) ",
            "\u00a0I loved how open-ended it was. As a seminar, we could follow the discussion wherever it led us. One thing I would have liked to focus on more is the actual development and workings of some of the instruments, instead of just their place in the history of science. ",
            "\u00a0For a class titled \"scientific instruments,\" there was a lot of theory. Understandably so, by the end of the semester, as the class analyzed how scientific instruments shaped science as a whole (and vice versa), but perhaps the class should've been advertised more along those lines. I feel like I would've been more prepared had I received some more background in my academic career pertaining to the study of thought.\r\nOn the whole, I had a very enjoyable relationship with the course. The assignments were straightforward and well-crafted, the readings were sometimes dense but always pertinent, and the conversation was engaging and made time fly by. "

            "\u00a0Would recommend -- cool topics to think and talk about ",
            "\u00a0Well, if you are thinking about the class for the writing credit, it's probably not worth it since your writing will not improve much. If you are interested in history of science and medicine, the material could be interesting and provide a nuanced view of instruments. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for gut, this isn't it. This class will challenge you, but you will learn a lot. I would recommend this course for someone interested in both the history and philosophy of science. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the teaching staff is very supportive, the lessons are incredibly intriguing, and the course also provides access to instruments from Yale's Peabody collection. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. Especially to other science majors so they could expand how they view their work. "
