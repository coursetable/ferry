            "\u00a0i learned how to negotiate what to include and exclude while painting from observation over time.  i learned different ways to prime canvas, different mediums to use, different ways to mix paint and when to use which kind of paint.  i learned how to make iPad drawings and make egg tempera.  i learned how to navigate light changes, how to find inspiration in the mundane and how to use yale's campus and resources to create. ",
            "\u00a0Painting Time offered balance to all the STEM classes I was taking at Yale, and definitely gave me new perspectives on the beauty of campus ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to paint landscapes and to paint quickly. I learned how to make a pleasing composition, and became more familiar with oil painting techniques. I also realized how important it was for me to have art scheduled into my week. ",
            "\u00a0I learned exactly what to pay attention to when beginning a painting by observation. Often, we spend too much time mulling over the details that don't really matter. ",
            "\u00a0fast painting\r\ncomfort with the tools\r\nmore painting ideas for myself\r\ndon't want to go to art school though certainly want to keep painting. It's too cool and indirect. ",
            "\u00a0My painting got a lot better. I've learned to paint faster with more direction and I for sure got better at mixing paint. ",

            "\u00a0i think this course is awesome as is!  was very impressed with Sam. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed painting in various locations - Women's Table, Harkness tower, the Study, Old Campus - we were given a ton of freedom in our artistic choices, which was nice, but I wish Sam gave more input and critique to help us develop throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Not much instructor engagement ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is that it is really relaxing, and we got to go to a lot of really beautiful spots around campus which increased my appreciation for the class. A weakness is that I wish there was more criticism and direct help. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the observational characteristic of the course. I was able to truly capture the essence of the Yale campus, by painting various spots around the school. Additionally, the mentorship of the professor was incredibly helpful and supportive. This class was often a good break from my vigorous courses outside the art sphere. ",
            "\u00a0It was great to have the freedom of the class structure. I wish we had more feedback and that Sam was at more classes. But it's always worth it and pretty rare at Yale to have time carved out for painting and I really appreciate that. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great although painting for 4 hours with no interruptions was kind of tedious at times. ",
            "\u00a0excellent! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0It's a really chill class! If you like painting, this class will give you the time to paint regularly. But its structure might not be for everyone -- every week, you have about 3 hours of classtime to finish a painting in a specific location. You can definitely go back to it on your own time, but you probably won't have time. I'm definitely someone who needs to paint over a couple chunks of time, so having to do a painting in one session felt exhausting and frustrating at times, and I was unsatisfied with most of my pieces at the end of the semester. I'm not sure if I improved too much as a painter. I am however really happy with my final project and the one semesterly-long piece you have. ",
            "\u00a0this class is fantastic.  sam has perfected the curriculum.  this is not a class for novice painters, students mostly work on their own.  but students sharpen their observation skills, learn to negotiate time and space changes, learn how and when to use different mediums, primers, and kinds of paint.  it is very fun to wander around Yale and be able to paint the pool, Beinecke, woolsey, etc...   sam is the best. ",
            "\u00a0If you have painting experience, yes!!! ",
            "\u00a0I 'd recommend this class because it is extremely different than every other class I have taken at Yale. It forced me to take time out of my day to paint and it significantly increased my appreciation of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is incredible, I would recommend it to anyone--despite major. It is incredibly intuitive, relaxing, and creative. I hope more students enjoy it as much as I did. Also, the professor is incredible! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. There are very few classes like this at Yale ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. Sam is a great instructor. You also get to work on your painting all the time. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you already have background in painting. "
