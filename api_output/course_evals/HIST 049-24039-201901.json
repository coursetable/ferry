            "\u00a0I have learnt a lot about the case method, how cases are structured and written, and how to analyze cases and the businesses/business leaders they discuss. I have also learnt about some of the key American businesses that have shaped the way the American economy and business world have developed since America's founding. This class also teaches some of the economic and business strategies employed by businesses and business leaders to grow their businesses. We examine why companies have succeeded or failed, and what their leaders could have done differently. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read case studies in a thorough and  effective way and write a business case in  a concise and  effective way. ",
            "\u00a0Since this class was case base, it taught me to look at how each case was different from each other.  This comparison led me to be able to see where certain techniques were benefited the overall case which allowed me to internalize them to improve my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0How to read, discuss, and write business case studies ",
            "\u00a0Case study analysis, business models, case study writing, Business terms, business strategies, participation within a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze comprehensive case-studies using economic, business, and financial models. I also learned how to supplement case study arguments with evidence such as graphs, charts, pictures, and timelines. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write a case and how to look further into the narrative of a company to see errors and strengths. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about important American business history topics by taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different ways to analyze a company or business executive through different lenses. I also became more adept at asking better questions about why something had happened in history or what the appropriate action should have been to solve a problem. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how businesses and corporations operate, and the factors that make them either successful or unsuccessful. ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking. In depth analysis. Case writing skills. The knowledge of how businesses grow and the challenges they face. Insight into how businesses have evolved over time, but the similar problems that leaders face regardless of the time period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how to learn using the case system as well as write a case myself. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest skills I gained from this course was how to read and write business case studies. Case writing is quite different from the usual writing assignments/ styles that we learn in other courses, and it was an eye-opener to engage with history and business through such a methodology. I was able to see how business in particular contributed to the arc of American history, and similarly, how the developments in American economy, society and politics shaped the business decisions and business environments of many great business leaders. I really liked how the course went beyond history and business too, and often got us thinking about side themes like good leadership and management, which has applicability in our own student lives, as well as in our future careers. I think it was really interesting to learn about the stories behind some of the most well-known household brands too, many of which came from humble beginnings and grew to formidable clout and influence through a combination of splendid business acumen, good management practices, fortuitous political/ social/ economic conditions, and incredible leaders. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this class, I have developed skills for reading, analyzing, and writing business school case studies. In addition, I learned how to participate in class discussions in a smaller college section enviornment. "

            "\u00a0The professor is engaging and the cases are interesting to read. The questions are thought-provoking and make me more familiar with the strategies and business terminology.\r\n\r\nThe workload was a bit high in the sense that a reading response was required for each class on top of reading a case. Feedback was also not provided on our reading responses which could've helped to improve our writing capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0i thought the course was well structured and organized. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was definitely how organized it was.  We knew exactly what we were going to do everyday.  Although this was great, it came with the downside of the repetition of the classroom environment. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Milner was exceedingly knowledgable and well-prepared. Can't think of any glaring weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting material covered by professor Milner and incredible knowledge base on the part of professor Milner. Helped us gained insight to American business history very well. Harvard business cases were also very well written\r\nWeaknesses: Course material was very expensive ",
            "\u00a0Some of the strengths include a very passionate and knowledgeable professor who made sure to include everyone within the class discussions, the small class size that was conducive to prolonged debates and discussions, and the style of teaching using HBS case studies in an undergraduate setting. The course could be improved to include other mediums of information that are not all written under the same institution to provide greater breadth of information and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is my favorite course this year since it was exceptionally well-organized and filled with interesting topics. I enjoyed the discussions during the class meetings. The professor was also helpful and available throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were good, but it could have been more of a discussion instead of just answering the professor's questions. Also could have been more emphasis on differing points of view. ",
            "\u00a0I would like more interaction with actual businesses. For example, we discuss companies like JP Morgan or Apple. It would be cool to visit those companies or have discussion with leaders in the companies we discuss to truly get a fuller view of the evolution of the company. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the cases, but I feel as though sometimes class discussion could have been more structured. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I can't think of any weaknesses because this course was so solidly executed from beginning to end. The reading responses were fantastic tools to help us to read the cases carefully and think about them in the right direction and from the right angles. Because the guiding questions got us to think critically, most if not all of us were able to come into section knowing our content and thus able to contribute meaningfully to the discussion (which was a very empowering feeling - coming in to class we were able to really engage with each other and push the boundaries of our knowledge, instead of just struggling to even make sense of what we'd already read). The selection of case materials was also really strategic and meaningful (we moved from the Antebellum to modern day, and in the course of these developments were able to notice patterns and trends such as how business moved to the M-Form after Du Pont, etc), and I also really appreciated how we didn't just look at conventional cases but also more unorthodox ones like Al Capone. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths was the consistent workload, which allowed students to allocate a reasonable amount of time out of their schedules to prepare for class. Another strength of the class was the professor and his love and knowledge of the subject. Each case study was explained very thoroughly and with passion, which made learning the new materials a lot easier. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, because it familiarizes you with the business world. It is also one of the few classes that employ the case method. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0For sure.  I think it gives a unique viewpoint of American history that you do not learn from a typical textbook or Google, but one that can only be achieved through the economic point of view of very specific companies at specific times. ",
            "\u00a0Of course I would recommend it, it was my favorite class this semester. I love reading about business history, and this class taught me how to think about today's businesses and how they compare with their historical counterparts. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. Professor Milner is a fantastic lecturer that helped our class to  learn so much about business concepts and strategies. This course is one of the reasons why I know want to pursue a career in business. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are passionate about the intersection of business, economics, and history. The setting of the class makes it heavily discussion based so engagement is necessary to stay on top of the readings and learnings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes its a gray seminar for those interested in the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student since it was very interesting and well-taught. ",
            "\u00a0Good course if you are interested in learning more about businesses/corporations and how they work + what makes them successful. Not too much emphasis on writing, which could be good or bad depending on what you want. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I took this course to help decide whether I was vaguely interested in business and I now know that I love it. If a student wants to gain a credit and learn more about how their world has been shaped, they should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0The course isn't too much work, and it is usually interesting. If you are interested in going to business school especially, experience with learning through cases can be valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! Professor Milner makes lessons incredibly engaging, and while the workload for this course isn't very high, it also isn't very low, which makes it a really good course if you want the intellectual rigour without being overloaded with assignments. The final case writing project was also really enjoyable for me personally, in part because it was a culmination of the entire semester's case reading, except one was now writing instead of reading the case. Professor Milner gave us a lot of freedom to exercise our knowledge and pursue our interests in writing this final case, which made it incredibly fulfilling. One of the biggest plus points about this course is simply how structured and organised it is. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those who are interested in attending business school after their undergraduate education! "
