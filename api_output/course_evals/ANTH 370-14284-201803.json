            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how we interpret information, from older \"classic\" texts to Alan Turing to modern data processing. "

            "\u00a0The class meetings lean more towards lectures as opposed to more conventional seminar discussions. I see this as a strength rather than a weakness -- it allowed for Professor Kockelman to connect the rather diverse range of weekly readings into a complex and coherent whole. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Professor Kockelman is engaging and knowledgable. There could be more room for discussion, but it is overall a very strong class. "

            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student, regardless of major. The content is enjoyable and the applications are far-reaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an interesting class with good readings and an engaging small lecture format.  It culminates in how tech interprets information, but it takes a while to get there.  Be warned, though  it was mostly graduate students in the class, and one essay dictates most of your grade. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in taking a course that delved into a primarily linguistic anthropological view of modern technologies and the ways humans have extended themselves through information mechanisms, take this course. It was also extremely interesting coming from an engineering background to look at material like Shannon's theorem and the Uncanny valley in a non-engineering perspective, and the implications these inventions and phenomena manifest in social-cognitive contexts as opposed to strictly technical. ",
            "\u00a0Here are a few things to take note of: The class is supposed to be a seminar, but Paul lectures for the entire allotted time. The class is purely about theory (semiotics, automata, media, etc.). The class is also predominantly composed of graduate students (this year there were only 4 undergraduates). That being said, this was an absolutely incredible course. I've learned so much and the theories we've covered have been incredibly eye-opening. Paul is a genius, and seeing him lecture at the whiteboard is truly amazing. The final paper is very broad (synthesizing 4-5 theories to create a framework to look at some media) and this was one of the most enjoyable papers I've ever written and it made the material feel much more under my grasp. There are weekly reading responses that are very lax (as long as you do them, you should be fine). Though Paul doesn't really grade anything  throughout the entire semester we only got two comments on our readings responses, which were as short as \"Great job on these!\" Come to learn, and you will leave having acquired so much.
