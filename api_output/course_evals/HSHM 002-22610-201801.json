            "\u00a0Insight to how medicine has developed throughout time and its origins through different societies. ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I learn a lot about several topics regarding ancient medicine and disease, I also learned how to extract the most relevant and compelling subjects in medical treatises and articles on ancient medicine. I also learned how to think critically about those articles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ancient medicine in many different regions around the world, and how ideas in antiquity pertain to modern-day understandings, both in the context of science and humanities. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about ancient medicine as the title of the course suggests. I also learned quite a bit about being able to read dense texts and understanding the link between antiquity and the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to do effective research and make connections between units that we did better. I like the research paper as a final project because it forced us to make connections between different, topics, and eras. I also had the idea reenforced that my opinion were valid and I had a valid opinion on interpreting historical evidence. ",
            "\u00a0During this course, I learned about ancient medicine and the techniques and beliefs that the civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome used to treat medicine. I learned how to look at primary sources and write essays. ",
            "\u00a0This class was one of the BEST classes I've taken at Yale so far. We read a lot of primary and secondary sources concerning healing systems in the ancient world, and were able to draw parallels between medicine and disease in history and in the present day. Not only did this bolster our critical reading skills but also the course really broadened my horizons. I feel that I learned so much about the cultural context that informs modern health care, public health, and social determinants of health. Also, the discussion-based structure of the class was really central to having students share their insights and bounce ideas off of one another. Finally, Professor Lamont is SO smart, so approachable, and so encouraging to work with. You can really tell that she knows so much about the material and also that she cares deeply about her students. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in how to better read, interpret, and analyze classical works and texts about the ancient world. I really learned a lot about medicine, healthcare, and how the body was believed to function in Ancient Greece and Rome. It also opened my eyes to how medicine and healthcare and society connects to modern times. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ancient medicine and how it can be applied to the medical field today. I also improved my writing and analytical skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to understand and contend with new types of information regarding history that I had not seen before. In particular, I was impressed by how well the course combined historical perspectives and modern scientific perspectives to create an overall view of Ancient Medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the evolution of medicine through antiquity. We used evidence like  surgical tools, ancient texts, philosophical viewpoints, and the Hippocratic texts to gain insight into how views on surgical interventions, women's health care, and dietary regimens transformed over time. The class also provided a forum to discuss areas of ambiguity where historians are still not quite sure how to interpret texts, allowing us to widen our discourse on ancient medicine to reflect on present day medicine.

            "\u00a0The readings got a bit lengthy but overall the course was extremely interesting and easy to be attentive in. The things we learned were interesting ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, comprehensive readings, good discussion and teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there could have been a bit more primary evidence in our readings. Perhaps would have made very similar readings a touch more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course is absolutely amazing. This is mostly because of professor Lamont, who is an inspiring and amazing teacher. She also teaches the material very well. ",
            "\u00a0As aforementioned, the course's strengths lie in 1) the body of work that we examined, 2) the small discussion-based format of the class, and 3) professor Lamont. Above all else, Professor Lamont really made the class the success that it is. She always assigned thought-provoking and intersectional work to examine. She is great at encouraging discussion and calling upon students to engage deeply with the work. Finally, Professor Lamont is so dedicated to the class and the learning of her students. There are no weaknesses that I can think of for this course- it is literally the best class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the structure of this class: readings for every class discussion, two short papers, a midterm exam, class presentation, and final research paper. The class was also small enough (less than 20 people) to allow for great class discussions. The readings before every class were manageable, and although some texts were a bit repetitive, they were still actually very interesting. I enjoyed that there were also parts of the class time when Professor Lamont would lecture about the readings helping to give context or clarification, especially because some of the readings could be confusing and also it would be difficult and less interesting to carry on a class conversation about a few readings for 75 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great how we got to go eat a meal at the study and take a visit to the Medical library. They were really great experiences that enhanced learning and also made it really fun. I also thought all of the readings were very interesting and I enjoyed doing them. A suggestion for improvement would be to have more class discussion amongst students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were clearly in the professor and the content. Professor Lamont had a complete command of the content and was able to answer any question asked, and the supplementary lessons such as the one at the Medical Library made the content even more interesting and tangible. If I had to say there was any weakness, it would have to be that, though this class was a seminar, it was taught a bit like a lecture, with very detailed lessons during the class periods and less time for discussion. This was very effective in facilitating learning, so I have no issue with it. However, it could have been further improved if more time was spent on discussions and opposing points of view. In addition, sometimes the readings were very long but were not covered in class, so a small change could be to streamline the required reading assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging, and Professor Lamont brought tremendous vivaciousness to this class. The class was small enough that we all got to know each other pretty well, and the material was often surprising or revealing, making for interesting in-class discussions. In terms of weaknesses, the material became more repetitive towards the end of the semester, as we had already discussed most or, had learned to anticipate, the common motifs of ancient texts. "

            "\u00a0yes, for those who are possibly looking to be pre-med and for those just interested in medicine in general. I loved learning about the concepts and history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Lamont is amazing! She is so sweet and very fair with workload and assignments. I learned so much about this topic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! The professor is phenomenal and she really cares about her students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any yale student because I think it would be interesting to anyone regardless of major and the professor made the class so I would recommend this professor to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0yes it was very interesting and rewarding to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any other student interested in ancient civilizations, traditional healing systems, public health, medicine, anthropology, or taking a class that is well-designed and highly engaging. This course embodies so much of what Yale classes should strive for: it draws students in, it poses previously uninterrogated questions, and the students and instructor are all deeply involved with the class. For premeds and those looking to pursue a profession in health care, I think that it is especially important to take classes that inform the cultural and social implications of health: this class is a great place to start. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to other students. I really enjoyed the structure of this class: readings for every class discussion, two short papers, a midterm exam, class presentation, and final research paper. The class was also small enough (less than 20 people) to allow for great class discussions. The readings before every class were manageable, and although some texts were a bit repetitive, they were still actually very interesting.

I really learned a lot about medicine, healthcare, and how the body was believed to function in Ancient Greece and Rome. It also opened my eyes to how ancient medicine, healthcare, and society connect to modern times, which was probably one of the most interesting parts of the class for me. I also enjoyed that Professor Lamont would spend some class time lecturing about the readings helping to give context or clarification, especially because some of the readings could be confusing and also it would be difficult and less interesting to carry on a class conversation about a few readings for 75 minutes. I was looking to get a manageable humanities credit in and this class ended being a great course for me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a really great class and I learned so much. It was a really rewarding experience to be in a small seminar class and get to know my professor well. Probably my favorite class at Yale so far! Would HIGHLY recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for science students looking to expand their horizons, this course was even better than I expected to be, especially in how interesting the content was. I think that students will enjoy this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. This class is a great way to learn about a wide variety of concepts in medicine, society, health, and so much more. The readings provide a fascinating glimpse into medicine through history, and I found many of them not only intriguing genuinely surprising. It's easy to underestimate both the advances and the shortcomings of ancient medicine and this course provides a great venue to discuss both aspects of history. "
