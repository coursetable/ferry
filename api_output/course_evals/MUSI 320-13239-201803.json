            "\u00a0Practiced composition through practice exercises and larger-scale projects. Learned basic information about different kinds of instruments and proper notation. Learned about Pandiatonicism. ",
            "\u00a0I mostly learned technical aspects of composition: using Sibelius, orchestration, Logic, etc. I also learned a lot about orchestral instruments and how to compose for them, which was really useful! ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into the specific function of a number of instruments and technologies in the context of practical case studies in composition. I also attended guest lectures on composition, which provided critical interactions with practicing composers and performers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to compose, how to write for certain instruments ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compose and orchestrate effectively for the different instrumental families.  I also learned how to use Logic Pro to create polished audio files and to score visual media. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compose with little composition background. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great because it gives you a structured way to composelessons were helpful insofar that it gave you a mini-deadline for each week. I felt like I grew as a composer, and short if finding my own compositional voice, I moved a step closer to doing so. ",
            "\u00a0I gained additional insight into effective composition techniques including but not limited to: instrumentation/orchestration, musical notation, idiomatic writing for any given instruments, and musical modes. ",
            "\u00a0You get to learn about pandiatonicism and modal mixture, basic Logic Pro X skills, and useful knowledge pertaining to a range of instruments and their ranges and techniques.\r\nThere are also numerous composition workshops with renowned composers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compose for various instruments, as well as specific techniques and methods used in different areas. "

            "\u00a0This course provides a great opportunity to hone skills as a composer by giving students feedback from multiple perspectives and giving access to useful resources, weekly lessons, and opportunities. Some exercises and assignments were uninteresting and tedious, which I feel takes much of the joy and personal expression out of composing. I feel that more open-ended assignments would help students feel more excited and engaged with the course and its assignments. Some presenting composers share great insights with students; however, many of the presenting composers give poor and uninteresting presentations that just entail listening to their music. Classes that we spend separately to learn are often spent reviewing Powerpoints that could be reviewed individually by students easily. This class time could benefit from more productive activities such as peer presentations, interesting lectures on various topics, and student participation in in-class activities and exercises. ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot of freedom in this course, which can be both a good and bad thing. I got to compose exactly what I wanted to, but to improve in the specific kind of writing you're doing, you really need to put the work in yourself. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well-structured overall. The assignments are fair and informative, and the lessons and guest seminars are outstanding. I think the Canvas page and Coursepress site can be revamped with clarity and consistency in mind. Often it was difficult to find instructions and due dates for certain assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt think the weekly lectures were that helpful. The guest Composers were fine, some of them fit my style so they were interesting but others (Hannah Lash - Im sorry if Im being rude) were straight up torture. ",
            "\u00a0The course is excellent overall.  Many students did not enjoy all the little assignments, but they were actually quite helpful.  Furthermore, taking private lessons with the T.F.s was a great experience.  I only wish that the seminars had been a bit more engaging and/or interactive.  The guest lectures were fascinating, but the basic lectures on instrument families were a bit dull. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course how it is! ",
            "\u00a0Lessons are great. The time spent in the guest presentations could often get a little tedious, but was helpful in exposing students to unfamiliar material. I wish that we did more analysis of 20th and 21st century music. ",
            "\u00a0This course's focus on independent work was an absolute highlight. Structuring the course around individual composition with feedback from tutors allows each student to improve their work while also showcasing creativity. I don't have any real suggested improvements. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lay in its clear format, as well as its joint meetings with the other composition seminar. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I think comp seminar is a great way for composers to get involved in the composition community, find opportunities, receive feedback, and take lessons. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! Genuinely can't wait to take it again next semester. Whether or not you're a music major, this course is a great way to get creative and become more refined in your musical writing. People write all kinds of music, and you will get to hear other people's music too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; composition seminar is probably one of the most useful and unique classes offered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0100 percent. Dr A is awesome! And you learn so much, especially from your TA. I wrote a piece in a scale I never would have thought Id be able to. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course!  Composition seminar is a unique opportunity to learn technical aspects of composition through the regular assignments but to work creatively on a semester project.  Furthermore, the private lessons with the T.F.s are incredibly helpful, and one can get as much out of the lessons as one would like.  Finally, as someone who has only ever worked with notation software, I was grateful for the opportunities to learn Logic Pro in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I came in shopping the class, and on the first day, the presentations from the previous Composition Seminar had blown me away. I already felt out of place, both in composition experience (little to none) and in my writing style. After class, I had a chat with Dr. A who gladly listened to a short (very beginner) piece I had written in the past and encouraged me to stay in the course. She assured me that students aren't graded against each other but against themselves. Progress is measured, and as long as you're improving in your composition skills, you will excel in the course. Also, you're not grading within the parameters of one specific genre/writing style. You can write in any style, your style. I am so glad I decided to stay in the course, and I have learned more than I've ever learned about writing music in my entire life. \r\n\r\nThank you so much, Dr. A. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but know that people at different levels will get different things out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in composition in any capacity. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course for anyone who composes, for fun or otherwise!! Not only is the course itself great, you get to meet other amazing composers and learn from them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learned a lot about how to compose, and had the opportunity to hear from various speakers about their own compositional experiences. "
