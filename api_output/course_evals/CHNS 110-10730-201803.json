            "\u00a0More tips for how to memorize characters ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength in this course is that most of the class is centered around speaking and listening practice. While this is helpful, I think it would also be a good idea to review more of the homework in class and to incorporate more character practice in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very rigorous in forcing you to learn Chinese but does so very well. The small class size is probably the most effective thing about this class. It forces you to speak Chinese everyday which was super helpful. The amount of homework, quizzes, and tests was hard but made for a great way of learning the language. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because I think while learning a new language is very difficult, this class does an excellent job of teaching Mandarin to new students. This class moves extremely quickly, and I learned more than I could have ever expected. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's a tough class but worth the work. You pick up the language very quickly. ",
