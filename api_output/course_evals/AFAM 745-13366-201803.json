            "\u00a0I learned incredible amounts about the field of Black Atlantic Art, encountered artists I didn't know before, learned about theoretical approaches to understand their art and ways to discuss them in a classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about aesthetic theory, Black studies, art historical analysis, and cultural theory. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of black contemporary art since 1980 as well as a sense of the theoretical frameworks through which it has been interpreted. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much improved knowledge of contemporary Black Atlantic artists and their work. I learned a great deal from closely examining the work, its historical, and critical context. Overall, I was very inspired by the material, readings, and discussion. It gives my new insight into my practice as a Black artist. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the early assignment in the first weeks of the course to post a work related to the week's topic. The assignment encouraged me to start researching artists and artworks early and widely. Sometimes I have an art object in mind to attach theoretical or thematic concepts to, so this was a slightly different model of researching. I enjoyed the work of combing through artist websites, exhibition catalogues, and critic reviews in order to track down information about works that in many cases have not been widely written about in academic contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Gain a great deal of knowledge on the art history and black cultural production since the 1980s. As a student will little prior knowledge of art history, Professor Mercer's course was incredibly informative and intellectually engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in black Atlantic art. It is especially useful for those looking to build a foundation in the topic. "

            "\u00a0Strength were an incredibly knowledgeable instructor and fascinating material. Weaknesses were the somewhat unclear expectations for the final assignment and a lack of instructor feedback on paper proposals or presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Prof. Mercer is brilliant and masterly lead discussions and provided so much wisdom on the subject. His knowledge of the material is unmatched. ",
            "\u00a0Many of the art works that students showed in their final presentations were new to meit would have been nice to incorporate lesser-known works throughout the syllabus alongside the work of more famous artists. ",
            "\u00a0There were no weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course truly had no weaknesses. It's strength's were the Professor in-depth knowledge of the material, the quality of the selected readings, and the breadth, and depth, of the classes final assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong and cohesive syllabus with foundational texts. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course. The readings are fascinating and moving, the subject matter is avant-garde, and Professor Mercer is a genius. Also, the class draws a lot of interesting students from across different departments--School of Art, History of Art department, and African American Studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in Black Atlantic art from this period. I would especially recommend it to Black artists and art history students. ",
            "\u00a0In a department where courses on contemporary art with a critical race studies lens have been few and far between, I think this class did a great job bridging disciplines. That is, I liked the variety of departments represented in our class, which were brought together by key issues in black studies and cultural studies. I thought the syllabus for this class was well structured (I especially liked the T.J. Demos, Chakrabarty, and Davis texts). I think this is an important course to offer again in future. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Mercer's course was by far one of the best courses I have taken while at Yale. Professor Mercer not only provided an environment conducive to learning, he gave his students a solid foundation from which they can approach the complexity of black art. ",
