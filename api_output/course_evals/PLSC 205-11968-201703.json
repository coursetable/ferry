            "\u00a0I learned a ton about how to read political situations, the differences between power and authority in leadership, and the development of the office of the presidency. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a unique framework for understanding the modern presidency. The courses teaches you how to think about authority, leadership, and character in presidents. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a massive amount about the history and political science philosophy about the power and authority of the President and his office. It was certainly an enlightening course. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course, I better understand the current context of the American Presidency as it has been historically shaped. The course mainly focused not so much on individual Presidents, but rather how they were characteristic of a particular time period and presidential structure of political power. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a good historical survey and all about the literature in the specific branch of American Presidential Development. Skowronek knows his stuff, in large part because he's a seminal scholar in it! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the initial American Presidents as well as the nature of the Presidency as an institution and as a political tool in modern day. I really enjoyed learning about Neustadt and Kernell and appreciated Skowronek's explanation of the executive bureaucracy. ",
            "\u00a0A good understanding of the major American presidents, how to analyze the success or lack thereof of presidents, and how to write a clear essay. ",
            "\u00a0I have definitely learned how to think critically about readings and lecture topics, as well as create a concise research paper. The class also really taught me how to think beyond class topics. ",
            "\u00a0In this class you will learn how the American presidency developed over time and amassed power and resources that it was not intended to have originally. You will grapple with the constitution and think critically about what the founders intended the American presidency (and government) to be, how we have diverged from that vision, and why we should care. The most interesting thing you will learn (in my opinion) is Professor Skowronek's theory about presidential authority, which I loved because it shows that as much as things have changed since the founding, what makes a president \"successful\" is the same. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the political development of the presidency over the course of history. The class served helped further my knowledge about the office and how it has changed over time based on different interpretations of the constitution. "

        [
            "\u00a0Lectures are not structured super clearly. I think the class would benefit tremendously from a handout/email before class that outlined the basic elements of the days lecture. Feel like it tends to bounce around too much (confusing the timeline of events). ",
            "\u00a0The course topic is very interesting and the professor usually gives very interesting lecturers. Weaknesses of the course include the essays and sections. The course had way too many essays not to be considered a WR class. The essays themselves had long, jumbled, confusing prompts that not the even the TAs understood. Asking for clarification from the professor often resulted in even more confusion. The same can be said about the essay prompts on the final. Discussion sections were unfocused and unengaging. The amount of reading in the course was overwhelming and sections for this year failed to provide a basic framework for addressing the course readings is a concise manner. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the course material, especially the end of the class which had the framework the professor developed. The weakness was the seeming lack of interest the professor showed in his students. ",
            "\u00a0The Professor was an extremely difficult grader and the essay assignments were very hard. I also think that the pressure for the final exam was unnecessary. We did not even know what a potential ID term could be because there was no midterm and having to prepare for 9 essays was a little extreme. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Lectures are AMAZING. Very well organized and you can feel the passion in every single word. \r\nWeakness - I felt like I learned loads that I never got to show on assessments, which is frustrating, but certainly not the end of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course was somewhat rigid. Perhaps there might have been more flexibility or options for the essays including doing 3 and dropping one. I also felt like some of those assignments were sprung upon us late in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Not organized at all. ",
            "\u00a0All of the lectures were incredibly interesting and engaging, with the exception of the ones on the institutional structures of federal government. I understand this is necessary to learn, but I think it could've been covered in fewer classes. ",
            "\u00a0I think the biggest strength of the course was the professor himself - Professor Skowronek is a genius in his field and truly explained the material in an engaging way. It astounded me to hear his own theories on patterns of presidents and to be able to trace presidents back to a common threat. I think a weakness was definitely the amount of reading in contrast with the amount of discussion section time. We would have very short discussion sections, but the readings would be incredibly long and detailed. There either needed to be less reading or more time in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strength and weakness was its solid grounding in history. Lots of history for a poli sci course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting content, the professor is highly regarded for his research in this field. \r\nWeaknesses: the class was overall very unorganized. For example, for the paper prompts we would not receive clear direction on what to write. One question would embody several little questions- so much so that it became unclear what the main focus of the paper was to be. On top of that, it was hard to respond to all of the mini questions within one question of the prompt in the allotted word count.  In addition, there was minimal feedback on the papers that we did. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is pretty interesting but two things I found frustrating were that Professor Skowronek's lectures are sometimes hard to follow because he uses no slideshow or visuals of any kind. There is also a lot of long, repetitive readings. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class is the content that is discussed, in lecture and discussion sections. However, lecture without any sort of interactive tool like videos, graphics, slides, pictures, etc. would make the class a little dull at times. The chronological order of the content definitely helps, but the older content (Founding Fathers era) could definitely benefit from some sources other than readings. Some of the readings assigned were also not discussed in lecture or section sometimes, which is a missed opportunity to facilitate further discussion and thoughts. "

            "\u00a0Yes- I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend to students to credit/D. The course material is certainly interesting. However, the amount of reading, number of essays, lack of clear feedback, and arbitrary grade deflation by the professor will make the class unnecessarily stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend as a credit d if you are interested in the politics of the president. If you like other branches of the government, then this course is probably not for you. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class was really helpful, but in the moment I did not enjoy taking it very much. It was very valuable knowledge, but I would recommend taking the course Credit D. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to people who have already taken a PLSC course or two, specifically because it is a very specific approach. That said, hard to beat having Skowronek teach you APD. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0No. I most definitely would not. The material is interesting, but the professor and one of the TFs did not facilitate a comfortable, learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're interested in the presidency, you should definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to major in political science - I would not recommend this course to someone who simply wants to get their social science credits out of the way. It is definitely difficult for a first year student who does not have much of a political science background (there is a lot of work and the course challenged me to think in ways I had never thought before). But if someone wants to learn about the presidency in great depth, I highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you have an interest in this area I would recommend this class, but beware of the fact that it is extremely unorganized and the fact that the assignments are not clear in direction. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in presidential history, political philosophy, and constitutional law. The assignment workload is not that heavy but the readings can be unnecessarily long and you have to be on top of them to do well on the papers. Be prepared to think critically about  how and why the presidency has amassed power and why we should care. I say that because there was more political philosophy than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course if you are interested in American Politics and its development over the course of history. I also think the class is important to clear up any wrong ideas about what the president is allowed to do vs what they are expected to do and whether those two things align. "
