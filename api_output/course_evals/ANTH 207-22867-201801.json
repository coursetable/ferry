            "\u00a0This course offers a global understanding of what constitutes cultural heritage, how it has been interpreted in the past, and how we can best preserve it. By having guest lecturers every week from all across the world and with many different areas of expertise (chemical conservation, cultural preservation, law, police work, city planning, tourism, etc.), it was possible to get some semblance of the full complexity of the problems currently being faced in the world of conservation. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a working definition of cultural heritage. Learned about various threats to cultural heritage and techniques of preservation and conservation. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of the stakeholders and actors in cultural heritage preservation. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of the vast field that is cultural heritage. We spent the semester defining cultural heritage, and this course opened my eyes to how incredibly complex cultural heritage really is, as well as the physical, economical, and political issues that surround it. We were able to talk with experts all over the world to be able to understand these different issues and also relate to the cultural heritage that surrounds us in New Haven. Stefan also had an amazing team of colleagues that gave us insight into their specific fields that relate to cultural heritage, like physics, chemistry, and data analysis. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the enthusiasm and knowledge provided by the instructor, and the diversity of viewpoints presented every week. The class struggled a bit with scheduling, as many, if not all, of the speakers spoke for longer than their allotted time, which gave us less time to hear from Stefan than was ideal. Perhaps the class could benefit by meeting more frequently, or by having one or two fewer speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers that Professor Simon gets to talk to us are all incredible. Getting people from around the world to discuss the unifying spirit of cultural heritage was truly a wonderful experience. This was an amazing class that really opened my eyes to the world of cultural heritage and the need to preserve it. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: incredible range of speakers ",
            "\u00a0A definite strength of this class is the variety and quality of the guest speakers. I loved being able to ask specific questions to the experts Stefan brought in to class each week. It really felt like hands-on learning even though we were sitting in a classroom in New Haven. I also loved being able to check in with the other students in the class about their projects because I learned so much from them as well. I liked the small class environment because it really felt like we got specific feedback and attention from everyone. The main weakness of the class is that there was not a lot of discussion time after the speaker's talk and the question and answer session. I would have loved to learn more from Stefan himself about his work, but often we found we ran out of time to look at the slides he had prepared. This could be improved by a different set up, like two guest lectures and an extra section time to synthesize what we really learned. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone and everyone. Learning about what constitutes cultural heritage and how to preserve it is not a subject that should be limited to a small group, but is something that everyone should be interested in. Cultural heritage is constantly under attack, often literally, and has been for most of human history. The more people become aware of the struggles, the better we can preserve our own heritage, and the more we can learn from it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if youre interested in the topic and it is pretty much the only class to discuss it at any length. Prof Simon is incredibly knowledgeable and well-connected in the archaeological/museum/preservation world which made for a truly remarkable seriess of guest speakers. In nearly every class we found ourselves face to face with museum directors, people who faced extraordinary odds to protect heritage in Syria and Iraq, as well as other Yale professors. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think I could recommend a course more highly. This was one of my all time favorite classes. Professor Simon is a wonderful lecturer and his connections are so deep that he is able to bring in speakers from around the world. Please, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if youre interested in learning about cultural heritage preservation around the world ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! It was such a fun, laid-back class and I really felt I got a lot out of it. The speakers were so interesting that I never felt I was forcing myself to pay attention. We also had really interesting reading response prompts. I loved the topic and Stefan was a delightful professor. "
