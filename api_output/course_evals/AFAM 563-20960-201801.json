            "\u00a0I learned just how evasive a true theory of Ralph Ellison is. He was really an innovator in creating a comprehensive sense of black life and the importance of  refusing restrictive definitions of blackness. The readings were situated in a specific moment of black literature that i t was helpful to become more familiar with. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about literary critique techniques and close reading. I also really appreciated being able to read so many of Ralph Ellison's work because it provided me the opportunity (which I have never had before) to really think about a writer's work over time and in the context of their life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think through the life and context of a single writer. ",
            "\u00a0I chose to enroll in this course under the idea that it would be a good introduction to Ralph Ellison's work which I had heard of frequently and knew was important but had not yet read. In taking the course, I was given the freedom to explore archival resources and worked on public speaking a bit. But the most important aspects of the course for me were that I had the latitude to examine a single work closely as part of a group and to build an interpretative argument over months rather than a few weeks at the end of a semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a full-bodied account of the life and works of Ralph Ellison.   In addition, I became far more familiar with era in which he wrote  the contemporaries in which he engaged.  Doing so not only allowed me to think about the cultural imprint left by Ellison.  It also allowed me to think more broadly about tools for critiquing and complicating dominant conceptions of the \"American tradition,\" and the creative practices through which African American artists and intellectuals have done so. "

            "\u00a0The course was somewhat singularly focused, which could be both bad and good. There was not much contextualizing done of the world beyond America, to suit Ellison's focus, I suppose. The scholarship on Ralph Ellison could use a more contemporary update, but  as an English major, I benefited from the focus on language and close reading.\r\nI wonder if the class may have had more room for student-led engagement beyond the presentations. ",
            "\u00a0It was an enjoyable class, but could have had more rigor. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course served as a great, semester-long examination of Ralph Ellison's writings which culminated with his most celebrated piece, Invisible Man. I felt that the course assignments were useful; the presentation was a relaxed way to hear various approaches to Ellison's persona, life, and work which encouraged me to start thinking toward a final essay from the beginning of the course. I found that the structure of the course has been the most organic and still generative way to help students prepare better final essays that are brave and thorough. The only significant weakness that I noticed was that there seemed to be uneven participation between the graduate and undergraduate students. I would have preferred if the class dynamic could have grown to create a space where everyone is engaging equally and frequently, but I also understand that class dynamics depend on the arbitrary people who end up taking the course together and varies from one iteration of a course to another.

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in Ralph Ellison's relationship to other literary figures of his  day and the various contexts of American history he emerges from. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I think this course is very important for thinking about the relationships between literature and history and for thinking about how to think about literature \"in context\" - in the context of the author's time, location, colleagues, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Stepto has a rich understanding of Ellison and a rich life that he very generously shares with his students. ",
            "\u00a0I would excitedly recommend this course to other students especially if, like me, they haven't read Invisible Man before and are looking for a first encounter with Ralph Ellison. In addition, if students are looking for a course about the mid-20th century, African American experiences in the 20th century, the purpose of novels and fiction, or Ellison as an intellectual celebrity, this course would also be a great fit. Finally, if anyone wants to simply take a class with Professor Stepto, this course will surpass expectation. "
