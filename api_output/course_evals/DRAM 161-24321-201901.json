Maybe more examples could be provided for writing assignments such as the budget writing, for examples provided in other courses might couldnt be directly used in this course. "

Im looking forward to the advance class and I believe it is on the same track as the beginner class. Maybe a vocabulary of the terms in this field could be provided in the beginning. Being a student without professional background, I spent some time search for the terms and guessing the difference between similar ones. Though this procedure was helpful, it would be better if there is an official clarification of the terms. "

Most of the class was very New York centered and I felt like he only really considered what the more NY-savvy students in the class had to say. I'm afraid to say that I was not satisfied with this course. ",
