            "\u00a0This course offered a lot of understanding about the history and character of German fairy tales and their pertinence to other aspects of German culture. It definitely helped me improve my German reading and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0German speaking, some grammar, definitely reading skills and scholarly language ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of German fairytales, their adaptations, and their interpretations, as well as much more German vocab. ",
            "\u00a0I continued my development in proficiency of the German language, this time with a better understanding of storytelling and writing. It was super helpful to not only be able to speak German, but also to write interesting narratives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a lengthy research paper in German and how to read complex secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course required a lot of writing and so learning to write both creatively and academically in German was definitely emphasised. There was also a lot of exposure to literary criticism in German as well as German literary texts themselves, which helped a lot with improving German comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my German reading and writing skills, especially through reading and analyzing secondary texts and the bi-weekly writing assignments. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course consistently had engaging readings and assignments. I loved getting to practice German creative writing and there were plenty of interesting conversations in class, since there's so much to talk about in relation to fairy tales. Obviously getting to read fairy tales is a great, chill time, but they also did a lot to balance the heavier academic texts. Professor Schenker is also a phenomenal teacher dedicated to helping students grow in and enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0It's a very engaging course. No real complaints regarding weaknesses. Perhaps the content could get a little repetitive sometimes (maybe the nature of the subject - a lot of psychoanalytic-type themes). But I have nothing bad to say about the teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel that this course had any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness was the difficulty of the secondary texts, but this was addressed partway through when there were annotated sections to focus on and that was very helpful. Everything else was great! ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and organized. Some of the secondary sources were extremely difficult to read, but Prof. Schenker provided annotated versions at the end of the semester which proved useful. ",
            "\u00a0really fun topic, Theresa is obviously a strength (she's amazing) ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely helped develop German reading and writing skills. However, the exclusive focus on fairy tales meant that by the end of the semester the topic felt a bit worn out and overstretched and discussions became repetitive. This topic probably could have been finished in eight weeks. \r\nThere could definitely have been more emphasis on practising listening and speaking skills in German and often the classroom atmosphere felt quite disengaged. It would have also been helpful to have more guidance in how to approach difficult texts in literary criticism, particularly as many of these texts were written over fifty years ago in quite high academic prose style. There was not a lot of guidance in the final project either or in the creative tasks in general, which meant that the grading felt a bit unfair and not conducive to learning, especially for non-native speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the course is designed to facilitate student learning, and that the students can shape how they want the discussions to proceed.\r\nThe weaknesses are that the secondary readings can get a bit complicated at times. "

            "\u00a0This is a great German elective to take. The assignments and readings aren't very demanding, it offers great practice with German, and the content itself has a cool history and applications to other fields. Also, taking a class with Professor Schenker is always worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to take an L5 German course, you should 100% take any of Theresa's courses. This topic was interesting because you can actually read the original fairy tales and follow them, as opposed to a literature course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I definitely improved my German. It's very welcoming to all levels. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Theresa Schenker is, hands down, the best and most engaging professor Ive had at Yale. I was always excited to come to class (especially when Zo was around), and I look forward to future courses with Professor Schenker. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you feel comfortable with German, or even just want to challenge yourself, it is so much fun and so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I think everyone could benefit from taking a course taught by Prof. Schenker! ",
            "\u00a0definitely take this class! Theresa is a gem of a professor and also who doesn't want to get graded for reading and talking about fairy tales for a semester? ",
            "\u00a0In theory, this is a good course for improving skills in reading and writing German and the learning curve is quite steep. However, the structure of the course needs developing as the material gets very repetitive towards the end. There was not a lot of guidance in terms of writing or reading built into the course itself, unless you reached out to the instructor, and so it required a lot of self-teaching and self-discipline. This class is probably better for native speakers than for those looking to develop their German language skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants to improve their German skills and is interested in reading fairytales and learning about different perspectives on them. "
