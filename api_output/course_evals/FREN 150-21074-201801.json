            "\u00a0This course really helped solidify a lot of grammar that I thought I learned in 140. Aside from grammar, the stories and plays that we read in class helped to improve my vocabulary a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This is a brilliant way to refresh your memory and pick up all the nuances of French grammar, learn a lot of relevant literary vocabulary and generally improve your speaking and writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0This course has a very heavy and consistent workload each week. Because of this, I really did improve my vocab and grammar, but the workload was hard to manage at times. Some weeks we would have grammar work, reading, and a 2 hour movie to watch all for one day. The work was manageable but I had to work pretty hard some weeks to plan ahead. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that you really do learn a lot. There is a great variety of materials covered, from grammar to literature to film. The only weakness is that the work load is a bit too big. "

            "\u00a0I would totally recommend French 150, but don't expect it to be an easy 5th class. It's a lot of work (I would say the same amount as L4 but only meets 3 times a week), but if you put in the effort it pays off. Your French will definitely improve. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is serious about improving their French, but I probably wouldn't recommend this class as a fifth class to take just for fun because it really is a significant amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot if you are willing to put in the effort. Would recommend! "
