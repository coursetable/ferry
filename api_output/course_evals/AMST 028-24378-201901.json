            "\u00a0This class provided me with important insight into the world of antiquarian book collecting as well as a history of the American West through a lens which it is not normally taught. The trips to the New York Antiquarian Book fair, the William Reese Company, and other important centers of the book trade left me feeling much more connected with the material which we studied. ",
            "\u00a0Research and analytical skills. Also the exposure to the Beineke made me more confident in rare books and manuscripts research in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new appreciation for the Beinecke Library and all the resources they provide to students. I learned how to use the Beinecke to my full advantage when doing research. I also gained insight into the world of book collecting, book history and the field of Americana. I also gained knowledge into the effects of book collecting on higher education and the education system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about rare books and collecting in general. There was an emphasis on studying books as objects rather than simply as sources of knowledge. "

            "\u00a0This course was very balanced between learning about the history of collecting Americana, creating book lists of our own, and engaging personally in the world of collecting. It also opened my eyes to the great resources on campus such as the Beineke and for that I see it as a very important fist-year class. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely interesting and great use of outside resources/field trips. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is so broad that it has something for everyone. The way this material is delivered is through books, articles, field trips to book fairs and William Reese Company which keeps you engaged. Also, the assignments are clear, but at the same time open to student creativity which is not penalized in the end, but rewarded. The schedule on the syllabus is fairly accurate, so you know what to expect and helps you prepare for class. Only improvement would be to make deadlines for assignments more clear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Ross is awesome and super nice. We got to go to the Beinecke several times, went to NYC for the Antiquarian Book Fair, and visited a local rare bookstore. It was all pretty cool and gave some insight into the industry. The final project was also pretty interesting and unique\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much. Maybe to be more clear and organized on what our assignments entail "

            "\u00a0Yes. This class discusses a topic that I doubt many students have been greatly exposed to that of antiquarian book collecting. This seems perhaps a dry or daunting subject at first, but I found it exponentially more interesting and engrossing with every class. Book collecting still looks daunting after having taken this class, but more in the sense that a hike is daunting: I know that there is a lot of meticulous work to be put in if I ever wanted to be a collector, but there is a great reward at reaching the top of the collecting mountain and seeing where your hard-work has brought you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I learned a lot about a subject I didn't even know existed. For anybody interested in books this is a must take class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's very unique in its course material. It offers an intimate learning experience. Also, you get to know people in the field of book collecting and in Americana through visits to the Beinecke, William Reese Company and the New York Antiquarian Book Fair, as well as guest speakers. Professor Travis also is a wonderful instructor who is very passionate about the material taught and has experience in the field of Americana. He helps you improve, succeed and keeps you engaged and asking questions. Take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a pretty interesting class about a cool subject without much stress involved. "
