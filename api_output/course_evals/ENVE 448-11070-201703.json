            "\u00a0I learned about how contaminants are transported in aquatic systems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use momentum and mass conservation equations to analyze the inputs and outputs affecting control volumes. I learned about many forms of mass transport and solutions to common models of mass transport (ex: dissolving sphere), with a particular emphasis on diffusion, as well as when to apply certain assumptions to real world situations. I also learned a lot of about groundwater, forward osmosis, and contaminant mass transport within groundwater. "

            "\u00a0The teaching was engaging and understandable. The homeoworks were rather complicated and could barely be done without the help of the TA, but were a useful teaching tool. The tests were very reasonable (but still complicated) and helped me better understand topics. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the best class I've taken at Yale that intensely used differential equations to model concepts, and it is one of the few classes that made my horrible experience taking differential equations itself worth it. I loved the fact that Prof Elimelech published helpful notes to go with each of the lectures, even though attending lecture was still necessary to get the whole picture for each of the topics. Prof Elimelech is an excellent teacher, and he made the workload for his class reasonable. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course--it is hard, but well-taught and the tests are reasonable (even if the homeowrks are very hard--you need a TA to do them, but they are very usedul). The topic was interesting and very useful. ",
            "\u00a0Look, you're probably looking at this class because you have to take transport for your major, but if you're going to take transport, take it with Meny. This class is basically applied differential equations, but is is worth it, and Meny is an excellent professor. The workload is manageable--make sure to go to TA office hours for homework. You'll learn cool things about how the transport of contaminants is affected by different circumstances. "
