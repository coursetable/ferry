            "\u00a0I have a hard time figuring out if I'm doing good or bad in the class, therefore it would be helpful if the assignments were graded or commented, so I would have an idea.\r\n\r\nBesides, I would have liked if we read a more policy papers, since this was what we should write for the finals. ",
            "\u00a0The type of final paper was a good idea and I liked the small class size. I wish we had more case studies to think about the application of certain tools instead of spending a lot of time in comparing different research methods for human rights in the beginning of class. "
