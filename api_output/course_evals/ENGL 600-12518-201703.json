            "\u00a0Besides coming away with a much fuller understanding of early modern calendrical time, I felt that I gained access to a broad range of methods and approaches for studying the relationship between literature and history. The class places us in touch with a rich body of archival material, from plays and poetry anthologies to sermons, news pamphlets, and chronicle histories, and we are invited to engage with this material in a variety of different critical and historical registers, as well as to interrogate these larger conceptual frameworks themselves and the way that they condition us to ask questions. Having access to the Beinecke itself and being able to interact directly with its collections was a great resource. ",
            "\u00a0- I read a wide range of plays that I had never encountered before \r\n- I gained much deeper knowledge of the main players in the early modern play-book printing and performance scenes \r\n- I gained a deeper sense of the issues that audiences of the time found troubling, entertaining, preoccupying ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal of practical research skills in this class, particularly how to use sources that are crucial to early modernists. First and foremost, I learned how to determine dates in early modern England, which was an amazing skill to acquire. I also learned how to use the Stationers' Register and Henslowe's Diary. More broadly, I was introduced to the world of early modern English drama beyond the realm of Shakespeare, and now, as a result of this course, I'd say I'm more immediately familiar with these anonymous plays than I am with the Shakespearean canon itself. It really was a terrific class. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis galore...and a lot about guiding my own course of study. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class is structured around a fairly miscellaneous-- though, as I think I came to see in the course of the semester, not truly miscellaneous-- collection of texts at some point attributed to Shakespeare, which is its own kind of challenge. The traditional structures that organize a typical graduate syllabus, often focused on authors, influences, and so on, don't make a lot of sense for exploring this material, which, while belonging to a shared social and cultural world, were in large part placed in conversation with one another through a historical accident which only looks significant in retrospect given our Shakespeare-driven early modern curriculum. This was an aspect of the course that I really enjoyed, but it poses its own problems, and I could feel the group jointly working to build a vocabulary for discussion as the weeks went along, which might help inform later iterations of this seminar. ",
            "\u00a0- the plays were strange and exciting; I really enjoyed the parts of class where we were actually discussing the content of the plays and trying to make sense of them\r\n- it was amazing to have early editions of much of the material we were looking at; I wish we'd spent a bit more time looking at the actual materials called up from the Beinecke collections, though\r\n- the historical background and details were informative, and the professor is clearly an expert, but it did sometimes get a bit repetitive ",
            "\u00a0The course was very comprehensive, looking at a wide corpus of early modern plays that were at one point attributed to Shakespeare. Its main strengths were the consistency of its theme and the knowledge of our professor, who was able to impart a vast amount of knowledge each class on a given text. The only two things that I would have found helpful would have been more secondary reading material on the period/London drama scene for context and more engagement with the rare book material we saw each week. But that said, the class was extremely rich and of all my classes at Yale this semester, I'd say I learned the most from this one. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of strengths in my eyes: a syllabus full of interesting and infrequently read plays, an important historical and philosophical project, and a seminar atmosphere where everyone seemed to feel genuinely comfortable contributing. I especially appreciated that David Kastan was willing to let me and the other students in the class be independent in our thinking. He was supportive of our individual interests while still pushing us to refine our ideas. \r\n\r\nMy main suggestion for improvement, oddly enough, would be to add more readings to the syllabus: some additional secondary readings, maybe, and a bit more historical background. I was grateful for the lighter workload but honestly wouldn't have minded doing more for this class. The plays on the syllabus were such a fantastic entry point into the politics and culture of the early modern period, and it would have been helpful to see how our collective thinking about them connected with current scholarly trends in this subfield.

            "\u00a0Yes-- absolutely! It's a really interesting concept and worked out well in practice. We had a range of students with different interests, including those focusing both on other periods and other methods, and I think everyone got something out of it that they can take with them back to whatever they do. And what better excuse to spend some time at the Beinecke looking at amazing old books? ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would be a good match for a student who wants a combination of studying form (book historical inquiry) and content (of the literary materials themselves) ",
            "\u00a0YES. I think this course would be an incredible introduction to Early Modern drama for any graduate student. The great thing about it is that it provides a much more comprehensive view of what the early modern world of drama was than a more traditional Shakespeare class. I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, David is a wonderful teacher and we read many texts that  are understudied bt nevertheless great reads ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was probably the most interesting and enjoyable class I took this semester. "
