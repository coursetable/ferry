            "\u00a0Good dialect vocabulary! Knowledge of the origin of words in dialect. Conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided insight into colloquial Arabic words and phrases that I hope will be useful in the future. I got used to colloquial sentence structure as well. ",
            "\u00a0I gained speaking and comprehension proficiency in Levantine Arabic ",
            "\u00a0This class helped develop and apply basic levantine dialect skills, spoken and listening.  Most of the Arabic language was pretty basic, but it was nice to have a class space to practice speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Better knowledge and understanding of Levantine dialect, new vocabulary. "

            "\u00a0More natakallam in the future. The practice with native speakers was great. I wish it was taught more often because Im in L5 and there were students of many levels. ",
            "\u00a0This might sound strange but I actually think it would help if the course had more evaluations (i.e. quizzes) to help students retain the material. I liked the emphasis on talking in class a lot. I think it wouldve been helpful if we had more structured questions to ask each other that focused on the vocab so that we had to use the vocabulary in sentences. I think the exercise where we were given scenarios on slides and had to use vocab phrases was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The conversational elements are the strongest aspects of the course the Levantine table especially is helpful. The projects often felt a little like busy work, and I wish we spent more time on the grammar and activating new vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0This class had very little outside work and was mostly class based discussion.   A little more outside work could be useful for the class. ",
            "\u00a0A bit less reliance on the book, and more outside content. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Only dialect class opportunity for Arabic ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because this is a great opportunity to spend time on the Levantine dialect which there often isnt time for in the normal Arabic sequence. You will get good speaking practice, and the workload is very manageable. If you want to learn new vocab you will have to encourage yourself to practice it because there are no formal assessments besides projects so Im not sure how much of the new vocab I retained. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, if you want to learn Levantine Arabic, this is your best bet at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Sarab is an incredible professor and so nice--she really encourages students to speak in class and practice! Workload is very minimal and manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I think learning a dialect is extremely important when it comes to Arabic, and I was glad that Yale offers the chance to do so. I think this is something that distinguishes Yale's Arabic program and I hope it will be mantained in the future. "
