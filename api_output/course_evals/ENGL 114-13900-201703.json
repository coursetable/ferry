            "\u00a0This course improved my ability to write and my level of comfort with essay writing at an exponential rate. ",
            "\u00a0How to read advanced/scholarly texts, how to write longer papers using predominantly scholarly sources, how to compare and evaluate scholarly texts, how to write at a collegiate level, how to analyze art/creative writing from a scholarly angle, how to peer review more thoroughly ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the foundations and definitions of exiles, migrants, refugees, nation, diaspora, etc.  More importantly, I developed critical writing skills, such as learning how to craft an argument, write a research paper, and revise my papers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed both my writing and critical reading skills. And I learned to think deeply about nationality, race, ethnicity and how separation from those things affects a person. ",
            "\u00a0I know myself more as a writer. I can edit essays faster and give more on point feedback. I learned new theories to shape my thinking around. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredible! I came as a very weak writer, and watched both my writing and confidence as a writer grow exponentially! As promised, English 114 truly teaches you how to write on a college level. \r\nHowever, this section in particular was great: you tackle principles texts on nationalism, diasporas, refugees... and take away very relevant knowledge in addition to just skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed analytical and organization skills. I also developed theoretical and philosophical aspects of immigration issues we face today, including the sentiment of exiles and refugees as they leave their countries. ",
            "\u00a0This course drastically helped my writing. It taught me to think critically about the prompts and texts that I was given, and how to continuously revise and improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to edit my own papers and the importance of the revision process for writing. ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I see my writing improve, but I also learnt how to be a more attentive and inquisitive reader. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was good about taking everything in steps and providing check-ins for papers both with flexible office hours from the Professor and in class.\r\n\r\nI wish the course could have had more specific assignments and have spent more time analyzing the readings explicitly for what we students were supposed to understand ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The texts we read seemed to be seminal and crucial texts to the major themes of the course. The workload and expectations were challenging, but not overly so. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - The readings we did were cut, which although was helpful in balancing my other classwork, also made me feel like I missed out on learning more about the class topic. Again, due to time constraints, I also feel like we didn't have enough time to discuss the texts we read, especially more confusing ones like Benedict Anderson. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very difficult, but it was also very rewarding by the end of the semester when we could see all of the work and improvement that we accomplished. The readings were helpful and often interesting, but the course did not always allot time to analyzing and discussing every reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Heavy focus on clear and concise writing, based on what is present in text or research. The Professor was very engaging and personable.  \r\n\r\nFlaws: Grading was a bit of a Black box. I would change things in my essay at the professors recommendation, and in my final review of the paper she correct those edits. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that this course was about exiles, migrants and refugees made this class very relevant and important. The reading selections, the professor and her way of teaching the class all enhanced improvement and made this class an amazing one. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is how little time we have for both practicing writing and doing the readings justice. If a course is called a \"writing\" seminar, then we should do more writing than the four major assignments we have for the class. Doing short pieces each week, handing it in, getting feedback on it, repeating... In my opinion, this is how the course should be designed. The readings were all so interesting and stimulated a lot of discussion, but because we had major assignments coming up and writing tips we need to go through, we didn't have enough time for discussion. I feel like we could've made a lot more out of the things we read because of the way the course is designed. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredible! I came as a very weak writer, and watched both my writing and confidence as a writer grow exponentially! As promised, English 114 truly teaches you how to write on a college level. \r\nHowever, this section in particular was great: you tackle principles texts on nationalism, diasporas, refugees... and take away very relevant knowledge in addition to just skills. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A lot of open discussions about the writing processes, and in-class writing workshops helped to develop each draft. Challenged students to interweave different ideas on and concepts of exiles, migrants, and refugees. Analysis-heavy. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not a lot of time between each assignment or discussion of reading material; the emphasis was more on the writing aspect. Because this is a writing course, it may be difficult to change the entire structure. However, perhaps a day or two of discussing the readings would help students process the information and be more comfortable with the material before moving on the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was definitely the emphasis it placed on revision, forcing students to revise their work and also help their peers work on their writing.\r\n\r\nAnother strength was the support provided by Professor Mirakhor. It was great to have a professor so involved in helping her students with their writing, offering to meet with them multiple times for one piece of writing.\r\n\r\nOne weakness I found was that prompts could sometimes be a little vague, sometimes resulting in the first draft of my essays being confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I felt this course did a lot of teaching through corrections; essentially we learned from the mistakes we made which was good in that it ensured we improved upon our weaknesses, however it also did not do any favors to our grades. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was really well organized and does not need any improvements. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. The texts we read are incredibly insightful, and the emphasis on peer review, writing multiple drafts, and seeing writing tutors helped me become a much stronger writer. The discussions we had were also really interesting, and the dynamic of the classroom and the way discussions were structured made it feel like no one overpowered the discussion. The writing prompts are all varied and extremely thought-provoking; I especially enjoyed writing the last two essays. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to others that are both interested in improving their writing skills AND learning/reading about the theoretical foundations and definitions of the critical terms on which the class focuses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes only if you are truly interested in learning about the exilic experience and are serious about improving your writing. Take the class seriously, dont expect to get an A in your essay or the class unless you are truly phenomenal. Do expect to learn a bunch from a really cool professor though. ",
            "\u00a0I would because no matter your level, it pushes you to become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0This class is A LOT of work, but in retrospect its  definitely worth it! You tackle principles texts on nationalism, diasporas, refugees... and take away very relevant knowledge in addition to just skills. \r\nProfessor Mirakhor expects a lot, but she's also very caring, flexible and would go out of her way to meet with and guide you and make sure you're on track. \r\nThe four papers were all so different, some more intimidating and demanding than others, but she does an incredible job of breaking down the assignments. \r\n\r\nThe reading list is perfectly crafted and extremely interesting; by the end of the class you see it all fall into place! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if the student enjoys writing. If not, because the course was writing-intensive, it could be stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I think it is a great way to improve your writing and a very interesting topic to study. ",
            "\u00a0I would, it is a really interesting English class. "
