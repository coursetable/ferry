            "\u00a0I found this course incredibly useful to prepare for my summer master's research. Most important, I gained an appreciation for the embedded character of economic behavior and the contingency (and precarity) of our contemporary economic life. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course - I wish it was required for all FES students. Classes at FES tend to be very \"solutions\" oriented but those solutions tend to be grounded in our current political and economic systems. This class provides important context for how those systems initially emerged and reminds us that they are not necessarily permanent constraints. This is an incredibly valuable reminder. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of some of the foundational works from anthropology and geography theorizing how the global economy impacts local communities--including critiques of capitalism, development, and globalization. ",
            "\u00a0I read many different materials in economic history or issues from a anthropological perspective, which truly opened my eyes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how to conceptualize the immense forces/ systems shaping the relations I know I am embedded in but have never perceived clearly. ",
            "\u00a0One of the fantastic things about courses like this is that one actually commits the time needed along the semester to actually study a very specific study, as is the case. In that sense, the course reading selection was a particularly fine one at it and well worth the time and dedication to the course. Also, as with any seminar, the quality of the learning experiences depends on the classmates one happens to end up with and in my case I was lucky. Class after class there was a great discussion led by the professor after her lecture and I felt that the materials and lessons covered really informed by knowledge about the class subject. Not to say I ended up with a fantastic reading selection about it, as already mentioned. All in all, the seminar repeatedly felt like a special and unique spacephysically and timelyfor free thought, reflection and exchange. That is not easy to accomplish in itself, much less in such a diverse school. ",
            "\u00a0This course contextualized my grasp of capitalism and taught me critically important language for everything I'd learned in other parts of Yale, wrapping other courses and dogmas into the packaging of \"neoliberalism.\" This course is not only valuable for offering the economic syntax for critically evaluating dominant economic paradigm today, but it gave historical and anthropological perspectives that centered marginalized peoples, not companies, and those perspectives offered new insights for me.

            "\u00a0They align well. In fact, the class, and especially the discussion section, exceeded my expectations ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't sure what to expect from this class and it exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well aligned with my expectations. Readings and concepts were difficult, but engaging and I learned a lot that will be applicable to my thesis research. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to gain an anthropological method to insight into the economic topics, and I needed to summarize it by myself after reading and discussing the materials, which means that I obtained the content rather than the method. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class surpassed my expectations, which were already high. ",
            "\u00a0They met my expectations and surpassed them many times in terms of the quality and well-thought out of the reading selections. A few times I wished the lectures were to be bit better, but I guess that's too much to ask. All in all, I feel the course mostly met and sometimes exceeded my expectations, particularly in the quality of the discussions that it ensued and in how inspiring many of the sessions were. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't sure what to expect - I expected Foucault and philosophical perspectives, but I appreciated the additions of historical perspectives, global south voices, UN institutional critique, and some discussion of environmental solutions like REDf. "

            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course and wouldn't change much ",
            "\u00a0The second half of the course, when we had discussions, was fantastic. Carol's lectures were sometimes a bit hard to follow but were generally very interesting. Perhaps there would be a way to combine the two portions of the course together. Some lecture, then some discussion, then more lecture, then more discussion. Handing out an agenda or having a powerpoint might also make them easier to follow in terms of structure. It can sometimes be hard to listen to a lecture without any visuals and follow the structure. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus for this course is really strong. The assignments and discussion are also strong. The main weakness is lectures, which sometimes felt too disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0The topics and materials were really rich, but the lectures and discussions seemed scattered and some more obvious logical chains were needed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe various topics were synthesized very well, and the links between them were clear. \r\nThe quality of class discussion was amazing. \r\n\r\nWeakness: \r\nI can't think of any, I enjoyed every bit of it - even the parts that might have seemed like digressions (e.g. Prof Carpenter's anecdotes) ",
            "\u00a0There a realness to both everything the professor does that is so much necessary in this school. I wish other faculty member were like that, less pretentious and uptight and more human, more real. This carried across to the weekly reading selections, which never felt overwhelming and always seemed doable and inviting to complete. This keeping it real attitude was in itself an important lesson, besides the topics we studied, of course. \r\n\r\nThe reading list could be improved only a little bit more, maybe by selecting authors or introducing topics towards the end that can look more into what is next for the global economy: what is next after capitalism or how to bring it to an end (or how it will bring itself to an end). We did get a bit into that, but perhaps it could be officially incorporated into the reading selections. Again, this is a very personal and capricious suggestion. Just trying to add my two cents to an already extraordinary reading selection!\r\n\r\nOne additional thing: the minimum page requirement for the last paper could be a little less. Not that it was undoable, but it could be a little less. ",
            "\u00a0The unstructured chaos of discussions is a strength and weakness. It allows the class to feel informal and has a low barrier to entry for all students to speak up, but can also be easy to lose the thread of conversation or feel like we are wasting valuable time together.  The course focuses predominantly on identifying and analyzing problems of the dominant economic paradigm, but for those of us who want to be practitioners rather than academics, I would appreciate more attention to solutions and critiquing those.

            "\u00a0Take it. Especially if you have a background in economics and yearn for more thoughtful exploration. ",
            "\u00a0This is going to be quite different than most courses at FES but that is a very good thing. ",
            "\u00a0Students who have some economic or social science background are appropriate for this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to put aside some time to read and think about the origins and actuality of the global economic system, this course is for you. Go ahead, take it. The weekly reading selections are not only excellent and particularly precise and relevant, but they are doable. They are well-thought out to be made along with other coursework, not as it happens almost always, whereas the professor thinks his or her class is the only one the student has. Do check on who you're taking it with, as the quality of the weekly discussions will largely depend on your classmates. ",
            "\u00a0This class should be mandatory. It revolutionized my thinking about the economy we live in and create daily. I am so much more aware of how the pieces all fit together now and learned immensely. "
