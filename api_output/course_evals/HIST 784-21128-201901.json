            "\u00a0I thought a lot about the structures of US empire, and the different ways it manifests. I also found this class really useful for thinking about questions of archive and profession. It was a great class to get insight into the profession of being a historian. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of ground in the historiography on American empire in the 20th century and offered a very helpful reading list for a potential oral exam field in a related area. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new perspectives on US power and learned about different historiographical approaches scholars have taken in order to examine, analyze, and dissect the US empire around the globe. ",
            "\u00a0The course syllabus was excellent; I felt that Professor Engerman founds readings that would appeal to a diverse audience. It also complicated the concept of empire for students, forcing us to critically engage with the history and the concept itself. ",
            "\u00a0The most valuable insight I gained from the class was learning how a historian reads historiography. I thought the repeated emphasis on \"what are their sources\" and \"how does the evidence align with the question\" was incredibly helpful in getting me to think critically about historiography in a way that was productive.\r\n\r\nI also think the class modeled a range of different ways one might \"internationalize\" American history. By offering such a wide range of subject areas, the course made the case for understanding most aspects of American historical life in international perspective. "

            "\u00a0This class is very solid--I think the syllabus was mostly very good, and the discussions were engaging. I can't think of many weaknesses, although the one might be that we could have used more authors of color on the syllabus, as I think many of my classmates and I were sometimes frustrated by the limits and ethics of white, bourgeois authors writing about often colonized subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Really excellent reading list\r\n-Course discussion was almost always substantive, generative, and engaging\r\n-Very manageable writing load\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Frequently very heaving reading load ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this seminar and found the structure that requires students to submit discussion questions in advance particularly effective. The readings were engaging, and Prof. Engerman is a talented seminar leader. No specific weaknesses come to mind, although it would have been nice to talk a little more about other empires in order to strengthen the comparative angle. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: I would have liked if Professor Engerman would have based the class discussion on our questions. It seemed that he just picked a couple of ones he liked during the beginning but then they [the questions] were not referenced during most of the course. There were also instances were students were randomly asked to share their comments, which would result in long pauses. \r\n\r\nStrenghts: Professor Engerman was respectful of our ideas and perspectives, and is also very receptive to feedback. The class environment was very healthy and I believe the instructor facilitated this. He is also very much available outside of class, answers emails quickly, and seems like an excellent mentor. There was a lot of engagement outside of class and provided great feedback for paper ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The key strength of the course was David Engerman, who is a very warm and dedicated teacher. Discussions benefited greatly from his patience, insight, and generosity. Structurally, the course's main strengths are its broad scope and consistent attention to the works as vehicles for thinking about historiographical practice. The book review component was also a nice touch, as it broadened discussions and helped us better engage with the historiographical context within which the main work was embedded. Discussions were lively and fun, though at times they felt a little unfocused. \r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, my main qualm was that the syllabus felt a little methodologically limited. Cultural history is certainly ascendant in diplomatic history, and should rightly constitute the lion's share of the readings. However, the relative lack of other methodological approaches left me wondering about where the limits of a cultural approach are, and--equally importantly--what kinds of problems cultural history solves with other methodological approaches. Being forced to work through less familiar historiographical strategies might have driven home the course's refrain about sourcing and its limitations; it also might have driven discussions deeper.\r\n\r\nUltimately, however, this \"weakness\" is more of a quibble than a real issue with the class. It was an excellent seminar that significantly advanced all of our professional development and instilled a real sense of community within the group.. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to others. It is really solid class for thinking about 20th and 21st century US history, and we read some very useful texts in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone studying 20th century American history. Although the readings are mainly focused on U.S. foreign relations history, the study of U.S. empire can also prove productive for people primarily interested in domestic affairs. Many of the books we read this semester really changed the way I think about U.S. foreign policy and American empire. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course provides a good base for understanding the US and the world. It is useful for students across multiple subfields, which in turn generates interesting conversations with multiple regional perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it exposes students to important recent scholarship on the topic of US empire, but Professor Engerman is also a great instructor. "
