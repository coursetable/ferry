            "\u00a0A fantastic course, I would say this course didn't teach us how to write, it taught us how to communicate. We learned that the goals of a writer are to delight the reader with excitement, surprise, zeugma  to make them feel and think differently. ",
            "\u00a0I think my writing improved a lot in this course. I love that this class had us write about things that we actually care about; I got to reflect a lot on the interesting people and experiences in my life that are worth writing about. I also really enjoyed reading and discussing other essays, both from famous writers and from students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what it means to really go through an editing process in this class. I realized that what I view as a final draft from internal revision can always be drastically improved by comments from other readers. This class taught me to take advantage of office hours, residential college writing tutors, and any other opportunities available to get my work read by another set of eyes. I learned that editing from rough first drafts can often require more time than the initial writing. I also learned that copying the style of great writers can teach you to write in a way not much else can. Learning to read great essays from a writing student's perspective was a pleasure. ",
            "\u00a0Write goodly! ",
            "\u00a0I think I seriously improved my writing and felt myself become more imaginative and thoughtful about my experiences and how to translate them creatively. I think the class's emphasis on revision was incredibly useful, and I could feel myself working hard to make every sentence as good as it could be. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to pay attention to the words I use, to think about more than just essay structure, and to listen to myself as I write. As a whole, I think I learned how to become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insights on how to write betterspecifically, how to make my writing surprising and delighting, how to use writing as a mode of thinking, how to make my writing both surprising and inevitable, and how to write for a wide audience. ",
            "\u00a0This course absolutely strengthened my writing skills and ability to read closely. I gained a greater appreciation for the art of writing and different techniques that writers may use. ",
            "\u00a0How to properly read and analyze various modern essays, as well as how to take part in greater conversations even while being suppressed with our writing. ",
            "\u00a0You get to really develop your essential writing and argumentation skills. This course is, I think, intended for students who can already write somewhat well, but it could also function as an excellent introduction to writing the kinds of essays that appear in the Atlantic or New Yorker. ",
            "\u00a0I leaned SO MUCH in this class and my writing improved more than it ever has in such a short period of time. It changed the way I read too, not just the way I write. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how to closely read written works with an eye towards craft, the writer's intentionality, and rhetoric. I learned to identify skills in writing and got a chance to apply those skills to my own works through the five essays we wrote during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to become a much better writer through this class by examining model essays. Now, I can write artfully and have fun with my writing. I feel like I've gained enough knowledge of it to start making artistic choices in what I do. At first, I was just hoping to become a more fluid writer, but looking back, I've gained that and so much more. "

            "\u00a0A lot of strengths for this course, I loved all the different readings we did and all of the assignments were conducive to learning and enjoyable in one way or another. The professor was engaging, lively, and spontaneous and made me excited for 1:00 pm on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The only real weakness of the course was that it was difficult to keep one syllabus/schedule on hand because our teacher kept handing us out a new or revised schedule every other week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is engaging and well structured. The individual feedback received when discussing drafts was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well designed and engaging course, I learned a lot and would not have it change.d ",
            "\u00a0It is an incredibly strong course -- it is very fun and exciting to read these wonderful essays (especially in the mindset of writing) and exciting to write. I found the majority of the essays felt natural and fun for me. Weakness-wise, I sometimes wish I could revise more (like have two rounds of revising) and really get my essays places I wanted them to be. I think, as with all ENGL120 courses, the very specific prompts sometimes lead to slightly 'forced' essays, where I was trying to fulfil what they wanted and therefore occasionally forced my conclusion, but I see how this is both a strength and a weakness, because the focused prompts made us write different and specific essays. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the workshop format, the extremely reasonable workload, the insightful comments of Prof. Ehrgood on all drafts and revisions, and his teaching style. For me, there aren't really any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths; you learn a lot!! And you get a lot of feedbackfrom meetings with Andrew, form in class workshops, and from writing tuyos. \r\n\r\nWeaknessess: its a pretty good formula I cant think of any ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is structured extremely well, and I have few complaints. The only major change I'd like to see is less frontloading of the reading material; the workload was extremely heavy during reading period and much less so during times when I could have handled the material better. Other than that, I think the pace of the course was not too intense, but just enough to be engaging and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class!! Wouldnt change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include its impeccably built curriculumI think all the essays were fascinating, and the pacing of the writing was challenging but reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that we were given an entire course packet with not very much instructed pacing in terms of when to have the readings done. It would have been helpful to know exactly when to have read which essay, so that I could have been more prepared for class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the set up of alternating the study of model essays with writing our own essays/workshopping classmates' essays worked so well. It gave me a good frame of reference for how to start my own essay. Also having two weeks of studying a type of essay (reading model essays and our classmates'), I feel like I had gained a skill set that was necessary to get my writing to the high level that it got to. Specifically with Professor Ehrgood, having essays three and four being graded as drafts with the chance of a rewrite was very helpful--it allowed me enough time to do my best work. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this course to anyone. I am a CS major and I had so much fun with this course. Do not be afraid to take it even if it's credit D/Fail, you will not regret having so much fun with writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really only took this class because I needed a WR credit, but I ended up really enjoying it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class. If you can, take it with Ehrgood. I have never had an instructor go through the details of my essays like Professor Ehrgood did. I think I am a much better writer because of all of the great individual feedback I received. This class is challenging. You have to dedicate time to it. If you don't, you won't get anything out of it and probably won't do very well. If you do, you probably still won't get an A. No more than half of the students are supposed to get an A or A- and an A is reserved for work your professor would consider nominating for a prize. Don't worry about it. If you put in a lot of time and are already a good writer, you can probably get an A-, but that isn't what is important here. English 120 will help you grow as a writer and you will get to write about things you care about. English 120 essays are interesting, fun, and an exercise in creative argument. Don't waste your four years at Yale too scared to take classes like this because you are concerned about your gpa. If the format of English 120 appeals to you, take it! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to became a more effective, subtle, or interesting reader and writer of short works. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. It makes you a better writer but it's also just so fun. You learn about yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this course, especially with Prof. Ehrgood, to another student. It's one of the best classes that I've taken at Yale, and it will help you grow so much as a writer and also as a person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its tough but it makes you think about writing jn a totally new way. And ready your classmates essays is so fun! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you get Professor Ehrgood's section. He is amazing. I have never seen a teacher put as much effort into a class, and seeing him do that makes us want to do better too -- and we do! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely if the students are willing to put in the work, theyll get so much out of the class ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course helped me develop tremendously as a writer, and it facilitates learning of the English language in a way that I have never seen before. I would recommend this course to any student. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Even if you don't think you're interested in taking any English department courses, please consider this. Writing is essential to success in just about every discipline and field, and this course teaches you how to write at a high level. It will develop not only your vocabulary and general ability to craft a good essay, but it will improve your communication and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0100% would recommend to any student of any major ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone and everyone. The skills you can take away from 120 are not just applicable to those interested in reading and writing. Their relevance spans all disciplines and fields. There is not a single Yale College student who wouldn't benefit from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I would recommend this course to anyone going through Yale. It was inspiring to feel in control of my own writing. These skills will help me throughout my time here at Yale. Also, its just a fun course if you enjoy reading and analyzing essays. I had never written creatively before this class and I found it also to be such a fun and engaging challenge. "
