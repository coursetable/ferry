You learn about functions of three variables, planar approximations, vector calculus (including Green's, Gauss's, and Stoke's theorems), and everything else in a multivariable calc class. If you're deciding between MATH 120 and ENAS 151, I would say to think if you want to take linear algebra: if yes, I would suggest MATH 120; but if you do not plan to take linear algebra, then ENAS 151 is a great alternative. The final is not cumulative, but the exams are very difficult. The lectures are deceiving with Vidvuds Ozolins: they're easy, but the exams are unnecessarily difficult. The lowest 3 pset grades are dropped, and the lowest quarter of the pre-lecture quizzes are dropped, not to mention your lowest to highest midterm scores receive 15%, 20%, and 25% weighting, respectively. However, THERE IS NO CURVE. Do not expect a curve in this class: only if the entire class failed an exam would Ozolins change the score, and he only added 10 points. ",

There are no peer tutors and the TAs are not very helpful. The psets are very long. Meet during reading period and had pset due on the friday after reading period. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the professor's personality. Weaknesses: the tests were WAY more difficult than what we did in class so I always felt unready. Also, it was extremely annoying that over half the class had already taken multivariable calc so not only did they completely kill the curve on every exam, but it also made it seem as though who did poorly in the class did not know what was going on. When in reality, people were only doing so well because they had seen the material before. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that there was reading to do before each class, but having a short quiz on the material before we learned it in class was frustrating for the harder topics. It was great to have 3 equally weighted exams because there was less pressure, and psets counted for more of the grade than they do in 120, which really puts an emphasis on effort and practice. We moved pretty quickly at the end, so perhaps the first few topics could be condensed. I think that this class could be more structured because it often felt like we were just deciding how the class would be run as we went along. ",

More than half of the class had already taken multi variable calculus in high school and those who did not were easily left behind. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include learning multivariable calculus, but the weaknesses overcome the strengths significantly. This class is a lecture course, and although I learned some topics in lecture, the lectures did not sufficiently prepare me for the exams. I had already taken multivariable calculus before (with passing grades), but this class was still difficult for me. The professor (Vidvuds Ozolins) was helpful when you went to office hours, but he seemed too arrogant on his exams: specifically, he would laugh or be humble when he made his tests to hard. He though it was a compliment that we felt miserable over the difficulty of the tests. I think if the test were less hard or if the lectures and the psets prepared us more for the exams, the class would be better (although you would still have to do a lot of work: one pset was 30 questions and took hours).

He will be patient with you and is dedicated to helping student learn!\r\n\r\nI really learned the most when we had the kahoots during class. Please bring those back. I learned so much better and I was very engaged in class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class was overall pretty strong. It is nice to be taught the math, with consideration for what we will be doing with it later. I also thought doing Kahoot! In class made it much more interesting and made it easier to remain engaged, as when we were just doing problems on the board it was easy to lose concentration ",

            "\u00a0This is difficult material and a lot to cram into one semester, but this class was well structured and the problem sets were very effective at helping me learn to actually use what we learned in class. Kahoot was definitely a strength of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were not helpful, exams were very difficult. A nice curve in the end but overall a stressful class ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material was interesting, but I wish that going over problems in class had been more solving problems together rather than having the answers written up on the board. I felt like solutions were often given in place of methodology. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ozolins was very good at keeping the lectures interesting. I enjoyed coming to class even when I didn't understand all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course format was a little tough to keep up with; we were expected to have essentially taught ourselves beforehand, and then were treated to a slideshow that reviewed the content at breakneck speed.  Later on, we switched to doing problems in class, but these were always far easier than what we might be expected to complete on an exam.  We came closer to hitting our stride towards the end, when we would focus on doing a few hard problems our on the board instead of flying through some slides.  In the end, I feel like most of the learning I had was form the textbook, with classes serving to solidify some concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved if the professor attempted to teach as if he were first learning the math all over again. He jumped way too fast over things and didn't explicitly describe how to do things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course was very lenient with grading (main focus was to learn the content)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We changed our lecture style three different times, which was annoying to keep up with. Additionally, I think the professor focused too much on the theory and not the actual way we should solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0Very good professor with a willingness to help students. A little too much learning from the book with not much explanation in class. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest problem with this course was it's supposedly \"flipped classroom setup,\" though other flipped classes I've taken -- such as Math 115--have video lectures that are supposed to teach you the material before class. The idea with this class, however, was that you would just read the book before class and just KNOW everything from that. This was then used as an excuse to rush through material in class, instead of explaining things at a level that could be understood by those who don't already know the material, even though reading the book before class is just a normal expectation of any class, and any good teacher would still teach that material during class. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is very open to adjusting the class and lecture style to best suite the needs and preferences of the students. ",
            "\u00a0Good course for people who have taken multivariable calculus before. For those who haven't, you'll really have to work at it. I like how we are given physical interpretation for the mathematical concepts we learn. This really sets this course apart from Math 120. ",
            "\u00a0It covers a large amount of material throughout multivariable calc. I liked that even though the class was larger than the average 120 class, it had fewer students in total which made it kind of less stressful. I think a weakness is that the class has to move so fast that the material is not covered in depth during class, so a lot of work outside of class is required if you don't get the concepts right away. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the first 23 or so lectures, the professors preferred method of teaching included PowerPoint, and in-class Kahoot for a few of the last lectures. In my opinion this is a core weakness of the course, simply because the pace of the course is only accelerated by presentations of the already difficult subject. Many times I found myself confused and even lost during lecture because the information was being presented at such a fast pace that I did not have enough time to process what the professor was saying, even after having read the necessary sections in the book the night before. I believe that most mathematics, especially a subject as hard as multivariable calculus, should be taught in a traditional manner, with the professor writing on a board and explaining the topic to the class as he goes along. Simply projecting the images and example problems from the textbook onto a screen and calling it a lecture is a very ineffective method of instruction; in order for students to perform well in the class, they should be given multiple viewpoints on the same topic to maximize understanding. Kahoot practice problems in class, although engaging, did very little in enhancing my understanding of the material. Often times the timer on the screen placed a great deal of pressure on the students to guess and submit an answer for the sake of getting a chance to garner some points and rise on the leaderboard. Lecture shouldnt be made to feel like a competition, regardless of intent. \r\n\r\nStrengths of this class include the comfortable setting and opportunities to seek extra help during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very much the professor reading off of slides that took straight of the text book and little explanation about the topics outside of the book. in class he read off of slides for an hour then we watched him do problems for the second half of class where he would explain every question using words as \"obviously\" and \"easily\" not catering to students who have not already seen this material before. Only after the first half of the semester did he start using interactive problems that were very trivial and helped little with the PSETs and tests. There were little resources and the TAs often were not helpful for the problem sets. The solutions for extra problems were rarely posted and if they were posted at all they were not in a timely manner. This class needs to do more that just repeat everything we already read in the book and explain things we read further especially if there were any confusions (which there often was). ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course is that some first year students have already taken this course before, and some students haven't. Therefore, there are many differences, people that can follow the class better, and  some other people that struggle more. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. I liked the order in which topics were presented, and the abundance of challenging practice problems. I would have liked slightly more time spent on the underlying conceptseven \"engineers and physicists\" can sometimes enjoy mathbut that's a personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be very confusing in terms of what to expect. The material itself wouldn't be terrible if it had a decent teacher, which I hear is hit or miss. The tests seemed to be of a whole other level relative to the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes a few of the integral types got a little muddled together in my mind. It would have been nice to see some sort of interactive or applied component, even at the expense of covering some material. "

I would STRONGLY recommend taking Math 120 instead. You do very few applications to engineering problems, the workload is greater, the curve is worse, the psets are longer, and there are fewer TAs. I was tempted because more of your grade comes from psets than in math 120, but the psets are so impossible that this doesn't even help anyways. The class is taught absolutely awfully: its supposedly structured as \"flipped classroom,\" but all that meant was you were supposed to read the book before class - which is pretty reasonable for any class - but the UNREASONABLE part is this was then used as an excuse to merely quickly glance over material in class with little to no explanation, followed by a lots of examples that really only involved writing down the problem giving the class a minute, and then writing down the answer. Most of the semester was taught either through powerpoint of math or endless Kahoot problems that only the same 7 people who took multi in high school get right. I hated this class, There were several occasions where I asked questions in class because I didn't understand something, and he would simply say something like \"Isn't it obvious?\" and continue. I left this class literally crying on multiple occasions, and it was by far the hardest class I have taken at Yale, and no, I'm not a freshman. Save yourself the pain and take math 120, this class just isn't worth it. ",

If you haven't taken multi before, expect to read and do the pre-lectures to understand the concepts. Psets are a fun challenge and make you think. However, if you've taken multi before, expect to learn some but not a whole lot from this course. ",

I liked the more personal feel than I think that you would get with 120, just because their are fewer students in total. Like I said though, I think that this class, if you don't have any prior knowledge of multivariable calc, this class can be really tough to grasp, so it will require a lot of additional work to grasp concepts and get a solid understanding. The lectures move fast because they have to cover a lot of material, so if you don't do anything outside of class a lot of the lecture material will fly past. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who seek a larger lecture class than those offered in Math 120 for the chance to form study groups with more people. Aside from that, I would not recommend this course as an alternative to Math 120. My suite mates who were enrolled in Math 120 seemingly were not as stressed about multivariable calculus than I was although they agreed that it was a difficult subject. To my surprise I never learned the difference between ENAS 151 and Math 120 aside from the titles of the courses. The problem sets in ENAS 151 took on average (at least for me and a few friends) anywhere between 10-14 hours of pure work to complete, whereas my friends enrolled in Math 120 never complained about the amount of time it took for them to complete their weekly problem sets.
