            "\u00a0How to actively read and discuss texts involving various conceptions of the future. ",
            "\u00a0I think I got a much better idea for the concept of futurity in literature in this class. Through all of the science fiction we read this semester, I got a deeper appreciation for how we as human beings tend to think about the future, and how that has changed over the course of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0This class delved pretty deeply into the futurist movement and how various authors (and movies and other media) has visualized the future from past to present. The skills were primarily in synthesizing common themes across various works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about science fiction and futurist literature. I also learned the steps to write a well-thought-out research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better idea of the types/styles of science fiction (both books and movies) that are out there, and how they have evolved. ",
            "\u00a0Some understanding of \"futurism,\" post-modernism, read a bunch of cool books, saw some interesting art. Was the first time I had prepared an annotated bibliography, so was also a good intro to how to properly write a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course, like most Yale English courses, helped me improve my writing skills immensely. Specifically, we wrote extensive annotated bibliographies as a graded assignment, which I had never had to do for a class before. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, we take a look at a wide variety of (mainly science fictional) texts that engage with the ideas of time and the future. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths is the format and class discussion. Weaknesses are the length of time dedicated to each book and the speed of the course in gnerral ",
            "\u00a0I don't think that there were any real weaknesses to this class. Overall, I think everyone was engaged in our discussions, and Professor Williams did a great job leading discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the reading list is incredible and Prof. Williams is a very engaging and caring person. However, the format of the class is not truly like a seminar in which students drive the discussion, but was instead often ping-pong between student to Prof. Williams to another student and Prof. Williams again. Prof. Williams definitely has lots of great information to share, but did not give everyone in the class the opportunity to assert their thoughts and explore their questions. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is incredible and the class material is very interesting. I enjoyed every class. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course are generally very fun and varied, and provided a nice break from other courses (with the possible exception of a few towards the end, e.g. those involving scenario planning -- I think short excerpts would have worked equally well). It was also a nice break to have movies assigned occasionally, and to go to the YUAG one class. The professor's clear enthusiasm and knowledgeability about the content is also a strength, and the format of having papers \"due\" on one day, then able to be turned in for real after peer review, was genius, and extremely helpful.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was pretty disappointed by the class discussions, which often ended up consisting mostly of who liked what book and why. We got off-topic quite a lot, and by the end I still didn't really have a good sense of what unified all the readings, or what to take away from it. The \"future\" is such an incredibly broad concept; I think the class would have benefitted from having more targeted discussions, with specific future-related questions as prompts. In one class, we looked at some excerpts from another book, and then spoke in groups about how to answer a few questions; this was a really effective format, and I wish we had had that kind of structure for more classes.\r\n\r\nFinally, I was a little nervous throughout about all of our assignments revolving around one hidden text. I think assigning reading responses every other week (or something like that) would have alleviated a lot of that stress, and also made class discussions a lot deeper and more interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fairly good syllabus. Most of the later books were fun to read (Lathe of Heaven, Three-Body Problem, Empire Star). The assignments were a pretty interesting idea (argue for the inclusion of another text in the syllabus).\r\nWeaknesses: Other parts of the syllabus were terrible. I understand that some inclusions that I disliked (Wells's The Time Machine) were important and necessary to the genre, but other inclusions (the movie The Time Travelers, another bad movie [literally a B-movie] called The Day the Earth Exploded [spoiler: the earth doesn't actually explode], some full length documentary about the son of the guy who came up with the many-worlds interpretation, a long reading from a drug-addled physicist, a crappy book called When Worlds Collide) seemed pretty lame and useless. Class periods weren't really discussions (which was sometimes good because Prof. Williams always had interesting things to say). Lot of time spent on stuff that I didn't really enjoy: we all presented our final papers, taking up three class periods, we watched animations of the Julia set to \"learn about fractals,\" long videos of Terence McKenna who basically just ranted about LSD. When we did have discussions, they often devolved into inane comments about time travel, one guy just dropped pop culture references, too many white acapella boys monopolizing the time (when it wasn't them, it was a bunch of people who hadn't actually read trying to score points). ",
            "\u00a0The main attractions of this course are Professor Williams' teaching style and the course's unique and amazing syllabus. There are books and movies that aren't included in any other class at Yale, and Professor Williams is a gem of a pedagog. If the course has any weaknesses, they are primarily that the syllabus is so rich that some of the works we read are relegated to only one session of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class keeps a brisk pace to keep up with all the texts we cover, but it is well worth it because they are all great. Class discussions tend to have a good focus, and I only wish we had more time to have freeform discussion. The biggest strength of this class is the flexibility we have in choosing our \"missing text\" for the final paper. Professor Williams encourages students to find a text that interests them, which helps to make the writing assignments fun instead of a chore. The fact that each assignment builds on the last is an added benefit  when the time comes to write the final paper, most of the research will have already been completed. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone remotely interested in science fiction who wants to spend their semester reading and discussing thought provoking books with a passionate and well informed professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to other students if they are at all interested in critically examining science fiction, or have an interest in science fiction in general. Professor R. John Williams leads each class through enjoyable discussion over a variety of sci-fi canon, and picks books and essays that are enjoyable to read outright. ",
            "\u00a0The class is worth taking as a chill fifth class. The readings are super interesting and Prof. Williams has lots of information to share. The writing portion is basically one big paper, with an outline and an annotated bibliography preceding it. Be prepared to feel like you're kind of in a lecture class and not a seminar and Prof. Williams does tend to share a lot of information that may cut into time for student-led discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic writing credit, especially if you want to read interesting science fiction novels and theorize about the future. The professor is amazing and brings so much life to the class. The workload is also very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are largely science fiction and so pretty fun, and the content is generally cool. The workload also isn't too bad, and Professor Williams is really enthusiastic about this stuff. However, class discussions were not extremely enlightening, so I would only hesitantly recommend it to another student, with the hope that they improve in future years. ",
            "\u00a0Meh. The best part of this course was the reading list, but you could knock that out in a couple weeks no sweat, and also be able to skip the bad movies and boring books. DEFINITELY READ The Lathe of Heaven, Empire Star, and The Three-Body Problem (Foundation is, well, foundational, so if you're into Sci-fi maybe read that, too). If you want to take a course where you'll read/watch some stuff for class, listen to the professor talk about some interesting things, sit through a few terrible class discussions, and write a few easy things, take this course. If you want to take a course with a good syllabus and have good discussions, make a book club and do it yourself.\r\nThis course IS a writing credit for not that much work, but your writing will 100% not improve for any other reason than you have written more (feedback is sparse). ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely wonderful course! Professor Williams is so funny and smart, class will go by so fast because discussions are so great. The reading list is amazing and very entertaining. Definitely a great way to get a WR if that's what you need (which is why I took it and I definitely did not regret it). The only real work other than reading is working up to a big final paper, but although it's kind of lengthy, it is a fun paper to write and there are steps to work up to it. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class that covers a wide range of topics. A really knowledgeable group of students elected to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Regardless of what your major is, you should absolutely take this course. Professor Williams is one of the most interesting instructors at Yale, and you'll never find another class with a syllabus or reading list as varied, compelling, or unique as this one. There are short stories, fiction, non-fiction, sci-fi films, and some of the most fun and exciting novels of the 20th and 21st century. Give it a shot even if you have no interest in English, because it's super duper fun and enriching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; this class is a great excuse to read tons of science fiction and have interesting discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take this class!! I wouldnt say its a gutty writing credit because you do have to put in work for the writing assignments, but Professor Williams is FANTASTIC! he is super fun and always has great things to say about the readings. "
