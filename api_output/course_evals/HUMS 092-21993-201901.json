            "\u00a0A really thorough understanding of divine law in all its incarnations. Got an introduction to a ton of philosophers I'm sure I'll see again in other religious studies and poly-sci courses. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! Ive never really spent time learning about religion and this class presented it in a wya that felt accessible and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0We were able to analyze religious primary and secondary documents, piece together an intellectual timeline of theories and apply those ideas to the present ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to different religious, philosophical, and legal theories on law throughout history especially pertaining to Hellenistic and Judeo-Christian histories. In reading different philosophers, I developed skills of analysis and critical reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop a general sense of the evolution of religion and religious ideas. More generally, this class showed me how to track an idea (whether religious or not) through history. It was also good at developing close reading skills and at understanding the ideas of major thinkers who have contributed to a canon of thought. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an overview of how the notion of divine law evolves in Christianity and Judaism, under the influence of the Greek philosophers. Critical thinking and close reading of primary texts are emphasized and practiced. I started to think about what religion means to people and how it sheds light on the relationship between man and the world. "

            "\u00a0Professor Hayes is a wonderful instructor. The reading materials are fascinating and class is incredibly engaging. The only weakness I can think of is that it was very hard to tell where you were in the class grade-wise for virtually the entire course because most of the grade hinges on a final paper. That being said, she's very happy to work with you on the final paper to make sure you produce a strong final draft. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hayes is brilliant and so excited about the subject. Will warn interested students though that this is less of a seminar and more of a smaller lecture most classes. Not much opportunity for discussion, although that got better later in the year. ",
            "\u00a0NO weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Longer time to complete the final research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Its very very reading heavy and you need to be on top of your workload in order to participate in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in that it exposed me to a whole new side of religion and law that Ive never seen before. I read so many new philosophers. It was also great to be able to analyze historical traditions and see similarities in the modern and secular worlds. The format was great too, with Professor Hayes leading the classes and students expanding on the readings. I do wish there was a little more discussions among the students about our opinions on the philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- students who take it have internal motivation, don't need to be forced to read\r\nWeaknesses- some students have different levels of participation ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging material, very organized, interesting readings, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: not much of a discussion ",
            "\u00a0The selection of reading for this course is truly amazing, especially when the texts from different sources start to talk to each other. The classroom discussion is definitely one of the highest quality among all the courses I have taken at Yale. It is facilitated in a humane and intellectually challenging way. It might improve by cutting some of the readings, as there was never enough time for us to fully digest each piece. "

            "\u00a0I couldn't recommend this course more. It's such an incredible opportunity to be able to take a course with Professor Hayes, especially as a freshman. If she's teaching it and you can get in, you should absolutely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone vaguely interested in either law or religion should definitely take this course. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely. ",
            "\u00a0Would highly recommend this course, as someone who is religious it was very eye opening and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in law, religion, or philosophy, this is a fantastic introductory course. Professor Hayes is an excellent teacher and you will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting topic, a great way to learn about it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I found the ideas we discussed fascinating. The readings could be long at times, but were very interesting, so it was not usually not difficult to complete them. The only thing I would say is this class is a leminar format with Professor Hayes sort of lecturing most of the time, so if you want a discussion class that's not what this is. Having said that, I think the format of the class was very well done. She is so knowledgeable about the topic that I preferred to hear her talk about it than to hear other students talk about it, and she would take the time to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend it to the fullest extent. A truly enlightening course that challenges preconceived perceptions of religion and inspires the way I think about many aspects of life. "
