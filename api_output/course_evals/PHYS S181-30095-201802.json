            "\u00a0Quantum mechanic, electric fields and magnetic fields, Guass' law and Maxwell's equations ",
            "\u00a0I gained a genuine appreciation for physics. Marco really focuses on concepts and on teaching you to fundamentally understand how electromagnetic fields work. It is the opposite of a typical \"plug-and-chug\" intro STEM class. I improved my quantitative reasoning substantially. ",
            "\u00a0Applications of calculus (it made the concepts of Math 120 much more understandable since it was real world applications), gaining insight on problem solving and quantitative reasoning. Visualizations in 3-D. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the mechanics of electric and magnetic fields, and the experimental bases of charge forces and currents. I also learned how to quantify currents and circuits in terms of the fields surrounding them. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of some concepts that regulate physical principles. I learned how to solve classic problems related to these concepts. "

        [
            "\u00a0Well taught, caring, engaging professor if you get prof. Marco, small class size so more opportunities to ask questions (if taking it over the summer). ",
            "\u00a0This class was a lot of work but I got so much out of it. It takes up a lot of time and Marco sometimes runs over. However, in general it was fantastic. The classroom in the CTL was absolutely freezing, which someone should change. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Content is extremely interesting and fun to learn!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I took this over the summer so the curriculum was very rushed, if you want the most from this class take it over the semester ",
            "\u00a0The strength was definitely the focus on field theory over circuits, and the focus on the experimental basis of these theories. I can't think of weaknesses within the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of material to be digested in an incredibly short period of time. The professor balanced this well by hearing concerns and going for depth rather than breadth which worked well and establish a great continuity. ",
            "\u00a0A huge strength of this class is Prof Bonett-Matiz. He is a super caring, patient professor and is always willing to listen to people's questions. The class felt intimate and very open to discussion.  I liked that this class overall prioritized \"depth\" over \"breadth.\" However, I felt that some aspects were super skimmed over and not talked about in depth at all. and I also feel as though some concepts that were talked about in depth weren't too important to the overall narrative of the class -- ie emphasis on vector math calculations, etc. It seemed like the heavy math things weren't relevant to our overall conceptual understanding and got in the way of learning other concepts fully ie optics and diffraction. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Marco is great and if you want to develop an intuition to physical concepts, this class should be able to help with that depending on how much you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as a pre-med I have taken a lot of intro STEM classes and Marco cares so much more than most other STEM professors about teaching non-majors. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course especially if it is being taught by Professor Bonett-Matiz again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! What I learned from this course changed the way I view the world (we did reflection activities throughout the class which really emphasized this) in a great way. Having the knowledge of this class was extremely helpful, especially since I had such a passionate professor (Marco) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, given how well theories were explained, anyone who requires science credit would get a lot out of this course, both in terms of engagement and information. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a non physics major this is the definitive way to take the course.  Marco taught the concepts in an approachable conceptual way that made it incredibly accessible. Discussion section and office hours then made the transition from this conceptual learning to the computational side seem very natural. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is interesting material and you won't ever get a classroom environment like the one Prof Bonett-Matiz creates. He welcomes any questions and cares so much about his students' learning. \r\n\r\nI would say don't take this course if you're just interested in getting it out of the way for a requirement. This class is about learning as much as you can and if you don't come to it with that attitude you won't get anything out of it. "
