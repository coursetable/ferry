I know it's unreasonable to expect a TF in such a small class (we had 4 students), but Smilga is intimidating and condescending (in the sense that he expects us to be smarter and is disappointed when we are not) so a TF would be really helpful for asking questions about the material.

Apply linear algebra, real analysis, and abstract algebra to the study of matrix Lie groups, which is a great way to review all of these subjects as you learn all sorts of new stuff. Very difficult class; do not take unless you are very prepared. Watch out for the final: it hits hard. "
