The midterm paper was about an extremely relevant political topic that I genuinely enjoyed writing and learning more about. ",

            "\u00a0Elli Stern is one of the best professors that I have had at Yale. He is so intelligent, so Jewish, so funny, so kind - he reminds me of the guy who's obsessed with Sigourney Weaver in Ghostbusters, I don't remember the name. He's so great - he made a class that could be dull (Jewish thought) into something alive and fascinating.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses? None. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. My only suggestion is that a \"no-technology\" policy would cause a dramatic increase in student engagement. ",
            "\u00a0The material is very interesting, but I felt the course structure to be inhospitable to learning. In effect, Professor Stern asked a series of intense questions to one to two assigned students per class about the readings. On your two days, you were placed on the spotlight and only really had to participate on those two days in the semester. I think a more balanced discussion would be helpful for student engagement and learning. Basically, this structure allows disengagement for 90% of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The class is super interesting but can often be a bit scattered. The final exam question was very out of nowhere and we were not prepared to answer it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that the information was very engaging and the class discussions were very stimulating. Professor Stern is really great and make class enjoyable. However, the instructions for assignments are quite vague. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class was always engaging and exciting. Professor Stern always provided great insight into the readings. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the days we completely ignored the readings for that class which could be disappointing if they were of interest. ",
            "\u00a0Elli Stern is completely brilliant. The course could be better as a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0It relied a lot on personal experience. At least many students prefaced their engagement with personal experience which is tough for nonJewish students. Well structured engaging class with an excellent professor otherwise ",
            "\u00a0I definitely think that the course should continue to be taught as a seminar - I know that it used to be a lecture, but I think that the class as a seminar is more conducive to deep and fascinating dialogue between the professor and students. Sometimes discussions can get sidetracked, which isn't ideal, but on the whole it's definitely a plus. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of times the discussion would veer away from the day's topics and into discussions of modern Jewish identity/American politics, which although while also very interesting, took away from some of Professor Stern's lecturing/explaining. I think the class could be improved by staying more on topic, but besides that it was a really great class. ",
            "\u00a0Stern is a great lecturer, and when he's talking you're never bored. He has interesting insights and is a hilarious guy. But I did feel that the class would often get bogged down in conversations that had more to do with students unpacking their own Jewish identities than unpacking the texts we were reading -- this was less of a problem at the beginning of the semester, but when we got to talking about American Judaism it became much more of an issue. ",
            "\u00a0The class structure was great.  As the readings were sometimes difficult or cumbersome, it was great that Prof Stern would summarize them at the beginning of class, and that a couple of students would specifically be responsible for the readings each class.  Discussions were great, and always interesting although they sometimes went off the rails a bit.  The style of assessment: two reading summaries, a midterm essay, and a final take home exam were also great and well suited to the class.  I do wish that Prof Stern was more available to talk after class. ",
            "\u00a0Main strengths were the instructor and the syllabus. I thought the readings were really interesting and well-chosenthey definitely cover a broad range of material, most of which was new to me. The instructor is engaging and does a great job of drawing out larger themes / relating the material to life today.\r\n\r\nI think the class discussion could have been better. We could have spent more time digging deeply into the readings themselves. I think there was a bit of a vicious cycle: we started to talk less about the readings => more students felt that they could get away with just drawing on their personal experiences and riffing on \"Jewish identity\" => fewer kids did the whole reading => the less we talked about the readings. Professor Stern could have helped guide the discussion back to the concrete. I think we sometimes ended up having similar discussions week after week, where there were too many platitudes about identity and current affairs (how much really needs to be said about the Pittsburg shooting or Jeremy Corbyn?) I liked what Professor Stern said in the first class about not wanting the class to explore broader themes and be relevant to current issues, rather than just running down a list of the 5 most famous Jewish philosophers and doing two weeks on each of them. But I would have like a little more traditional / academic / concrete discussion of the thinkers themselves. \r\n\r\nFor example: the midterm a difficult and ultimately not very educational exercise. It was too broad of a question to actually answer with any depth or certainty, and too disconnected from the work we had been doing in class. I didn't feel that it was very academic. In contrast, the take-home final was excellent. The questions were interesting and I learned a ton from answering them, even though I just used readings we had already been assigned. Even though the first question (about Baldwin) drew on broader themes, the question was still specific and grounded in the texts. I wish the class discussions were a bit more like the final and a bit less like the midterm.\r\n\r\nLast thing: I think having 23 instead of 17 actually does make a difference in student engagement and the quality of the discussion. Next time I would not signal in the first class that the workload will be light (that \"we'll try to do as much work as possible in the classroom\") even if it will be, because it will encourage kids to prioritize other classes when they have to (which is always) and the quality of the discussion will suffer.

            "\u00a0Yep. For Elli. Elli makes Jewish thought interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A good Cr/D class if you're interested in getting a feel for JDST without doing much work. Professor Stern is cool, quirky, funny, and very knowledgeable. Class discussions can ramble and wander a good deal, but they're usually quite interesting (especially if you're Jewish  makes you reflect a lot). It may be intimidating if you have no experience in JDST and are not a humanities person, because people come in with a lot of background knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No. The course itself is interesting, but unfortunately the professor makes the course an unpleasant experience. While being passionate about the material, Professor Stern picks clear favorites and if you are not one of the Elli-chosen, good luck. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an engaging class on Jewish thought yes, but if you want a more in-depth discussion it is probably not the best class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I learned a lot and the class discussions never disappointed me. I looked forward to this class every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the class was fun, engaging, and not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great learning opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0If you were interested in the development of Jewish identity absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. If Jewish history or Jewish thought interests you, this class will definitely be worth your time. You will learn a lot, and your grasp of the history and ideas of critical thinkers will be greatly enhanced. Going in to the class, I knew some basics about some important thinkers like Mendelssohn, but I really didn't have an appreciation for how his ideas impacted others and the overall Jewish community, as well as what critics and supporters argued. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The class room environment was wonderful and the readings were extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the topic, then yes! I'd be careful if you already know a lot about the subjects in the syllabus because then it might get a little stale for you. Either way, Prof. Stern is a fantastic seminar leader and it's a very fun class to look forward to. ",
            "\u00a0Depends what you're looking for -- and who's taking it that semester. If you're looking to read some interesting and important texts in a class that doesn't demand too much of you and where you'll get a pretty easy A, definitely take it. If you want a course that'll change your life, this might not be it. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course.  As a Jewish American this course was invaluable in understanding the religious organizations and culture that I grew up in.  The readings and discussions were incredibly interesting and personally relevant.  As a non Jew one could certainly benefit from understanding more about the constructs of citizenship and ethnicity in Europe and the US, and the history of zionism and how it has been conceived very differently throughout time and by different scholars and advocates. ",
            "\u00a0I would particularly recommend the class to three kinds of students:\r\n1. those who don't already spend a lot of their time thinking about Jewish identity, Zionism, antisemitism, assimilation, etc.\r\n2. those who have the self-motivation to do all the readings even when they don't have to and might want to pursue these topics outside of class (e.g. for a senior essay)\r\n3. those who want a mind-expanding but not particularly time consuming 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes especially if interested in jewish studies. 100/100. "
