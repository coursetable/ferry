            "\u00a0I developed my musical theatre writing skills in a fun, relaxed, and honest setting! ",
            "\u00a0I gained additional tools and insights for writing music for the theatre and thinking about the art of songwriting. Assignments were diverse enough to help me practice a good variety of skills that might be useful in a writing career. ",
            "\u00a0Scott Frankel's insight is really continuously inexpendably valuable. Take his course! ",
            "\u00a0i wrote some songs and learned a lot about musical theater in the process ",
            "\u00a0Getting yourself on a regular composing schedule is one of the best things you can do for yourself as a composer. You will gain invaluable practice writing in the genre. The diversity of Scott's assignments consistently forces you to break your habits and refine your voice as both a composer and lyricist. Because the class is workshop driven, you will be exposed to your classmates' work, and your classmates will give feedback on yours. Having a literal captive audience to present your work to is a great way to see firsthand how others respond to and connect with it. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper perspectives on the craft of composing for character and scene. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was a fantastic teacher. I loved his beginning lecture on opening numbers. I also got a good deal out of the roundtable discussion. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Scott Frankel! Hes a brilliant songwriter with a tremendous amount of experience in the industry. I cant speak to the course beyond its association with Scott because, having taken MUSI 314, its 100% different each time it is offered based on who is teaching it (e.g., Jeanine Tesoris version of the class was also wonderful, but much more intense and with a greater workload). ",
            "\u00a0Writing a song a week is tough, but the number of people in the course allowed us to present every other week so that occasionally we had more time. ",
            "\u00a0the course had a wonderful tiny feel -- just talented songwriters around a table taking turns sharing material. Writing songs is tough (obviously) so it was really nice that SF had a lot of flexibility with assignments (sharing projects, writing something fresh, having a theme of some sort). Weakness is that it ended all too soon. ",
            "\u00a0If I had to nitpick, I'd say the only weakness of this course was a lack of a set syllabus or structure. But the course has so many strengths that you'll barely mind the spontaneity or last minute nature of assignments. Of course, the heart of the experience is Scott himself. Assignments are time consuming yet highly rewarding. There will be late Thursday nights spent in the practice rooms, and sometimes you may wonder what you were thinking the next morning after three hours of sleep, but you will never feel penalized if your work isn't as good as you would've hoped. If anything, it's a chance to identify methods of improvement the next time around. ",
            "\u00a0There should have been fewer students in the class. It would have been nice to have closer, detail-level criticism of each composition from Scott, and I think this would have been more possible with about 2-3 fewer students in the class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Scott Frankel does a fantastic job of creating a kind and supportive environment where students of varied interests and strengths can grow as composers. I definitely recommend this course to songwriters and composers looking to be challenged with fun assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Dont miss a chance to study with Scott Frankel. Beyond his incredible experience and expertise, hes an extremely kind person and will likely become a lifelong contact and resource. If Jeanine is teaching it (Ive taken it with her too) and you get in, you MUST take it. She will change your life. Scotts version of the course is much less intense than Jeanines, but is still absolutely worthwhilehe brings a unique perspective to the art of songwriting (a more traditional one in comparison to Jeanine), and a relaxed atmosphere to the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for getting practice writing songs and as incentive to work on your own stuff! ",
            "\u00a0If you love to write music, this is a great course to... write music! If you're not a musical theater aficionado, you will still be welcomed with open arms. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The course is extremely rewarding. If you have never studied MT composition in a formal setting, this will be a transformative experience for you. You will be consistently inspired by your classmates' work (and if you're lucky, Scott will play you his wonderful music as well). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you are interested in songwriting in any capacity, there simply exists no greater option at Yale for developing your craft with some of the best artists in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! I think many YSM students would benefit greatly from this class "
