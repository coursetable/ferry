            "\u00a0I learned how to memorize tons of facts and probably way too many specific details about experimental studies and how to properly write thirty short essays within a week involving all of those concepts, all while trying to study for the rest of my finals and get a reasonable amount of sleep. If any of this information stays with me after this semester is over, then I guess I'll be a walking history book for developmental psychology experiments, so that's good, I guess...? ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the developmental process and how we can study the development of children in order to better understand ourselves. The class also gives you the opportunity to craft a research paper, proposing an experimental study that you could potentially follow through with in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how and why children think and act the way they do--it was really insightful and opened my eyes up to a new field that I had never really thought about before! ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a good foundation in developmental psychology, as well as in experimental design. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a good base of knowledge in developmental psychology. Learned about a lot of experiments involving young kids. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about psychology during development and gave a lot of insight. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the developmental trajectory of human infants. Professor Keil was extremely knowledgable on the subject matter and could deliver so much information to our class. I learned about different capacities that infants have at specific ages as well as how researchers can best go about trying to create studies that can reveal this sort of information. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about how children develop in each of the areas of psychology. This class is very comprehensive and covers a lot of information and research, so you learn a lot about the field of Developmental Psychology and what sort of research is being done right now to contribute to the field.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Keil is an effective lecturer and makes the material interesting. I really do like what we learned in this class, and I believe the field of developmental psychology is immensely important, but...\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: ...the exams are too much. Full stop. There is no reason why we should be expected to spend hours every night for a week combing through the textbook for minute details about experiments that we would never be expected to have committed to memory after the exam anyway. Dedicating part of each exam to these essays would be fine, or maybe even doing the whole exam like this but releasing 15 possible questions instead of 30. But 30 in a week only serves to stress everyone out and make them resent the course more than they would had they not had so much pressure put on them. There are more ways to get students to engage with the material than this. ",
            "\u00a0This class has a very set and predictable structure. The only confusing aspect of the course was that the syllabus does not put due dates in chronological order. Otherwise, I do like that the exam questions are given ahead of time to prepare the best answer, and the effort you put into the class results directly with the grade you receive. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Keil is a fantastic lecturer and the textbook that he wrote for the course was a great help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-go over many areas of psychology\r\n-different types of assessments: debate responses, research paper, midterm, and final (which do end up being a lot towards the end if you don't pace yourself)  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I wish we could have focused more on adolescent and even adult development. However, we really only spent like 1-2 classes on this topic (and I don't even think we mentioned adult development). The VAST majority of the course was studies involving infants and very young children \r\n-Powerpoint slides are usually unclear and not very helpful \r\n-At the end of the last class, he told us what he hoped we would take away from the course. However, we were tested on the final in much more detail (as expected since you get the questions in advance). I just think we should be more explicitly tested on what he hopes we take away ",
            "\u00a0I think the delivery of the material is a little bit too fast and overwhelming both in lecture and in terms of reading. There is just so much we are told and it's hard to really retain all of the material in its full depth. That being said, I really enjoyed doing the debate responses because they allowed me to offer my own opinion. I also think the TA meetings were extremely helpful for our final papers. ",
            "\u00a0There was way too much at the end. I think the workload in the last two weeks of the semester was unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0This course has an interesting balance between social science and more scientific material. The debate essays are short, but substantive enough to get you engage with the material and actually pick a side without worrying if you're right or wrong. A strength is also the way the final paper is structured. Though slightly annoying, it ends up being so helpful having us start thinking about the paper early on and go through stages of developing it with our TA so that by the time we get to the end of the semester, it doesn't feel like you're unprepared to write the paper because you (ideally) have a well-thought out topic and outline by then. The biggest weakness of this course is the format of the final exam. Memorizing 60 essay questions on top of writing the 12-15 page paper is a lot. Only having to memorize 30 questions for the midterm is a lot, but manageable. 60 essay questions at the end of the semester on top of the final paper and studying for other exams, and working on other papers and projects is too much. It is a time crunch and I believe, unnecessarily stresses students out. The format itself doesn't necessarily need to be changed, but the amount of questions for the final should be cut down in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This course was generally excellent. Professor Keil is a fantastic lecturer and the class is well designed to be able to follow what's going on. For the most part I think the assignments were well designed. For instance, I think the research proposal paper was one of the most rewarding assignments of my Yale experience so far. The debate responses were all right. I think they're better than most reading response-type assignments (which isn't saying much) but some weeks were definitely better than others in terms of connection to what we were learning, and I think some of the questions could be amended to connect better to course material generally. The prep for exams was kind of overwhelming, but I think it was fair because if you did the preparation the actual exam was very straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that you learn a lot. You will come out of this course with so many interesting factoid to tell others about children, and you come out with a lot of curiosity about the development of children. The weaknesses of the course is that it is a lot of work and memorization. But that comes with the department, and I don't think of it so much as a weakness because it's a given. There is a large research proposal that you have to write that takes up a lot of time throughout the semester. Be consistent or be punished. There are also two exams: a midterm and a final, where both exams are made of 5/7 essay questions that comes from a list of 30/60. It's a lot of work, and I think that the amount of work is a bit too much, but again, it comes with the department. Just start early and get ready to memorize many many different studies and their results. ",
            "\u00a0Surprisingly engaging for a lecture class. Good course load. Midterm and final format was a bit demanding (studying 30 question only to see 5 of those questions on the exam) however it really helped me retain the information. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: some parts of the lecture got kind of dry, would love to have more videos and activities. Strength was that Prof. Keil was very informative and knowledgeable and I felt like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very well organized. I found the lectures engaging and interactive and I loved the use of videos of cute babies to demonstrate developmental trends. Some of the lectures, like the language ones, were a bit dry, but for the most part I found the material and the way it was presented extremely interesting. Also, it was super helpful that the lectures and material lined up really well with the textbook (since Prof Keil wrote it), so if there was ever something I was unclear on, it was easy to find more detailed descriptions of the studies described in class in the textbook. \r\n\r\nThis is not necessarily a weakness, but this class is a lot of work. There is an assignment almost every week that is often fairly time consuming. I would say this isn't a bad thing though because it never felt like busy work and I felt like I got a lot out of the assignments. For example, the progress reports and paper meetings mean you have a plan for your final paper way ahead of time. I did end up working on the paper on the last day, but because of the required assignments beforehand, I had already done most of my research and had a full outline so it was manageable (still not recommended obviously since it is a long paper). \r\n\r\nThe tests are really hard also. They seem like they won't be that hard because he gives you a set of questions beforehand, but the questions are complex and detailed. I think that it would be an improvement for there to be fewer questions, especially if the questions are broad, overarching questions that require you to pull a lot of material, like a lot of the midterm questions were. ",
            "\u00a0This course did center a lot around memorization. The midterm and final were set up in such a way that you basically just had to know everything. I would consider this both a strength and a weakness because it was really difficult and time-consuming but ultimately beneficial to the value of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging lectures\r\nWeakness: work load is really high, grading can be a bit arbitrary "

            "\u00a0If you're majoring in psychology, you have to take this, abnormal psych, or social psych to fulfill the core social science requirement. I haven't taken the other two courses, as they've never been available when i wanted to take them, so I took this one. I don't recommend or not recommend this course because you're probably just going to take whichever of the three is available, and if you go with this one, it won't kill you, but you might fear that the exams will. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. When you walk into the class, you always learn something new and exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was really interesting and is a must for anyone who is ever wondering why kids (or teens) act the way we do (or did). The writing assignments could be a lot of work sometimes because there is one due every week in the beginning of the semester, but the lectures themselves were very instructional and informative. Professor Keil really makes the class fun by showing videos of cute babies and animals, too. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Whether or not you're a psychology major, the course offers a lot of insight into human nature and development, and is very interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't strongly recommend, but overall it was a good experience. If you really like baby/child studies, then definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Id definitely recommend this course. I learned a lot and it was all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is very important for those who want a solid foundation in developmental psychology. That being said, I believe a class like Mental Lives of Infants and Animals might be better paced and planned to truly maximize learning about similar topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were able to take it Credit/D. Frank is a great lecturer, and as he's been teaching this class for several decades, knows what he's doing. He's very knowledgable and you walk away from the class feeling like you've learned so much more about developmental psych that intro psych doesn't cover. His standards, however, are very high, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does raise the bar for the class really high. The workload is manageable up until the final, but even before that it can be a little much. In total, there are 5 debate essays, 3 required paper meetings with the TAs, with 5 total progress reports, a midterm where you're given 30 essay questions a week ahead to study, a final paper of 3500-4500 words, and a final exam, where you're given 60 essay questions to study. It is a lot of work, but if you're willing to take the class Credit/D and still work hard, the class is so worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This class is a fair amount of work, but it's very fair. You check in several times with a tf about your research paper and get the midterm/final questions in advance. If you put in the effort, then, it's definitely possible to do well (but you will have to put in a bunch of effort). It's also incredibly interesting and Professor Keil is both a fantastic lecturer/teacher and really knowledgeable. Would highly recommend as a psychology class that's more interesting/focused than intro psych! I think even if you're not a psych major the information is digestible and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class only if they are planning to major in psychology or if they have a very high interest for developmental psychology. I am a potential psych major and did not have as high an interest in developmental psych, but I found myself in the middle questioning why I even took the course. Although in hindsight, I would say I enjoyed the course and that I learned a lot, during the time, I felt miserable and didn't really \"get\" the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, wonderful instructor and interesting content. Presents multiple views of psychology, as the field is still a growing science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Keil is one of my favorite professors at Yale. Because I took this class, I now know what I want to study and pursue in grad school and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, learning about how we develop into the people we are is incredibly essential to understanding ourselves and the people around you. Developmental psych is one of the most relevant classes to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved this class. I thought the material was super interesting and it is so fascinating to learn about children. This class is a 100 level psych class, which I felt like makes it seem easier than it is, because it is a lot more work than the other intro psych classes I have taken. I would hold off on taking it until you are a sophomore since I think it does require some psych knowledge. I would also strongly consider credit/d-ing this class. Overall this class is one of my favorite classes so far. It was also fairly small (~30) students which was really nice, because even though it was still a lecture class, it was a lot more interactive. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if you have a genuine and specific interest in psychology and are willing to put in the time necessary to do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Developmental psychology is an amazing field, and Keil is a wonderful instructor. He seemed a bit boring at first, but he is actually a fantastic lecturer with a lot of insight and humor. \r\n\r\nThe content is also wonderful! I learned so much. "
