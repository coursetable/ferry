            "\u00a0I really think that the layout of the class was awful. I wanted to learn more about biomechanics, meanwhile, the majority of the class was focused on deriving equations that I learned already in other courses. \r\n\r\nAnother awful idea was to make the second lab assignment a \"three hour assignment\". This worked on the honesty system where students agreed they only worked on it for 3 hours. What this does is cause students who followed the rules to get a lower grade than students who broke the rules and spent more time on it.\r\n\r\nAlso, the homework was on a much harder level than any of the material taught in class. We never received homework solutions so there was no way to actually learn from the work that we did. \r\n\r\nOverall, if the course remains the same I would never recommend this course to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0We used matlab tools like optimization and curve fitting that are extremely useful and I have applied on my own, after taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Well structured, good teacher, good TAs, a lot to learn\r\n\r\nWeakness: If you ever fall behind, you can't really grasp it afterwards due to missing solution of psets etc. and too vague answers of TAs "
