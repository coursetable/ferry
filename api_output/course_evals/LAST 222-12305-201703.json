            "\u00a0I noticed my written and spoken Spanish improve dramatically over time. ",
            "\u00a0I really did learn a lot from this course. It was pretty cool to expose myself to legal terminology for the first time - in Spanish. I am happy that I took these skills out of such a laid-back class. ",
            "\u00a0I really improved my oral and written Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the legal systems in Spanish-speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about some legal issues in spanish. There was not very much speaking and it was mostly lecture. I developed writing skills through the paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the legal system in the US and in Spanish speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0nice intro to law class with some Spanish practice ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I tremendously improved my academic, written Spanish. Most importantly, I learned legal terminology that is relevant in the discussion of political and socioeconomic problems in Latin America and the United States. ",
            "\u00a0I developed more knowledge about the law, specifically in Spain and Latin American countries. ",
            "\u00a0You can get a lot out of the class if you put in a lot! The readings are definitely harder than the expected quality of students' writing but you can set your goal to write strong answers. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I was able to learn about the different legal structures of Latin American countries. Furthermore, I was given the opportunity to hear and participate in debates regarding topics such as immigration, death-penalty, legalization of marijuana, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class improved my Spanish skills, especially writing. ",
            "\u00a0Critical listening and writing. Ability to understand Spanish at a native speaking level "

            "\u00a0One strength was that we were only able to speak Spanish. I also appreciated the well-made PowerPoints, which made it easier to follow along to some of the more complex topics. The weekly assignments were also good writing practice.  \r\n\r\nI think it would be helpful to have more speaking exercises. This could include small group discussions during each class, as well as more student presentations throughout the semester. Also, students should not be allowed to read from a script for the debates, since this does nothing to improve speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I liked our weekly homework assignments and feel that they helped me stay engaged with the course. I wish deadlines and expectations were a little more easily expressed. I also feel that the course packet was not entirely necessary, although I do appreciate that we helped a local business. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class with a workload that isn't too difficult, though the assignments do take a while each week. The content is interesting and there are speaking parts every day. \r\n\r\nThe weakness is that expectations for work are not always clearly laid out. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Carreras is really nice in office hours but her lectures can be a bit dry. The class is more focused on technical aspects of the law than I expected. I would've liked to get more practice speaking, as I took the class to improve my speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the weekly writing assignments that develop our writing skills, and the fun in class discussions/videos and songs. \r\nThere are not many weaknesses!! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Carreras is, hands down, the most charismatic teacher I have had during my time at Yale. You can tell that she genuinely cares about her students and that she is extremely passionate about the subjects she teaches. This enthusiasm made the class extremely enjoyable and one I looked forward to each week. \r\n\r\nAlthough it is hard to identify a weakness, sometimes instructions and deadlines could have been made a bit more clear. ",
            "\u00a0The class was manageable for someone with a very low level of Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Great listening and writing training\r\nWould love more day to day class engagement for verbal practice ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the class were that the assignments were pretty straight forward and continuous, which created constant engagement with the material. Profesora Carreras is also a great professor to have for a 9 am class since she will most likely keep you awake by all of the things that she says. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0This is a fine L5 class to take. The workload is very manageable, but you don't get much speaking practice, if that's what you're looking for. Prof. Carreras is very sweet and helpful. Definitely a good 5th course. ",
            "\u00a0The level of Spanish required to engage in the class might really depend on the people in your class. Our class had many fluent/native speakers and thus there were some people that did not participate often. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I think this is an ideal 5th class that you will actually get a lot out of. Assignments are manageable, Carreras is so wonderful (especially for a 9 AM), and you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY! Great class that feels super relevant. I learned very applicable vocabulary that will be helpful to me in the future! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the class if you are interested in legal issues and want a not too difficult spanish  class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Mercedes is one of my favorite teachers at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend Legal Spanish! Professor Carreras is extraordinary, and you're able to learn material that is relevant to understanding the political and socioeconomic crises within Latin America and the United States. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, the professor was great and the course itself was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to get a glimpse into Legal Spanish and are looking for a class with relatively low workload. Prof. Carreras is very approachable and always willing to give d=feedback and help out. All in all, you'll get as much out of it as you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was so much fun and I know that the knowledge I gathered from it will be useful in future endeavors. I absolutely love Professor Carreras! ",

            "\u00a0Yes, good way to practice Spanish skills and at the same time learn about interesting topics relating to law. Honestly a fun class with a wonderful professor, and the relatively small workload allows for a deeper understanding of the material and less stress over grades. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it was a great way to improve my speaking, writing and comprhension skills, especially as a non native speaker. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. The professor is a joy to have. The material itself is also very intriguing since it examines different law systems throughout Latin America and Spain, and there is a lot of freedom to explore one's interest for the final benchmark. "
