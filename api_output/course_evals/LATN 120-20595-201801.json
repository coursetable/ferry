            "\u00a0I have basically received a primer to all of Latin grammar, and learned how to read Latin texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to translate complex texts using new grammatical concepts and vocabulary I learned over the course of the class. Specifically, I learned the different subjunctive constructions and how to translate them in different contexts. ",
            "\u00a0Learned really well how to intuitively look at and parse Latin. ",
            "\u00a0I learned good skills for approaching Latin texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an incredible job at cementing the basic foundation of Latin grammar, while also doing a great job of introducing students to the process of reading genuine Latin texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply Latin grammar and vocabulary to reading real Latin passages. I learned how Latin syntax works and what to look for when reading authors like Cicero. I learned what are the best techniques to reading Latin prose and also how to further improve my skills. I learned some stylistic Latin prose terms. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of Latin grammar and practice in reading actual Latin, a skill which I found most helpful while taking concurrently a course dedicated to the History of the Spanish Language. "

            "\u00a0Strengths--Great TF and professor willing to help people improve their Latin.\r\nWeaknesses--Goodness, it's 100% the pace of the course. To be frank, expecting people to learn all of Latin grammar by spring break of second semester is simply an untenable situation. I feel that by taking more time on the grammar, the eventual translations would be much, much easier. For example, complex topics like the subject infinitive (which is not intuitive for English speakers) are simply glossed over during 1 week of classes with the expectation that we understand the nuance of the material. Please, please, please take an extra 2 weeks to fully go over the grammar before diving head first into Latin texts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The pace of the course is good (not too fast or slow), the teacher was patient, clear, and available to help students, weekly quizzes were a good opportunity to assess your knowledge, TA was good\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Can't think of any immediate weaknesses, maybe go into more depth while translating Pro Archia ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes reading the actual Latin text was inhibited by categorizing sentences to specific grammar points in the textbook ",
            "\u00a0The course emphasized rigorous treatment of the language. It focused less on developing fluency, which would make the course even stronger. ",
            "\u00a0Both the biggest strength and weakness of this class is the pace. On one hand, the rigor and amount of material covered is a great way to learn Latin quickly and well. However, it was at times overwhelming and made for a rather difficult course, particularly in the first semester. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that it really leads you to reading Latin prose. It also covers a fair amount of material, both grammatical and literary, in a relatively short amount of time. Although evaluating on a weekly can be stressful, I believe it results in a rather pronounced learning curve. This entailed that, after the end of the course, I could see behind and look at all the work I had done with satisfaction. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths of the course is having students read and re-read actual Latin in the second half of the semester. One of the weaknesses has to do more with the interstitial period between 110 and 120; I think it might be helpful to have some sort of review/practice available online for students to practice their skills, since the grammar element tends to move rather quickly at the beginning of 120. Also, it might be helpful to structure more class time around working in groups, or assigning group work for homework; to give students the chance to strengthen their skills while working with their peers. I would also suggest making a more intentional effort to incorporate elements of Roman culture into the course, especially to contextualize readings, because it helps students better remember the texts and helps with engagement.

            "\u00a0If you took Latin 110, yes, only if you are absolutely willing to devote 2 hours everyday to the language--it's that difficult. Maybe this is what the Classics Department at Yale is going for, but all future students should be aware of this. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Latin I recommend you take it, however, it is not an easy course so prepare for the workload and the numerous grammatical concepts to learn ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course to learn how to read Latin. ",
            "\u00a0Id recommend it to anyone interested in learning to read Latin. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to dedicate the time necessary to this course, I would wholeheartedly recommend it, as it was very rewarding in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone interested in reading Latin prose, because before this semester I was not even able to read simple passages in Latin and now I can read some not so difficult passages. ",
            "\u00a0I would, especially to students interested in the humanities, because an understanding of Latin is quite helpful in working with the Western literary tradition, to say nothing of the phrases/words in Latin that are the lingua franca of the intellectual sphere. "
