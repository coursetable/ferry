            "\u00a0He was very knowledgable and helped us makes sense of the reading material. I do wish that we would have discussed the reading a little more critically and analytically in discussions. Very charismatic--I would take his class. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-informed on the topics we discussed, offered helpful background information and suggestions for further reading. I would have appreciated him taking the section conversations beyond just reviewing details of the readings, into more substantive conversation about what each work brought to the class and how they fit into the big picture. ",
            "\u00a0Colin was an excellent teaching fellow.  He was well-prepared, friendly, approachable, well-organized, and enormously helpful in response to any questions or requests for help or input.  My one suggestion for improvement would be that Colin could have been clearer about re-emphasizing some of the ways each week's materials fit with the broad themes of the course - it would have been helpful if he had taken the opportunity each week to invite a discussion of how the current materials related to some of the prior weeks' discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Always very well prepared and facilitated section discussions with ease ",
            "\u00a0Colin conducted sessions in a stimulating and inclusive way ",
            "\u00a0Colin was thoughtful, thorough, and encouraging. He was always well-prepared for section, and he excelled at walking us through the context for primary source documents that we might not have picked up on from lecture. He also created space for a diverse set of intellectual backgrounds in the class - he made it easier for people who did not have a history background to engage the material, while also having opportunities for those people who were well-versed to ask more in-depth questions. ",
            "\u00a0Colin is such a great TF! He made section both fun and informative -- he always welcomed comments and facilitated discussion well, and his extensive knowledge of the period was always on display. His lectures were informative as well. ",
            "\u00a0Colin did a great job preparing discussion material for section and keeping us on track with what he had outlined. This meant that we made our way through the material, but also led to some discussion being stifled. I found that some of his best sections were those that started by following his outline, made space in the middle for discussion that was either mapped out or spontaneous, and then related the readings to some of the others that we had done or would do. Overall, he managed discussion well and provided helpful comments on papers. Thanks! ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Colin is an excellent teaching fellow. He explained the subject matter with ease and fluency. He answered questions respectfully from those who had various levels of exposure to the material. He gave greater insight into the material that was discussed in class and gave ample space for people to ask questions and he gave positive feedback when people shared. I appreciated his classroom management. He also brought a level of excitement to what we were learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Could have provided a bit more clarity on the first writing assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Colin Hoch was a great class instructor and is very intelligent and open to differing views from students. Hire him. ",
            "\u00a0A bit more guidance on style of historical writing would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Mr Hoch is quite encouraging and he is open to different ideas and voices. And I really appreciate his comments of my paper. ",
            "\u00a0Colin was an excellent and animated T.F.  who was never unprepared for section. His enthusiasm for the course content was very clear and very welcome. He was mostly willing to let the class talk about what they found interesting, while at the same time he clearly had a list of talking points to resort to when things went quiet. \r\n\r\nHe was usually clear and direct with his questions and answers, which was welcome. We could have maybe zoomed in on particular passages more than we did, especially for longer assignments that it was pretty clear not everybody had read. Colin was great. ",
            "\u00a0Colin was one of the best section leaders I've ever had. He was a patient and informed discussion leader, and answered questions about all kinds of material in a way that respected all students and perspectives. Moreover, it was clear he respected all points of view. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledgeable, enthusiastic, approachable, and successfully made discussion sections compelling. An especially fine job navigating the various personalities, interests and egos in the room. ",
            "\u00a0Pranav was kind, helpful, and reasonably knowledgeable, considering that Christianity is not his area of expertise. He did his job. However, I don't get the impression that he liked the class material or the students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Pranav was great. I especially appreciated the historical overviews that he provided at the beginning of the term. His comments were helpful, and I appreciated how he made himself available to help his students outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Pranav was a very good TF. He led us through the material really well each discussion and clarified complicated issues. He used different methods of facilitating discussion, and I overall thought he was very effective. ",
            "\u00a0Really helped us reach into the material. Added a lot of depth to the topics at hand. \r\nWeakness - none ",
            "\u00a0Pranav was a wonderful TF. He was very engaging in section and encouraged us all to share, without making us feel like we had to have the smartest thing to say or the right answer. He was always available to answer questions and very knowledgeable when it came to the material. Really well done. He would make an excellent professor. ",
            "\u00a0Pranav was a fantastic TF - he guided us through section discussions ably and wasn't afraid to prod us when we were too quiet. I also greatly appreciated his feedback and advice on the papers, and his willingness to review outlines and drafts. ",
            "\u00a0really good at conversation and discussion \r\nnot so good at christian theology ",
            "\u00a0Pranav is an excellent instructor. He led very stimulating discussions that brought us deep into the the material, prepared rich background information the discussions, and educated us about the literature surrounding the works we were reading. He went above and beyond.\r\n\r\nWhen he gave full-class discussions, Pranav took us through dense philosophical and historical arguments with ease. He did magnificently. ",
            "\u00a0Pranavs knowledge of the course material was outstounding. I really appreciated his secondary source recommendations for the papers! "
