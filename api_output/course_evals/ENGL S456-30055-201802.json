            "\u00a0I learnt the importance of the public record, techniques for deep, ethnographical reporting, and the ethics of dealing with sources. I also really engaged with New Haven! ",

            "\u00a0I learned some fascinating things in this course, including how to access a wealth of information that's freely available to the public. Its greatest weakness is that it's very unorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the lectures and stories that Prof. Shapiro would tell were really interesting! The discussions of the readings were also thought-provoking. I thought the idea of the blog posts--to get used to more informal writing and reflection--was also useful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I wish we did more of the readings, since they looked super interesting, and talked about them. I also thought the class could use more structure, since we seemed all over the place sometimes. We also didn't really get any feedback on our work. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved by organization, plain and simple. It's hard, as a Yale student, to go into a credit with no sense of grading and with no syllabus. I think Prof Shapiro did it in part to simulate a real life news room, but most of the time it was just unnecessarily stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The projects are extremely useful and interesting, but I felt that class time was not very effectively used there was a lot of great information in lecture, but it was buried among less useful information in lectures that could easily have been cut in half. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course is very intriguing and useful. I learnt a lot by actually carrying out the activities. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would! Despite being a little disorganized, the course was really interesting as a look at journalism from both a media-studies perspective and a practical, boots-on-the-ground perspective. I thought I learned a lot especially about ethical obligations in journalism and public documents, which can be intimidating to get into at first. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I absolutely would! Professor Shapiro has a rich set of real life journalist stories and is very kind and willing to meet up whenever! I also would recommend a student having trust in the process. I was worried and anxious about the lack of organization, but got something miraculous out at the end of the class-a deeper attachment to the city I call home. ",
            "\u00a0The projects are very useful, but the lectures can be very boring and Professor Shapiro is very disorganized. A lot of fun to do the projects and to get out there to investigate. A great WR that will be a lot of fun, but not a terrible workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very helpful to inspire students' interests in journalism in general. "
