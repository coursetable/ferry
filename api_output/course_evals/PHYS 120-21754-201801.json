            "\u00a0I established a fundamental understanding of quantum theory, relativity, and likely advances in cosmology, particle physics, and astrophysics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper appreciation for the genius of Einstein and the beauty of physics. I finally have a solid understanding of basic quantum physics concepts. I feel that the scope of my thought is significantly broader than before. ",
            "\u00a0More in depth understanding of quantum physics and relativity than I had previously. Interesting questions at the frontiers of research, and implications for the nature of reality. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater understanding of the field of physics this semester. We learned about topics ranging from the Big Bang to quantum mechanics to string theory, which gave us a thorough knowledge of topics at the frontier of physics while also helping to give us a picture of where the field stands as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I became familiar with general topics in modern physics, which enhanced my perspective of the world. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was exposed to a lot of the concepts in quantum physics. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the course's single class period format.  One two-hour class allowed me to fully engage for that time period and was a convenient way to gain the requisite exposure to the material for the week all at once without the need of multiple class periods.\r\n\r\nI thought discussion section was rather pointless except prior to an exam, so I am glad that attendance at section was not required. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and assigned work are well done. I think class time could be used more efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0The homeworks could be overwhelming so that I couldn't get down the basics of the topic. Everything was definitely interesting, but I wish the required reading was smaller so that I knew what I should focus on learning first before pushing myself to explore more fascinating details of the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: needs more math, professor lectures rather than discussion\r\nStrengths: very diverse array of topics, gets to the heart of the matter ",
            "\u00a0One of the course's greatest strengths is Professor Harris. He really wants to help us learn, which definitely showed in the effort he put into the course. One example of his dedication is the fact that at the end of each homework assignment, we were asked to list topics that were confusing and needed clarification or that were interesting and that we wanted to discuss further. He sorted through all of our feedback and incorporated it into each class, which helped to ensure that we were understanding the material and covering the topics we were most interested in. Another strength of the course is its ability to provide students with a thorough understanding of some of the most exciting topics in physics without requiring sophisticated math. Without this course, many of the students would have been unable to take a course in these topics due to the high level of mathematics with which they are normally taught. The readings outside of class and videos during class were especially helpful for understanding the material, and they were chosen well to be at an appropriate level. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting and accessible. However, in-class time sometimes felt unproductive. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that you leave the course knowing a lot more physics concepts than you knew beforehand.\r\n\r\nWhat I found really difficult about the course was the level that was expected. I think the exams were difficult to prepare for because the questions didn't always seem to be very fair; the questions were very detailed and specialized and often either about concepts we barely covered in class so they didn't seem as relevant as other topics to study for or based on topics we covered. I think that just studying to get the big picture or general idea wouldn't really let you succeed; you would have to really study all the details.\r\n\r\nI also think that the way it was marketed as a class for non-physics or non-STEM people was a bit misleading.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student looking to gain a solid baseline understanding of quantum mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is a great introduction to quantum physics for people without a rigorous background in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was definitely interesting and fun, but it could definitely still improve! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you are already interested in the topic, and are willing to dive deep yourself beyond the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who has had a basic physics background and who is interested in learning about some of the most exciting material in the field of physics. The course covers an extremely interesting set of topics, including black holes, dark matter, and general relativity. This course succeeds in providing a thorough understanding of these topics without requiring an understanding of the mathematics behind them, which provides a unique opportunity for students who do not have the mathematical preparation to take the upper-level physics courses that discuss the material. In addition to the material, Professor Harris is a major strength of the course, and he is truly invested in helping students learn and succeed. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in these topics and who prefers not to tackle the quantitative nature of physics. ",
            "\u00a0I guess I would still recommend the course because I think the concepts were interesting. I just think the course isn't meant for students who want to explore something new or gain exposure to physics. Instead, I think you should only take this course if you already have a good amount of physics background and have already had exposure to quantum physics. I feel like this class often assumed you knew the basics well enough so that the class would just end up covering the small details. "
