It was somewhat disorienting to learn base R then have dplyr added at the end as an addendum, as this made it harder to think of dplyr solutions and encouraged me to use base R even when dplyr offered more elegant solutions.

The content she has created is well organised, perfectly builds on each other, is contemporary, interesting, real-world, applied helpful, created perfectly didactic, to teach what she intends to and pre-treated to work for what we don't need to focus on.
