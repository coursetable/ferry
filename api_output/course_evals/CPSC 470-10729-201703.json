On the foundations side, we looked at search algorithms (depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost / Dykstra, greedy best-first, A star + heuristics, and gameplay minimax with alpha-beta pruning); we showed the generality of these techniques with applications in gameplay, constraint satisfaction, and NP-complete problems. We also covered logic and theorem proving, decision trees, dimensionality reduction, probability, and Bayes nets. On the modern / sexy side, we covered neural nets in great detail (SVM, Softmax loss functions; stochastic gradient descent parameter updates; intuitions about hyperparamenters and convergence; fully-connected and convolutional layers for image classification and reinforcement learning; recurrent, LSTM, and attention architectures for semantic parsing). We also looked at Markov models (Markov reward processes, decision processes, POMDPs) and related algorithms (value and policy iteration, Q-learning) which was perhaps my favorite part of the course. \r\n\r\nThis course also found a balance between theory and implementation. The lectures stay high-level, allowing for exposure to and synthesis of an immense field. In the psets, we dove in head first to the most crucial algorithms covered in class. The last two projects feature 1. (Supervized learning) - neural-net image classification on the CIFAR-10 data set and 2. Reinforcement Q-learning in the Pacman and Atari environments. Both projects were fun to show off to friends and family.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter? In addition to its applicability in most jobs and areas of scientific and digital humanities research, AI is the noblest and most ambitious experiment undertaken by humankind (since freedom). In AI, we are trying to formalize the principles of our rationality, to extend and surpass our minds, to understand who and what we are. Join us! ",

One thing I also appreciated was how the assignments got us familiar with a number of contemporary machine learning libraries, like Theano and Tensorflow, both of which I'd never used before. Even though it was hard work trying to figure out the APIs sometimes, now I feel more confident using those libraries in the future. Also, programming AIs to play games was just pretty fun to watch.

In terms of strengths, Professor Radev has a very well-thought-out curriculum and is a good lecturer as well. ",

The programming assignments are all in Python, except for one pen-and-paper mathematical problem set. This means that the language is applicable to real-world work. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the course is related to the exams. The review sessions leading up to the exams involve the professor skimming through old lecture notes during class, not providing much substantive review. There is not much clarity before exams about what will be covered, as the only review material provided is exams from other universities, including questions not related to content covered in CPSC 470. ",
            "\u00a0Survey courses covering a lot of material, in not much depth. Very confusing to follow at times because we did not go into much detail. ",
            "\u00a0CPSC 470 covered way TOO much material, in not enough depth, meaning that students were left with a very surface-level understanding that wasn't terribly useful for solving problems. At this point, I think AI is just too broad a field to do justice to in a single course. Students are better off taking separate classes on individual subfields, i.e. logic (PHIL 115), machine learning (S&DS 365), robotics (CPSC 472 and 473), computer vision (CPSC 475 and 476), NLP (CPSC 477), and decision-making (not offered). \r\n\r\nWhile this class was too broad in some ways, it was also not broad enough in others! It all but omitted several central components of AI  things that I was expecting and hoping would be covered  including convolutional neural networks and  backpropagation. \r\n\r\nThe class just didn't work, and studying for exams was incredibly frustrating. If it were up to me, I would say eliminate it altogether, and encourage students to explore the subfields that most interest them. As it stands, this class is a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0There are wayyyy too many slides per lecture (about 120 slides/lecture). So it was a bit hard to study before the exam. A lot of the material were from the Berkeley CS188 class which is nice because there's a lot of resources available online, but it's still hard to keep up during class (even if you pay full attention in class) because Drago just flips through the slides so fast. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs to be better organized in terms of relating content to the homework material, as well as the pacing and emphasis of certain key concepts. \r\n\r\nLecture slides were unnecessarily long, would be good if examples were run through by hand to aid teaching as well as through slides. ",
            "\u00a0In a couple of years I expect this course to be excellent; in its first year being taught, assignments were new, so specifications contained mistakes and other things that caused misunderstandings and confusions. That was the main problem with the course. The material is very relevant and exactly what one would expect out of a well-structured, intensive intro to AI ",
            "\u00a0Too difficult, too many topics. Problem sets were either far too easy or completely impossible based on what had been taught in lecture and assigned as reading. The final exam was absolutely perverse, and tested knowledge that was completely outside the bounds of the syllabus. Lectures were nearly useless, and whenever the material strayed from the textbook, it felt like there was nowhere to turn. All the course materials were delegated out to a vast teaching staff, so often different parts of assignments did not agree with each other and proved impossible without diligently checking the course Piazza for updates.\r\n\r\nThe main strength of the course is that it was so difficult that it motivated me to seek out materials from other courses in order to teach myself the material. This is unacceptable that I had to do this, but often the course staff was open about the fact that we needed to do this in order to adequately learn the material. I learned plenty due to this course, but no thanks to the course itself. Also, the textbook is generally extremely strong, so whenever the course material relates to what's in the textbook, you can usually learn it independently. This became less true for the later material. The textbook became fairly inscrutable when it came to probability and reinforcement learning, so I had to seek out other materials online. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is a very relevant topic that I'm glad is now included at Yale. Weaknesses are that some of the organization of the class could be improved but that is understandable because it is the first time it is offered. ",

            "\u00a0It was great. ",
            "\u00a0This class has no organization at all. Professor Drago has on average 100 slides per lecture and goes over some complicated concepts about AI in only a few minutes which makes the class very disorienting. Also, usually half of his slides are straight-up ripped from either Stanford's course or Berkeley's course, which makes it even more disorienting because they often contain abbreviations or terms that were never even introduced to us. Furthermore, there was one homework assignment that we were given two weeks to do that was an entire's semester's worth of homework for an ADVANCED computer vision class at UC Berkeley. \r\n\r\nThe class can be dramatically improved if Drago narrowed down the topics for this class. He needs to limit his slides to something reasonable like 30/lecture so that students can actually leave the class with a solid grasp of certain concepts. It's no surprise why attendance for this large lecture completely dropped to the point where Davies Auditorium had only about 4 rows of people in it in some classes. ",

Teaching on neural networks was a mess, and everything after and including the second half of first-order logic was not taught well. Homework and practice assignments were often copied whole-scale from other universities (Stanford, Berkeley) without adjusting for the type of content that we had learnt (which was different compared to them) ",

Some of the material is interesting, but because it's such a big class, everyone's coding ability varies a lot.\r\n\r\nWould be more interesting as a smaller class with a specific level of prerequisite. This class was too broad and general to come out of it as having learned how to implement anything specific. ",

Another area for improvement was that the homework and lectures didn't align well. ",

While it is a survey class we did go into some depth on things like deep learning and reinforced learning which are very interesting. That said, the quality of the teaching is very poor. Drago seems like a nice person who cares genuinely about his students but he is a very bad communicator. This results in lectures which are impossible to follow as well as unintelligible exam questions. For instance, i have never seen so many people go up to ask questions during an exam as I did during this classes final. Nearly every question required significant clarification. I left the exam wishing I hadn't studied, not because the exam was easy, but because the hardest part was figuring out what the questions were asking. Drago could definitely improve as a professor with time, but one does get the sense that everyone would be better off if he were spending his time researching instead. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard to evaluate this class because it was taught by a new instructor. That being said, there were several glaring weaknesses this semester. \r\n\r\nThe first weakness is the problem sets. The problem sets varied wildly in the difficulty of the assignment. Some problem sets were very straightforward, taking maybe only a couple hours to complete. However, other problem sets were much, much longer. These problem sets were made much harder because we weren't taught how to do these assignments, but rather meant to learn how to do them on their own. While this normally wouldn't be an issue, on one problem set we were essentially expected to learn about half of a Stanford class's worth of material (they gave us the lecture notes for that class to learn). It seems very unreasonable to make us learn an entire other course's material to complete a problem set. Please fix this for future classes. \r\n\r\nI think the weakness of this class was that it was kind of tough to tie together all of the material. This is definitely difficult to handle because of the survey nature of this class, but I didn't really get how the different subjects fit together until I was studying for the final exam. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the TA's for this class were generally subpar. I understand that they were essentially forced to TA this class, but they were very difficult to work with because they were not familiar with the problem sets that they didn't write (as each TA wrote a different problem set, which made continuity between problem sets awful).\r\n\r\nFinally, the last weakness is that the lecture slides are way too disorganized. The initial slide decks were good, but towards the end way too much material was just copy and pasted from different courses at other universities. This was very confusing to follow, especially when slides from different courses were interleaved. \r\n\r\nFor a strength, I guess the content is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Drago is a really nice professor and the material is fascinating and super relevant. It was frustrating how disorganized some of the psets and exams were. Would be a fantastic course after some polishing. ",
            "\u00a0I took Drago's NLP course last semester and thought that the course was pretty well structured and had similar expectations for AI. However, the class definitely is going through some growing pains because the problem sets are not well organized and the lectures could be improved. I feel like more focus could be put into specfic topics rather than trying to cover as many topics as possible. ",
            "\u00a0The problemsets should be made more substantial, so that more thinking is required. The slides should ideally have less topics, but have more content on each topic. ",
            "\u00a0Didn't learn anything substantial from the course -- I learned more from watching stanford lectures online (where all the psets were copied from anyway) ",
            "\u00a0The course has some strengths; parts of the problem set were interesting. But it was often poorly thought through. One of the psets, for example, had random chunks pulled from different sections of another courses full semester work that resulted in us learning little to nothing. Parts were often left unexplained in a way that made it difficult in a way that was frustrating but did not allow me to learn much at all. The tests did not adequately reflect what we had learned.

Lectures go at a breakneck pace and it's hard to follow sometimes -- I only really understood and appreciated the material when I sat down to study it at the end.\r\n\r\nThe class also relies on course material from other schools (read: Stanford and Berkeley) a lot, which is understandable because there's no point reinventing the wheel, but it's not ported over well yet so sometimes you're thrown into the psets without the lectures/notes that should have come with them. Fortunately they're not very hard so you can figure it out after a bit. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of intellectually stimulating and technically complex topics; however, I felt this course lacked structure and because so many topics were covered, a lot of them were glossed over and not gone over in as much depth as I would have preferred. ",

To some degree, they would, but it was very difficult getting through certain psets and having to learn it all on the fly (Tensorflow, Convolutional NNs, etc).  I also think that the PowerPoint format is not the best way to convey the information. ",

It has the characteristics of what a good CS course should be at Yale (we should have lots more AI courses) but it just never got there. The assignments in particular were not well structured and were incredibly frustrating at times as well. Because we didn't learn anything, the exams were way way way too hard and just total crapshoots. Grading was generous in the end though as long as you did well on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0To do the assignments you needed to do a lot of learning on your own. The covered topics was good, but I think we should have dug into some more.

I think lecture could have covered more relevant to what we were working on. ",

Either the course must go through all the slides or just link us to the lectures that were originally given using them so that we can learn the material properly. Some of the problem sets also had nothing to do with the content learned during the course. ",

For math-based topics, this was particularly frustrating. ",

Also 60% of the class got an A, which seems to be ridiculous - given that the class doesn't have a very heavy workload to begin with, this means that many would be able to get an A without putting in a commensurate amount of effort.

There could be more frequent checkins to make sure we were on target. In lecture, although I like that Drago stays high level, more specific guidance on the most important algorithms could be given. Drago draws on slides from multiple sources, and sometimes the notation can be variant and confusing.\r\nImprovements: I think the kinks in the psets will work themselves out going forward. Having an ability to see the results of especially pset 3 (semantic parsing) more clearly would be nice. In lecture, try to draw on at most one source of slides per topic to minimize confusion. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overly ambitious in the sense that not only did it cover a lot of material, it also assumed that we were covering everything in depth. The lecture slides provided by the professor were very difficult to understand. The expectations for the exams were also very unclear and the final exam tested material no-one really understood. I believe that the course would benefit from being converted into a 2-semester long sequence that actually covers the material in depth and not just expects us to understand everything on our own. ",

Some of the homework assignments were disorganized and duplicates from other courses. There isn't anything wrong with using assignments from other courses, but it was clear that not much work was put into making sure the material was suitable for the class (HW4 in particular). The final was also not representative of the material of the course, with almost 20% of the points focused on one topic which was barely covered. The pseudocode in the textbook was nearly impossible to understand. ",

It's helpful that the problem sets line up pretty close to the material, which, surprisingly, can't necessarily be said for all CS courses at Yale. However, there were times where the material was a bit more nebulous than it should have been, lending to a torrent of questions on Piazza. ",
            "\u00a0Course was WAY too broad, psets were way too hard. I think the instructor could've gone into topics more in depth, and actually built out the logical steps to some of the techniques rather than glossing over them and expecting us to actually execute in the problem sets.\r\n\r\nTA support was poor. PSETs were absolutely terrible  too difficult. ",

Other courses focus on teaching key course concepts, but Drago focuses on covering as much material as possible, but it's his first time with this course, so I think he'll improve the course greatly over the years. I think that mandatory section to go over algorithms and course concepts in depth would be very useful, as our ULAs didn't seem to have a clear teaching function, other than to answer questions on Piazza, which was flooded with information, sometimes course critical. More often than not, our prep material for exams would be straight from UC Berkeley, which has a very well taught course, but Drago did not adapt this material to be used in the course he taught, which was very frustrating.

The lectures mainly covered the material found in the textbook with some elaboration, whereas in some cases, specially when a homework was due, what I personally needed most is more guidance on how to approach the homework and what things I needed to know about it. (That improved towards the end of course when the professor and TA's started to explain what is unclear about the homework.) That could have saved a lot of the time spent on understanding the pset. There should also be more office hours or at least longer sessions, since there are many students in the class, 2 hours are not enough to help 20 students. There are many strengths to this class however. The topic is very interesting, more so than some other courses I have taken at Yale. That helped me enjoy studying the material for the tests. This course has also provided me with some of the basic tools I would need for AI and computer science in general and strengthened my coding skills in python and in general. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe materials are very up-to-date. We read papers published a few months ago, and the professor edited slides to include the latest findings. \r\nThis course cites multiple similar classes at Stanford and Berkeley etc., thus provides a good depth and breath for an introduction to AI.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nSometimes the slides feel disorganized (as they were taken from slides at other schools), and the lectures are not very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class borrows a lot of assignments/lectures from other classes, which can sometimes be a bit disorganized.

That said, the lectures themselves were less engaging than I'd expected -- I think partly because the slides didn't always seem the most organized, and I find it hard to understand algorithms quickly by reading the pseudocode on a screen. Perhaps it would have been better to do things graphically on the chalkboard where possible. The late afternoon timing also made it harder to stay awake, at least in my experience.

",
            "\u00a0Absolutely do not take this course. I thought it would improve with Drago teaching, instead it was an utter disaster.\r\n\r\nFor context: I am a senior, I attended every class, and I had close to a 100% going into the final. So believe me when I say that (1) no part of this course was easy to understand in any sort of depth, and (2) this is probably the worst class I have taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nIn more detail: Virtually all of Drago's powerpoints are just taken from other people, which means they're a disorganized jumble of different presentations, often 100s of slides long. Class itself is incredibly boring, with Drago just reading from the slides and doing very little to frame the material in a way that makes it sound interesting/easier to understand. The problem sets either don't relate to what we covered in class at all (e.g. Problem Set 4, which involves implementing different classifiers using algorithms we did not go over, including backprop [HOW CAN YOU NOT COVER BACKPROP IN AN AI CLASS?!]) or can be completed with minimal understanding of the underlying concepts (e.g. Problem Sets 3 and 6, which effectively asked you to implement equations that were given). The exams sometimes felt like non-sequiturs, e.g. three questions about multi-class perceptrons on the final  yet another topic we quite simply did not cover in class! Overall, the class tries to cover way too many (sometimes irrelevant) topics at once, while omitting others that you wish it did cover. The net result is that you often don't actually understand anything you're doing and end up scrambling come exam-time.\r\n\r\nUltimately, it's difficult to know how to allocate blame here. I think Drago does mean well, and I've heard mostly good things about his NLP class. But it would take an incredibly gifted, dedicated teacher to make a class of this scope work, and Drago couldn't manage it. I would STRONGLY recommend that anyone interested in AI take one of Yale's alternative courses in more specific subfields, like machine learning (S&DS 365), robotics (CPSC 472 and 473), computer vision (CPSC 475 and 476), or NLP (CPSC 477). I just wish someone had told me that before I wasted a semester on this class. ",

Knowledge of Python was insufficient to complete the psets. Some of the psets also tested vectorized programming in the TensorFlow and NumPy libraries, which is completely different from general Python programming. These psets were nearly impossible for me, because I had never coded in these libraries or worked with R, etc. ",

The midterm was quite easy, and the final was very difficult. The practice materials we were given were extremely unhelpful as they were just taken from a different university's course, and they did not reflect the material on the actual exams. \r\n\r\nIn the end, I would recommend this class to anyone who wanted a broad survey of AI.

The course was highly disorganized and it seemed like only one TA understood a PSET at any one time (that is, the one they were in charge of...).

If you're worried about grades, 80% of the class got an A- or better and 60% of the class got an A this time around (he released the distribution to us on Piazza). It's a class that I actually did learn quite a bit from, and I didn't need to attend lectures at all. Most of the problem sets were genuinely interesting in terms of content and challenge too (it was usually writing very few lines of code, but the challenge came in figuring out what was going on). \r\n\r\nThat said, this course has some major logistical challenges to overcome. The slides were usually just borrowed from other courses without actually going through them in class. The problem sets were written by students and were hit or miss. Most were exceptional (the written pset that had us hard code neural nets by hand taught me a lot), but others (pset 4) were terrible, demanded knowledge that wasn't taught during the course at all (we were told to read the course material for CS231 at Stanford. Why am I taking a Yale class if I'm just being asked to read other schools' materials to do a problem set? This content should have been covered in class), and weren't fully done by the time they were released to students (many bugs that students had to point out and find fixes for). This is unacceptable. The other big issue is that the slides cover a ridiculously expansive set of content that just isn't covered in enough detail in the class. Studying for exams is a nightmare because there's just way too much content to review and it's unclear what's testable because the problem sets are completely different from the exams. The practice exams are unhelpful as they are ridiculously difficult problems from a Berkeley class that, unlike us, actually covered all the material from the slides. Make sure you ace the problem sets, do decently on the exams, and you'll get an A. This will get better over time, and I sincerely hope that the problem sets are written ahead of time next year. ",

The class was very disorganized in that the lectures, problem sets, and exams did not correspond with each other at all. Lectures moved very quickly because it was basically speeding through high level slides in an attempt to get through everything that might be of interest within the field of AI. Problem sets were written by the TFs and take largely from other courses at other schools. The material itself was pretty interesting and applicable on its own, but I think the class could have been much better organized in order to facilitate learning, because I think very few people felt like they actively understood anything after doing any of the problem sets.

            "\u00a0Awesome course. This course was a perfect combination of the foundations and modern techniques in AI. On the foundations side, we looked at search algorithms (depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost / Dykstra, greedy best-first, A star + heuristics, and gameplay minimax with alpha-beta pruning); we showed the generality of these techniques with applications in gameplay, constraint satisfaction, and NP-complete problems. We also covered logic and theorem proving, decision trees, dimensionality reduction, probability, and Bayes nets. On the modern / sexy side, we covered neural nets in great detail (SVM, Softmax loss functions; stochastic gradient descent parameter updates; intuitions about hyperparamenters and convergence; fully-connected and convolutional layers for image classification and reinforcement learning; recurrent, LSTM, and attention architectures for semantic parsing). We also looked at Markov models (Markov reward processes, decision processes, POMDPs) and related algorithms (value and policy iteration, Q-learning) which was perhaps my favorite part of the course. \r\n\r\nThis course also found a balance between theory and implementation. The lectures stay high-level, allowing for exposure to and synthesis of an immense field. In the psets, we dove in head first to the most crucial algorithms covered in class. The last two projects feature 1. (Supervized learning) - neural-net image classification on the CIFAR-10 data set and 2. Reinforcement Q-learning in the Pacman and Atari environments. Both projects were fun to show off to friends and family.\r\n\r\nWhy does it matter? In addition to its applicability in most jobs and areas of scientific and digital humanities research, AI is the noblest and most ambitious experiment undertaken by humankind (since freedom). In AI, we are trying to formalize the principles of our rationality, to extend and surpass our minds, to understand who and what we are. Join us! ",
            "\u00a0I do not recommend taking this course. It suffers from a serious lack of structure. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting and hopefully the level of organization will be higher in future years. Psets are taken from Berkeley and Stanford AI courses and are mostly fun to do. Relatively low workload for a CS elective. All the slides are posted online so the material is crammable. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend taking this class for any reason. It is the worst class I have taken at Yale.\r\n\r\nUnless they redesign the entire course, and the instructor seriously revamps his style of instruction, I would not recommend this course for any reason. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take this class, it is a waste of time, you do not learn anything. Drago's lectures are extremely boring and uninformative. There is too much that he tries to cover in the course that you don't end up learning anything. The hardest part of this course was not knowing anything about probability-- a lot of the concepts in this course require probability concepts. \r\n\r\nYou will end up doing a lot more work learning concepts on your own ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a relatively easy CS elective to learn the basics of AI. That said, the class definitely has its weaknesses: this year, the material was disorganized, lecture was pretty boring, and psets were often irrelevant to what was covered in class. That said, if you're looking for a pretty lowkey CS elective to learn an overview of artificial intelligence, this is a fine class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Unless serious changes to the course structure are made, I would recommend watching the UC Berkeley videos on AI and perhaps finding a different course, or taking NLP, which Drago seems to prefer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, taking this class was definitely worth it. I have improved and solidified the coding skills by far, learnt AI from scratch and enjoyed exploring the field through the extra material that was offered by the professor. It was very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This is interesting material that is still being developed as we learn about it, which is super exciting! Because this course was in its first year, I think there was still a lot being developed/tested out. For example, Drago is a great professor (and his NLP class is definitely worth taking!) but a lot of the slides and problem sets ended up being taken directly from the Stanford or Berkeley slideshows and assignments. He did, however, do a great job of providing lecture slides and tons (and I mean TONS!) of extra links on Piazza if you wanted to learn more. I would recommend this course in future years, because I think it will be a bit better organized/material would be more organic. At the very least, you should take it to get an understanding of AI and to take a class with Drago-- he's adorably nice and sweet! ",
            "\u00a0The topic is interesting and up-to-date. It covers a good breath in AI. The lectures and homework are mostly taken from classes at other schools though, so it feels that this class jumps from place to place. The lectures are not very engaging, as are many other cs classes, and Drago is trying to cover so much in this one course, so many lectures seem a little rushed, and requires a lot of learning on the students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to do anything CS related it is important to have an understanding of AI. At the least this class is a decent introduction. ",
            "\u00a0Eh. First time it's been taught so maybe wait for them to work out the kinks. ",
            "\u00a0There are better CS electives. ",
            "\u00a0A decent survey course that somehow manages to cover the huge field that is AI in a single semester, though somewhat at the expense of depth and clarity. Don't take this if you only want to do statistics-based ML or deep learning (which is such a bubble anyway) -- be prepared to also learn about planning and search, logical reasoning, probabilistic reasoning, etc. (all of which are much more interesting intellectually, IMO). The content is good, though the slide-based lectures could probably be made more engaging (I'm a fan of chalk-board based explanations of algorithms, hopefully this happens next time round). Assignments can be a little more self-guided than you'd like, because you have to look up the documentation for ML libraries like Theano and Tensorflow yourself, but you also end up learning a lot along the way, and the overall workload ended up being not too high (especially with the deadline extensions they gave, when they realized some of the assignments were going to take way longer than planned). Overall, this is *much* better than the previous version of AI taught at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend as it is a course in a field of computer science that is very relevant in the current frontier. However, be warned that much of it will be dwn to self studying ",
            "\u00a0One of the most poorly organized classes that I've taken over the four years of my time at Yale. Psets were basically copy-pasted from Stanford/Berkeley's AI classes but in a degraded manner, and what's worse, the TAs clearly did not run or test them before they release the psets, so many of us had to waste so much time just debugging the pre-given code or installing a bunch of dependencies on the Zoo machines. Unless the class structure significantly improves, don't even think about taking it. "
