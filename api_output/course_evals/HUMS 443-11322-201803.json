            "\u00a0I learned a lot from writing my term paper for this class and from daily discussions. You will learn a lot more or less based on the time you put into doing the readings. you can participate in class without doing the readings but then the class is much less interesting for you. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the history of Muslims, Jews, and Christians and their relationship in Europe and Arabia from biblical to medieval times. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a historical paper and analyze primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to read primary sources and gather both primary and secondary sources to produce a massive research paper. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time that I engaged in a long term research project. During class we had to work with almost exclusively primary source material and that was a skill I had not developed previously. ",

            "\u00a0It was a very informative class, and he split up writing the paper very well throughout the year, and Professor Marcus was more than willing to give advice on the class and paper. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great course, just not really a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I thought professor Marcus was great and I was fascinated by my research paper topic. I wish, however, that the weekly readings were somehow more integrated into the course (maybe they could be somehow connected to the research paper or there could be a separate paper about them). Also, I wish more background information was provided in class about the time period we were studying. A lot happened in medieval Middle East, and at times I felt lost/overwhelmed without the background information to ground me. ",
            "\u00a0It is what you make of it and how much you engage in the readings. ",

            "\u00a0If you want to learn to write a history paper then YES! ",
            "\u00a0Depends. Professor Marcus is great and the research paper is super rewarding and fascinating. However, the classes that didn't involve the paper were at times dry and difficult to enjoy. We basically just had a massive stack of readings to do during the semester, but they didn't necessarily relate to the final research paper, so it was sometimes hard to feel motivated in class. Also, if you didn't do the readings well enough (the readings are also hard b/c they're most primary sources), it was difficult to follow what was happening in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the history of the Arab world and the early development of religion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Marcus is just really fun to work with, and I especially recommend him if you are afraid of writing a longer research paper like I was. He has a great sense of humor that livens up the course. "
