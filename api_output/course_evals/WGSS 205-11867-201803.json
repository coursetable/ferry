            "\u00a0The class brought to light so many important aspects of how the world we live in works. It took a thematic and historical approach to explain the experiences of embodiment, minorities and the intersection of them. The class was critical and analytical in ways that sharpened my own thinking when reading a text. This course helped me gained a sensitivity towards others and improved articulation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory WGSS theory and methodologies, writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I reread a handful of foundational texts (Foucault, Freud, etc.) and read hundreds (maybe thousands?) of pages in ethnography, historical analysis, and theory. Due to the sheer mass of reading over the course of the semester, I developed strategies to optimize the balance between time spent reading/taking notes and level of understanding (on this front, I recommend printing out readings and annotating by hand rather than taking notes as you read! Much more efficient and left me with a better understanding and a more useful roadmap when I went back to write my final paper). The readings for this course also forced me to interrogate my own ways of thinking about gender, transness, international humanitarian aid, and rhetorics around disability and disease in ways that went far beyond the tumblr/twitter/facebook feminist theory many of us have been exposed to. I definitely experienced a fair amount of growth in this course. It was the on-boarding opportunity I needed to build my confidence in seminars. I'm convinced that if you can make it through a seminar on core WGSS texts, you can make it through a seminar on pretty much anything. ",
            "\u00a0Theoretical foundation of contemporary WGSS without much intersectional feminism. Very basic but informative if youve never been exposed to theory ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the relationship between embodiment and ideology and how imperialism, neoliberalism and gender intersect to form our habits and ideology. Professor Pepi's lectures are straight fire and very insightful to help me understand the course materials intersections better. The class is all about the relationship between texts rather than the texts in themselves, and the class syllabus is very comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many foundational theories of WGSS. This class not only taught me a lot but also allowed me to question a lot of the original ideologies I held and forced me to have a constant dialogue with myself and others. It is a fantastic course ",
            "\u00a0I become more familiar with terms used to discuss gender/sexuality topics. I received a wide range of readings from international perspectives. I see things more critically. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a perfect starter kit for anyone interested in analyzing power dynamics within and stemming from sexuality and gender. The syllabus is stacked with pieces from a canon of literature that I can now recognize when cited in other scholarly work. The class goes from the individual to the political group to the nation state to hegemonic power structures that have dominated society for centuries. Throughout all of this, the class is a space to contest and confront one's own world views and attempt to grab hold of the material through in-class discourse. Through the primarily ethnographic works we read, I learned not only how bodies and gender have been policed and labeled, but also how we must work to actively subvert those very systems. "

            "\u00a0This course was well taught! The readings were not too much, and spoke really well to each other. I reading responses were very helpful and not overly frequent. Class discussion was generally very good, and Prof. Pepi's lectures were helpful. The syllabus is very well constructed, especially the beginning. I would have loved to do more theory and fewer applications towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, well-led discussions, well-organized syllabus ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great syllabus! I left this course with a deeply expanded understanding of what the field of WGSS actually encompasses, and I'm feeling even more excited about and secure in my decision to major.\r\nWeaknesses: In the beginning of the semester I was deeply intimidated by juniors in the course who were further along in the WGSS major and seemed to talk theory and jargon with ease. I wish that more space had been made to voice confusion, difficulty, and misunderstanding. Turned out, the few times the professor asked us questions about the structure/core concepts of a reading, the class had trouble articulating what exactly the author was saying. This course could definitely be improved by a bit more structure in class - maybe spending the first hour charting the argument/key points of each piece collectively, then the next hour in free discussion. ",
            "\u00a0There are only two weaknesses of the course. I think the first one is that many of the readings are from anthropology given Professor Pepi's background, and I wish we had more classic WGSS theory type texts intersecting with the readings from anthropology to balance them out. The second thing I think Professor Pepi could do better is to steer conversation away from unhelpful confusions or conflicts during discussion so that we can focus on discussing the text rather than having polemical political arguments. ",
            "\u00a0The only way in which I imagine this course could be improved would be increasing partner or small group work. It's very intimidating to discuss such sensitive issues in a seminar of multiple people. Once you've had a chance to develop your thoughts in conversation with someone else it's much easier to communicate them to the group as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0the organization of the syllabus was fantastic, pepis expertise built well on theories of embodiment ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course and I loved the readings. I feel that all assignments were purposeful and all helped to facilitate the learning of my coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The discussion was well organized, the readings were great.\r\nWeakness: Can be even more helpful if we can practice using theories to interpret events/politics happening today around us. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fantastic readings every week, great seminar environment, the student-ran presentations were fun and helpful and also not too high-stakes, the syllabus encourages engagement with not only the academia but personal experience and moments in pop culture\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some weeks the readings felt disjointed - I think it would be helpful to have a guiding question under each week topic so we can find our way to a common meaning or connection before class.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! And for non-WGSS majors as well ",
            "\u00a0Yes! (but only if you're willing to do the readings) Also, for first years who might be interested: this is the first required seminar for WGSS majors, and is a great course for getting a grasp on the breadth of theory in the field. If you're attracted to Feminist and Queer Theory but have no experience with theory, take this course instead. ",
            "\u00a0Too much annoying work that doesnt help you with the interesting parts of gender theory. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It is required to take for a WGSS major, but I enjoyed this class and learned much more from it than many of my other WGSS classes. The professor is very knowledgeable and has a clear understanding of the text and what she wants each of us to learn from it. The think pieces are also very helpful to facilitate student engagement. It was a fun and engaging for students of all levels, and is really not that much work. However, I want to warn students from complaining about accessibility of the theory texts. We are the privileged ivy league students that are in the unique position of understanding theory. While they are difficult, WGSS has many classes heavily grounded in critical theory and I believe it is the job of the WGSS professor to help us understand it even though reading it may be difficult. Hopefully, that comment can help students decide whether they want to take the class or not. ",
            "\u00a0I have already and I will continue to. I think this course provides invaluable ways to think about privilege, sex, and gender that everyone at Yale (and in the world) should be exposed to. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely. the wgss majors and other majors blended well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the course is such a delight, and really is a great introduction to WGSS course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this class provides a challenging but accessible theoritical foundation for me, and is also relevant to many of my peers' artistic practice. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Even if you're not a WGSS major (I'm not) this class is full of so much valuable information that has shaped how I view the world and my own position in it. The readings are pieces any social science person should have in their tool belt, and the seminar environment is so warm and worry free. "
