            "\u00a0This course helped me think deeply and critically about Tuscan culture through the lens of film, art history, and literature. It also improved my writing, as each week required a short written assignment. My only criticism is that I do not think the course really improved my Italian language skills: the lecture (instead of discussion) format made it difficult to practice Italian in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me such a connection to the culture and history of Tuscany! I learned valuable skills regarding analysis of art, but what was more important for me was the overall sense of Tuscan identity we gained through the movies, trips, readings, and lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Italian culture, including film, literature, and daily-life! This course bettered my understanding of the Tuscan-way and history of the nation. I studied many films and writings by classic artists and gained new knowledge of the beautiful nation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about the culture, history, tradition, and people of Siena and Tuscany. There is a huge focus on religious aspects of art which I appreciated since I had never been exposed to that before. We also analyzed films and how they showed different interpretations of Toscany and Italy. My favorite part of this course was when they took us on trips both in Siena or Tuscany and we could have real interactions with the history/culture of the area. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave a lot of background to my learning in Tuscany and gave me a sense of depth to everything I was learning while I was there ",
            "\u00a0I do not normally write essays every week, but this course helped me develop the ability to write a 500 word paper in a language with which I was not initially too comfortable. I can now think critically and analyze films and artwork in Italian, a language I only began learning last September. ",
            "\u00a0All about art, culture, and Italian history. There was a lot about catholic religion because it had a huge influence on Italian arts. ",
            "\u00a0I became much more aware of and in tune with Italian, and especially Tuscan, history and culture. I grew to love the region and became a Tuscan myself in a way. I was introduced to the depth and beauty of Italian film, grew to appreciate Tuscan art, and was able to put my experience in Siena in context. ",
            "\u00a0High engagement with Italian culture through not only studying it in a class environment, but also seeing it in historical landmarks. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, we had the incredible opportunity to see artwork that revolutionized their period and influenced Italian culture. In addition, we analyzed pivotal films and read literature from the \"Tre Corone di Firenze,\" Boccaccio, Dante, and Petrarch. This course helped my understanding of Italian language and culture flourish. ",
            "\u00a0This course strengthened my Italian comprehension while introducing me to a rich portion of art, culture, history, and film during my time in Siena. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater appreciation of the rich and storied culture of tuscany "

            "\u00a0Overall, this course was very fun and interesting. I feel like I learned a lot without being stressed about the workload or assignments. I enjoyed all of the films we watched in class. I loved the literature section -- I wish we had the opportunity to read one or two other similar works. However, the best part of the class was by far the group excursions -- the opportunity to visit a wide range of incredible places with Professor Marcus or a another qualified guide was incredible. I only have two criticisms of the course. The first is that the course was advertised on the syllabus as a \"discussion,\" when it actually was more of a lecture. Although I found Professor Marcus' lectures incredibly insightful, I wish there had been more of a chance to express my thoughts and hear those of my classmates as well as to practice my spoken Italian. Professor Marcus did occasionally ask questions; however, they tended to be questions with one or two correct answers versus questions that are open-ended or facilitate a real \"discussion.\" My other recommendation is either to eliminate the final essay or assign it sooner in the program; I believe the final exam and final project should have been the true end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course really took advantage of us being in Italy with the trips we went on that connected to our study. I wasn't the biggest fan of the movies that were in English at the beginning of the course, and I feel like we maybe could have accomplished the same in fewer lectures at the very start. However, once the course and the movies changed completely into Italian I thought everything was amazing, the only thing I would maybe like to see a little more of is student engagement during class (maybe some small group discussions, or open discussion among the entire class with the professor more as a moderator). ",
            "\u00a0The course was very enjoyable and I was very happy with pretty much everything about it! I struggled a little understanding the first few guided-tours of the summer (all of which were in Italian), but as the summer progressed, my comprehension of the language significantly improved and the tours were much more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized and gave us many opportunities to see art, churches, places, etc that we would never have gotten otherwise. The final exam and video project were also very reasonable for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed watching all the films, and visiting different museums/cultural sights and having previous background knowledge of the works of art! I think an improvement could be the timing of the course; if it could take place earlier in the afternoon, I think it would allow for more free time in the afternoon to explore Siena and neighboring cities on our own. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were all very informative and thorough. My only suggestion would be to make the post-film discussions more of a discussion and allow for more student input. ",
            "\u00a0This course was useful in understanding the context of Siena and its history to respect the culture. I also enjoyed the film analysis, however I wish the first two films had also been directed by Italian directors and in Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes difficult when the course is solely taught in Italian, but as the course continued, I got the hang of it. ",
            "\u00a0I loved all the trips we went on during the trip. I felt they were informative and eye-opening and I highly enjoyed them. I was fascinated by the cathedrals and the art that we saw, and I thought every one of the guides wasfor lack of a better word in Englishbravissimo. I also did enjoy most of the films we watched and was happy to be introduced to Italian film. Some of the in-class lessons could have been more engaging and seemed like they could drag on a bit, but I appreciated the fact that everything was conducted in Italian. I think that the class could be made more interesting if it focused less on film analysis and more on actual historymaps and battles and life in ancient and medieval cultures and civilizations in the area, sort of like what we learned about with the Etruscans or like the archaeological things we saw in the lower levels of Santa Maria della Scala. But then again, that just could be because that is what I am interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: actually interacting with the landscape we study\r\nWeakness: none. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very strong, but it would have been interesting to have more diversity in the films that we had watched, as we had watched several from the same directors. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging and interesting since we were able to see much of the art, film locations, and historical sites that we had studied, in person and appreciate them closely. Having class everyday was a little bit heavy-loaded at times, but it was enjoyable, and I think appropriate for an intensive course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were right after lunch in a hot and sometimes dark room which was not conducive to staying awake, some of the lectures were slow but enjoyable. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. I learned a lot about Tuscan culture and, through this course, was given the opportunity to visit many incredible historical sites and cities. However, I would warn potential students that, if you do not like art history and museums, you should not take this course. ",
            "\u00a0As part of the study abroad trip to Siena, 100%. Even though it meant more class time compared to the L1/L2 students who didn't take this course, the extra trips gave our class a great way to bond and by the end we were all really close, something I think would have been harder without this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! This course was enjoyable and educational! There is nothing like learning about the Italian culture than BEING, LIVING, and LEARNING in Italy! I had a wonderful summer with Professor Millicent and left very lucky to be taking her class. This class required much homework on the weekends, but was lighter during the weekdays and the lessons were entertaining and productive! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class in Italy because you're given many chances to see amazing works of art, buildings, and historical monuments while also learning so much about the history behind them. It gives a much more in depth explanation as to why they were created and I came out of it with a much greater appreciation for them. Penny is also a fantastic professor who is so sweet and cares so much about the topics covered in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really great class and an immersive experience of Italian culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would because it was a very complete course on the history and culture of Tuscany ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the history, culture, and film portion of this program were integral to my experience in Italy. I felt I could engage with Siena and Tuscany in ways I wouldn't have without historical background and some cultural understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! What a great experience! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. The length of the lessons was more than balanced out by the extra experiences we had through the class, and the heightened appreciation for them, as opposed to the L1/2 students without a culture class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Marcus makes the eight weeks of studying Italian culture not only enjoyable, but also an experience to look forward to. Her essay assignment requirements further the fulfilling nature of the course in making students reflect on visits and topics discussed and find their relevance in their own lives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Marcus' joy and passion for Tuscan culture was infectious, and encouraged me to be fully enthralled with every lesson and every work we analyzed and discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course since it is well-organized, interesting, and introduces you to classics in Italian art, literature, and films that capture aspects of the experience in Toscana. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because you get to be in italy! "
