I learned a lot from the guest speakers and appreciated how Dr. Vasiliou encouraged us to explore topics that we were interested in with the various assignments. The Friday discussions were nice when we had specific assignments or speakers attend but sometimes I was confused on what exactly was happening in them, so some extra clarity regarding those would be useful.

I learned some things but do not think my overall knowledge of toxicology improved throughout this course.  There were also no exams throughout this course, as all the exams were changed to papers.  This was fine, but should have been reflected in the syllabus with specific due dates and instructions. The debates could have also been improved with better class interaction and participation. ",

            "\u00a0The course was interesting and I learned a lot. It is a tough balance since toxicology can be a very science (chemistry, biochemistry) heavy topic, but there are no science prerequisites for the course- I think the class did a good job of trying to balance giving the science information that we needed vs. the class' ability level, however I do think we could have gone a bit more into depth on the chem/biochem side of things. I appreciated the emphasis on debates, essays rather than eams "
