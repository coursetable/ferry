As long as the project is approved by your senior advisor, they trust you to complete it and get it done- I only had a few meetings with my senior advisor and things went smoothly and well. My advisor was busy/traveling often, so that was the only frustrating part, but that is understandable and we as students just need to work with their very important schedules. "

As long as the project is approved by your senior advisor, they trust you to complete it and get it done- I only had a few meetings with my senior advisor and things went smoothly and well. My advisor was busy/traveling often, so that was the only frustrating part, but that is understandable and we as students just need to work with their very important schedules (at least to an extent). But either way, the requirements are reasonable and will vary among advisors and projects, but it was really fun developing this app and getting to present at the demo day in the CEID at the end of the year!
