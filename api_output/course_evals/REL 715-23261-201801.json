            "\u00a0Dan is an exemplary teaching fellow.  He was extremely well prepared, knowledgeable, engaged, accessible and had a contagious interest in the material he was teaching.  He provided a great supplement to Professor Hardy's lectures.  Also, I've never had a TF who structured the time of sections better than Dan did; there was a substantial supplemental lesson and real coverage of material each session.  He'll make a wonderful professor, I'm sure. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best teacher's I've had in my time here. Not just brilliant, but a good instructor and successful at engaging the students. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how Daniel took time to help us think critically as historians, synthesize course lecture and reading materials, expand our resting list as desired, and keep both a broad and specific view of each weeks' themes. ",
            "\u00a0He was great!! ",
            "\u00a0Daniel was great. He was clear in what we were talking about and illuminated the topics well. He also was easy to reach out to if need and gave clear feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nKnowledgeable, friendly, energetic, engaged with the students - interested in the material, pressing hard for us to consider the issues in depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nSometimes the discussion in section felt like a guessing game - Mr. Bohac had something in mind that he wanted us to say, and we were all guessing what it was - which felt slightly unproductive for a graduate school discussion section. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-informed and structured sections thoughtfully ",
            "\u00a0Dan was absolutely, absolutely fantastic. I cannot say enough about him.  Whereas I didn't get a ton out of this class in lecture, I got SO MUCH, I got EVERYTHING, out of his section. He tied all our readings together and pointed out bigger historical trends in them in ways that were tangible and exciting. He was great at stimulating conversation and monitoring discussion, and led us towards a climax in each class with amazing pointed questions. I swear, every time I was in his section, I felt as if I was in an episode of National Treasure, and he was Nicholas Cage leading us all, through the power of suggestion, into an unbelievable realization about things we hadn't even realized were behind the  texts!\r\n\r\nHe is so knowledgeable but also incredibly energetic. He is so good at what he does and clearly was born to be an educator, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Daniel was awesome. I can't think of a weakness honestly. He is helpful and sraightforward. He really opened up the text in section and showed us the dynamics underneath in a way that was really informative and interesting. He is friendly and a natural leader. I really enjoyed section with him. It was one of my favorite weekly meetings. ",
            "\u00a0He was quite helpful! ",
            "\u00a0I did not have Daniel as a section leader. However, I found him personable, kind, diligent, and helpful with questions. \r\n I believe he served the class well. "
