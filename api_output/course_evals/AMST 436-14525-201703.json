            "\u00a0I gained a lot of critical thinking ad analysis skills in this class. The reading responses really pushed me to consider how texts from different weeks across different topics informed each other and changed my understanding of the texts. We had a lot of good discussions in this class. Most of the reading was also very worth the while. This course does a good job of bridging the gap between theory and action/activism. ",
            "\u00a0Very deep engagement with beautiful texts, texts I was not exposed to read in other courses ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to engage with a broad array of texts under the theme Antiracism & Racial Justice. I appreciate the attention to creative and imaginative literature that Professor HoSang built into the course - poems, videos, songs, and art were just as important in our discussions as more academic ethnic studies texts. This class was really rewarding in allowing us to discuss themes that felt high-stakes and have critical importance in our contemporary moment. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped us get a survey of important theories related to racial justice and the assignments allowed us to put these theories in conversation with each other to gain new insight from considering them together. We also were able to study various historical social movements and many different kinds of sources including cultural production. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives us a brief, non-exhaustive, but deeply vital overview of how antiracism and racial justice have been imagined in the U.S. over the past century. It is incredibly creative and expansive in its view of what constitutes as antiracism and activism. This course opened up new avenues in my thinking about how to move forward in the fight for racial justice. ",
            "\u00a0I became a stronger writer and learned about past and present racial justice movements "

            "\u00a0I really liked the way Prof HoSang structured the class. The outlines he printed for class were very useful. I also liked the way discussions were led. Biweekly response papers were not always easy but were very useful. Sometimes it was hard to get good discussions started, but not so often. We also often started class with a relevant song or video or story which was great. ",
            "\u00a0Due to the fact that the texts we were engaging with were very rich and the class was broken down into very useful sections with the discussion of these texts being at the end, maybe it would be best to reduce the amount of reading in order to focus on the meaning of each reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-structured and clearly organized. It offers materials in a way that is not offered in other classes, because it covers anti-racism across social movements and racial/ethnic groups. As a senior, there is often at this point a lot of overlap in course sources, but with the exception of a couple of papers, I had not read any of the material from this class already and was able to discover many new authors and theories. I also think that the workload was fair. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing amazing course. \r\n\r\nThe incentives to read and read well were amazing; the emphasis on bringing texts together to create new ideas in the response papers was so useful, and I really grew a lot writing them; the open ended final project was a joy. \r\n\r\nOften, there wasn't enough time to really get into the meat of some of the arguments, because we tried to do so much each class. I really really valued that we took time to make sure we all understood the basic elements of each argument. But we spent less time than I wish we did comparing/critiquing arguments, disagreeing productively with each other, etc. \r\n\r\nThe reading list was great! And the introductory class was so incredible, and such a good frame for the semester. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is that the readings were intersectional and were often accompanied by other forms of media, such as short articles, songs and youtube videos. As a result, I really enjoyed the readings and was encouraged to really engage with the course. ",
            "\u00a0The texts we read for this course were incredible and were definitely the strongest part of the course. The class discussion was also great - I enjoyed the small group discussions and Professor HoSang's inclusion of videos, songs, and poems to supplement our other texts. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class (and Prof HoSang). It's engaging, HoSang makes a lot of effort for his classes, and really important subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course - Professor HoSang is amazing. One of my classmates once described this course as kind of feeling like a reading group/book club, which I think is a very accurate description. The social labor of reading and discussing ideas together is very much the backbone of this course. The reading load is not light, but it's doable. One 2-3 page response paper required every other week. Take it, if anything, because Professor HoSang is great. ",
            "\u00a0LOVED this class. If you get a chance to take a class with Professor HoSang you should do it. Interesting material taught in a thoughtful way. The workload was very manageable: reading responses every two weeks and a final project with a creative option. HoSang gives lots of feedback, so by the time the final rolls around you're really prepared. ",
            "\u00a0Professor HoSang is brilliant and wonderful. Go to office hours! The class was greatgave me so many new good frameworks for thinking about struggles for freedom and justice, the importance of imagination for any of these struggles, etc. Conversations were lively and the reading list was great. Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class is great for anyone who cares about racial justice and wants to read scholarly, intersectional articles on the subject. If you are someone who is not planning on doing the readings and wants to speak from experience, this class is not for you. This class requires a high degree of intellectualism and is focused more on insights drawn from creative sources than tangible insights derived from personal experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. Professor HoSang is amazing  he is generous, kind, wise, and incredibly eloquent. Every sentence that comes out of his mouth is a fully-formed gem. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take Antiracism Racial Justice and Freedom! You will read some of the most incredible, life-changing texts in this course and Professor HoSang is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The format of the class is really straight forward, and the material you are given an opportunity to engage with is truly amazing, while it may feel like there is a ton of reading, all of it is significant in getting a wider understanding of the topics you are presented with each week.
