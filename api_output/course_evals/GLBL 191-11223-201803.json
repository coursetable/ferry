            "\u00a0I learned more advanced data analysis techniques in Stata. I specifically learned a lot about conducting descriptive analyses of data and evaluating relationships between variables in models. ",
            "\u00a0Learned lots of STATA. How to clean data (ex; deal with missing values), descriptively analyze data for variable operationalization, and a tiny bit on regressions and model-fitting at the end, but I think this year was more rushed than most. ",
            "\u00a0Skills: data management, descriptive analysis, regression analysis, time and long term project management, self-directed work/independent inquiry, asking questions that yield constructive responses. Knowledge: Stata minutiae, some components of statistics relevant to social scientific analysis. Insights: better equipped to evaluate professional researchers work / decisions. ",

            "\u00a0Lots of STATA ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about STATA! ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO much in this course. In addition to developing a better understanding of how to code in Stata, this course taught me the need to constantly gut check in data science. So far, this is the only Data Science course at Yale where the professor has discussed the many different ways you can go wrong during your data analysis, and the questions you need to constantly be asking yourself to ensure you're doing the right thing. \r\n\r\nThe best thing this course has helped me develop (though I still need to develop it further) is care while analyzing data. It's a huge responsibility, and you NEED to know what you're doing, and you NEED to know the mistakes that you might be making. ",
            "\u00a0I developed some very practical skills in using stata to analyze data. These skills enables more sophisticated and nuanced data manipulation for real-life research. "

            "\u00a0Strength was that I feel pretty comfortable with a very useful program. Weakness is that we didn't receive much feedback from our work. I think I learned a lot from the p-sets, but it was hard to tell without getting any explicit comments/ grades. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be more structured to provide consistent feedback and adequate learning development for the students. It gave a decent amount of knowledge on how to use STATA. It was disorganized and derailed during the semester and did not adequately help students who were struggling. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that this course is small and takes place in a long seminar slot. I would've been willing to spend even more time in class to get through all the material, since we were not able to cover everything in the regular semester. The problem sets were challenging but fun to work through. The final data project, completed step by step throughout the semester, allowed us to apply our new skills in an interesting way. This course is one of the most practically relevant classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm really glad I was able to learn these data skills to use in future research both at Yale and beyond. However, the organization of the course this semester was not great--in the future, JT should hire a TF at the beginning of the semester to grade our work and possibly offer review sessions. I really appreciate how much time JT invests in each of the 191 students for personal meetings and office hours, but there was so much demand for his time that often I was unable to secure a meeting slot. Designated 191 office hour time, along with a TF, would improve this course significantly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JT -- he's amazing. Really fun PSETs/one project. Low-stress but a course where you'll definitely learn a lot.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Content was a bit rushed at the end (with regressions). I felt like I wasn't always necessarily retaining everything (and I know others felt the same or worse). But that (a) is a personal thing (b) might also just not be true. \r\n\r\nIf I didn't already know how great JT was, I might've looked into S&DS 230 and tried to compare them a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: JT, covers material not covered in other classes, in textbooks, or on the internet that is extremely helpful for social science research, numerous opportunities for in-depth feedback. Weaknesses: very dependent on feedback (meaning you may often be waiting on feedback to move forward), assignments not graded in a timely manner, slightly disorganized. Overall, the strengths definitely outweigh the weaknesses, which are just a product of the unreasonable number of demands on an academic's time. ",
            "\u00a0Great instruction, just very unorganized. It seem like JT has too much on his plate with two classes and consulting projects etc. In order to improve class, he can't expect to just shoulder all this load- he has to cut back on commitments. I can imagine this course being really stellar with more organization, already it is great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- got to work with cool real-world datasets\r\n- format of the classes made it easy to follow\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- if you got lost in class, you could get a little stuck\r\n- it took a long time to get things handed back ",
            "\u00a0You learned STATA and how to conduct research to a ridiculous extent. Wonderful ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is it its very personalized, and you get a lot of one on one time with JT. One of the major weaknesses of this course is that we got no feedback for any of the psets except the first one (no grades or anything), or on the research assignments. Also, the directions for the research assignment were not very clear, and we ended up cramming all the stuff about regressions to the very last makeup lecture. I think this class would benefit from being shorter (maybe 1:15 minutes), and then having a fifty minute study hall where all the students can work together and ask JT questions because I'm sure a lot of us had the same questions on the pset. ",
            "\u00a0I wished Prof. Thomas had a teaching fellow to help him grade the assignments and supplement his teachings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: As was mentioned above, this course allowed its students to develop an intuition for how to conduct (___secure?/fullproff?) data analysis. JT would ask us to do something in class, then tell us WHY we probably did it wrong. In so doing, he showed us the holes that researchers constantly fall into, then taught us how to avoid them. This knowledge and these skills are INVALUABLE. \r\n\r\nWeakness: It would have been nice to receive more feedback. ",
            "\u00a0It would be more helpful if we can stay on schedule and get more timely feedback on homework. "

            "\u00a0Yes. You learn really useful skills that are not really taught anywhere else. I have already started learning what I learned in the class in my independent research. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course if you are looking for a class that fulfills the research design requirement. There are easier courses out there to fulfill that requirement for the Global Affairs major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a fantastic option for the GLBL research design class or for anyone who is interested in using statistical analysis in their future research. I am very glad I took this course and am happy to recommend it to others. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Was very fun and not stressful at all. Learned a ton of very useful information everyone should know. JT is a gem. He explains things so clearly I would not be worried about not being a stats whiz going into it. No cons. Maybe just look into the other similar course (S&DS 230) because there are some key differences that might matter to you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in social scientific research, this course is a great way to connect what you've learned in the classroom with what you hope to do in the field. JT is an amazing professor/mentor and is extremely invested in your success. The meetings with him are an excellent opportunity to learn from an excellent person. If you're not interested in social scientific research, this course is probably more/different work than you're looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I did not think I would be into statistical coding but I really learned a lot and now want to go further in the field. JT has really made this material accessible and I feel like I'm pretty well prepared moving forward ",
            "\u00a0You get to work with real-world datasets which are cool. Professor Thomas cares a lot and tries to meet with everyone at least once every week or two about their project. Unfortunately, he's also quite busy, meaning he often doesn't grade things until a while later (I STILL haven't gotten most of my work back yet) ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is the only course at Yale where I have developed a deep understanding of the many mistakes one can make while conducting data analysis. This intuition is invaluableI wish all classes at Yale instilled it in it's studentsbut alas, take this course which actually does. \r\n\r\nThe final research project was also fun. \r\n\r\nI would recommend this course to students with some background in coding though (Stat 230, CS 112 etc). The psets can be really hard if coding is completely fresh. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a hands-on data analysis class, this course would give you the skills and knowledge to deal with imperfect data that you are likely to encounter in field research. However, there is very little statistic theory involved, and skills in math is not relevant. At last, if you need a research design credit for global affairs major requirement, this is a good choice - JT is really helpful and some skills learned in this class can be applied to senior year cap stone as well.
