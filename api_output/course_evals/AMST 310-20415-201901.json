            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the syllabus and Professor Reed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly knowledgeable professor, engaging and diverse readings, most course flexibility I have ever seen in a class at Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Only once a week, classmates could make it through without reading so we did not get to deeply engage with some texts as I would have liked ",
