            "\u00a0I've never had a course so committed to close reading and engaging specifically with a text internally. I hadn't realized the extent to which my literature classes were concerned with the lessons of a book or their connection to historical events; obviously those are also important, but it was beyond refreshing to approach these texts as pieces of art worthy of independent examination, and I got a lot out of it -- my critical reading skills improved over just a few months. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my writing and critical reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to close-read in various types of papers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed ways of critical thinking and learned how to develop strong arguments for my essays. I learned how to find common themes among seemingly different texts and also ways in which it is sometimes best to pick one stance and argue it strongly instead of being ambiguous. ",
            "\u00a0This course develops writing skills in a variety of types of essays.  It also develops reading and interpretive skills. ",
            "\u00a0English 127 with Professor Smith taught me how to engage in close analysis of a text and how to put history and literature in conversation with one another. In addition, I truly felt as if the writing assignment prompts and the structure of the class discussions helped me sharpen my analytical essay skills and improve the clarity of my work. ",
            "\u00a0As is the case with all introductory level English classes at Yale, this course is an excellent way to build writing and critical readings skills. Specifically, the classs three essays focus on close reading, dealing with historical documents, and interacting with critical sources. Over the course of the class, I learned not only how to write more academically, but also how to approach American literature. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a more critical literary eye through the study of American literature. ",

            "\u00a0I thought Prof. Smith's English 127 seminar was excellent, maybe one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. This was a solid group of students in the seminar, and the structure of the course enabled some excellent discussions that benefitted everyone who participated. Prof. Smith did a great job spearheading everything and guiding us to uncovering why these texts have the effects on us that they do. Aside from the Moby-Dick days, the workload between classes wasn't so bad, and the reading responses encouraged some consistent low-stress engagement. The 75 minute blocks never felt long. ",
            "\u00a0Terrific syllabus, well organized class, just the right balance of teacher guidance vs. student led discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smith told us near the end of class that he used to teach the class a different way, with historical context. This semester, it seemed as though we were close-reading in a vacuum, understanding very little of the historical context of critical pieces of literature. I did not find this an effective way to learn, nor, I think, did many of my peers. I don't know that I see the value of a survey course in American Literature that simply asks students to close-read single paragraphs for most of class. The course had the potential to be better - I found myself craving, the entire time, for even a bit of historical context, or just context at all. I also think the essay assignments should be reevaluated - it felt like all three were the same kind of close-reading assignment, and I would have loved a less constricting format. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a wide range of texts from a diverse range of authors, and I felt that I got sufficient exposure to important (and lesser known) works from the American literary canon. There are texts that I would have liked to have spent more time on, such as The Crying of Lot 49, but I understand that it is hard to cover many works while giving each the time it deserves. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Smith, syllabus\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class discussions ",
            "\u00a0Professor Smith always led very well organized and engaging discussions.  I think he mentioned that in the past the course involved more use of presentations, but I really liked the course as it was this year (mostly focused on discussion). ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the greatest strengths of this course was how focused each class discussion was. I felt as if I walked away from each class with a new insight into the text, or a deeper message that I was supposed take away--even if we had spent the entire time looking at only one or two passages. In addition, I loved how each class really felt connected. Even when we completely shifted genres or authors, there was a great sense of cohesion, and I found that we were constantly referring back to other works we had read. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of the subject material covered in the course is a point in its favor. We cover poetry and prose in long and short forms. Additionally, the manner in which the course approaches academic writing is a key strength. Its main weakness is the class size: it was three or four people too crowded to make a truly engaging seminar, but the professor did his best to include everyone. Its really a matter of chance as to how many students enroll in each section. ",
            "\u00a0Although the free-form nature of the section was nice, and I appreciated the unstructured nature of discussion, I would have liked more structure through the writing process. Draft due dates, etc. It felt, at times, as if the specifics of the papers were explained the week they were due. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I'd absolutely recommend ENGL 127, particularly with Professor Smith. This was my first English class at Yale, and it definitely refined the way I approach texts. I think my critical reading, writing, and discussion skills all tangibly improved. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend to both english majors and non-english majors. It's a great way to read some great books. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class, although if you're an English or American Studies major that's probably not too helpful, since it's more or less required. I will say that I was surprised by the heavy emphasis on close-reading in this course (very, very heavy) without much context/criticism provided, and that it felt like Moby Dick was 90% of the syllabus and we still very rarely examined it critically from a modern standpoint (again, historical context/literary criticism could've been crucial here). I never really gained much insight into many of the works we read, and it felt like Professor Smith's main goal was to guide us to the points he wanted to make, rather than allowing students' thoughts to guide discussion (though, in fairness, students, myself included, are never so great at guiding anything, particularly when they feel uninspired). The class atmosphere never really felt open to legitimate debate, or to questioning why we were reading something, and what its value was. It's an intro class, so plenty of people do take it for fun/for their WR credit/etc - if you're one of those, I would say to look elsewhere. Professor Smith's grading is challenging, not that that should necessarily be a deterrent, but I would say I never felt like I was getting much out of what I put in, and I felt I put in a lot. I can't speak to other sections of the class, but maybe there's a class that's structured differently. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they want exposure to works of American literature and want to learn how to structure essays. ",
            "\u00a0For students who have a passion for American literature, I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because Professor Smith led the discussions during class very well, and the texts had an interesting variety. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student (in fact, I've already recommended it to virtually everyone I know)! I loved the range of texts that we read, and the discussions were consistently engaging, inspiring, and eye-opening. Even for the couple of texts that I had already read, I found myself walking away with a much deeper and fuller understanding of the work than I had previously known. I also loved the Beinecke component of the course, and found that the type of primary source analysis we engaged in really enhanced my understanding of the works we looked at. Overall, it has been one of the greatest courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to any student planning to major in English. Compared to all the other 120-level English courses, the diversity both of the type of text covered and of the backgrounds of the authors is staggering. Long and short form poetry and prose are covered, by authors from all walks of American life. Plus, Professor Smith is one of Yales most compelling literature educators. Dont miss this class. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if a student is confident in their writing capabilities, and is confident enough socially to contribute in section without fear or embarrassment. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It is a good survey course ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course! Its an excellent survey of American literature that examines a handful of periods and styles of writing. "
