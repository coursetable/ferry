            "\u00a0I learned how food is a reflection of our nation's relationships to race and migration within the national and outside. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about food justice as it relates to ethnicity, race, and migration, covering particular themes like access, immigrant labor, authenticity and appropriation, Indigeneity. Class discussion helped me to think about my own positionality in these conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Critical but sympathetic discourse\r\nThe use of different objects such as food to understand history ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of food systems and of the way in which these food systems are directly complicit in oppression. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first American Studies course and I found it really interesting to study patterns of history and culture as they related to food. ",
            "\u00a0The course teaches you tons of information about the food industry from the farm workers to the farm owners to the supermarkets to the policy makers to the consumers to restaurant workers to non-profit organizations. Very detailed about the politics behind the Food Chain and highlights the social inequalities evident in these systems. ",
            "\u00a0In Food Race & Migration, students are introduced to the racialized history behind food and the transnational forces of capitalism and colonialism that have shaped the world of food as we know it. We learned how systems of power are enacted through consuming and marketing food. Through this course, I learned how to meaningfully engage with my peers around the assigned readings and how to interrogate my previous relationship with food and food consumption. ",
            "\u00a0general comprehension of the definition of food system, food justice, food security, food sovereignty\r\nsense of complexity of food webs and vocabulary to think and speak critically about American foodways ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me the great opportunity to explore themes and theories from other ER&M classes but through the lens of food something tangible, universal, and familiar. One of my biggest takeaways included being able to distinguish the difference between movements working towards food security, food justice, and food sovereignty. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings, class discussions, and activities we did in class. If anything I wish we'd received more guidance for the final project ",
            "\u00a0The class has a great syllabus and covers a broad range of topics related to food and race. The class felt a little bit too big to have productive conversations at time, and I felt like a lot of people showed up to class not having done the readings. Further, we were assigned to attend talks by authors we had read, which were really enriching. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Sources - great texts that provided insight into multiple different food systems\r\n- Speakers - we happened to have 3 very relevant speakers this semester who aided my understanding of food systems and the roles that they play in global politics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Final project - the final project was not well explained, and was disorganized in its creation and production\r\n- Unclear guidelines - we did not receive clear expectations on the vast majority of our major assignments ",
            "\u00a0I liked how this class was very collaborative and involved a lot of in put from students, but sometimes found discussions unstructured. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a very high reading load but, because we only meet once a week, it feels like in each class we are only skimming the surface. Either there could be less readings, allowing for a more in depth conversation of the assigned texts, or we could have more classes. I think that the reading responses were a really good way of having students synthesize the readings and a good way of engendering interactions between students. The final project and the group presentations provide really good opportunities for students to practice their public speaking skills. The research papers were also very interesting and open ended enough for students to feel unbridled in their writing practice. ",
            "\u00a0This course facilitates students taking it as a \"gut.\" Unfortunately, this meant that engagement was fairly low and discussions were surface level at best. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: fascinating readings, often fruitful discussion, really cool engagement with speakers/visiting professors\r\nweaknesses: volume of readings slightly unrealistic for course, discussion sometimes dragged (when it didnt it was great), vague final project without much structure or guidance ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings for this class a lot, I thought they were interdisciplinary and some were incredibly inspiring. One thing I would have liked was for us to spend more time in class discussing policies I felt like our conversations were often guided by questions about how we as consumers can make a difference by choosing to buy a certain way at the supermarket or by having conversations with people around us to raise consciousness about some of the issues we talked about in class, but I felt like we could go deeper and talk about political trends throughout history and how to make change in the policy realm.

            "\u00a0yes! I really enjoyed this course and learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tran has a heart of gold and anyone at Yale should try to take a class with her. She is approachable and helpful despite her busy schedule. Her flexibility and the way she went about structuring classes really brought everything together nicely for me. Everyone was engaged and we had very meaningful conversations that I will remember in every interaction I have when shopping at the supermarket or even eating a meal. I would absolutely recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any other student, because of how relevant the course material is to every single person's life, and because the syllabus provide so many useful and interesting resources. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student.  We did not receive clear guidelines on many of our projects and it seemed that attention was payed not to the substance of our work but rather to whether or not they were completed in adherence to logistical guidelines. ",
            "\u00a0This course is engaging and low-pressure, I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely fun with the in-class exercise and assignments. The readings are pretty new and good to read, and sometimes, you get to meet the authors. Unfortunately, class discussion falls flat a good amount of the time. Take this class if you care a lot about food, otherwise, you'll probably get bored or not care to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are really comfortable with discussion seminars. If you are not willing to engage with other students and with oftentimes dense readings, you should not take this course. Otherwise this is a really amazing opportunity to learn about an unrecognized discourse around food and race. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, but the class is really made by the students. The syllabus lends itself to skimming/skipping readings and even class, so the students tended not to be engaged. I would not take the class again as it was composed this past semester, but, of course, that is something that will vary every year. ",
            "\u00a0yes! wholeheartedly. a fantastic course for anyone in any major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It strikes that golden balance of being really intellectually fulfilling while still being very manageable time-wise. "
