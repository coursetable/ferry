            "\u00a0I learned a useful framework for thinking about scientific writing, which I think has already improved my writing process. The course was also an opportunity to get feedback on in-progress writing projects from peers and the instructor - and I noticed in the process of workshopping drafts that I could also apply my new writing skills to being better at talking to others about their writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed writing skills by practicing writing, reviewing drafts, and participating in roundtable discussions. ",
            "\u00a0How to develop a narrative within the constraints of a scientific paper or grant; how to effectively edit your writing "

        [
            "\u00a0I appreciate that this course was designed so that we could work on writing projects (grants and papers) that we already had to do, and it created a useful external structure for getting these things done. The readings were useful and well-chosen, and the organization of the course from week to week made a lot of sense and aligned with the progression of our big writing projects - moving us from how to organize the overall structure and flow of a paper, to finer-scale details of editing.\r\n\r\nIn class, it usually felt like there was only so much mileage we could get out of discussing the readings - this was useful up to a point, but I learned the most when we had something hands-on to do. The most effective class sessions were either when we had an activity to do (e.g. editing example sentences as a group) or were workshopping each other's work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fantastic. I learned so much! I learned things that I did not even know were a problem in my writing.\r\nI wouldn't say the course had any weaknesses, but I would suggest that some of the deadlines be moved around a little. I found that the workload came in waves (either I was writing frantically for several weeks or not writing at all), but that is also true of many courses.\r\n\r\nI also know it is difficult with so much writing and so many students, but I would have liked to received more detailed feedback on my writing, especially in the draft phases. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that is is tailored to natural science students, particularly E&EB, and teaches us how to write in this field. The grant-writing section is very useful and information not easily gotten elsewhere. One weakness is that a lot of the readings available on science writing are for writing experimental papers, as opposed to review or proposals/prospectus, and doing both have different demands. ",
            "\u00a0I loved using the Schimel book as an outline for the course - it was a useful resource for assignments and I plan to use it for all future writing. There was a great balance between workshopping our pieces, more formal lectures, and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The mix of reading, workshopping, and working on our actual papers worked well in the context of a course designed to better your writing; smaller writing assignments consisting of writing one or two paragraphs of manuscripts at a time might generate better feedback than reading a classmate's entire manuscript in one sitting, that we can incorporate in our final drafts. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Writing is such an essential skill in science, and this course is a great opportunity to make concrete improvements and feel better prepared to take on graduate school writing projects. I would love to see the E&EB department offer more skills-based graduate courses like this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student. I think everyone could benefit from what is taught and applied in this course. ",
            "\u00a0It is highly recommended if you have ideas for a grant and a paper to write, and a great way to set deadlines and get feedback. Also very useful for learning how to teach writing to others and edit writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was extremely helpful for students preparing grants and papers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since it made me very aware of the specific weaknesses in my writing, and it is good to always be striving to be better writers and communicators. "
