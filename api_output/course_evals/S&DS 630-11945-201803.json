It also improved some of my mathematical proof skills and coding skills with the homework. With the foundations of the class, and such a broad overview of the many different exciting techniques, I feel that I can read any paper of optimization and know more or less what they are talking about. Very very good course, probably my favorite one this semester. ",

            "\u00a0I think the course gives a very good overview of a lot of important topics in optimization theory. The fact that the course is heavily theory based may deter some students, but I think that building a theoretical base is important rather than just focusing on applications. That said, I think the course could be improved by having some additional 'motivating examples' to give students a better idea of the type of problem that a certain technique would be applied to. Even though lectures might not cover any actual solution to these problems I think students would be better able to connect with the theoretical material if they were given a few more 'real' examples as motivation.\r\n\r\nThe course project is a good way to help students think about optimization in their own field of interest. While I appreciate the open ended nature of the project, I think that some additional guidance could be given during the term regarding some things such as general expectations for the main archetypes of projects that arise. ",
