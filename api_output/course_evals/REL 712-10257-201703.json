            "\u00a0When I think of Burton's teaching style, I can only remember strengths and a positive experience. He goes out of his way to make sure that students understand and are not left behind. He also facilitates the class discussion really well. ",
            "\u00a0Burt was wholly inept. He was regularly confused in section, unable to answer questions, so nervous that he was red and sweaty by the end of our meeting. When Kate subbed for him, the difference was night and day. The quality of these three TFs was so vast - it was not really fair to those of us who had to sit through Burt's confusion. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this section with Burt was not helpful. The material felt incredibly new to Burt and hard to understand. Many of our questions in this section were left unanswered. When we expressed the material as hard to understand Burt resorted to us trying to answer our own questions, even when we said we didn't understand. \r\n\r\nIn all the sections, there was one powerpoint on the day Professor Beeley came to observe. It was probably the best facilitated section of the entire semester. The rest of the sections lacked organization and adequate preparation. \r\n\r\nBurt was available in the refectory for office hours which was a strength. ",
            "\u00a0Burt means really well and I could see him improve a lot during his first semester as a TF. Though I gave him a negative review after when Prof. Beeley sent out an evaluation after only the first section meeting, I would say I now have a much more positive opinion of him as a TF. Burt definitely gets the \"most improved\" award from me. ",
            "\u00a0Burt was an eager and knowledgeable teacher. He was always extremely prepared for our class periods together, and he wanted to give us creative ways to engage with our readings and material. He gave us as much time for questions as we wanted, and helped answer all of our questions. He was also extremely willing to share additional resources that he thought might be relevant and helpful to answering our questions. For papers, for example, he was happy to send us resources that he knew would be directly relevant to our research. \r\n\r\nBurt was available to help us with our writing by meeting with us and going over topics, and he would also point us happily in the direction of the writing center. However, his own sense of how to help us with our writing for class was limited, and I felt like I yearned for more direction about what kind of paper he and Beeley were looking for as I went about writing. ",
            "\u00a0I think Burt did a good job of both reviewing information learned in class and discussing the assigned readings for the section. For the most part, I liked how he came up with different activities to facilitate discussion (arguing for Irenaeus or Valentinus), though I think our section had the best discussions when we were all together in one group. ",
            "\u00a0He was not familiar with most of the material. Often times he did not know the answers to certain questions and was not able to explain a subject. His office hours were short and often not easy to book. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Burton's love for teaching is clear in the section I was in. He listens to student's feedback and makes adjustments so that everyone's needs are met to the best of his abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Burt made every effort to be available to students outside of class. He was very accessible via email and in person during office hours. He cared about us succeeding in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Burt is awesome. He really came into his own as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Caring, present and eager to do well. Receptive to feedback. Offered and emphasized a historical bent, which is always a relief in a class on history that is nevertheless populated by MDivs.\r\nWeaknesses: Although receptive to feedback, I would almost argue that it is difficult to feel comfortable giving feedback in the first place. Burt seemed like he often felt that he had to project himself as an authority at all costs. I sympathize with this position- I cannot imagine what it must be like to have to grade and garner respect from people who are sometimes older than you, have more degrees than you, more job experience, etc.. but I think it would be beneficial to everyone for a TF to be comfortable admitting that they do not know something. I saw this interaction happen often with students in the class- a student who would be more familiar with the topic, perhaps due to a philosophical background (whereas Burt has a historical one), would offer a response or ask a challenging question- this would often be dismissed as \"off topic\", or \"we are running out of time,\" or that \"it was too complicated for an intro class.\" Although I sometimes felt that Burt was right and it was better to focus on more basic things, I also wanted to know the answer to the difficult questions and know that there was a space at YDS to ask them. As such, I hope that Burt focuses more on a collaborative effort between him and students, rather than enforcing a hierarchical relationship. We are all in graduate school and want to learn- if someone is late for class, they probably have a legitimate reason (some of us have kids and jobs, after all!). If someone challenges something, they are probably looking to expand their mind because they want to study it professionally, not because they want power and control. Seeing students as colleagues and autonomous, kind people is going to always be more effective than seeing them as an adversary. PLEASE NOTE: A lot of this complaint is not a reflection of Burt himself, but a frustration with the system that produces these problems. The idea that a TFs first teaching experience would be with seasoned graduate students who he might have even had a class with seems like a poor administrative choice. Burt is clearly passionate, and will become an excellent professor. I certainly do not think I would do better for my first semester of teaching (and, in that context, Burt did a damn fine job). But it was frustrating, as a graduate student, to be impacted by that. ",
            "\u00a0Kate showed empathy towards students, but was always a true professional.  She never pretended to be more of an expert than she was yet always seemed incredibly knowledgeable and thoroughly prepared to work with us in section.   She was approachable outside of class, and routinely re-evaluated her own teaching methods. ",
            "\u00a0I had the feeling that Kate was not familiar with the material enough to really be of great help, although she was excellent in facilitating discussion and participation. This was the kind of class that we really needed an expert to synthesize the material since the lectures were not always so clearly focused and we covered so much material. She did however share resources from the other groups which was hugely helpful in preparing for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: helped tie each consecutive week to prior weeks, was willing to talk through ideas for outside research and interest, offered unique insight from a more modern historians view of history\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: didn't always organize sections well, would struggle to get conversation started or facilitate it if we were lost or didn't know where to begin/what to be getting out of a text. ",
            "\u00a0Kate was a great section leader, and I would love to have her as a TF again. ",
            "\u00a0Kate was really helpful in facilitating conversation and engaging all of the students in the group.  I think the structure of the group meetings was difficult for her, because it kind of left them unorganized and she would have to figure out what to do herself - sometimes what we did was helpful for learning the content, and other times this was less true.  But I don't think this was Kate's fault. ",
            "\u00a0Kate did a wonderful job facilitating our section! She did a great job asking the right questions and knowing when we were having trouble with some of the material. She made it easier to get through some of the longer readings by giving us prompts to think about as we read. She gave us plenty of opportunity to ask questions and engage with each other in section. ",
            "\u00a0Kate did a great job of allowing each of us to use our voices and weigh in from our own perspective during section meetings. She was very accessible to meet, attentive to individual concerns, and supportive of our writing and synthesis of information in the course.\r\n\r\nThe suggested questions were also helpful, although it would have been even more helpful to have them at the beginning of the week as a reading guide. ",
            "\u00a0Kate is a terrific TA; she did her best to fill in the gaps in the lectures, and was always available to talk about the class material.  I have no feedback on my final paper as I write this review, but she spent several hours with me to help me determine a topic and give me ideas for exploration.  I really enjoyed working with her. ",
            "\u00a0Brackney was articulate and prepared, clearly very invested in helping students engage with the material critically. Her section was extremely helpful for me in understanding what could often be a confusing history of ideas and theologies. She encouraged participation well and gave substantial thought to what her students had to say. ",
            "\u00a0Kate was always available and helpful. Although this area is not her speciality, she tried to find ways to answer questions and assist the students. She was innovative in ways to encourage discussion during section meetings. ",
            "\u00a0Kate is a talented and enthusiastic teacher.  Her commitment to the course content and her own specialties were clear, and she was quite able in the classroom.  The discussion sections may have been aided by more time in discussion and less time in additional lecture, but the responsibilities of the TFs to cover information that was never addressed in lecture left no time for consistent discussions, so that is understandable. ",
            "\u00a0Kate was a pleasure to be in section with - her knowledge of the material was thorough and thoughtful, and she structured her classes so that students really had to come fully prepared. She constantly encouraged us to make connections between readings and weeks, and to look for through-lines even when they were not being highlighted in class. ",
            "\u00a0Kate was a great TF - very available to us outside of class hours and willing to listen to and answer our questions about course structure to the best of her abilities. She was knowledgeable and passionate about the subject material, but could have left more for students to answer after her questions. I would have found the section meetings more productive had we done any work relating the material covered in class to the larger scope of the course, but we always had other material to cover instead (which is not a critique of Kate but of the structure of the section meetings for HEC). ",
            "\u00a0Kate tended to ask very specific questions, and sometimes I felt like she was looking for a very particular answer rather than for us to think about something together. I felt that if the questions were a bit more general it could have spurred more class discussion and participation. But to her credit some of us were probably under-prepared for section; the amount of reading was hard to get through each week, especially for first-year students. In any case, section was definitely helpful for me in understanding the texts and Kate was very thorough. ",
            "\u00a0Kate did a wonderful job. She was intelligent, engaging, and imminently helpful in synthesizing the materials that were in the readings but were not addressed in class. I learned far more in my section than I did in Professor Beeleys classroom. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie was a wonderful TF. She helped to draw out all of the important information and tried to make it seem like there was a cohesive thread to the materials we read and create an arch in a course that had no obvious arch. She was an advocate for students, helping to pressure Professor Beeley to provide needed materials for students. She engaged in discussion well and was overall a delight. ",
            "\u00a0She was very helpful and facilitated good section discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Good communication\r\nAlways encouraging varies perspectives ",
            "\u00a0Extremely efficient in making the team work as one, whole. Efficiently used the time to cover course material and was willing to help outside of section. She also made herself available and reminded us every week. She is very knowledgeable with the subject but if she was not sure, which was rare, she would say, \"let me ask Professor Belley and get back to you on that.\" ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie Machabee was an excellent teaching fellow. She was prepared for every section with discussion topics immediately relevant to the text and was able to facilitate discussions well, including to challenge us to further our thoughts on the material. She often came with extra materials that she had made on her own time that helped to provide some of the context that Dr. Beeley did not provide in class. Much of what I have learned from this class is from Stephanie. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Stephanie was a great TA. She incited thoughtful conversation and created an environment in which good discussion could happen. She brought up the important parts of the weekly readings and was well prepared herself. Overall I thought she was a really good TA who helped us get well prepared for the exam and papers. ",
            "\u00a0Great at adapting and improvising.\r\nAlways well-planned and prepared.\r\nDiscussion was never difficult.\r\nHad the right balance as a TF of knowing when to instruct and when to lead discussion. She and only one other of my 5 TFs has actually stricken this balance well.\r\nAppreciated her applying different pedagogical approach.\r\nAlways approachable and helpful\r\nGood feedback on written material. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie was a phenomenal TF. She facilitated discussion well, and was extremely open to comments and questions. Her openness cultivated authentic and deeply interested engagement. It was learning in its ideal form. ",
            "\u00a0I looked forward to every Friday because it meant HEC section with Stphanie. She grew in confidence over the course of the semester as she facilitated discussion among an eager bunch of students. It helped that everyone was prepared and engaged with the material, but she also helped by leaving room for our own questions, concerns, and I thought struck a good balance of leading the conversation in a productive direction while also leaving room for the class to explore ideas we thought were important. I would definitely take another class with her. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie was a really solid TA. She facilitated conversation well, brought all students into the conversation, and offered clarity both to the material of the course and to the general class structure. ",
            "\u00a0What didnt Stephanie do well? She was excellent.  She brought us all into discussion well and made us think about broader questions we werent able to discuss. She also explained convoluted topics in lecture, which became essential to my success in the course.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of improvements. She communicated with us well, and if we had questions that she couldnt answer, she would always get back to us. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie Machabee was the best teaching fellow I've had at Yale. She went above and beyond to guide every student on an individual and collective level. Her lessons proved interesting and comprehensively engaged the class. Her teaching format truly encouraged our sections class to engage and better grasp the text on a in-depth level far surpassing her Teaching Fellow position. Stephanie's insight and thoughtful expertise, along with the creative formation of the class, made complex subjects easy to understand. I truly looked forward to attending her session each week. She also helped exceedingly with my final paper thesis. Her guidance revealed that she truly cared. She is an outstanding teacher and student. ",
            "\u00a0Stphanie was an incredibly effective teaching fellow. She was very good at facilitating our discussion sections and showed a great deal of investment in each of us. Not only did she create a very welcoming atmosphere, she was also helpful in helping articulate some of the finer points in class topics. We love Stphanie! ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie did an excellent job pulling together students to pursue the common good of understanding within a group conversation. Her discussion sections were a great way to end my week and excellent summaries of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie made herself available to students at multiple opportunities, which I value. She also was a thoughtful and invested facilitator of section discussions, and she particularly demonstrated care in her warm and caring affect, which invited all students to participate. She made every contribution feel like a valued addition to the section conversation. I think as she looks ahead to future discussion sections, she could work on offering more critical feedback or pushback to student comments--to ask for textual support when none was offered, to request specificity in a comment that was ambiguous, or to restate the strong portion of a student answer while critiquing the weaker part. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie was obviously new to teaching this material. And seemingly new to the management of a classroom and time slot. Our class started late each week. Though she was professional and respectful, she was not able to answer questions about the material or the connections between the early church fathers such as who influenced who or who taught who? She was not knowledgeable about teaching the Trinity which is very difficult (at best) but she was unable to answer basic questions on principle Trinitarian theologies. She seemed to be managing a lack of organization of the course, an overload of reading assignments and a lack of clarity. She was however, helpful with organization persistently trying to provide timelines and outlines and organize some electronic reading materials that were otherwise not available to students but required for the final exam preparation. Expectations were not clear on the syllabus ie: missing a section requires a written two page summary of the material - this should have been included on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Stphanie was an effective and encouraging facilitator of discussion. She came across as consistently well-prepared and glad to see our section, and went out of her way to compile additional material and organize study methods before the final exam. I felt a bit that Stphanie could have done more \"teaching\" during our sections, but she was nonetheless a great facilitator. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if it was just her or the students or just the content of the class but I often felt that section discussions were slow going. People were not wont to participate, and the TF was not always up to the task of eliciting responses from them as is necessary to run a section ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie is a very good teaching fellow. She always created a lively discussion and allowed everyone to speak. She was also very helpful in discussing paper topics, research, and studying for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Encouraged questions, but could have used a more rigorous approach to course material. More intense accountability to the reading would have raised the level of discussion from bare comprehension to more nuanced conversation\r\n\r\nCompletely kind and encouraging, very clear about course expectations, really exerted on behalf of the students. Above and beyond! Many thanks :) ",
            "\u00a0Section was really helpful for integrating the large quantity of information in this class. Ste'phanie created many effective activities for us to do. Organizing charts, timelines, group study guides, paper discussions, etc. all helped us organize it in our minds. Her summaries of class were also helpful. I would encourage Ste'phanie to speak her mind a little more--go ahead and tell us directly when we've got it wrong. At the same time, I would say don't feel obligated to respond to each comment directly. Discussion seemed to be most engaging when it became a genuine conversation among the entire section. And it usually did--skill in guiding discussion greatly improved over the semester! I really enjoyed this section, and I learned a lot. Thank you. "
