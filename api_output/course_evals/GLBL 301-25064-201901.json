            "\u00a0Learned a lot about diplomacy in the Middle East and the environment issues that the region is facing in the upcoming years. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great overview of the multidimensional environmental threats facing the Middle East and the inherent difficulties in resolving them. The course focuses on the present moment and recent past, and will give you a lot of tools to think about what comprehensive environmental security means. ",
            "\u00a0Greater understanding of political, social, cultural, economic, and environmental interactions amongst the Food-Water-Energy nexus, particularly in the Middle East. Concise writing on real-world political issues as well as mock debate/political discussion skills. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths are the depths of the Professor's knowledge and the depth with which we were able to go into some topics because the class subject is so focused. Weakness was sometimes we got too much into the reality of things rather than maybe talking more about possibilities. I mean this in the sense that there was too much talk about the realities of diplomacy in the Middle East to the point it was depressing. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main strengths of this class is that Prof. Madani was on the frontlines of environmental policy in Iran, and offers a lot of great real-world insight. The class encourages students to be engaged in the academic realm (with the readings and discussions) as well as in current events. Papers are on concrete questions of environmental security facing the Middle East. \r\n\r\nOne weakness that I can think of is that we spend most of the semester talking about water, which is probably the most important and pressing environmental problem facing the Middle East, but sometimes prevented us from going into depth on other environmental issues (energy, waste, CO2 emissions, etc.) However this is only a minor thing - overall the class was extremely interesting and important to understand the Middle East today! ",
            "\u00a0The instructor is very informative, however, this course is not very well organised, probably because it is offered for the first time. There is supposed to be a theme for each class, according to the syllabus. However, usually, the topic is ignored during discussions. It might be better to draft some discussion questions in advance to organize the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly fascinating content. Professor has unparalleled real-world experience as previous Minister of Environment for Iran!\r\nWeaknesses: workload on the heavier side for a seminar. Papers are manageable but balancing them with the readings was dicey at times. I ended up taking this class Credit-D to remove the stress of completing the 100+ pages of readings and 2+ hours of video assigned every week. Discussions always began as open-ended until the professor slowly began to guide them, but it would have been nice to have a stronger sense of structure going into each seminar. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend only if you are deeply interested in the intersection of these two issues, otherwise I worry you'd lose interest easily. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are at all interested in the Middle East or working in international institutions on climate policy, this class will help you develop a skillset to think critically about how to build comprehensive policy. Environmental problems are never considered in isolation, and it was super helpful to learn and think about the various ways in which politics, diplomacy, and nationalism are interwoven with environmental issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're ready for the workload (or take it Credit-D and just enjoy the intellectual challenge). This is one of my top 3 courses at Yale despite the immense workload simply because Professor Madani has so much lived experience in the field. You tackle complex political issues every day and by the end of the semester feel that you have a solid grasp on the complexity of navigating this space, without presuming to be able to deliver straightforward solutions. Few classes at Yale have improved my perspective on the world; this is one of them. "
