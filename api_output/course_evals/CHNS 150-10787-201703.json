            "\u00a0I learnt vocabulary and improved my reading. All in all, my Chinese improved. ",
            "\u00a0Well structured introduction to advanced Chinese language ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my Chinese reading, writing, and listening skills. ",
            "\u00a0We learn, of course, more grammar and more vocabulary to build on our previous Chinese ability. However, one of the most enjoyable aspects of the course was definitely that we get to learn more about Chinese culture and our instructor's lives, points of view, and stories. ",
            "\u00a0A better mastery of Chinese, especially applied to important contemporary topics. I also got practice with more niche skills like handwriting, film and music, and traditional characters. ",
            "\u00a0I mostly worked on my spoken language skills and pronunciation in Chinese, which was very helpful and exactly what I needed to get out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of new vocabulary, solidified knowledge of some grammar structures, learned some new grammar structures. Gained a lot more knowledge of life in China/important issues. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I have developed a far greater level of proficiency in the Chinese language this semester compared to my level before taking the course, particularly through the skill of recognizing (both in writing and in speech) and actually using a much larger and more complex  range of vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class after taking Chinese L1 and L2 at Yale and attending a summer program.   the class built really well upon what I had been learning before "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Maybe a bit more chances to speak in class so that confidence is not lost in that area. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is it absolutely strengthens one's Chinese skills and covers a broad range of formal topics. The weakness is organization is a little unclear and could be improved upon. ",
            "\u00a0I am very passionate about the language and am very engaged. Going forward, I hope to continue to improve my pronunciation and tone accuracy. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the breadth of topics covered, as we were able to discuss a variety of contemporary issues and important skills in the language. A weakness of this course was how the workload was structured, where all of the homework for a unit was concentrated right around the test, so we had to prepare for the test while writing the essay and submitting online recordings. Subsequently, right after the exam we had the largest homework assignment for each unit (the tingxie) in order to start the next unit, and I think the course could be improved by finding a way to better space out the work load. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely the high intensity of the class, and the daily quizzes that help reinforce the learning of tones and reading skills. Maybe one weakness would be the non-transparent grading system and also perhaps a little more direction in the tutorials. ",
            "\u00a0The teachers (Wang Laoshi and Zhang Laoshi) are great -- very fun and funny. Workload is not unmanageable by any stretch. I would say it's easier than CHNS 110/120 (didn't take 130/140 so don't know how to compare). I came in to this semester from HBA, so my speaking skills declined for sure, but that's to be expected. Sometimes on the essays it was hard to tell where they wanted to focus -- correct/appropriate (formal) grammar and vocab use, or developed ideas? I wasn't sure if they would rather we make a simple argument about gender equality but do it beautifully or make a complex argument and end up with some mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really engaging, and it's awesome to have one of the professors who wrote the textbook in the class. My Chinese got so much better and I honestly don't have any complaints about the way it was taught. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are too many to count -- from the diversity and usefulness of the topics and phrases and structures covered to the phenomenal Professors to the fun classroom environment and sense of daily rigor. One area I saw for potential improvement was the following: I sometimes felt that having more structured time or exercises to revisit and re-use past content/language mechanisms that I might otherwise forget after learning would be really nice. I know we are expected to do this on our own, especially in preparation for tests, but I think having more of such time in class could be an option worth exploring. ",
            "\u00a0Both Zhang laoshi and Wang laoshi are excellent teachers. Their methods of instruction are different but both are ultimately very effective. They are incredibly kind, engaging, dedicated, and happy teachers. ",
            "\u00a0The class is really well organized, and the professors are considerate of when we have a lot of work in midterm season and had restructured the syllabus in advance to have easier material then "

            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes the instructors were terrific the course was rigorous and greatly improved my Mandarin ",
            "\u00a0The instructors are amazing, the class is well structured, and the workload is not much compared especially to L1 and L2. The class is, of course, still very challenging as that is the nature of language learning, and the number of words to be learned in a week is quite a lot. It was definitely one of my favorite classes regardless and I would recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to another student. If you want a better mastery of Chinese language and culture, this is the class to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to advance their spoken Chinese and expand their vocabulary. If the student is looking for more writing-focused or reading-focused classes, maybe another is better - given a certain level of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! If you're coming in as a first year, good chance to knock out your language requirement, and see if you want to continue; if you're coming from a summer L3/L4 I also say take it, because it won't be terribly difficult and I think it's a good test of how much one actually likes Chinese. It's super fun and not that much work. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if you want to improve your Chinese and learn more about Chinese culture. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. I loved both professors and the dual-instructor format itself. A simply phenomenal program that has further invigorated my love of Chinese and the extent to which it challenges me for the better. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. At L5, much of our textbook focused on culturally or historically significant aspects of China, and the vocabulary was both useful in day-to-day conversation and in professional settings. We discussed the Chinese government's treatment of the rural AIDS epidemic, of Falun Gong, of adoption concerns, among other topics. Overall it was both an informative and language-improving class. "
