He is constantly asking feedback to improve his teaching/dynamics.\r\n\r\nI wish there was a paper for this course, rather than a math-heavy midterm/final that does not necessary proves our full understanding of macroeconomics.

He really takes the time to make sure we understand the concepts he teaches, and his last lectures on economic inequality in America were a real highlight for me. I've felt like I've learned so much through this course, from new ideas to making formerly foreign seeming economic ideas much more understandable.  Grading expectations, in particular on the exam true/false, were unclear to me and annoying because of it, lost points for reasons that were sorta stiff expectations ",
            "\u00a0I loved the news stories we did in class. I thought those were so interesting. I also thought the last couple lectures on inequality were so neat. I think that the lectures on the regular macro were also informative, but perhaps it would be helpful to give us a huge overview at each class to give us the big picture. ",

The \"discussion\" ended up only being between Professor Peters and 1-5 students (usually the same ones every time). The rest of us were not at all engaged with this part of class (the beginning of most classes). Good effort on the part of the professor though, to try to keep us engaged. Unfortunately, it was not that effective. ",

            "\u00a0strengths: \r\n-MP is an excellent lecturer. he's always excited about the material he is covering and really takes the time to explore current events in relation to the theories that we're learning. really the best part of this class is his willingness to engage students. if you want to take macro, take it with him, bc he really cares about his students \r\n-problem sets are graded leniently \r\n\r\nweaknesses: \r\n-cover material really quickly, with enough space to \"understand\" it but not truly digest it \r\n-TAs were not very engaged - they walked through problem sets during section but not much beyond that \r\n-class was very much about concepts/intuition, problem sets and especially EXAMS were actually pretty math-heavy and dependent upon you having a strong command of algebra and being able to play around with variables/numbers. \r\n-exams tried to pack in too many questions into time period which made them very difficult. there is the curve in the end but you might walk out of the exam feeling really exhausted and stupid. this wouldn't matter except that exams make up essentially the entire grade distribution since problem sets are essentially pass/fail. \r\n-spending more of the class on practicing with the models would be helpful.

Felt like a fair amount of work for almost no reason. ",

It's great the professor recognized this and took time to explain this. The professor is also super nice and clearly cares about our progress in the course. Exams don't throw left-field questions for the most past, you get what you earned. Overall, really like the structure and execution of this course. ",

            "\u00a0The major weakness of the course is that both major models have big holes in them that are totally unaddressed. Like, they say the Romer model makes sense unless you have population growth, but then they just leave it there. Like uh what if we actually have population growth? Like you know in the real world where we have population growth. So I'm not super clear on why we spent so long on a model that has a gigantic hole in the center. Also, in Intro Macro, Aleh shows you a paper arguing that the phillips curve is totally BS and that no version of it is more predictive than just assuming that inflation will be the same this quarter as it was last quarter. If that's true, the entire AS-AD model goes out the window. Was that just like fake? It would be nice if the intro and intermediate macro classes weren't operating in wholly different paradigms, or if there was a stronger defense of the phillips curve in intermediate. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of real world discussion ",
            "\u00a0Peters is very kind and is good at explaining things, but the lectures are far too long and boring (by nature of what's being taught) for most people's attention spans. Posted slides and a great textbook (which could be found cheap online) made it easy to learn the required material. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of this course often made it difficult to truly gage how well you knew the material. While there are weekly problem sets, because they are graded on a check/check-plus basis, I often found it difficult to know exactly how I was doing, especially relative to my peers, which is important in an economics class because of the curve scheme. Peters is a good professor, but his tone and manner often seemed more suited for a seminar or smaller lecture  although, he's excited and knows his stuff, it was sometimes too easy to zone out in lecture. Additionally, I wish there had been more available problems. For the midterm and final, one practice test each was released, and the Jones book did not provide questions of the level of difficulty anticipated on evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. ",
            "\u00a0Class was good! The sections could focus more on rehashing the material learned than just working on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The curve. RIDE THAT WAVE, BABY! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't understand economics, this course exploited that flaw to the highest degree. ",
            "\u00a0Michael Peters is nice and he's a pretty good lecturer. I'd say the material is a bit dry, but he does his best to explain it. The TAs are also nice and problem sets weren't too bad. The one thing I didn't like about this class was the exams. It was super hard to prepare for them and I didn't really know what to study. Many of the questions were also weird or unclear and the grading seemed a bit arbitrary. I'd also recommend adding an extra midterm or changing the weight on things because the final was worth way too much in my opinion (50%). ",
            "\u00a0Great slides. The pace of certain material is too slow. ",
            "\u00a0The course was excellently taught. Michael Peters has an incredible way of explaining the material and his lecture slides are phenomenal. Problem sets and exams were reasonable, however many students struggled with timing on the midterm. A weakness would be the differences among TA-led Discussion Sections that were not publicized. The TA's were great, however it seems like one TA always led discussion sections covering the week's problem set, while another would speak only on the material introduced in class. Students in one section would then be at an advantage over their peers in the other section. Symmetry among the Discussion Section would be great. Furthermore, I don't get why problem sets were graded on a \"check-plus\" system, as we could never get feedback on our work! "

However, this was also the class I spent some of the most time on and still felt like I wasn't doing well in it. Maybe I'm just bad at critical thinking or something, but it always felt like I understood the content in class/manipulating the equations on problem sets but not when it came to exams. chances are if you're shopping this class you are required to take it for the major, so I'd recommend doing it with MP in the spring. if you just want to better understand econ though, look elsewhere.

            "\u00a0Like all required core courses, there are things that you'll like and understand well in this course and things that seem unnecessary and frustrating. I found the exams to be excessively detailed in the short response sections, and a bit too cumbersome in the long response sections that were often variations of the models we studied in class. While the problem sets were somewhat helpful in preparing for this, I think the lectures could have emphasized exactly which of the details of the models were most important to know for the short response sections, and generalize techniques for applying the models to different situations. Overall deceptively challenging, but Michael Peters was considerate and willing to help if you made an effort to do so, which I can't say I did much. ",

If you, like me, don't particularly have the macro intuition, this course can be challenging and often frustrating, because it seemed like there wasn't much to do in terms of putting in work that might make up that lack of intuition. That being said, most students who are looking at this course likely are required to do so, and it's still a generally manageable class. ",

Michael Peters is a god/Saint and I would take a bullet if it meant protecting this man's luscious German locks.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would never recommend taking ECON 122 to anyone. The course itself is fine; Professor Peters was a fantastic lecturer and engaged the large lecture more others would, often asking questions from the audience to check their understanding. He also connected our course material to the real world with relevant news articles that made the class much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIf I never saw a Solow Growth Model curve again, that would be too soon. Maybe Econ just isn't for me, but this class was dreadful. On the surface level, I understand everything; however, when the PSets and tests begin to ramp up in difficulty, I found it very hard to keep up. Ah well. You know what George Bush says. \"To those of you who are graduating this afternoon with high honors, awards, and distinctions: I say, \"Well done.\" And as I like to tell the C students...
