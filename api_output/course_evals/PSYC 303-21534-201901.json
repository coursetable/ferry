However, most of all, I learned about the brain's capacity for reacting to and controlling human behavior, which isn't as complex as we assume but it is complicated in that it is very hard to discover from. This class really helped me bridge the gap between the physical parts of the brain and the more abstract abilities of our consciousness. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - very organized, comprehensive, you never really feel lost\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - a lot of content, sometimes needs to move fast ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- super interesting topics, straightforward exams, very manageable even for a non-STEM major\r\nWeaknesses - wasn't a fan of a lot of the readings. It's a mix of studies and reviews, and I didn't bother reading half the reviews (and luckily didn't have to); grading on the reading responses were wack -- I never knew what I would get ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: It's a lecture. I found the professor inaccessible. She has no office hours; they're only \"by appointment\" but the one time I reached out because I was struggling, she told me to go talk to the TFs. I don't know if she was accessible to other students. I also absolutely hated the way reading responses were graded, as in I found the requirements strict and the rubric unhelpful and the feedback even less helpful, but they're only 15% of your grade, so it's not so bad. Also, this course has both a final essay and a final exam. \r\nStrengths: The material is interesting. The tests were fair. After I finished this course, I did feel like I had learned a lot and had a better understanding of the brain and social processes. ",
            "\u00a0Really just the course material--it could be interesting at times and other times super repetitive. Social neuroscience is a young field, and I would have liked to hear about different techniques or different, more specific neural regions involved in social neuroscience, but I don't think the field is that broad yet to allow for this diversity. ",
            "\u00a0It is almost the exact same course as Cognitive Neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0The class becomes very repetitive and boring, with papers of similar content and style. Professor Crockett, frankly, comes to class unprepared often, and is unable to answer (often very basic) questions about the material that goes beyond what is in the slides. Most everything is read word-for-word either from the slides or from notes on her computer screen. Her comportment when she takes questions makes it very clear to anyone with even a basic of social neuroscience that she is not looking forward to answering them. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this class is incredibly interesting, and Dr. Crockett is an engaging lecturer. Lectures were really jam-packed with studies, which is to be expected of an upper-level science course, but I wish they had been made more accessible for students who aren't necessarily geared toward rote memorization; I really wanted this to be a class not just for neuroscience majors, and felt quite ill-equipped for it in the end. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in its organization and conceptual layout. Lectures contained a good mix of description of experiments and abstract presentation of concepts. One weakness was that neural processes were presented separately for different concepts, and some integration of circuits and systems would have been helpful. In addition, the rubric for grading reading responses was not very clear. ",
            "\u00a0Focus more on neuroscience and less on psychology. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture is very good, but I believe there should also be a section. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material flowed very well and one could easily tell the entire course was carefully planned and strategized to maximize comprehension and understanding. The assignments and lectures were always very engaging and interesting. The knowledge provided never shied away from sensitive topics and provided a good unbiased way of revealing human behavior. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were not discussed in class so questions and discussions were left unheard of or at times had very little connection with the actual lecture. The weekly assignment grading was not ver well standardized between teaching fellows, the grading varied between them. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly well organized, the lectures are fast-paced but easy to follow, and the final paper was a creative way of integrating the information we had learned in the class over the semester. I also think that the five reading responses were effective in that they helped me make better sense of the assigned readings, but also low-stress in that we had the option of choosing which readings to write responses for. ",
            "\u00a0fantastic lectures, very interesting and engaging material, could be improved by standardizing the proportion of psychology to neuroscience; it tended to vary unit to unit ",
            "\u00a0Great feedback, lectures, and fair assessments. ",
            "\u00a0I think great class overall  extremely engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was very well designed. Perhaps it could be improved by having regularly scheduled office hours ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures are engaging, material is well explained, excellent professor, tests and work is very reasonable\r\nWeaknesses: Just by nature of the course, there is lots of memorization ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about the brain going into this class, and I knew quite a bit coming out of it. Now I can think about social interactions in terms of the brain areas that get activated\r\nI didn't like the parts of the class for which we basically had to memorize which parts of the brain lit up when a given emotion was triggered or a given visual stimulus was displayed. I was definitely less engaged for those parts of the class. Also, memorizing all the different networks that the ACC and DLPFC are a part of was confusing and difficult. I feel like the professor/TAs could have given us a basic study guide matching brain areas and functions if that was such an important part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthslectures are informative and interesting, the class isn't too much work for most of the semester, and the reading load isn't too heavy and is also pretty flexible. The only weakness of the class is that the final exam and final paper are a lot of work right before and during finals period, but it's a minor complaint. Can't stress how much I enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Only complaint is that lecture often moved pretty fast and was hard to take notes on, but generally that wasn't a big issue when it came to studying for exams. Also be aware that the class does have a final exam and a final paper, which is manageable but should be considered when planning for finals. Strengths are in Professor Crockett's lecturing and the syllabus. You can for the most part ignore the prereqs for this class. ",
            "\u00a0The way Dr. Crockett structured the course helps all the information to flow naturally to us, which enhances learning. The readings go well with the topics we are going to discuss, and most of the time, aren't that long. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think Dr. Crockett should be more strict with the prerequisites to taking PSYC303. She reiterated time and time again, if students haven't taken an intro to neuroscience course, adapting would be hard, but I don't think many cared... What you take away from the class and how well you understand the material is correlated to how much background you have and how prepared you are for PSYC303. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interactive, even though it is a lecture. Professor Crockett really takes her time to answer questions and tailors the lectures to content that may be interesting to students based off of their questions "

            "\u00a0If you've taken Human Brain PSYC 160, this class will be fun! Dr. Crockett is a lovely teacher, and you'll learn a lot of cool stuff about social things.\r\n\r\nIf you have not taken Human Brain PSYC 160 (like me), this course is still doable!! It'll just be a lot of work. Take deep breaths and focus on the big ideas (summary slides are very much your friend). Start from there and branch out to the other things. Remember the names of brain parts that come up often (you'll see amygdala, ACC, insula, etc. a lot, and they'll be associated with certain.. \"things\" like ACC/insula with \"negative emotion\" and amygdala with \"automatic stuff\") and that will help with generalizing what regions might be associated with certain functions (e.g. ACC/insula with empathizing with other people's pain)\r\n\r\nYou'll learn a lot, I promise :)\r\nand you can do it!

The knowledge provided never shied away from sensitive topics and provided a good unbiased way of revealing human behavior. Definitely an interesting class that talks about human behavior in a very scientific way. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is interested in the course material, but only if you've taken the Human Brain (PSYC 160). Someone without an introductory background would find it hard to keep up with the lectures, but otherwise it is a great course taught by a phenomenal professor. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would. Incredible teacher  molly is very engaging, as well as the lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great way to rigorously study various topics in social psychology in terms of not only behavior but also the underlying neural mechanisms, which together can reveal insights that wouldn't be visible with just behavioral findings alone. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was extremely interesting and Molly Crockett is a fantastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a really interesting look at mental life. I'm a cognitive science major who hasn't taken Human Brain. I had some trouble initially learning brain anatomy, but after I learned like 10 essential parts that kept coming up again and again, I was fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an excellent neuro/psych class to take as a major requirement, but even if you have no interest in these fields the material is simply so interesting that it's worth taking regardless. Professor Crockett is a great teacher and the assignments are manageable. Cannot speak highly enough about this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the topic, this is as good a class as any on it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an elective for NSCI and Cog Sci majors. The course content is interesting and the workload is not too bad to manage ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty good. I took this as my science credit, and I would recommend it as such. Most students in it are cogsci and neuro majors, but it still serves as a pretty good science credit if you are willing to be a little confused for the first two weeks. Once you learn about 15 brain parts, it becomes a lot easier. It wasn't graded on a curve and the exams weren't difficult, mostly just memorization, so it's manageable and probably more informative than Plants and People. Molly Crockett simplifies things and the lectures are fairly easy to understand. \r\n\r\nAs a class in a very new field, Dr. Crockett tries to be careful about oversimplifying the human psyche based on a few studies, but it can be a little reductive and presumptuous at times. This course is not supposed to teach you about the general laws of human behavior. It's mostly an overview of brain studies. Very little feedback was offered in this course. Overall, a solid and okay class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Crockett does a wonderful job of taking serious and interesting empirical research and applying it in a smooth and interesting way throughout the semester. If you took human brain and enjoyed any of it, you're more than prepared to succeed in this class and the topics will be much more satisfying! "
