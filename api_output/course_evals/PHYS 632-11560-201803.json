            "\u00a0I got a great overview of 1D many body physics and the role that interactions play in a few choice problems. I also enjoyed seeing Luttinger Liquid theory and it's ability to treat arbitrary strength interactions through a mapping to bosons. Finally, I appreciated discussions of the Kondo problem since it is something I had seen but never really understood/appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Course was a useful review of modern research directions in quantum many-body theoretical physics. I learned a lot about Luttinger liquid formalism that is used to describe interacting 1D systems of electrons. Moreover, the course provided numerous insights on topological effects in condensed matter physics and on random matrix theory as applied to description of quantum dots (and other random structures). ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an overview on many of the modern problems in condensed matter theory. I studied how the interaction between electrons can be taken into account in many-body systems of different spatial dimension. In particular, I learned that the standard Fermi liquid paradigm breaks in 1D and another description, Luttinger liquid theory, should be used. I studied how the later theory is constructed. In addition to that, I learned a lot about fascinating physical phenomena, such as superconductivity, Kondo effect, Fermi edge singularity, orthogonality catastrophe, and many other. Finally, I studied some aspects of the random matrix theory and learned about the role of topology in quantum systems. "

            "\u00a0Strengths include the clarity of the lecturing style and the ability to connect complicated problems and areas of physics while sticking to a rather intuitive/lower level of mathematical complexity. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength was broad coverage of different topics.  Because of that some derivations were rather sketchy but that is totally fine. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength for me was a broad range of topics covered with a focus on building a qualitative picture.  The course could be improved by providing lecture notes. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend to other students who are interested in many body physics, including those experimentalists who want a background without extreme mathematical rigor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, nice course to get familiar with concepts of quantum many-body physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in quantum many-body theory in general and condensed matter physics in particular. "
