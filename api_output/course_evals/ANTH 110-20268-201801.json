            "\u00a0This course exposed me to a large range of topics in cultural anthropology as well as some of the history of the field up through modern times. I also felt that this course helped to instill an anthropological mindset and encouraged me to use the analytical tools that I learned as I considered the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0I developed many new critical thinking skills, and I also gained insight into what it means to be a cultural anthropologist. In this class, I learned a vast amount about the field of cultural anthropology from how to conduct basic fieldwork techniques to interpreting the works of many famous anthropologists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ways in which I can think about and conceptualize the world and got to practice doing that. I learned about the history of anthropology and the various aspects of life it looks at. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me tools that I will use forever: to analyze the world around me, to analyze my own actions, and to understand the macro issues that face our world. It is a wonderful intro to the field of anthropology and was an extremely interesting endeavour into the field. ",
            "\u00a0A greater sense of the world and how we interact within social structures. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned how to think and analyze in an anthropological manner. This class made me think about ideas Ive never before thought about. Ive started to notice things that I never wouldve noticed before. This class made me analyze my own life, my own biases, and my connections with other people. It truly transformed my entire way of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0What anthropology even is, and the methods used in anthropological analysis - to critically engage with the world. ",
            "\u00a0I obtained the vocabulary to discuss and analyze different cultures and their respective practices, in addition to power structures and cultural constructs of power. I was able to think critically about other cultures as well as critique aspects of my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about basic introduction to socio-cultural anthropology and the tools anthropologist use in order to understand the world surrounding them. I became much more adept at seeing underlying structures that form the foundations for how different individuals act in society. I learned how to criticize and view issues from multi-dimensional perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0You get a good overview of the anthropological canon and then expand that theory through contemporary readings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what anthropology is, and in doing so gained an understanding of viewing the world in a different, more intuitive and appreciative way. I can now not only recognize differences in cultures, but understand what the differences mean and why they may be so. Essentially, this class has allowed me to engage with a broad way of thinking that I had previously not come into contact with. For that I am grateful. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to engage with some fundamental anthropological ideas. I learnt to engage actively with much of our culture through the fantastic assignments. I engaged with the scope between ideas and individual ethnography; between agency and structural forces. I was able finally to observe cultures in a thoughtful way, rather than a problematic one. I developed ethnographic tools and analytical skills in this course. I developed new insights about the world that have invigorated my intellectual life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some of the foundations and rudiments of sociocultural anthropology, including several schools of thought, pioneers and key anthropologists, and methods used in anthropological study. The course went over such topics as the ritual process, violence and power dynamics, gifts, kinship ties, labor and moral economy, migration, and race, class, gender, and ethnicity. By the end, I felt more ready to take note of cultural similarity and difference around me, and to approach my own society with a critical eye. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a vast amount about anthropology, and more importantly, the course completely transformed the way I see the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that there are large forces in our world that contribute to individual lives. This course allowed me to investigate things such as power structures and social categories. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned so much. The course centers on the concepts of structure and agency. In particular, we covered three main units: 1) culture/structuredifferent ways to view culture and society through different schools of thought, 2) structures of powerstructures of power shape culture and erase narratives, and 3) resistance/problem of human agencysituating individuals in these larger structures with individuals as products of structure and culture, but still agency in the structure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a wide array of topics in this course including key ideas in the history of anthropological theory/case studies, important facets of applying sociocultural anthropological analysis, and about cultural comparisons and how to use anthropology as social critique (or as a method of building bridges of understanding between populations). "

            "\u00a0The material in this course is very well-curated in that it is consistently interesting and comprises an effective narrative arc through time and topics. I also found the assignments to be enjoyable and a welcome way to emulate anthropological fieldwork on a smaller scale. I can't really think of any weakness in this course that ought to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a fantastic and engaging lecture that is always interesting and fun to attend. Discussion section can be a little all over the place, but often in a way that leaves us students confused, but in a good way. It is a very intellectually stimulating course that poses many unanswerable questions that are intriguing to ponder and debate. It could be improved by more thoroughly covering each reading in section so that central ideas are not lost in the sea of readings we do. ",
            "\u00a0I very much liked the ethnographic assignments, which were a great way to get out there and actually put all that theory you're learning into practice. It was nice to be able to dabble in five different topics rather than just writing one big term paper. Some of the highlights of the course were the documentaries Professor Harms showed as well as the panel of professionals who had all gotten degrees in anthropology but went on to do very different things with those degrees. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really interesting and Professor Harms is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0The course is strong in every wayorganization, instruction, examinations. I would've liked to do a longer ethnography that I could have spent more time on, however. ",
            "\u00a0While I love the general structure of the class, I sometimes have trouble seeing the direct connection between certain lecture content and the larger theme. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great lectures, ethnographic assignments were fun, teaches you to look at daily life with a critical eye\r\nWeaknesses: at the end of lectures, there would be often be a few minutes for discussion, but mostly the same people would talk. I take a while to formulate my thoughts and come up with a response, so such a short amount of time left for discussion wasn't ideal. Also section could be confusing sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers a wide range of general concepts because it is an introductory course. It presents and connects many new and varying ideas very well. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and the readings are absolutely amazing. There was not a single time that I found the lectures dry or the readings uninteresting. I learned so much from these alone and couple that with the great section support, the course was very good. I think that even as an intro class to anthropology, more theoretical frameworks in anthropology could possibly be taught to allow students to have a survey into the theoretical foundation of this discipline. We have indeed learned a few theorists, but most of them are at the beginning to middle of the course. Essentially though, I can see that it's important to thread a balanced line between theory and examples in order to keep the lectures interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Good material, good lecture, sometimes more discussion in lecture would be good. A lot of the topics are complex enough that you need to talk through them, not just take notes. ",
            "\u00a0The class structure was well planned, and I was able to see how one section of learning pertained to the next easily. It was reading heavy, perhaps simply by virtue of the material and concepts covered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the instructor, the wonderful assignments and the readings.\r\n\r\nA small weakness is perhaps a slight lack of clarity on certain ideas in lecture. But this should not come at the expense of Professor Harms' very fluid and personable teaching style. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely engaging. Lectures are captivating, well-structured, and professionally delivered. I felt I was genuinely learning in every class. At the beginning of the course, it was sometimes difficult to connect concepts to one another, but by the end, it was much easier to see connections. Readings were heavy, but quite interesting and applicable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the lectures and readings for this course are quite interesting, and section was highly engaging. My main complaint was that I feel it would have been more appropriate and fulfilling to write a paper instead of (or in addition to) having a final exam. I believe that would have been a better format for deep consideration of how the anthropological lenses we talked about can be applied to the world. Overall, I loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and material were the strongest part of this course. They readings were interesting, relevant, and thought-provoking, giving meaning to the bigger concepts we were learning about. There could be improvements made with clarification in terms of the structures of the written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course a lot. All of the topics were so interesting, and the class served as an incredible introduction to anthropology. It has probably been the best introductory class I've taken; Professor Harms teaches the course in a really wonderful way that doesn't make it feel like an introductory course like the others I've taken. I feel like I actually was able to learn. I think Professor Harms is also a really great lecturer, and he's also just a super sweet, kind professor who actually cares about his students.\r\n\r\nWith weaknesses, I think the main thing was that it sometimes was really difficult to understand what the big picture ideas we were supposed to be understanding were. Sometimes, there would be so many examples or specific ethnographies we were looking at that I didn't really understand what the main idea was. I also found it difficult to figure out the big picture ideas because I found it difficult sometimes to translate the readings to the lectures; I know the professor addressed this, but it would be nice if the connection between the two were made clearer. It could be really difficult when the lecture slides seemed disjointed from the readings.\r\n\r\nAs an overall comment, since I don't know where else to mention this, this isn't specific to the course, but just in general, I want to make a suggestion for the anthropology department. I wish there could be more classes like ANTH 110 offered in the department. In particular, I wish there could be more courses structured as lectures. I've been trying to look for more classes offered in the department, but they all seem to specialize very quickly and become seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course very much because it provided me with a stronger base with which to analyze society around me.  I appreciated how the course was organized so that each consecutive week laid the foundation for the following week (because I could see myself learning and applying the new concepts that I learned).  I also really loved how intersectional and how applicable/relevant to differing situations, time periods, and places the course material was.  This class has impacted how I interact with the world around me and has encouraged me to be more observant.  I wouldn't change a thing about the way this course is taught. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. I came into this course with no background in anthropology, and I was impressed by how effectively-designed it was to help me learn how to think from an anthropological perspective. This class focuses on ideas and understanding rather than jargon and memorization, which I found very refreshing. We need more classes like this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. It is very interesting and teaches you how to think in new ways. The lessons taught in cultural anthropology are very applicable to other areas of life and learning. That being said, this class does involve a LOT of reading, so I would not recommend taking it alongside any other reading-heavy classes. It worked out well for me because my other classes are mostly STEM courses with little to no reading, so doing anthropology homework provided a nice break from problem sets. Also, the homework assignments were a lot of fun; they give you an excuse to people watch, talk to other students you normally wouldn't talk to, and really engage in \"Yale culture\" in a new and enlightening way. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone with an interest in anthropology or who is generally interested in social science but not quite sure what discipline. I went into it hoping it would help me decide what I wanted to major in, and I am leaving it strongly leaning towards anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good one to take regardless of your major, just to learn about what it means to be a person existing in the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes yes yes! This course was amazing, enlightening, challenging, and really fun. It's a wonderful theoretical intro to anthropology as a field, the key texts of anthropology, the methods of fieldwork, and tied together readings about the most interesting subjects (like Devil worship in farms and dirt as a cultural symbol) that one would never encounter otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course to other students because the way of thinking it requires can be applied to many different classes and disciplines, not just anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students regardless of their field of academic interest. The anthropological lens of critical inquiry ought to be applied to the other disciplines too! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to other students. Its not too difficult, but you learn a lot of incredible information. I really enjoyed all of the readings - they were super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - readings are on the lengthy side but most are super interesting; just learning the concepts and applying them to ethnographies of Yale students is a lot of fun ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It contains fascinating topics that forces students to engage with the material in order to fully understand it. This course is intellectually stimulating, and I believe that other students would appreciate its nuances. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Harms is one of the best professors I have had at Yale and if you are slightly interested in anthropology as a discipline, I urge you to take this course. You will not regret it and will learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes please take this class. Critical for every discipline, entirely reshapes how you will look at Yale and the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As someone who does not want to be an anthropology major, I still view this class as one of the most important I have taken at Yale. The ideas we learned are overtly big-picture, and the concepts I now am aware of are present in my everyday life. This class has introduced a new, more in depth way of thinking about the world and my place in it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is a great window into the anthropology discipline. It establishes a good foundation for other anthro classes. It wasn't too broad (which is the risk with an intro course) so I engaged well with specific ideas. The course also gives good tools for other discipline, like understanding of cultural relativism, structural forces, cultural phenomena etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course fundamentally changed how I approach and view the world and the society around me. The ethnographic assignments could be a bit time-consuming, but they were interesting ways to engage with campus culture. They invite you to step outside yourself for a bit and really examine the sort of culture you're immersed in, and I personally found that extremely valuable as a first-year student trying to find my place at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would recommend this course. I think these lenses of analysis and modes of thinking can be helpful and interesting for any student, regardless of major or interest. I think the course does a good job connecting anthropological ideas and history to its relevance today, in a very engaging, insightful manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would be very surprised if a student taking this course was not engaged by the instructor and the material. The topics of culture, power, race, gender, and representation are things that are given importance in this class, and I believe that students would respond well to that. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely 100% recommend this course. The material covered is great, Professor Harms is greatI don't see how you could go wrong by choosing to take this course. I think everyone should leave college having some understanding of the material covered in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  I felt that this course provided me with the groundwork to better understand the place of the individual (or of differing populations) within various societal structures, and it gave me many intellectual tools that I can now use in a wide variety of situations as a method of social critique (or as a method of building bridges of understanding between populations).
