            "\u00a0Knowledge: courtly love, troubadours and trouveres, madrigals and text-painting, operas, parlor songs, blues, waltz and hip hop, etc\r\nIt's literally 1000 years of love songs.\r\n\r\nInsight/skills: analysis of songs, understanding of forms, rhyme, melody and relationship between text and music, consideration of songs in a social and historical context. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to analyze music new and old, thrive in a small setting, and prepare for discussion. \r\nThe content of the class was the perfect combination of challenging and interesting. As someone who has grown up listening to music, singing, and performing, I knew that this class was going to be a great way to ease into academic life at Yale. There were a wide variety of musical skill sets and knowledge in the room, and I feel as though that was one of the reasons why the class was so successful -- everyone brought something different to the table. Even a good friend of mine that I met through this class who has never sang much on her own or paid much attention to music found the class accessible and fun. The content before the midterm is music none of us are very familiar with, which can be frustrating when trying to recall the name and century of the piece, but exciting when thinking about how much you are learning. The content after the midterm is music we all hear pretty frequently in everyday life, but presented and discussed in a different, academic way. I learned so much in this class!\r\nI tend to thrive in a small setting, one in which I'm forced and encouraged to constantly participate. With only ten of us in the room, this class was ideal for my learning style. I don't know how this will be when it turns into a lecture. I'm hoping it will having discussion sections so that students can have the same experience as I did. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about music of the last century, from the troubadours, trouvres, to the elizabethan lute songs, to italian madrigals, to opera, to art songs of the 18th and 19th centuries, to modern day hip-hop. I also learned about the notions of love throughout the last century, and how they've changed and stayed the same.\r\nI also learned quite a bit about music, its forms, and vocabulary to talk about it in a scholarly way. For example, I learned the difference strophic settings vs. periodic settings. I was taught about conjuct vs. disjunct melodies.\r\nLastly, I learned about poetry, and the narrator or speaker as opposed to the performer. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a profound amount of knowledge of both music from different time periods and how the musical setting contributes to the meaning of songs. I was also able to discuss music in a way that I never had before, in terms of both the music itself and the context. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in insightful analysis of music history, deeper understanding of lyrical and musical tropes, and a more holistic familiarity with the love song genre. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great exposure reading/writing at the level required for studying the humanities, especially in music and cultural history. The class gave me a comprehensive knowledge of the history of love music and insight into how we study music history. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course introduced me to many genres of music that I had never heard of before and helped me understand how the structure of music has evolved over time. It also taught me how to notice themes in music whether it be within the notes of the score or the lyrics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper appreciation and understanding for music, but I also learned a lot about history, culture, and human behavior. I feel like I now have a better understanding of the world and how we as people interact with each other, both inside and outside of a musical context. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of western music history from the 12th century to the present, and increased my ability to engage in critical thought about music. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The topic is really good and the course walks us a long history of both love songs and the notion of love and sex in human society. The best of this course is YOU LISTEN TO SONGS AS HOMEWORK!\r\n\r\n Sometimes we ran out of time, but we managed to cover all the materials and it's a rewarding journey of love songs. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-small, engaging environment\r\n-listening to music for homework is a dream\r\n- readings are overall accessible\r\n-workload is very manageable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-assignments were not posted to canvas ahead of time so it was difficult to get ahead when time allowed (but Professor Z was incredibly sweet and quick to act when emailed!)\r\n-some readings were long and boring ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course, and there were many strengths. I think the way it is set up, chronologically, allows for students to learn about types of music at the beginning and better communicate their thoughts by the end when they are more familiar with the music. \r\nThe style of the class, very discussion-based, works extremely well, because different students interpret the readings and songs quite differently.\r\nThe collaborative listening guides are also helpful, because students can read each others' comments before they write their own. This ameliorates students understanding of the music.\r\nThe only improvement I think this course could go through is a slightly different arrangement of subject matter. What I mean is that the class is entitled \"1000 years of love songs,\" and yet much of it seems to be centered around the first two-hundred years of those 1000. I think the title may be a bit misleading, but it didn't bother me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - This course is taught by the most amazing professor I have ever had. She is passionate about what she teaches and she instills that passion in all of her students. The class is very well structured and I believe the readings and songs selected were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Some of the readings were a bit dry and at times I felt like the readings were not discussed in class, so sometimes it didn't feel very worthwhile to read them in full. I think it might be better to have less readings, and to cut out the Gioia. ",
            "\u00a0The small seminar format was great. I think perhaps the Gioia reading could be switched out for something more useful. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a strong course for any freshman at Yale college. Love Songs is an intimate classroom experience that's not found at many other schools, even Yale. It prepares students for the level of the work they should expect throughout their college career, but does so in a way that isn't a radical change. Instead, the class gets more difficult in increments. More than that, the class is generally interesting and every student will find some value in it and be able to apply to their own experiences and work. A notable weakness is that the class did not follow the syllabus with much rigor, but this is perhaps unavoidable given the nature of seminars. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic course to have as a freshmen seminar but I recommend it not be turned into a large lecture at any point. The small size of the class allowed me to get to know all students intimately and allowed for active discussion over all the songs we listened to. Professor Zayaruznaya is very knowledgeable in the field and that translated well into the course in terms of keeping me engaged. The only weakness I found was that the course moves slowly at the beginning of the semester because of how many (very) old songs we listen to in comparison to those on the more recent end of the spectrum. Once we hit the 1600s however, the music got significantly more interesting because there was more I could talk about-- but this is a personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0The course was described as one that did not require any musical background of its students; however, many of the other students in the class had extensive musical training, which resulted in the pace of the class increasing at such a rate that students such as myself, who had little to no musical experience, fell behind initially. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were fun and challenging, and the curriculum itself was really interesting. I just wish I could have had more time to engage with the course material. One semester is hardly enough time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0YES!\r\n\r\nBackground: a prospective CS major first-year without any background knowledge of music history but interested in music.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in music/its history, this freshman seminar is 100% your choice. It discusses the timeless theme of songs--love in social, musical and technological perspective. You can listen to a variety of genres from 12th century albas to 21st century hip hops. Isn't it cool to listen to XO as your assignment?! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. It was such a critical piece of my transition at Yale, one that made the process of settling in so much easier. Professor Z is the most kind-hearted woman, the content is interesting, the workload is not overwhelming, it's an awesome freshman seminar. For someone not going into music, no part of me regrets taking this class. It gave me so much more than a music education. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student, because I think it is fun and interesting. I also think that the work-load is manageable, and the I think the discussions are enlightening. \r\nIn addition, I think Professor Zayaruznaya is an incredible teacher and person, and I thoroughly enjoyed learning from her. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. You will enjoy the course with any musical background, and by the end you will find yourself wishing that it was a multi-semester class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any freshman at Yale. The class is a great way to transition into college life and academics. It's both stimulating and fun. Whether a student plans to study music history, or is looking for a humanities credit, this is an excellent class to take. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student but once again as a freshmen seminar. The class is very involved and everyone in the class was able to connect/appreciate many of the songs from each century. I found myself learning more than I would've imagined going into the course. ",
            "\u00a0I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS CLASS ENOUGH. It was my favorite class I took this semester. If I could take it again, I absolutely would. Professor Zayaruznaya was absolutely spectacular. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If a student is even just a tad bit interested in music and its cultural impacts and influences, this is a great course. Also a good course for history nerds, since a knowledge of music theory isn't required. "
