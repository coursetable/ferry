The class taught quantitative skills that could be used to better understand complex biological systems. The focus on application of these models helped me gain insight into biological processes and the design of medical interventions. ",
            "\u00a0First half of the course was spent analyzing the kinetics of reactions and the second half of the course was spent analyzing transport. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the details of kinetics of proteins and of mass transport and the movement of solute through a medium. I also got some grounding in modeling some problems using our knowledge of the aforementioned, and a lot of the problems were rooted in real problems that we may endeavor to solve in the future. ",

All this is to say we covered a great deal of material - the class had great breadth. ",

            "\u00a0The course was well taught and well organized. We covered a manageable amount of material in the course. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets often needed additional explanation from the tfs. The midterm project I believe was a poor use of our time. It required lots of time-consuming work and did not help me better understand the material. The midterm was fair, but the final felt way more complex that class problems. ",
            "\u00a0weakness: the exams were always on a much higher level of difficulty than any in class example/ homework problem and we were not given any other material we could have used to understand the topics as deeply.\r\n\r\na calculus review would be interesting at some point. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were very clear and the information was all clarified in section. We also went over a couple of practice problems and scenarios in class to help teach the subjects. I think a possible improvement would be to have more practice problems covered in section as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent and my favorite of the semester. The professor and TA's were all so good and caring about making sure we understood all the material and making everything as clear as possible. The notes system was excellent and the lecture style was also superb. ",
            "\u00a0It was an incredibly well taught class and it was clear that both the teacher and the TA's were very invested in the success of each student. Everything was presented in a very clear manner. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught in a very organized manner, with two main chunks: first, protein/ligand/enzyme interactions, and second, diffusion/flux. I think each module built off the previous modules in a logical manner, which was helpful to learning the material. The TAs offer very helpful sections each week which helped me to address any questions I had about lectures or the homeworks. I also found it really engaging to be able to use prerequisite classes like calculus and differential equations in a biology/chemistry setting.\r\n\r\nA weakness of the class I would say, is that the lectures can move very quickly and become overwhelming. It felt like in the first half of the class there were so many graphs that were introduced that they all started to blend together. I think it would be helpful to help students gain an intuitive understanding of each graph introduced. I also think the wording on exams and problems sets can be a little confusing or sometimes too wordy. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - teaching was incredibly great, very important skills and knowledge gained\r\nweaknesses - final was quite hard compared to the midterm, difficult to catch up if you didn't do well on midterm, psets were quite hard ",
            "\u00a0It was a strong course in that it integrated a set of interesting topics from a variety of disciplines. It could have been better if there were a more thorough set of teaching notes, and a consistent text with consistent notation to learn from. I ended up trolling the internet for some nice resources compiled by other schools (MIT, JHU, etc. ) to study from. Good course overall, but some more resources to study from would be great! esp. alternatives for students who learn less from following things drawn out on the board, and more from texts. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Midterm was very pressed for time though and final was very difficult. Overall good lectures, engaging good prof. ",
            "\u00a0HW was fair.  They were challenging but manageable and the TAs were super helpful on them.  Tests were extremely difficult and there was not enough time.  Format was good.  I really like the design project and it is honestly one of the things I am more proud of.  I dont think Ive understood a mat lab code as well as the one I made for that. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were actually very engaging and well-taught. Problem sets were reasonable, especially after having attended section. Exams were essentially fair, though the final was much harder than last year's exam, which was posted as a practice exam. The project was probably the only thing that I didn't like about this class, as it took up a lot of time that was mostly spent changing parameter guesses. I still enjoyed parts of the project, such as writing the report, and felt like it was valuable, but that more aid could be provided in choosing parameters. Other than that, this class was a great BME class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was a good course. Problem sets could be long and fairly tedious at times, but this was fairly necessary to understand the material properly. The project was actually somewhat fun and pretty engaging. Midterm and final were both difficult, but this is not a problem inherent to the course - overall, the course itself was pretty strong and well taught/run. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Splitting the material into two halves. Quick feedback on assignments. Splitting the final grade between psets, midterm, final and project. Very useful and well run review sessions. Approachable TFs and Professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Course Material in combination with the project felt a little rushed at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course organization, interesting topics, good lectures. Weaknesses: no problem set solutions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: WOW, this was such a wonderful class! Prof. Miller-Jensen and the TAs were extremely organized when it came to posting lecture notes and supplemental readings on Canvas, returning graded problem sets with clear feedback in a timely manner, and organizing review sessions and office hours for exams. I also liked that Prof. Miller-Jensen always tied the concepts we learned to larger, real-world applications in a cohesive manner. Perhaps most importantly, I really appreciated Prof. Miller-Jensen's willingness to not only listen to student feedback, but also act on it immediately to improve the course experience for us -- I think this is so rare to see, especially among BME classes, and it really goes to show how much she cares about teaching her students. Weaknesses: Really none, except some of the problem sets could have been a little less tedious and still gotten the same points across. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you have time to invest in studying the material. The problem sets weren't so difficult and section helped clarify questions but overall the material is quite challenging. You have to invest time into studying to do well on the exams. The exams are also pretty difficult but are a reflection of the material learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course. This is one of the best classes I have taken in BME, and lucky for you, it's also a required course. KMJ is so caring and so good at making sure we have all the information possible, without babying us and asking us busy-work questions on the problem sets. The focus on real world applications in BME were so good and great at making the class feel grounded in research. ",

            "\u00a0If you're in BME, I would recommend it but a non-bme major might not get too much out of the course. In terms of the level of challenge of challenge offered by the course, it makes you solve complex problems from the ground up using a set of assumptions and principles about a basic model. Good, challenging course! ",
            "\u00a0This class is actually really great; Professor Miller-Jensen is a gem and I thoroughly enjoyed her lectures. There is a LOT of information in the course though, so it can be pretty hard to keep up with sometimes, especially in the second half of the class. The homework is all really fair and can be clearly related to concepts from class, and the midterm was reasonable in the same way. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah good course overall. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This class is required for the BME major, but good news! This was the most productive, engaging, and well-run biomedical engineering class I've ever taken at Yale, probably the first one that I found both enjoyable and well-organized. The class was hard, but I enjoyed it a lot! ",
            "\u00a0If you don't need it for your major, there are probably better classes to take. But by no means is it a bad class - it's required for BME, so don't stress too much about it if you have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0It's required, but it is my favorite BME class I've taken so far ",
            "\u00a0Although this is a requirement for biomedical engineering, it is still a mandatory course that I genuinely enjoyed. It actively ties in real world scenarios so that the material is more interesting and we understand the real world application of the material. I would recommend this course to students, even if they are not BME majors. ",
            "\u00a0ye ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class! Prof. Miller-Jensen is wonderful -- she really wants the best for her students, and her lectures are clear, organized, and relevant to the problem sets and exams. She and the TAs worked well together as a team, with clear communication about how section should be run and how feedback should be given on assignments. I found this class deeply satisfying because of how I could finally apply what I had learned in differential equations to real-life applications, and it was really cool to see how various systems and processes in the body can be modeled mathematically. Although the design project was frustrating at times, I thought it was a wonderful way to tie together concepts from the first half of the course and allow us to demonstrate the full extent of what we had learned. Overall, I just really appreciated Prof. Miller-Jensen's willingness to listen to student feedback, which makes such a huge difference in making a class fulfilling and enjoyable. This course reaffirmed both my interest in BME and my faith in the BME department. "
