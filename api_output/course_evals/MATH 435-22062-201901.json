            "\u00a0I developed some of the basic notions of differential geometry including the idea of surfaces in n dimensions, basic calculus on those surfaces, the notion of geodesics and parallel transport, curvature of surfaces, and a basic introduction to riemannian metrics. ",
            "\u00a0Extrinsic and intrinsic views of characterizing manifolds ",
            "\u00a0The very basics of differential geometry - curves, surfaces, maps, vector fields, etc. Basically it closely followed the first 15 chapters of Elementary Topics in Differential Geometry by Thorpe. "

            "\u00a0Strength: The instructor not only gives rigorous definitions and properties of curves/surfaces/manifolds but also illustrates them using graphs, which are very intuitive and help understanding a lot.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I hope the course can be more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course had a reasonable workload and stayed on topic. \r\nWeakness: The course could use a little more.... fun. It just didn't feel particularly engaging and I never really was given a reason to be excited about the material. The take home tests were generally very fair but one of the questions on the final seemed a bit off base. Overall, I just wish applications were discussed a little more to motivate the students' interest in the material. Also, during the couple days of classes we discussed topics in Barrett O'Neill's book Semi-Riemannian Geometry With Applications to Relativity, and it was incomprehensibly fast. Granted, we weren't assessed over this material but it really felt like we were thrown into the deep end and weren't prepared for it. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in differential geometry, take the course. Prof Moncrief follows a book which gives a nice introduction to the topic without needing to build up the full machinery of manifolds which I found to be helpful for gaining intuition about surfaces and curvature. Recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a very good introduction course to differential geometry. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn differential geometry and Moncrief is teaching it then this is your run of the mill course. Just know that you probably won't be roped in and will have to find the motivation to do a lot of things on your own. "
