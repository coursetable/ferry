            "\u00a0I learned how to write with more precision and clarity, and to push myself. (Cannot overstate the value of these skills.) ",
            "\u00a0I was emotionally invested in the essays I wrote, an experience different from producing work for any other class. Writing for this class was both incredibly challengingand often frustratingand, when it went well, extremely rewarding. \r\n\r\nI also realized how much time it really takes to write something I'm proud of. And though I realized it, I regrettably wasn't always able to put that time in. \r\n\r\nI don't feel as if I improved as a writer, but I definitely did as a thinker. ",
            "\u00a0I feel a lot more confident in my writing abilities after taking this class. Before, I was used to the more academic approach to writing, so this class pushed me to be more creative. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about narrative and clean writing, as well as how the essay influences contemporary discourse. ",
            "\u00a0The course can be rigorous because such a high level of accountability is placed on the student. Professor Zarin does not provide topics for the essays so each student is responsible for developing their own topics and pushing them as far as possible. I think the course taught me to trust myself with my instincts but also to question why I know something works and does not work. I have a better understanding of what constitutes an essay and what does not. I took many risk in the class, some of which were successful and others that flopped. The class does encourage you to try new techniques while being conscious that you should not stray too far from your own style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I improved at crafting essays, focusing especially on being concise and not self-indulgent in my writing.  I also got better at stepping out of my comfort zone and allowing myself to go into essays without already knowing exactly where I was going.  I learned how treat writing an essay as more of a journey. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of the essay genre and the variety of approaches that can be taken towards writing about oneself, and the more universal implications of that. I feel like my writing has improved in leaps and bounds over the course of the semester. I feel like a much more confident writer, but beyond that, writing on a weekly basis made me better at not having to think too much before I write. Writing routinely made me realize that half the trick is just sitting down and doing it. \r\n\r\nThis class has been a thinking class for me. While it might be titled \"Writing the Contemporary Essay,\" this class, could easily have been named \"Thinking the Contemporary Essay\". Having to write without prompts for the entirety of the semester meant that I was made to write about what I was really thinking about. In doing so, I think I was able to puzzle out a lot of things I was wondering about outside of class. Personal questions. Ideas. The class gave me the time, and necessary process to be thinking about myself and where I am at. There is nothing more valuable a college class can do in my opinion. "

            "\u00a0Overall this is a wonderful course. It is fairly unstructured, and for the most part this works well: we are simply there to write, and to talk about writing. I enjoyed reading samples of essays every week, particularly from the Best American Essays, and I thought the challenge of writing 5 essays over the course of a semester was perfect for pushing us to develop our skills. I also think having the word count change was very smart as it pushed us in different ways each time. I would only change the workshops: I think slightly more structured workshops where we have to prepare comments on the essays before class would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0There's no syllabus. Readings are assigned ad hoc each week. Prof. Zarin doesn't give us letter grades on our essays (or any feedback besides line edits and minimal structural comments). At the time of writing this eval, I have no clue if I'll be receiving a C or an A- for the classnot the class to take if you dread this uncertainty.\r\n\r\nBut Prof. Zarin knows her shit. Her guidance is, more often than not, abstract, but what she said always rang true. The chance to write five essays without prompt, without guidance, is huge: you'll stretch your mind and end up exercising writerly chops you didn't know you had. But it takes a lot of time and, for me, a lot of patience. You'll also bond with the other students in the workshop, which is a big plus. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great way to improve your creative writing skills, even if you've never had any creative writing experience. The class itself was kind of like a group therapy session--you spend a lot of time reading and workshopping other people's essays. You'll also read essays from a variety of great essayists, which exposes you to a range of styles. I definitely felt like my writing improved a lot over the semester, but it won't happen unless you actually put in the work. It was a little frustrating not having a syllabus, and occasionally the class felt a little disorganized, but overall it was a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and essay assignments were compelling and educational. The workshop could have been more organized and the instruction at times lacked levity or imagination. ",
            "\u00a0The application aspect of the course is definitely stifling in terms of diversity. The course ended up being eleven white people and one Latino student, myself. A considerable chunks of the assigned readings focused on race-based identity politics and class economics. The discussions in the course about these topics were superficial and reserved. I do not know why other students didn't engage with the topics with a higher level of thoughtfulness and were so tepid about the discussion. \r\n\r\nOther students often commented on the lack of diversity to me outside of class as a means to vent but most of them weren't proactive in class to change the diversity of thought. As the course progressed, I became tired of students looking at me be the token representative of racial discussions so I spoke less and less. I didn't make new friends in the class and I do attribute that to the lack of diversity and how dicey the topic was in class. I don't think this discussion is particular to this class, but part of a much larger discussion in the English department. Students of colors are often ostracized by faculty and white students. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course was Professor Zarin's feedback.  She's very good at helping you get to the core of what your essay is about and cutting extraneous language.  She's also not afraid to call you out for falling back on certain habits and make you step out of your comfort zone.\r\n\r\nI wish the class were slightly more organized.  It wasn't always clear what readings were going to be discussed for each class, and the readings themselves didn't seem particularly connected to each other.  The discussions could also have benefitted from a bit more structure and guidance on Professor Zarin's part. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I found the structure of the class worked very well. We discussed other essays for half of the class, and then workshopped people's essays for the other half of class. I enjoyed reading other essays in combination with writing my own work. I found this process very helpful for experimenting with different approaches to the essay. \r\n\r\nI also found the peer editing to be a central part of the class, and an aspect that I found very helpful. Working with different people in the class no only allowed me to get a variety of feedback on my writing, but also allowed me to get to know people in the class better. I always find a class more engaging and rewarding if I feel that I know the people I am in class with. This was definitely the case in this class. We ended up getting to know different aspects of each other through reading each others work, and having to critique each others writing. \r\n\r\nOne thing that could have been improved was the way the reading was distributed. By the end of the semester, it became a bit unclear as to what the reading assignments were for each week.  This is not dramatically change the class, as we ended up spending more time discussing our own work at the end of the semester, but it is one aspect of the class that could be improved. "

            "\u00a0If you want to learn to write essays, take this class. If you want to write something else but want to push yourself on your technical skills, take this class. Writing the contemporary essay is a LOT harder than it sounds, and it doesn't sound easy; this is to say that it is extremely, extremely hard, in a way that will demand that you take care with your writing in a way that cannot be anything but generative. Professor Zarin is extremely incisive about writing and will push you to do better. You will do better, and you will end up at the end of the semester having written about things you didn't know you wanted to write about, and didn't know you could. If you are willing to put in the time and sincere effort, this course will develop you as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to write five essays without prompts and are OK not knowing how you're doing until the end, go for it. It's a unique, challenging workshop experience. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it if you're willing to put in the work. If you're the kind of person who starts essays at the last minute, you'll learn to stop doing that here. Professor Zarin can tell! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are up for a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I do recommend the course solely for Professor Zarin, and I say this having been the only student of color in the class. I found her comments and feedback to be deep and tailored to my specific writing style. I had frank conversations about the lack of diversity in class and department with her. She was receptive to these discussion and is actively taking steps to address the issues of diversity and representation in the major. The students were a toss-up in terms of engagement and peer-relationships. A few approached me candidly and respectfully about the racial discussions and others were flippant about it with me. I do think my writing improved significantly because of Professor Zarin's guidance. ",
            "\u00a0This was undoubtedly one of my favorite classes this semester. Having to work on my writing consistently was a deeply rewarding and challenging task. Writing was something I had done a fair amount of in an academic context - writing papers about books, or about class content - but creative non-fiction was not something I had much practice with. This class has made me want to do much more creative writing, and I feel, has given me the best possible start for writing on my own. If you are looking for a class where you will receive a lot of feedback on your work, but aren't too concerned with getting graded, this class will suit you well. By the end of the semester, I felt really excited by improvements in my work, and terribly sad that the class was coming to an end. "
