            "\u00a0I gained not only a newfound appreciation for food but a newly gained ability to write about many different aspects of food culture. We studied agriculture, we read cookbooks, we tasted cheese and watched Julia Child. I became a better essayist and journalist, and found the readings and assignments making me a more considerate eater. ",
            "\u00a0Great! So much food tasting and reading a lot of seminal food literature ",
            "\u00a0Learning how to write narratives, journalistic entries, and how to properly compose an articulate food review ",
            "\u00a0Techniques and concepts used to write narratives involving food. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about writing a personal essay in this class. I have only ever written analytical essays, so this was very different and very informative! It was also under a pretty low-stress, fun topic so it was always enjoyable to do the readings and write. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding on how food is created and the multiple different facets of food. ",
            "\u00a0I have thought deeply about how my food pathways have impacted my culture.  I learned about the meat industry, the unattainability of \"boutique\" healthy foods, the role of the restaurant critic, and examined ancient cookbooks. "

            "\u00a0This course would have been perfect if the course organization had been better and the grading more transparent. I really could never predict which grade I would get, or why I would get a high/low grade because at times it seemed like the grading was quite arbitrary. I loved the discussion, the teaching, the food tastings. Not so much the workshop. People just didn't seem to be very engaging. Some of the readings were dull and very long. The course package was a mess. Instructions for assignments were somewhat unclear. ",
            "\u00a0hard class...she is a hard grader ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved the variety of food media we consumed and studied to reach the core of food writing. I think Professor Stuart is unmatched in her knowledge of food literature, something she shows in the interesting essays, shows, and cookbooks she shares with the class. While I would have liked to learn a little bit more about how to put certain flavors into words, that remains my one critique to an overall wonderful class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Stuart really listens to students and improves curriculum and content based on feedback. She's really caring and engaging, and as a whole the class was fun and cute. I liked the group work because it helped me get close to members of the class! Also, the cheese and food she brought in were deliciousss.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes I wish the discussions got deeper than they did, but I appreciate that she made an effort to include everyone. I also wish she would curve, especially if she gives grades that are hard to make an A with, even if most of your assignments you did really well on! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Analyzing different food articles ",
            "\u00a0A very straight forward structure where we would read great pieces of food writing and try to incorporate those into our upcoming essays, split into 4 units. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly interesting! The readings were great, and I liked the incorporation of different media for food reporting. The essay prompts were very broad, so if you had an idea for a topic to write about it was nice that it would probably apply, however, if you didn't know what to write, it was incredibly frustrating because there was minimal support for topic choosing. Overall, this course was pretty disorganized, in addition to overly broad essay prompts. The syllabus was changed pretty frequently so it was hard to know what homework we had. It was also not uncommon to not be able to find the readings, or have all of the pages in the course packet. I think in general just a lot of the instruction for this class was very unclear, and the professor had a very narrow idea of what she was looking for, so we were just guessing blind for a lot of it. ",
            "\u00a0Very intersting topics, could be improved with a bit more organization. ",
            "\u00a0Grading seemed a bit arbitrary "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes if you really really want to write about food. It's very hard to get an A. Grading is harsh and unpredictable. If you're not a humanities major/good writer, you will struggle. ",
            "\u00a0its an amazing class but hard to do well in ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone who has ever eaten anything in their lives. Not only is this a very fun class, but visits to the Beineke and discussions of climate change make this an incredibly thoughtful class as well. Some of my favorite personal writing was done through this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you enjoy food and are looking for an interesting writing credit, it's a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is very engaging and enjoyable. If you like reading and writing about foods, this course is a must. We even tried several chocolates, cheeses, and desserts throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course felt more like writing stories with food in them, rather than writing about food itself. If using food as a lens to explore cultural or family narratives is something you want, then certainly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested by the syllabus, I would say definitely take this class. The readings are very interesting throughout the semester, and the essays are pretty different so you can try different approaches to writing. There is going to be more work than you expect, but Barbara Stuart is very understanding and not too strict. There are \"passes\" you can get by doing random things in class, which you can use later to get 24 hour extensions on assignments. However, if you take this class, you have to be prepared to be confused a lot and not know what you are supposed to be doing or what Barbara Stuart is looking for. But also you eat food in class so I would say its worth it! But I love free food in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is interesting to learn about everything food related. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!  If you are interested in how the food industry impacts your food pathways and choices, I recommend you take this course.  Readings are reasonable and very interesting. "
