            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to international LGBTQ+ movements and the politics surrounding gender and sexuality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a wide swath of LGBTQ rights abuses and various theories of LGBTQ rights. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the complexities of Human Rights work that aims to protect specific gender identities and sexualities. This included addressing language barriers, colonialism, and religious and political backlash to said rights. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about LGBT rights transnationally and also the implications of anthropological literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read academic literature more critically and also how to engage with international LGBT rights activism with considerations towards social and cultural differences. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course taught me not only an entirely new vocabulary but also a far better and more nuanced understanding of sexuality. As often I as I reject the effectiveness of the global scale in academia, I think this course complicated my understanding of identity that had been too narrow by introducing me to other understandings and expressions.

            "\u00a0Professor Reid and out TF, Jason, were fantastic and made this course really rewarding. The reading list was also very strong. However, I think this course would work better as a seminar rather than a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and offered me new ways to consider LGBTQ rights around the world. I think it could be strengthened by the addition of various case studies to which theories can be applied. ",
            "\u00a0The course offers some really interesting readings, and Professor Reid is an incredibly experienced and knowledgeable individual to learn from. We had very frequent and engaging discussions in both lecture and discussion section, although at a certain point the material got a little bit redundant. Many readings seemed to be making the same main argument, and after a certain point it felt like we had read the same thing three or four times. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Allowing students to complete papers with loose deadlines was super helpful with busy schedules. Because the class was so small, there was a lot of individualized attention.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Perhaps too many quotes on lecture slides sometimestrade some of these in for case study data. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions in class and in section were a major strength whether they had to do with the readings or real world case studies. ",
            "\u00a0I think the feedback given in the last class discussion covered everything. "

            "\u00a0Yes, particularly if you're looking to take a first WGSS class or get introduced to this subject with an emphasis on international movements. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in LGTBQ rights and want to learn more about how globalizing ideologies can damage rights around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could use a little bit of syllabus remodeling, but otherwise I would recommend this course. It offers a really important window into global queer identities that I had never previously been exposed to, but I think is a crucial part to becoming a global citizen. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. You dont have to have a strong background knowledge about LGBT rights because you start with a historical lens of the movement. I think this course is also great for anyone interested in human rights in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. Especially if a person thinks that this is something they might be interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this course, especially with its flexibility, is an effective way of engaging with gender and sexuality theory that often seems both inaccessible and purely academic. "
