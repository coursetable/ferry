            "\u00a0I learned to analyze much better. ",
            "\u00a0This class provides an excellent cultural history of Tokyo from many centuries ago to the present. Each class, we would do readings on and then discuss one specific, in-depth historical phenomenon-- everything from the processions of the daimyo to the WWII zoo massacres to the history of Ramen. The readings were long, but absolutely worth it. Many of our discussions involved comparing texts from a wide variety of sources, and I think that helped me become a more critical thinker. This class also improved my writing skills; it's a great writing credit because you have a lot of flexibility in terms of what you choose to write about. ",
            "\u00a0Historical thinking; the ability to analyze historical sources; researching skills.\r\nI also gained a significant amount of systematic knowledge on Tokyos history and Japanese history in general. ",
            "\u00a0Course covers Japanese history in detail with an emphasis placed on Tokyo, starting from its earliest beginnings as a small village and ending with its emergence as the world's largest city. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense about Tokyo from this course.  It does not matter if you have lived in Tokyo before or if you have never been to Japan, there is definitely something in this course fore everyone.  In addition, professor Drixler is great at leading discussion and teaching you how to really think critically. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many interesting aspects and issues in the history of Tokyo. I also learned how to write a historical research paper and analyze historical sources for bias. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many facts about Tokyo, and how to approach thoughtful discussion and writing. ",
            "\u00a0-An extensive understanding of how a historian works and thinks. \r\n\r\n-I discovered a lot about Japanese culture and East Asian history.\r\n\r\n-Made me see the world from a different point of view. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Drixler is fantastic. The class discussions are engaging. The students are given a lot of freedom surrounding when they write their essays and what they write them on. \r\nWeaknesses: Many of the readings were unnecessarily long-- often, we would have gotten just as much out of reading 80 pages as 150-- and sometimes they were super-specific before we had the context for understanding them, which made them hard to read. So maybe it could be improved by taking the last ten minutes of each discussion and devoting it to a mini-lecture preparing us for the next reading. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly the class as it is is perfect enough. The syllabus is good, the learning pace was very fine, and all the readings are so interesting. Maybe, if time allows, I would like to see more student research projects - like the ones we did in the Peabody Museum - throughout the term. But otherwise this class is very very good. Taking this class is honestly the best choice I made this semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was essentially perfect. The readings were very interesting and thought-provoking but didn't require that much time to complete. The in-class discussion was similarly interesting, and professor Drixler really made an effort to try to answer every question thoughtfully and completely. ",
            "\u00a0There is not much to say about the weaknesses of the course.  It is great! ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were very insightful, though the readings were sometimes too long and repetitive. It was nice that we read many different types of sources, including comics, scholarly articles, films, and even the experiences of contemporary Japanese visitors! ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the small seminar style and the fact that we had many options to choose from for our three shorter papers. A weakness was that some of the readings at the beginning seemed unnecessarily long, which resulted in some skimming. ",
            "\u00a0There should be a better regulation of how much each student can talk in the classroom. In all other respects the course was excellent. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Drixler is a fantastic teacher, deeply knowledgeable of the subject, and he makes the class a true delight. The workload isn't that much, with about 120 pages of reading a week, along with 3 short essays and a term paper, but all were on interesting subjects that were fun to learn about. I looked forward to every class. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting class and great teacher but the reading load is too much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You will love this class if you are interested in diving into Japanese history in a really in-depth way-- like most history classes, this class will be fun if you are passionate about the content, but boring if you aren't. Professor Drixler's seminar discussions were some of the highlights of my semester: he is one of the most knowledgeable people I have ever met. Truly an expert in his field!! If you are at all interested in East Asian Studies, try to take this class. Be prepared to do a lot of reading, and as it's a writing credit, to write four or five essays. All the students are fairly engaged throughout each seminar because no laptops or tablets are allowed. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class is so well-taught and I would recommend it to everyone, whether they are know Japanese well prior to taking the class or not. There is always something new to learn about. Ive in fact already recommended the same professors other class to some friends! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a very interesting but somewhat challenging seminar. The class is only about 14 kids maximum so each person does have to do the reading otherwise the class discussion can move a little slowly. Regardless of whether or not you're interested in Japanese history beforehand doesn't make that much of a difference because the readings are interesting by themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you have the chance.  And get to know professor Drixler too!  He is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend! It's an interesting topic from which to approach history, and you get sushi at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Every discussion was interesting and engaging. Professor Drixler is extremely knowledgeable and provides a very friendly classroom setting. There was a big range in the class in terms of how much people knew about Tokyo coming in, but it was always easy to draw on the readings to participate even for those with no or very limited background knowledge. \"Tokyo\" might sound a bit random or narrow, but the class teaches more broadly about culture and the subject of history. Also, Professor Drixler hosts a sushi night late in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to anyone, even to the ones that aren't interested as much to learn East Asian history. However, I would warn them that the workload goes well beyond most of that of other Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. While the reading load is somewhat heavy, it's completely worth the effort as it covers an impressive amount of material and prepares you for truly fascinating discussions in class. Prof. Drixler does a fantastic job of guiding discussions while both challenging and supporting student ideas. The material covered goes far beyond what is listed on the syllabus, as discussions often turn from the more detail-oriented material of the readings and into broader questions such as the role of the historian and different definitions of good versus evil.
