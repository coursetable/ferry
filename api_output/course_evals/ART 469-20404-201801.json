            "\u00a0Graphic design skills in general. Although I have never taken a typography course, I garnered basic knowledge on type from the first half of the semester. I also learned a lot about the history and lineage of design through the lectures. During the second half of the semester, I was able to focus more on the translation of an idea to a concept due to the nature of the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge to graphic design history and basic graphic design skills ",
            "\u00a0This course has two parts. The first (before spring break) was taught by Douglass Scott and focused around the history of graphic design. The main design project for this half was to write and design an accordion book about an important graphic designer. The second half was a more standard critique centered class taught by Julian Bittiner. The project for this half centered around making a large weltformat poster and corresponding small screen-based animation. The prompt for this project was a NYT opinion piece that discussed a topic of interest. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course. The first part of the class, graphic design history, was incredibly informative and very clearly showed the patters that emerge when taking a holistic view of graphic art. The second part was as well in applying what we learned to a more contemporary project (a poster and instagram gif). Overall, really enjoyable and well planned and taught. You will learn a lot! "

            "\u00a0The lectures are great and so insightful. The only downside to the course was the change of schedule due to snow day, which was a shame. ",
            "\u00a0I hope the second half part of the course could include lecture and crit like the first half ",
            "\u00a0Doug's lectures were some of the best I have ever listened to. They were engaging, fun, full of detail. The critique section of the course had its typical flaws: the quality of the class is strongly dependent on the rest of the students. Both Doug and Julian were able to give meaningful and helpful criticism, but the students lacked enthusiasm and dedication to make the class a full experience. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this class is built to be taught alongside the MFA Preliminary students. This could have been a great learning experience for the undergrads, but the class was divided so that no overlapping time was spent. I think it would be much better if the students could see each others work and progress some of the time. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this should have been the first course in the undergraduate graphic design trajectory as opposed to the last. If you don't know the past, you're doomed to repeat it, and it seems as though that is often the case with work in intro and intermediate design. I feel as though teaching graphic design history as a intro or intermediate prerequisite would really serve to elevate and inform students' practice as they move through the graphic design curriculum.

            "\u00a0Yes. Any one who is interested in design in general should take the course because of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will recommend this course to another student. The graphic design history lecture introduce by Douglass is really comprehensive and helpful so do the assignments. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in graphic design, or a graphic design concentration art major, and have already taken many of the lower-level design classes, this class could be for you. I would not recommend this class to someone who does not have the necessary experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. Doug Scott is amazing and his lectures are both entertaining and rich. Julian's portion of the class is also well paced and organized, and builds upon the last of Doug's lectures which focus on contemporary design practice. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. The history lectures are outstanding. The assignments are fun and not too stressful. "
