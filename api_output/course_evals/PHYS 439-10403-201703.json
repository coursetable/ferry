            "\u00a0I gained a tremendous insight into quantum physics, into the nature of the world and how we can use mathematical tools like eigenfunctions and Hilbert spaces to understand phenomena that are fairly nonintuitive. This course really teaches the power of \"working through the math\" in order to find out cool things about systems. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about quantum mechanics ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the formalism of linear algebra than I knew coming into the course, although I still don't feel totally comfortable with the concepts. We covered the basic quantum mechanical time independent problems in depth, so I feel comfortable solving problems like the quantum wells. However, a lot of hand-wavy math was used to explain problems like the simple harmonic oscillator or delta-function potential, so I'm less comfortable with those. The concept of spin was actually explained fairly well but we did not have enough time to explore it fully. "

            "\u00a0Very strong materials with which to learn. No complaints on this front. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was that it was taught by Prof. Peter Rakich, who is just the most amazing instructor in this field (more on that later). It was paced very well, and managed to cover a great deal. ",
            "\u00a0So I think this class is fundamentally flawed. I simply think that quantum is too much material and too much math to be able to get a good grasp on the concepts and applications in just one semester. The thing that I have noticed with it is that you are playing catch up with trying to understand the formalism or the math behind quantum and you end up leaving concepts behind or vice-versa. The saving grace of this class was that Professor Rakich was incredibly helpful and kind. ",
            "\u00a0I think more time should be spent teaching linear algebra ",
            "\u00a0The course tries to cover far too much material in far too little time. One of the biggest shortcomings is that it is not stricter about having knowledge of linear algebra and other math concepts before entering the course, so most of the time is spent wrapping your head around mathematical ideas that are essentially brand new. I do not believe PHYS 301 is reasonable preparation for this course. "

            "\u00a0This course is worth taking as an introduction to quantum mechanics and is easily accessible to physicists. ",
            "\u00a0Would I recommend this course?! Without a flippin hesitation! Students, take this course with Professor Rakich, and you will be guaranteed a solid foundation in quantum physics. The workload - a problem set every week or so - is manageable, and even fun. The class really impressed me, at least, by drawing out the mysteries of quantum into bite-sized concepts: non-commutative operations, operators, what spin really is, how to understand the relationship between energy and time. Everything it promised, and more. ",
            "\u00a0So,it depends on what you want in the class. If you are really comfortable with linear algebra and can pick up on the formalism quickly, I say go for it. My advice would be to talk to people who have taken 439 and people who have taken 440 and see what works best for you. I think that Rakich makes this class so if he isn't teaching it, I would be hesitant. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course over 440 if Rakich is teaching. He really cares about his students and makes the class very enjoyable. I would recommend taking linear algebra before this course ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student, although I'm not sure that the alternative quantum course is superior. Quantum is a challenging subject, and requires a strong background in linear algebra-- if you have this background, you can probably enjoy the class a lot more. "
