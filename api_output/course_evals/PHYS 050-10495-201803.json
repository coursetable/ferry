            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of important technologies in the world, how they developed, and the future of these technologies. ",
            "\u00a0The class covered a wide variety of topics involving the history and modern applications of various technologies, as well as their applications. I not only learned about these topics, but also gained insight into how to consider unintended consequences of policy and its implementation. ",
            "\u00a0I gained some knowledge of basic scientific concepts/technologies/issues and their relationship to public policy, from a campus-wide to national level. I gained particular insight into some of Yale's energy policies. I would not say I gained any significant skills from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insights into the mechanics behind daily technology that I never thought about. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper appreciation for power plants and how they work. ",
            "\u00a0Although the course said it talked about policy, a lot of what we discussed had to do with history and development of technology ",
            "\u00a0I learned about energy, carbon, and sustainability. The class taught me a lot about energy distribution across the country and included informative seminars with different members of the Yale community. I learned about the carbon tax and Yale's sustainability plan. ",
            "\u00a0A greater understanding of some fundamental technologies and how they are used in the US and at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great exploration of various modern technologies! I enjoyed the guest lectures and tours. ",
            "\u00a0I developed problem-solving skills related to solving empirical questions without any hand-holding. Often times we would be tasked with answering questions where we would have to do online research to solve with our best estimates. "

            "\u00a0Strengths- accessible science course to non-science majors, guest lecturers interesting, small size\r\nWeaknesses- fairly boring lectures from professor (not really seminar), expectations not communicated so clearly\r\nImprovements- do not schedule midterm exam and final presentations right after Fall and Thanksgiving break... this does not allow students to have an actual break and is my biggest criticism of the course. Make guidelines for the final paper, presentation, midterm, and homework more clear, ex: provide an example for each ",
            "\u00a0This course did an excellent job of covering a wide-variety of topics in detail, as well as considering the possibilities involved in future innovation.\r\n\r\nThe first few lectures on the general history and background for what the seminar covered, however, were not as engaging as later lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a decent gut science course for those looking to gain basic knowledge of modern scientific advancements. It covers a variety of topics, has a relaxed workload, and features many diverse speakers and trips around Yale campus. The environment it fosters is non-threatening and very manageable, and the relatively small class size makes it feel like a community. The student-researched presentations were the most personally rewarding, and where I was able to learn the most.\r\n\r\nAlthough the topics themselves are interesting and the class relaxed, I found the curriculum and teaching disappointing. First and foremost, despite being a first-year seminar, the course is overtly a lecture class. Students rarely participated, and the lecture itself lacked direction, glossed over many complex concepts and facts, and failed to engage with the interests of the students. The fact that several students in such a small \"seminar\" could be found sleeping each class speaks to this. I felt the curriculum itself was also poorly paced and structured; the course seemed much like a rehash of high school science and history that last-minute remembered to include some sparse commentary on public policy and throw in some articles that were quickly discussed and then forgotten.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is that low-expectation classes like these are not necessarily bad. It is okay to have a course that is relaxed and features a low work load. But the information offered in class should at the very least be effective. If not to simply add more diverse and engaging discussion in which the questions asked of students are not simply rhetorical, yes-no, or based on rote memorization, the lecture material itself might benefit from being taught in a more \"top-down\" approach starting with relevant tech-based policy issues that capture student interest, and then explaining them using concrete and well-explained scientific concepts (eg. starting with the role of Facebook/social media in the 2016 election, and then analyzing how neural nets, algorithms, computing, bots, Moore's Law, quantum computing, etc. do or will play a role in politics.) The course could also focus on preparing students specifically for the guest lectures and trips so that they can be more readily applicable and enlightening, rather than just an interesting side diversion vaguely connected to the material. The teacher should be more active in interacting with the students and their interests, as well as current events, and give deeper explanations of the science. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that really interesting and knowledgeable guest lecturers come into the classroom. These lectures were about the topics we were learning but it gave the class the opportunity to learn from another perspective. However a weakness of this course is that it didnt feel scientific at all, it was more a superficial analysis of how things worked. We also only discussed broad public policy, if at all, instead of actual policies like I had hoped for. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course jumped around in terms of material, we'd go back and forth between different topics and it could use more organization ",
            "\u00a0Each class was a different topic which was exciting and captivating. It was nice to have very lecture online, once recommendation would to have more information on slides. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures need to be more interactive. Its just the teacher talking to the class. And more preparation for the midterm. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting content, at times quite brief meaning we don't get a true understanding of many of the portions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very engaging and I enjoyed the material. Some assignments could have been explained more, such as the final paper and group presentation. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a non-science major interested in a broader overview of science. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone who has a general interest in science, but doesn't have plans to study it in greater depth later in their college career. The material was engaging and relevant to the technologies and related issues of today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wanted a relaxed science class, but not to someone actually deeply interested in understanding the science itself and its relation to relevant, exciting policy issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another person if they are super interested in the course from the very beginning, like from shopping period. If youre looking for a class with little work, and a good learning environment, this is a good one to take. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good science credit for first years. Course lectures were a little dense at times, but overall had interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if the organization of the course was improved, honestly the lessons and main points of each topic were a bit unclear and we didn't have any clear direction ",
            "\u00a0Yes if the student is interested in learning about energy and sustainability. ",
            "\u00a0NO. This class is not a gut. Theres not much work, but its hard. Average on the midterm was in the low 70s. You need to have a strong level of physics going into the class. Only like 5 psets which are easy. Midterm is really hard, final paper and project are meh. Lectures are very dry though. Its a tough class to get through. Wouldnt recommend. ",
            "\u00a0If they are really interested to know a lot about how Yale produces energy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to a student who is very interested in modern technology. However, there was not much discussion about policy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students that are looking for a more general understanding of the sciences and who may be looking to specialize in energy or environmental related fields. "
