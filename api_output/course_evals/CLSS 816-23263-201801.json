            "\u00a0There was a significant revamp of any knowledge I had of Plato prior to the course. Very insightful, and challenging. Certainly difficult to navigate both the text in its historical context + any trends/assumptions in secondary scholarship, but the opportunity to have questions answered was both satisfied by the emphasis on discussion board posts and Prof. Harte's availability in office hours. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Harte was prepared and went above and beyond. As chair of the department at a university like Yale, in addition to the scholarship she produces, I was not expecting a high level of engagement from her (since she has already proven her academic worth in publications, ideas, and prestige alone), but she was by far one of the most caring and involved professors I have had at Yale. Prof. Harte made consistent efforts to draw out ideas and encourage contributions from members of the class who were not graduate students/were quieter, and her commitment to the growth of her students was evident in the way that she prepared the class (even going so far as to have handouts for each session with the names of people who asked certain questions). I admired her before as a scholar-- I am happy to say, that after taking a course with her and getting to know her, that I admire her as a person, too. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is difficult to think of any, to be honest, but if the course were to be taught again, I would have found it helpful to have understood some of the assumptions being made, and the relationships between certain people, in secondary scholarship. Most of the names were new to me, and it was only by the end of the semester that I started being able to connect some of the people together (ex. Nehamas was a student of Vlastos). This perhaps would have been helpful to know upfront, insofar as it would have allowed more critical analysis of their papers, and to help identify reactions or trends in the field. Since a good amount of the course was not only concerned with navigating Plato's dialogues but also combatting many assumptions in secondary scholarship, having some extra tools to help navigate secondary scholarship itself seems like it would be valuable.

            "\u00a0Yes, although I would emphasize that this course was more time consuming and challenging than many of the other Yale courses I have taken, and that most- if not all- of the students have a working knowledge of Ancient Greek, and/or are graduate students who are specifically doing work in Plato or Aristotle. Make no mistake, the course was advertised as advanced, but I underestimated how intimidating the classroom environment might be to someone who wasn't planning on doing, say, a dissertation on Plato. Overall, though, I would enthusiastically recommend the course to anyone who claims to be up for the challenge. "
