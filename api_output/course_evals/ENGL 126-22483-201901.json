            "\u00a0Learned how to better read, interpret, and discuss poetry ",
            "\u00a0We read a great variety of poets from Alexander Pope to Sylvia Plath. We analyzed how the poetry related to the different social, political, and art movements of the times, and spoke about the writers as people and as poets. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt how to read and analyse some of the major works in English poetry, paying aparticular attention to form and structure. There was a lot of focus on close reading techniques and some comparison between authors and how they were influenced by or shaped the poetic genre they were writing in. There was also some discussion of other artistic influences, such as visual art, architecture and history. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to read poetry critically and analyze meaning and style. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about six major poets and the contexts in which they lived, which informed us to give a thorough close reading of their works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about analyzing poetry, especially in the context of poets with particular and compelling lives in which their poetry is situated. I wrote about poetry, and feel prepared to do so again. I feel very well versed in the 6 poets we read. "

            "\u00a0This class was interesting, relaxing, and engaging, and I always felt comfortable enough to speak up in class and share my opinion. Prof Ellerman was amazing at listening to the students and always making us feel like our points were valid. The texts were surprisingly very interesting and quite accessible, and I enjoyed this course A LOT more than English Poetry I. I would recommend to majors and non-majors alike.\r\n\r\nIt would have been nice to spend more time on Plath, Walcott, and some of the later writers, but I totally understand that there is only so much that we can cover in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-structured for teaching close reading technique and receiving feedback on writing. The small size of the class also meant that students could always be actively engaged in discussion. The course might have been improved through having less presciptive topics for each paper - for example, having a comparative question or allowing students to use more secondary criticism in their essays. There was not a lot of comparison across authors and sometimes there was not enough time to discuss all of the material in enough depth. We moved very quickly through a lot of authors! ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting but sometimes classroom discussion was slow. Would have to loved to participate in more smaller group discussions throughout the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think we had really fruitful discussions about the poems and Professor Ellermann did a great job at guiding discussion. We always had so much to talk about so I never felt like class was dragging on. I also liked that we didnt have assigned discussion leaders for every class because that gave us freedom in what to talk about. Also the reading load was never overwhelming but still gave us enough content to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the class doesn't do the entire reading assignment leading to some discussions which are too focused on singular poems and limits the ability of discussion to tend towards works as a whole. Finding a way to encourage reading would lead to better discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was the immersion in the lives and work of the poets studied. This course style allowed students to feel a fuller and stronger grasp on the work of those six poets. This kind of engagement with the poets is conducive to longterm understanding of the material we studied. The weakness of this class was that some students had not studied poetry at all in high school, so the class felt like my 10th grade poetry class. We learned terms that some students hadn't heard of and others knew quite well, and this difference in experience level was often present. "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student. It is challenging but rewarding. A great English class if you're even slightly into poetry because many of the poems we read are quite ~edgy~ or interesting. There's bound to be something in here that interests you. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fine for an english poetry course. The readings and class discussion was fairly interesting but if the student is taking this class just for an immersion into poetry, there are probably better classes to take that go more in depth into one poet or movement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you have to be willing to write critically about poetry in addition to reading it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Even if youre not super familiar with poetry, you will get more comfortable as the semester progresses. There are no discussion posts or discussion leader assignments so, other than the four essays, the workload is light and allows you to focus on the readings generally. Also the class really put poetry into context for me and helped me understand why poetry is used and how it impacts society. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're a prospective english major, not if you're interested in poetry as a non-major. Important but traditional texts are discussed. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking it for the English major requirement, then yes. Otherwise, find a poetry class that really focuses on something you are particularly interested in, as this survey course is broad. It's a good class and the discussions are interesting, the professor is very thoughtful and kind, but the material is often stiff and young for what it is. "
