            "\u00a0He is a wonderful Reverend, instructor, and friend. ",
            "\u00a0Practical and caring. Knows her stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Willis was a great TF! He brought a wealth of knowledge and experience to the course. His comments on our \"scenarios\" were very helpful, and I saw in him a genuine pastoral heart. ",
            "\u00a0Great listener, great depth of experience. ",
            "\u00a0She helped to guide our group in the role plays very well. I also appreciated when she shared her own personal experiences providing pastoral care. ",
            "\u00a0Rev. Lewis-Theerman was a great resource, in and out of practicum. She encouraged group conversation, walked us through challenging moments, and offered insightful feedback about not only our role-plays but also how her own particularity of experience might inform a pastoral response. She was also available outside of class for check-ins and discussion about call and class requirements in a way that I found deeply and personally helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Brenda is clearly a talented pastor and has previous experience facilitating small group learning. She was an excellent listener and communicator, and was able to draw on her wealth of experience. ",
            "\u00a0Pastor Will is AMAZING. Truly, he was such a source of wisdom, calm confidence, and honest feedback during this semester. I could tell that he really cared about us as people, even as he made it clear what we could be doing better to care for people in the future. He was reassuring, affable, frank, and very kind. I learned mountains of knowledge from Pastor Will and feel that we had a great, productive mentor-mentee relationship by the end of class. He is wonderful! I think Pastor Will should be a full-time professor (if he weren't already doing important work in the prison system). Thank you, Pastor Will! ",
            "\u00a0Willis brought his extensive chaplaincy experience to our section meetings where we reviewed class subject matter together and conducted role-play scenarios. Willis offered valuable guidance and more learned insight into analysis of our student role-plays.   He also shared from his real-life experience in his chaplaincy work to which we would not otherwise have had access. ",
            "\u00a0Brenda was incredible and the saving grace of this class for me. Our small groups were wonderful. Brenda actually coached us in real pastoral care and led us in discussing the real theological issues surrounding each role play. I feel like I learned a lot from our small group time, and I always looked forward to it. Brenda was able to balance teaching, listening, guiding, and observing in the best way. I felt like she really cared about all of us and really cared about the work that we were doing. Even though the role plays could feel artificial at times, I found them to be very helpful and really valued the opportunity to do them. ",
            "\u00a0Rev. Joan had such an amazing heart and our group felt so at home with her. For me, she made this class worthwhile, fulfilling, and feel like a family. I learned so much from her skills, patience, and advice during our break-out sessions. "
