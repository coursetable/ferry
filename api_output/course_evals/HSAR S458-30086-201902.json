            "\u00a0Through the course I learned how to analyse an art work from different perspectives as well as how to appreciate paintings in the art gallery. I also have a deeper understanding of the progressive development of western art overtime. Writing an essay every week helps me to improve my writing ability in academic essay as well. ",

            "\u00a0How to write a paper, and how to analyze an artwork. ",
            "\u00a0It was really helpful and wonderful to learn how to deeply analyze art works, and I could grasp the flow of art history by learning about the works in the canon. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the history of art and I could develop my own way of evaluating an artwork. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's about how to talk about art and how broad art history could range. I did four papers in this course and I think they cover the basic points that I can pay attention to when coming to write about art. Also, the readings are fairly informative that I'm impressed by lot of philosophical ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an opportunity to have access to some of the world-famous artworks and learned some approaches to appreciate those works. I also read some art criticize articles and wrote four essays concerning some of my favorite artworks, which is a great enhancement to my art-appreciation capacity. "

            "\u00a0Using 10 works as the canon of western art's development, this course makes art history to be clear and easy to understand. Professor Armstrong always gives detailed feedback about each essay work helping students to learn their shortcomings in writing. This course also brings students to the art gallery so that students would have first-hand experiences with these art works. I think that the only weakness of this course is that it only have one breaking time; maybe it could be split into two. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very well-organized\r\nImprovement: less workload ",
            "\u00a0Being able to have an open discussion about an artwork and writings about the artwork and the frequent visit to art center are some of the many strengths. ",
            "\u00a0The strength may be the idea of canon. It helps us to establish a more well-rounded understanding of the field and the potential of discussing different themes. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!\r\nFirst, I think this course provides a good opportunity for students to want to know more about western art and its development overtime. It also helps people to learn how to appreciate the paintings or sculptures in the art gallery. In addition, as a writing-intense course, it improves one's writing ability as well. Professor Armstrong is very nice and always willing to answer all the questions. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe someone who really love art history, because there's a lot of reading and writing, but they can really learn a lot ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have learned a lot from it, including many artists, artworks, painting skills and so on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because they would be able to improve not only the insight of the art but also the way of writing and analysing an artwork. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's because this course is very helpful for people who likes to look at art but don't feel like fully understand it. It can help them to articulate the unspeakable feeling clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Surely I will. Everyone should learn the way to appreciate beauty, and we should have a basic idea about how western art developed over time. "
