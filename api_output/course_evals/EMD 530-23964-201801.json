I also enjoyed the case studies in class.  They helped me better understand the material and some real life situations where they may be useful. ",
            "\u00a0The different guest lecturers were great as well as the group class components. I wish we were given breaks more frequently (class was held at 8 am and was 2 hours long). In addition, sometimes it felt like slides were being just read off of, instead of having additional information included by the instructor. Overall however, this course gave me a great framework in hospital epidemiology and I enjoyed it very much! ",
            "\u00a0An excellent course for health professionals. Very detailed and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting course. I liked that every lecture was on a new topic within HC Epidemiology and that lectures were given by experts in the field. I would have appreciated more epidemiological methods incorporated into the class. At times, the class can be heavy on regulation or the strict memorization of facts. I would have liked to see more methods, real-world application, and microbiology incorporated into the course. I really enjoyed the group work and case studies performed in class. I would have appreciated more opportunities to do this. ",
            "\u00a0Homework assignments were poorly written, not well thought out, and not conducive to learning. Instructor needs to realize that most students are not clinicians. Lectures were incredibly boring and uninformative. ",

            "\u00a0Great course for delving more into HC epi topics.  Being unfamiliar with the large majority of hospital epi and health care systems in general, this class was a great introduction to the topics.  I'm glad we were able to visit YNHH and tour the hospital while applying what we were learning in class to a real-world setting. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it! The material, the instructors, and the structure of the assignments were great - no complaints there. Whenever we discussed issues in small groups, I know that my classmates and I enjoyed those a lot. I do wish we had more of those in class, particularly while discussing case studies. The biggest strength was bringing in different speakers for different perspectives on topics. Ex: someone for clinical microbiology, someone for antimicrobial stewardship, someone for environmental disinfection, etc. Every speaker was engaging, informative, and receptive to student comments and questions. Additionally, they were happy to speak to students outside the classroom for research opportunities, general conversation, or career advice. ",

She has accumulated so much experience over the years (not calling her old), and it is special to have someone like that spread her wisdom and insight from all the challenges she faced. I wish she would engage the class more in case study discussions, as those were always very entertaining. ",

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course, especially if you are interested in any area of infection control and prevention. There are quite a few professionals in the class such as physicians, nurses, and ID fellows. Being able to discuss cases with these professionals is a valuable experience. This course encourages you to think about the interactions between different departments in a hospital, such as in the case of an outbreak or proposed mandatory vaccination policy. The group projects encourage thinking out of the box, as you take fundamental principles learned from the course and apply them to situations we haven't exactly covered in depth. Overall, the course does a good job encompassing the inherent complexities of working in a hospital. If anyone plans on working in such an environment, taking this course is a must. I would say this has been my favorite class at Yale by far. ",
