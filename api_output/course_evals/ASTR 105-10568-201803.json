This class focuses closely on solving Fermi Questions (back of the envelope estimations) which is helpful for anyone who wants to consider a consulting job (exactly like market sizing questions). It also teaches some basic astronomy concepts (seasons, tides, lunar phases) which are just fun to know. ",

Other than that I can say that I learned more of the concepts associated with astronomy, like the phases of the moon and the formation of the sun. I couldn't tell you much about how these concepts are applied specifically but I think they were generally covered well. ",

I learned so much about our planet and the universe, from things related to astronomy to things completely unrelated (e.g. stocks?!). I learned to also go with my gut and intuition (something that so many of us are trained to not do), which sometimes does lead you to a close answer. This is a course that really forces to explain yourself (especially in estimation problems), which is always a good skill to work on. ",

As for knowledge, we touched on several topics, some only tangentially related to Astronomy, such as: energy and entropy, computation, the fundamental definition(s) of life, the Earth system and global warming, the potential for life on other planets and moons, interplanetary travel, the lifetime and interior processes of the Sun, the age and formation of the Earth, the seasons and phases of the Moon, circular acceleration and orbits, and gravity. Ultimately, the study of Astronomy, even on an introductory level, tends to be a humbling experience, reminding us of our cosmic smallness; throughout the course, Professor Laughlin posed some deep questions (in homeworks and in lecture) that certainly developed my perspective.

I particularly felt this after midterm. Everything was kind of just all over the place and I had trouble tying together what the big picture was. Also, there seems to be a disconnect between what we learn sometimes and what we are tested on the exam... for example, we spent 5 minutes on tides in class, yet on the practice exam a full question was dedicated to an extremely specific and applied an instance of the tides? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Laughlin is an engaging professor who has a good grasp on how much work students are willing to put into a class that they are taking only to fulfill a requirement. The class is relatively interesting for a science credit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The problem sets are ridiculous. Estimating what cousin the centipede is to me was a complete waste of time. I did not learn anything new from questions like these, and I could have spent the time actually learning something in the senior seminars I am taking. ",
            "\u00a0Greg has a tendency to ramble, but he's still super interesting. Slides are almost all pictures, which is fine, but if you miss class they won't help you--BUT Greg uploads notes which are amazingly helpful since it can be easy to lose track of where discussion went. ",
            "\u00a0It is an entertaining and relevant course. The workload is very manageable. The lectures can feel a little long at times. ",
            "\u00a0This course was honestly a bit all over the place. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I think it's something students should be aware of going in. We learned about what felt like a completely different set of topics every week, and even at the end it is hard to find a cohesive thread throughout it all (besides the ever-present order of magnitude estimations). The problem sets were often shockingly difficult and time-intensive, even though the lectures rarely explored topics that were hard to grasp. Sections were not mandatory, but I think they should be - it would have been impossible to complete the problem sets without them. I always went to section to get help with the problem sets, and even though I would do my best sometimes I could just not come up with exactly what the professor was looking for. This became increasingly frustrating throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were kind of all over the place, Prof. Laughlin would skip around a lot. The homework was manageable, but the TFs were not very helpful. The course could use a little bit more structure in terms of the material covered. ",

Professor Laughlin makes such effortless transitions between topics that sometimes you can't even tell you transitioned from one topic to another. This strength, however, is also a weakness: sometimes, I would sit in lecture not knowing what exactly I was supposed to learn at that moment. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You will 100% learn order of estimation skills, which is integral for consulting / general problem solving. You'll learn to be really comfortable with working out reasonable answers to ridiculous questions like how many air particles are there in a room.\r\nWeaknesses: Greg isn't a super engaging lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very insightful, very engaging, very relevant. Professor Laughlin is an excellent lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Laughlin is a really funny and likeable professor, and he makes certain topics interesting. I think he puts a lot of effort into making assignments fun, such as that time we watched a cliff-diving video to a dubstep remix. However, the class doesnt really focus on space, and you may learn a LOT about estimation and some non-space things like bitflipping (but Prof Laughlin relates it back to Earth in its Cosmic Context somehow) ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting but sometimes went off topic, which was fun and engaging. The psets were somewhat difficult unless I went to section or office hours, which as an athlete was very difficult because of my practice hours. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Laughlin is funny and engaging, but the course trajectory is not clear. There were a lot of scattered topics that never really came together, and the homework is significantly more difficult than what's covered in class. They also graded pretty harshly and didn't provide clear feedback on how to improve, since a lot of it is guess work and estimation that you have to somehow get a feel for. The homework definitely needs to be completely re-written for the next semester it's taught and the TAs should be more understanding about people's different levels of experience; there were several times where I went into section with prepared questions and left even more confused than I was before. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: It is not very intuitive to many and the lectures seem very disconnected. It is very hard to study for this course, and for some problem sets, the only way to get a good grade on them was to go to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely random. We learned everything from the interior structure of the sun to how DNA works, and it was very difficult to follow week to week. The course should focus more specifically on topics of astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely lecture itself. While you could probably miss and still do fine on PSETS/exams, Prof. Laughlin was hilarious and had very interesting things to say every single time.\r\n\r\nWeakness was probably the PSETS. They asked questions that were sort of related to the main content of lectures and exams but not really. They were sometimes needlessly tedious and grading across the board was very inconsistent. Despite this being an order of magnitude class, points would be docked for putting a number like 3 rather than a fraction. For a class that emphasizes strategic thinking over getting the right answer, this was incredibly frustrating. I greatly appreciate the practice exams because those felt like the questions that should have been on our homework. They involved rigorous thinking of concepts we learned in class rather than calculating human cousinship with centipedes. It was in doing these problems that actually helped me internalize the material. ",

            "\u00a0Gregory Laughlin is simply delightful. Its weakness is that it's extremely broad, but its strength is that Laughlin makes everything exciting and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes, class felt a little disjointed and random. It was kind of unclear exactly what we were supposed to take away from each class. I wish Prof. Laughlin started each class stating what he hoped for us to learn by the end of the class, or in some way gave us some thematic continuity. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was really great.  One thing I thought was really great was how much we learned about basic Earth processes like the phases of the moon, seasons, etc.  I did not think that there were many weaknesses in the course.  While it would have been nice if grades had been put in quicker and some course information had been communicated more clearly, but it did not take away from my enjoyment of the class. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: the professor is really patient and really cares about teaching\r\nWeakness: course moves slowly, not suitable for those who want to learn a lot of astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: some interesting material, very little memorization, good professor\r\nWeaknesses: pointless information, more math than what a non-QR credit should be, little direction ",
            "\u00a0This course's greatest strengths were the vast scope of content we covered and Professor Laughlin's enthusiasm for presenting those ideas. The course may be improved by streamlining the lectures from the first half of the semester, as I felt that we could have progressed through the basic concepts more quickly and without the cool but often confusing tangents.

            "\u00a0Although the class really trains you to think creatively and critically even when you're given very little information, the class could use a little more organization. It was often difficult to draw macroscopic connections between different sections of the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0I always enjoyed attending lectures and found them to be engaging and interesting. Sections were a bit less exciting, as they were mostly used as a way to help with homework. This help was definitely useful, but I would've liked to learn some of the material in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Professor Laughlin's lecturing and sense of humor. The topics covered in class (especially in second semester) were incredibly fascinating.\r\n\r\nSome problem sets felt a lil too challenging. I also felt that I received too little feedback. If I got something wrong on the problem set, the class wasn't really structured to help me ever understand what I did wrong. ",

It is an enjoyable class, and I have gained reasoning and scientific analysis skills that I don't think I could have picked up in any other Yale course.

The material is pretty interesting, Prof. Laughlin is hilarious and brilliant, and he is really, really doing his best to make students like me learn something that will be of some actual use. This made my total apathy all the more devastating.

I really enjoyed Professor Laughlin's teaching style, but this class, which was supposed to be an engaging science credit for non-STEM people, ended up causing me unnecessary stress and anxiety this semester, likely also due to the fact that in order to get science credit, I had to take it for a grade. We get assessed based primarily on some truly arbitrary homework questions, one midterm, and one final, and the harsh grading meant that a lot of people in the class are going to get bad grades not due to their inability to understand science, but rather because the course material wasn't organized to help us learn and improve. ",

We learned everything from the interior structure of the sun to how DNA works, and it was very hard to follow any trends week to week. That said, topics are generally interesting and the homework is very manageable (only five problem sets throughout the semester). ",

You might as well call this class \"Science Class.\" As an English major in need of my last science credit, it was the perfect thing to take to make sure I don't forget the basics before I go out into the world. You also get better at estimating and practical math. Laughlin is so nice, and you only really have to do the psets (you don't actually have to do the reading or go to section, don't worry). ",

He will remind you of Bill Nye the science guy. ",

            "\u00a0No. I found this course to be very boring and the material covered did not satiate my curiosity for the cosmos. ",
            "\u00a0Recommend to those who want a science credit with not that sciency class. Not recommend to those people who are good at STEM. ",
            "\u00a0Very slow on the grading which made it hard to know how you were doing in the class. And when we did receive feedback, the point system seemed arbitrary and not fair. My peers and I collaborated on our problem sets (as we were encouraged to do) and received vastly different scores. Otherwise, a good science credit. Our universe is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect for an SC requirement, requires limited math and is based on critical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Nope ",
            "\u00a0NO! \r\nI would hope that my fellow classmates were honest enough in their evaluations, but based on past evals, I see that I can only trust myself to do for YOU what students of previous semesters failed to do for ME. In the event that you have found this buried in a pool of yeses, I must convince you to take my word over those of my well-meaning yet naive peers. I can only imagine that this would be the case because the multitude of students that would have told you the same probably declined to answer every question on the course evaluation.\r\n\r\nSo, let me give you all a realistic take on this class. First, if you actually want to learn Astronomy, do not take this class. If you're comfortable with math and science or have a strong STEM background, do not take this class. If you're weak in STEM and are looking for an easy science class, DO NOT take this class. By now, I imagine you're picking up what I'm putting down. This class is about estimation, not astronomy. That much is made clear from the get-go, but it isn't until after the midterm that the gravity of your mistake in taking this course dons on you. The actual work is easy enough on paper, but there's an underlying vagueness to everything that never really disappears. While you will scratch the surface of some astronomical concepts, the ultimate end and gimmick is for you to be able to tackle questions like \"how much water is there on earth\" or \"for how long can Connecticut supply the United States' food needs\" without any given information. Instead, you must rely on \"outside-of-the-box\" thinking to get close enough approximations. All questions are worked out using units of grams, cm, and ergs, and all numbers and constants are rounded to 1, 3, or 10 of some order of magnitude thereof. If you're already scratching your head, I understand. Other evals will no doubt advise that this takes some getting used to and that while at times unfocused or too simplistic, there are some interesting insights to be gleaned from Professor Laughlin's lectures, but the sad truth of the matter is that this class is just annoying.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there will be those who read this evaluation and, for whatever reason, refuse to heed the warnings. Theirs is a callow idealism and, unfortunately, I cannot save them. But I may yet save you, well-meaning but savvy reader. You're likely combing through course evals in search of a low-stress, fairly easy course that may or may not also fulfill your SC requirement. Whether said course material is interesting is probably a secondary consideration (though the answer here is still \"no\"). So save yourself the headache and look elsewhere. Actually, I'll go ahead and save you the trouble of looking, free of charge. Take ASTR 160 in the Spring or whenever it's offered. Or take something else. Just don't take this class. You're smart enough to make smart course selections, and well...this ain't it, chief. ",
            "\u00a0You should definitely take this course, especially if you need a relatively chill SC credit. You'll learn a lot, you'll have fun and the problem sets are totally manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Good course if you want an easy-going but still fairly interesting science class. Don't recommend it if you actually want to be learn astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an interesting and challenging course that encouraged students to engage with familiar problems in a unique way. ",
            "\u00a0No, the class was not very clear about expectations, with work intensity changing weekly ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class because it is an incredibly fun way to learn really cool skills. Professor Laughlin and the TAs are invested in the class and the students. I found myself telling others about what I was learning in the class and the conversations I had with my professors because it impacted me that much. ",
            "\u00a0Greg is a nice guy and I like him, but do not take this course. You will not learn anything and then you will be tested on it. A lot of the course is estimation problems, which you can and might do on your own. The course is trying to be pop science for non-science majors, but it ends up being pop science for middle schoolers. There is no central focus, no coherent narrative; if someone asks you what the course is about, you will not know what to say. The homework always has questions with no relationship to what we learned in class. The homeworks consist largely of googling things and then applying those googled concepts, which is kind of absurd, like usually in a class you're applying what you learned in that class. Don't take this as a science gut, take something else like Plants and People, or Ornithology if you're willing to do work. There's no way to know how grading works, which is also stressful.\r\nJuan Guerra is a great TA and you should take his section if, despite my explicit warning not to, you take this class. If you take this class, by the time you get to week 4, you will say to yourself, Man, I wish I had listened to [Anonymous Course Reviewer], who absolutely warned me and who I rashly ignored. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it was a relatively easier science credit ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not a science major but still enjoy science, I would recommend this course. It does use some mathematical concepts, which was tricky for me, but the assignments are pretty straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if looking to get introduced to Astronomy at a basic level. ",
            "\u00a0Unless someone is extremely into physics and astronomy and science type stuff, then I would not. ",
            "\u00a0yes, it is a good science credit class for people not interested in science majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. Especially for non-science majors. The class tackles lots of interesting question pertaining to science, while not expecting much prior knowledge of science. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly manageable science credit, more math than expected for a non QR ",
            "\u00a0I would! The class is a good survey science course for non stem majors, being the perfect amount of challenging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a SC credit that's well-taught, interesting, and not super hard. Prof Laughlin is great - it's clear he's excited to teach the class and puts in work into preparing lectures. The TAs this term were also very friendly and helpful. Psets were manageable and midterm/finals are not that hard to study for with a little review. "
