            "\u00a0I do not like how this course is so focused on grammar in an artificial context. Filling in the blank on exams does not hone skills that will help me communicate effectively in Spanish. I wish they had a separate course that was geared towards practical applications of the language, focused on speaking fluidly, that someone like me, who is interested in learning Spanish solely to interact with patients when I am a doctor and be able to communicate in a Spanish-speaking country. ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the course is very clear in the syllabus, and the constant Spanish conversation in class helps grow language skill. The breadth of the grammar topics/vocab covered on exams, however, sometimes made it difficult to effectively study. ",
            "\u00a0All taught in Spanish which is great, but lessons weren't always fun/exciting. ",

            "\u00a0No. This course is not designed to facilitate the effective learning of a language and overloads students by bombarding them with grammatical requirements rather than focusing on increasing communication skills. Your time and efforts would be better spent elsewhere (especially if you're just looking to fill your Language requirement). ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. It gives you a lot of practice with high-level spanish speaking. ",
