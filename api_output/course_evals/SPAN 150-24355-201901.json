            "\u00a0I developed my writing, speaking, and listening skills immensely by taking this course. It was a perfect primer before my trip to Latin America and would recommend this course to anyone before his/her trip to a Spanish speaking area. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my reading, writing, and speaking abilities in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about oral and writing communication. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more experience in speaking conversationally, reading different styles of texts, and writing different styles and lengths of essays in Spanish. "

            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses of this course! It is already amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great about assigning regular writing assignments. Students received constant and prompt feedback that greatly improved writing abilities. Another great component of the course was the required cultural engagement activity. One thing I suggest would be making the presentations of final assignments a more formal, slideshow presentation so students better understand the fascinating research projects their classmates are doing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: So much of the course depended on daily work. Be prepared to spend one or two hours a day to do the work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not structured to facilitate student learning. The sheer workload makes it difficult for the student to properly focus on improvement as the quick pace of assignments emphasizes quantity over quality. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This is an amazing course and I would especially recommend Profesora Tortora. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great course to learn the Spanish language while studying the fascinating history, politics, and culture of Spain and Latin American countries. ",
            "\u00a0I would most enthusiastically recommend this course to a student who is coming from AP Spanish in high school but does not yet feel ready for higher-level culture seminars. I developed as a Spanish language reader, writer, listener, and speaker, and I now feel ready to take on more rigorous Spanish courses in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class unless the student wants a heavy, tedious workload and if they take it with another professor. I would never had taken this class had I known the style the professor and all the excessive work it requires. "
