Learned how to make sense of pixels in an image by applying different algorithms to the data to pick out features or classify them. "

            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting for the most part, but near the end of the semester they became very dense and hard to follow. TA hours were useful, but I was mostly unable to attend due to family concerns (daycare, etc.)\r\n\r\nLecture notes were very useful, but obviously in a draft stage, as there were many missing figures or typos or unclear text.\r\n\r\nHomeworks were great and very helpful at understanding some of the more complicated theories.\r\n\r\nIt was never totally clear what we were expected to know for exams. There were occasionally details that were briefly mentioned in class and easy to forget by the time exams rolled around. "
