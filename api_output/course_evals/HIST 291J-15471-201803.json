            "\u00a0The course introduced a broad range of thinkers in dialogue with Freud. It was an enjoyable and informative experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to engage with analytical and philosophical texts. It was incredibly challenging reading but intellectually rewarding in discussion. It really gives you a good oversight of different types of philosophy and challenges you intellectually. It deeply engaging with Freud and related ideas stemming from his. ",
            "\u00a0On an intellectual level, this course gave me insight into and appreciation for Freud's work and its impact on the broader academic community of his day and those who came after him. It taught me just how interconnected many different academic disciplines really are, which was rewarding as these connections helped me to understand the various disciplines in a new light. On practical level, the pacing and assignments in the course encouraged me to deepen my research skills and critical engagement with a large body of work. The skills I took away from this course will prove very useful when it comes to writing my thesis. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an excellent and wide-ranging study into the legacy of Freud across eight disciplines. Not only did we gain an in-depth understanding of Freud's key ideas, we also gained an understanding of how those ideas developed and were taken on by thinkers and leaders in diverse disciplines, from sociology and history to psychology and literature. As such, this class not only offered an opportunity to study Freud, but to touch on the methods and priorities of eight academic disciplines. This was the first time I had ever read anything architecture or psychology-related! The class also provided us with the chance to explore Freud's influence within one discipline through our research paper. There, I learned the methods of intellectual history research. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of Freud and how it influenced many fields. A great way to learn about the top thinkers in a wide array of fields. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are grounded in the rigor of intellectual engagement and the community formed in class. The class could be improved by pruning some of the later thinkers (too much Lacan) and having another week to focus on Freud and primary texts. ",
            "\u00a0The reading was not super manageable and really challenging but Noah is incredibly helpful and engaging in helping the class understand tough topics. Noah was a gem to have and even had a late night essay workshop with great food for us and really took time to help us improve. ",
            "\u00a0The course readings at times felt disconnected week to week. The course could be improved by trimming some of the more ancillary readings and rearranging the remaining ones. The course did a great job of giving me a clear picture of Freud's main academic contributions and what impact they had on academic institutions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The fascinating class format of learning Freud and then branching into eight disciplines. Noah mentioned that this format can be applied to other thinkers with lengthy legacies and I totally agree! Such an interesting way to learn intellectual history. The readings were also excellent, I enjoyed them all and learned so much about how Freud's ideas were taken on and altered by different thinkers, and how each alteration illuminated something about that particular discipline. Another strength was Noah's method of getting us to spend so many weeks building up our final paper. This allowed me to truly dwell on what I wanted to write on and gave me time to research and work on my writing. The critique session was also a wonderful addition to the class, as it allowed us to receive feedback on early drafts of our papers. Noah cultivated a positive learning environment among us, and I truly felt committed to helping my classmates write the best paper they can. To improve: We could have less readings per week I think, about 80% of the current amount assigned. Classes never felt long enough to go through all the readings, and I would have liked to focus on each of them more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings and materials discussed were interesting and engaging. Class size was perfect for everyone to engage actively.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (We already told Noah, and he said he'll improve this) On some weeks, the reading load was too heavy, and so we had to rush through them .

            "\u00a0Absolutely a genius idea for a class. The model of the class is so clever: you read the basics of Freud and then go on to read other thinkers (Lacan, Derrida, Foucault, De Bouvoir, Marcuse, Sartre, etc.) and see how they applied/critiqued Freud's thinking. It is such a great way to really delve into a thinker's work. After taking the class, I feel completely comfortable discussing Freud and his work, as well as common critiques of his work. Noah said he may use this model for other thinkers (De Bois or Rousseau). If he does, I'm sure it will be fascinating. Structure of the class is really nice. Only a 15 page paper at the end with weekly reading responses. The paper was hard, but manageable, and he walked you through the process pretty much from the midterm to the point that it is due (proposal, annotated bibliography, rough draft, etc.) , providing TONS of feedback. The only thing I would say is that it is a lot of readingparticularly dense reading. But, I think that's pretty common in history classes and he does a great job explaining it in office hours and in class. I know this phrase is so overused its become almost meaningless but I honestly think it applies: One of the best classes I've taken at Yale from one of the most engaged, smart, and nice professors I've had. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - Noah is an excellent teacher and the material is under-taught and incredibly rewarding to engage with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Challenging but totally worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in intellectual history and appreciate psychology. This course straddled the line between a history seminar and a psychology seminar. If you appreciate digging into the works of a single individual, you will enjoy this course. If you don't like psychology, French theory, or modern history, this course isn't for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in Freud and want to learn about the diversity of his influence. A great chance also to pick up intellectual history methods and techniques, and to dabble in diverse academic disciplines, while using intellectual history approaches. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in Freud and intellectual history. Discussions were really engaging and Noah makes sure that you understand the inaccessible concepts that piqued your interest. I looked forward to going to class every week.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you are the kind of person who wants to study concepts in great detail, this class might not be for you. Because we cover a new field each week, we did not get to dwell on each new concept for long. "
