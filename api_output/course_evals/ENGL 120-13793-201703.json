            "\u00a0I definitely became a better writer because of this course.  Whether it was from the multitude of great readings, the lessons that dissected each of the texts, or simply writing 5 full and revised essays over the course of one semester, or some combination of the three, I cannot say.  The course also taught me to write quickly, which will be helpful no matter where you go in life.  Lastly, it taught me to be a better reader by being able to recognize more literary elements and nuances in passages. ",
            "\u00a0At its most basic, this class taught me how to write six different types of essays, many of which I had never had experience writing before. More abstractly, English 120 taught me how to write consistently and purposefully, how to value meaning and context as much as eloquence in writing, and how to revise diligently. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of writing techniques and got exposed to a wide range of authors (whose writings served as inspiration for my own)! ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write much more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to write. I now know so much more about writing than I did. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me approach nonfiction creative writing in a fresh way. I learned rhetorical skills to incorporate into my own writing and developed the ability to read works through the lens of a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about crafting organized essays and about writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0This class was super different than any other writing class Ive taken, but I really loved it. Dr. Hopper picked awesome readings and class discussions were very engaging. Learning how to write a strong personal essay is very different from academic writing, but you receive a lot of feedback and guidance. I feel like I became a much better writer and learned how to express my ideas clearly. ",
            "\u00a0This class was truly incredible! Everyone told me that I should take English 120 as my intro writing credit, and I'm so glad I did. Some of the best moments in a class that I've had at Yale were in this class, including the first time workshopping, the \"academy awards\" we assigned to different articles we read throughout the semester, and the final humor day. This class sometimes beats you down because your writing can always be improved and there are an infinite amount of ways to take your essay, but that's just the writing process for you. I learned how difficult it is to truly write well, but how valuable of a skill it is for any discipline. I also learned to value the incredible range of style in nonfiction writing! ",
            "\u00a0I developed better writing skills and critical analysis skills. The various essays we read not only exposed me to many amazing essays, but they also inspired me to copy some of the techniques used by famous authors. The course was a great exercise in creative writing and gave me practice in rhetoric and concise writing. ",
            "\u00a0I really developed my writing style and learned how to write various types of creative nonfiction essays. I learned various writing techniques and literary devices and also really began to experiment with my work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lies in the amount of reading that is done to see examples of literary techniques and styles.  Also, you will get a lot of feedback on your writing from the instructor and your classmates through workshops.  The weaknesses are that with all of the readings and essays you have to write, the course will take a lot of time, but in order to convey that amount of information in one semester, it is unavoidable.  Also, the grading is difficult, especially if English is not your strength. ",
            "\u00a0I love the small, informal setting of this class. Most days we would come in with 2-4 essays read. and we would discuss each essay. Sometimes the discussions would be structured in a fun way (like making a jeopardy board for analyzing tone, public significance, etc of different pieces) so we would be more motivated to think critically, and about once every three weeks we would have a workshop where we discussed five of our classmate's current drafts. This format worked really well for the most part, but I do think that sometimes class was not as intellectually stimulating as I would like. We didn't do too much close-reading, which was good because homework didn't take too long, but was also bad because I feel like I learned how to write much more than I learned how to read. Overall, though, I thoroughly enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0I love the structure of the course (5 themed essays, with readings reflecting each of those themes) and the diversity of authors we read. I also loved the discussion forum where we posted our reading responses; it was a great way to hear what my peers had to say about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of interesting and varied readings, with fun essay assignments. Harsh grading though (I've heard that there are literally students who have written for the New Yorker that got Bs in this class--which doesn't make sense, considering the ideal essay in this course is based on the New Yorker's style). ",
            "\u00a0I think the homework is a major strength of the class - I really enjoyed just getting to read great essays as homework, and the reading was by no means overwhelming. Another strength of the class was the personalized feedback  I got specific comments on my writing that really helped me improve, and my teacher was available to discuss writing whenever. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hopper gives incredibly detailed and constructive feedback. The class discussions were always engaging and interesting, and I enjoyed almost all of the readings. I liked that Prof. Hopper included more contemporary readings and helped us utilize techniques from these works into our own essays.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was that we didn't receive feedback on later essays until the semester was over. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was definitely the professor, Dr. Hopper, who really cared about her students and the craft of writing. The essay topics were super interesting, although broad and up to personal interpretation. This was my chance to write about things that were deeply personal to me instead of random academic papers. The readings before every class never took more than 2 hours and they were actually interesting (great variety too). As annoying as the reading responses sometimes were, it was a great way to ensure that everyone did the reading before class. The workshopping was also the most amazing thing to ever have been proposed in the history of English 120, because it was fun, made me a better writer, AND a better reader when critiquing my peers. It was also fun to see my classmates writing. Everyone always seemed embarrassed of their writing while most of the time I thought the essays were really great.\r\nOne of the weaknesses is that it can be really demotivating to pour your heart into an essay and then receive a \"bad\" grade, but that's just the standard the English 120 professors hold each other to. I also noticed the place essay seemed hard for a lot of students because they got \"stuck in their place\" (no pun intended). It was also difficult to figure out how to avoid clichs. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job of introducing you to many examples of each essay assignment. You are never a at a loss for inspiration for each of the essays, and often will find yourself copying the techniques of accomplished writers. There were times, however, that the number of readings felt overwhelming. Perhaps assigning only two or three readings, and having everybody focus on analyzing them would work better. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredibly well taught. The readings were very engaging and useful and I felt prepared to execute the essays. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because of the amount of improvement in my writing ability, but the course does take a lot of time, especially in the first half of the semester.  Only take the course if the rest of your schedule is somewhat lighter. ",
            "\u00a0Loved it! I always walked out of class feeling refreshed and determined to write more. I would definitely recommend taking this class, regardless of teacher (though Briallen was very nice and fun, and gave great feedback on drafts). ",
            "\u00a0Take it! ENGL120 really lives up to its hype--the essays you write aren't just mere assignments; they really make you dig deep into your life and think hard about how you want to tell your stories. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I cannot recommend this course enough. It made writing so much more enjoyable for me, and now I want to write outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course if you really need a Writing Requirement. But if you enjoy writing outside an academic/research setting, this is the course for you. 6 essays in one semester is a pretty heavy workload to consider, so beware. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Even if you don't like writing, you will have a great time in this course, and it provides you with an invaluable set of skills that will benefit you in all future classes and life in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! There is a consistent pace of writing and editing essays for this class, which helps everyone gain confidence as writers.  I really enjoyed the readings for this class, as well as the opportunity to receive feedback from my peers during workshops. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this class, especially with Dr. Hopper because shes amazing! I recommend that everyone take it. Youll learn how to write and share your ideas. And its a nice creative break in your schedule. Also, Dr. Hoppers extension policy is a life saver and youll be glad you took it with her. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! They say it's impossible to get an A, but welcome to Yale, it's worth it x10000. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH DR. HOPPER!!!! The discussions in class were pretty good, and the intimacy of the class compared to other classes at Yale allows you to make friends in the class. Lots of freshmen take it, but it's just as great for upperclassmen because it's a class focused on personal growth. Super rewarding class -- take it!! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend anybody take this course, not just prospective English majors. Creative writing is perhaps less directly useful than scientific writing for STEM majors, but it is a good opportunity to work on communication skills that are essential to all majors. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course. It is not only about learning to write, it is an exercise in self discovery. You will learn how to talk about your life. This is one of the best courses I've ever taken at Yale and I recommend it to any student of any major. "
