            "\u00a0The major strength is the expertise of the lecturers, bringing their knowledge and perspective to the different fields. The weakness was in the administrative support, with little to no feedback on work, or way to judge the status of standing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Though the class is interesting and I like how experts come in to talk about their fields, we never receive any feedback. Even I asked for feedback, I wasn't given feedback because half of my grade was the final. Feedback beyond grades is necessary for learning and even if half of my grade is the final, giving students updates on their performance in the class through grades is important so students know what we are doing well and what we need to improve. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that the course is well structured and has many impressive and esteemed faculty lecturers. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were primarily that is was such a long course, and due to the last two lecturers being extremely dull, it was difficult to focus. To improve the course, remove Dr. Rizzolo and Dr. Fan as these lectures were not really focused on stem cell biology or application and were incredibly boring. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course revolves around the expertise of each of the instructors. Utilizing a different instructor teaching their own speciality makes this class unique and enjoyable. \r\n\r\nOne of the problems in the course was a lack of feedback through the course. We did not receive any graded assessments which makes it impossible to know how we are doing in the course and if we are doing the right work. ",
            "\u00a0It felt like just the right amount of everything for this type of course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent lecturers, class format (1/2 lecture, 1/2 journal club) allowed for solid introductions to the material and engagement with the literature\r\nWeaknesses: some lectures felt repetitive (e.g. hematopoietic system), little to no opportunities for feedback "
