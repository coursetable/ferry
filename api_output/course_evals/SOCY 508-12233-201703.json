            "\u00a0deep understanding of qualitative methods ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the various methods of qualitative research, how to take effective field notes, became versed in a variety of the ethical dilemmas that qualitative field researchers face. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about how to conduct field research, research ethics, and, more broadly, about the indispensable role of qualitative research in political science.\r\n\r\nI hadn't conducted any field research previously, and the practical skills I obtained will be absolutely vital for me in my dissertation research in the near-term, and my career as an academic in the long term. Such skills include conducting interviews and completing IRB forms.\r\n\r\nI also learned how to break out of my introverted shell to engage with research subjects and talk to them about their personal experiences in order to answer my research questions.\r\n\r\nI gained an immense amount of feedback on my fieldwork - e.g. feedback on semi-structured interviews - that sharpened my approach in subsequent field visits. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamental approaches in qualitative methods to conducting field research. ",
            "\u00a0I gained practical knowledge about the field research project by going out into the field, receiving feedback on my field notes,  and reviewing my progress with peers doing similar work.  I also became more attentive to the role of positionally and research design in both qualitative and quantitative research. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the challenges that field research can present and ways to overcome them. I learned how to conduct interviews and then practiced different techniques myself.The course itself and final project was a humbling experience and one rich in lessons learned. ",
            "\u00a0This class was invaluable in helping me understand how to ethically and thoroughly conduct qualitative research. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive training in the IRB process and qualitative fieldwork methods. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the ways to conduct qualitative field research such as interviews, participant observation, process tracing. I also gained insight into how established qualitative research scholars have handled challenges faced during their research. I developed skills to conduct semi-structured interviews and participant observation. "

            "\u00a0strengths: own research project, much attention to detail, interviewing styles ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more time allotted to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\n- terrific field research skill-building experience\r\n\r\n- great way to engage with the New Haven community \r\n\r\n- great balance between learning how to conduct field research, on the one hand, and the role of qualitative field research in political science, on the other.\r\n\r\n- deadlines were quite flexible and could be shifted depending upon developments in the field\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- it would have been nice to be encouraged to begin completing an IRB form prior to the beginning of the semester\r\n\r\n- the syllabus changed too frequently during the semester ",
            "\u00a0The strengths lie in the requirement of students having to conduct their own field projects and also in being able to speak with successful scholars who are well-experienced in doing field research. The only weakness would maybe be the amount of reading per week, which is entirely reasonable for a graduate level course. But the readings plus the field work was a lot some weeks. ",
            "\u00a0One of my favorite parts of this course was Libby's sharing of exemplarsboth of past student work and also of widely read publications.   She not only shared exemplars, she invited the researchers behind them to speak on their behalf either by Skype or in person.   Libby even walked us through her own research process, which I found to be very helpful.  Another strength was regularly receiving feedback.  One of the places where this felt most important at the onset was with our IRB application; the feedback I received helped me be much more thoughtful about the overall design of my research project for this class, as well as for concurrent projects outside of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the course project progressions where I was able to practice techniques that we had discussed in class as well as the engagements with different book authors. I enjoyed the classes where we were able to talk about ethnographic work with the different authors and hear their perspective on the challenges they had faced.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is not really a weakness, but instead the challenge of time constraints. The time constraint of the semester is often reduced when dealing with the IRB. I found it very difficult to complete the course project in the course of the semester and would have been unable to complete it if I continued trying to write the full article. ",
            "\u00a0I was unable to conduct the research I wanted to in the amount of time allotted for the class and would have appreciated either more restrictions on my freshman ambition or a clearer idea of what I was getting myself into. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the Course: Undoubtedly, the biggest strength of the course is the hands-on experience of conducting a qualitative research project in New Haven. This was the most enriching part of the course since it enabled me to build skills to conduct interviews and participant observation. Prof. Libby is an excellent instructor too - her detailed and regular feedback was extremely useful. Moreover, interactions with guest speakers during various sessions of the course were immensely helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the Course: During the second half of the course, perhaps the reading material for the class was a bit overwhelming. I particularly found it hard to balance between my field research commitments and the heavy reading. \r\n\r\nThree suggestions for improving the course: more regular discussions during class each week on the progress and challenges of on-going field research projects; possibly have two shorter sessions per week with one session more focused on the readings and another on the field projects; and more guidance and/ or readings on how to conduct an oral history interview would be great too.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you have any interest in doing qualitative field work, this course is a necessity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more in this course than most others at Yale and compared to those courses I've taken at other institutions. I'd recommend that all graduate students in political science take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I think every student in political science, regardless of subfield or preferred method, should take this course to complement the training in quantitative methods almost everyone also takes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any graduate student who is interested in doing any type of theory and/or empirical work.  This course helps you become a better observer, listener, and synthesizer.  It helps you uncover and address (where possible) your biases, and the biases inherent in a lot of theory and research.  Both of these skills are crucial for doing academic/intellectual work that sincerely engages with questions of power, morality, agency, or ideology. ",
            "\u00a0I would, and have already, recommend this course to other students. Prior to recommending it, I would make sure they knew the time commitments and potential difficulties of completing the course requirements within the course of the semester. I believe that first year students can be successful in this course, but it will be difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of the most important skills to have as a political scientist, and the course teaches one how to use qualitative techniques confidently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course has the capacity to alter your perspective on social science research and could prove immensely valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would most certainly recommend this course to other students. The learning from this course is absolutely invaluable for anyone planning to conduct field research during their PhD. "
