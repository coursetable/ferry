            "\u00a0Learned how to put into conversation different historical filmswhat works well and what doesnt. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate and identify different techniques of presenting history and portraying the past. I will now be able to critically analyze historical movies. "

            "\u00a0It's a seminar so entirely discussion based and the quality of the class depends entirely on who else is in your class. The classroom was too warm and made everyone sleepy, especially when the lights were turned off to watch a clip. \r\n\r\nThere were lots of movies that the majority of the class disliked.. sometimes that can't be helped. ",
            "\u00a0I think naturally not everyone is going to like all the movies. But I definitely would have enjoyed another film with a female led character. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the premise of this course, and the readings and the movies pair very well. The movies are occasionally unbearably uninteresting and impossibly long. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very interesting. Most of the movies were unique and prompted good questions. The papers allowed me to demonstrate my learning. The discussions, however, sometimes lulled. Also, the readings each week were not always integrated into the discussion. Perhaps there needs to be more discussion of the readings and their connections to the movies. "

            "\u00a0yessss ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend this course. The films you see are relatively unusual and Professor Semmel also adapts the syllabus depending on the class, for instance, we were allowed to offer input on the final film as well as if we thought the syllabus should remain the same in the future. The papers are a bit long for the subject matter but Professor Semmel is good about offering help. This makes for a good History department seminar if you want to look at various regions and time periods. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if you're looking for a kind of chill class. I liked watching the movies, even if I didn't love all of them. Discussions ranged but this was just kind of a fifth class sort of vibe. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are really interested in historical film or curious about them. ",
            "\u00a0It's apparent that Professor Semmel is very smart and interesting, but I think it's difficult to be in a seminar setting with him. I'm not sure if he's mastered the subtleties of asking questions that students want to answer or if it was this particular group of students. In the beginning of most classes, he'll ask if we enjoyed the film. Ten, twenty, sometimes forty seconds of silence. This could be because of the movie, but I think it's because Professor Semmel himself doesn't have strong feelings/thoughts about each movie. He comes across as ambivalent about the syllabus and the class. I don't know if I would take it again, but I'm kind of glad I did. Not the best, not the worst class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a unique course that was a welcome change of pace to my other work. Its approach to history is unlike other history courses I've taken. "
