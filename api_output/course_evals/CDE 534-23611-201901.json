            "\u00a0Very great course that teaches students how to apply their skills to assess a dataset. This was probably the first useful course I took at YSPH. I am much more confident about working with SAS and knowing what to do when given a dataset. My only complaint is that the lecture notes aren't reader-friendly. Most of the notes are code so if you wanted to revisit the lecture, it's hard to follow what is going on. Lecture notes should be organized better. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome.  But if not programming and stats comfortable, budget adequate time to spend a little extra time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Highly organized \r\n- Labs encouraged critical thinking \r\n- Midterm was reflective of labs and what was learned in class\r\n- Allowed students to develop a strong and tangible skillset by the end of the semester \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Grading: 3 point grading scale left little room for learning.. only complete mastery was rewarded  (2/3 seemed harsh for minor rounding errors) ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of the data tables and correlating them to real world data bases was exciting and learning strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Lack of clarity on grading between the professor and TFs was problematic. The ambiguity of \"showing improvement\" over the course of the semester was anxiety-inducing given the fact that labs were graded on a 3-point system, with points taken off in equal measure for serious and minor mistakes. More opportunities to show improvement or restructuring this grading system might ameliorate students' stress levels. The majority of my colleagues in this class that I have spoken with share this sentiment. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated a section of the course dedicated to writing summaries. Literally a \"how to write a summary\" segment that includes references to examples the professor or TFs find appropriate or useful. With little background in scientific writing and quantitative coursework, this sort of \"101\" material would have been useful for me to learn. It's the end of the semester at this point and I still don't feel confident in my ability to write a summary. As far as I know, understanding how to do this was not a pre-req of this course.\r\n\r\nInconsistencies with TFs were also problematic. I found the TF for my lab section to be impatient with my lack of understanding of the course material and unhelpful in answering questions about course material, but another TF to be completely sympathetic and helpful in explaining concepts from scratch during her office hours.\r\n\r\nOffice hours with the professor were extremely helpful. ",

At the end of the semester, I felt confident to be able to do my own analyses of data using SAS, which is way more that I felt I could do after one semester of R work. I think the labs were well designed and reflected what we learned and built on each other. ",

            "\u00a0I appreciated this course, although I am not a \"quant.\" This provided a good introduction to using SAS and the instructor was expert/professional in his discussion of this material. However, I felt that this course could have provided more time in lab (2 hours instead of 1) and could have been more guided. I felt like I was having to learn a lot of the material myself/looking at online resources. Also, the fact that this class only met once per week was a turn off. I would have preferred that this class was at least a 2-times-per-week class so that there were more opportunities to practice this complex material. I felt the the instructor was somewhat abrasive, but fair. As a non-quant guy, he was a little scary *but justified* about being accurate in your data analysis. I really respect him. And I really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was an extremely hands-on, practical, skills-based course. You learn how to conduct analyses in SAS and have weekly labs where you go through the coding assignment with your teaching fellow. I learned a lot from this course and think it lays an excellent foundation for data analyses in SAS. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course. However, I do not think that taking off one whole point out of only three for minor mistakes on the labs is conducive to learning. I know that there is an emphasis on perfection, but this type of grading only leads to stress and does not create a positive learning environment. ",

            "\u00a0I really loved SAS and felt that the way it was presented was extremely practical and easy to understand. The focus on application of coding was appropriate in that I didn't feel too bogged down in conceptual content. I'm leaving the class feeling confidence enough in SAS to advertise the skill for jobs.

I would highly recommend it for anyone regardless of their level of statistical understanding. I began knowing I would have to work harder to understand the underlying statistical theories some weeks but it was made very easy to understand and help was always available if needed. ",

The course is structured very methodically and you learn to run a wide range of analyses. That being said, I think the lectures were too long and the labs were too short. Most students learnt the most by actually doing anyway. The lectures could have been condensed. ",

It's very practical, as most internships/jobs ask for experiences in SAS and likely will have you do the analysis we did for the labs\r\n\r\nthe grading is confusing as grades aren't necessarily assigned. this is meant to encourage actual learning the material as opposed to preoccupation with grades, but it's stressful not knowing where I stood in the class ",
            "\u00a0Scores between 2 and 3 for lab, since they translate badly into the grade even for small mistakes. More introduction to other ways to code things and why you might choose one way over another. ",

This class also helped me understand some statistical concepts better than the classes dedicated to teaching said concepts. ",
            "\u00a0It is a strong course. The grading for the labs is frustrating. anything less than a perfect score earns you a 2/3 which can really have a bad impact on your grade.\r\nI also wish that the lab sessions would be structured to solve problem sets independently  because often times I felt like I gained little out of them since the Gas would just type code and the students would blindly follow ",

I feel myself very confident about knowing and handling the data at the end of this semester. I wish it was a fall course instead of spring. I know that some people were complaining about grading system but I can totally understand the rationale behind it; you need to be careful when working and reporting data. I feel that this meticulousness prepared me to look more carefully to the papers that I am going to read and my future publication submissions. I also improved my summary writing skills for the data outcomes. My only problem was the class size; it was so crowded. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most well-taught, organized, and useful courses at YSPH! I was able to use a lot of the skills I have learned in AAMIE in another class, and it was nice to see how applicable these skills are in action. The course is well paced and the material is incredibly useful and important if one wants to work in epidemiology. I wouldn't feel confident about my foundational knowledge and skills in using analytic methods coming into my internship or writing my thesis without having taken this course! While the course was a bit stressful sometimes, especially with the expectation on attention to details, I came to appreciate it because in a research setting, one cannot afford to make mistakes that jeopardize findings. The course was well paced and exams were fair game. The TFs were also very helpful in office hours and seem to care about the students' performance. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very organized, clear expectations, clear lines of communication with TFs and instructor. Learn how to effectively use SAS. \r\nWeaknesses - I guess you could say large class size? But I think large lecture style for learning a statistical program is fine. ",
            "\u00a0There are a number of strengths of this course, including the pacing of content throughout the course, feedback provided on lab assignments each week, and the self-paced nature of exams. The pacing of the course was effective, as students are presented with easily decipherable material early on, and the difficulty of the course progresses as additional material is presented. The feedback provided on each lab assignment was helpful for understanding where errors were made, and what improvements could be made in coding. I enjoyed the self-paced, take home exams for the midterm and the final exam. This presents a real-world opportunity to understand and apply coding knowledge and statistical analysis on larger projects. On the other hand, I believe students should be provided with three take home exams, as opposed to two. Doing so would provide students with additional feedback to gauge their performance, and the exams are reflective of small projects that students would actually be working on for an employer. The application of knowledge in this setting is fundamental to mastery of the content. Further, this would split 80% of the course grade among three exams (e.g. 15%, 25%, 40%), as opposed to 30% and 50% currently. \r\n\r\nThe convoluted structure of grading for the course was a weakness. Students were provided with \"ballpark\" estimates of their midterm grades, and official grades for the midterm were never posted on Canvas. Additionally, lab assignments are graded out of a total of 3 points. A very minor error (including 1 typo in a multi-page document), or a number of errors, resulted in 1 point being taken off. 2 points were taken off for a number of extensive errors. I believe students should be graded on 0.5 point increments, as there is a not a proportional decrease in quality between 1 point and 2 points off an assignment. Additionally, taking 1 point off of an assignment for a student that made a small error, vs. 1 point off for a student who made multiple errors does not add up. ",

Applying what I learned in class was a great way to flex muscles. A weakness of the course was sometimes the lectures were monotonous. It would be cool if Mayur did some in-class examples on SAS to showcase what he is talking about in real time.

While I agree 100% that cheating is inexcusable in all circumstances, I don't agree with the method of reiterating the message and going over a list of specific coding errors students will be penalized for as opposed to giving more positive words of encouragement before an exam. This method created a certain level of fear and anxiety among students, which I find not very productive during exams. I understand that people have cheated and made a lot of coding errors in the past and that there should be repercussions for every category of action. I also understand that the teaching team does not want anyone to cheat, but I also think that the instructor is not testing students' knowledge and skills in good faith if they are giving students an impression that they expect some of them will do something wrong, be it cheating or making mistakes. A written grading rubric would clear things up and make the situation less stressful for both the teaching team and the students!
