            "\u00a0excellent narrative of how colonial America formed and dialogue between England, spain  and colonies ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about Colonial History that you never though to look at. This class talks about the history before the Revolution, which not many people focus on. I loved it! I loved the material and learned a lot for sure. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about a period of history that I knew relatively little about and in such a different light than it's usually taught in. The research paper is also a great opportunity, and I felt I really developed in my history writing because of this course. ",
            "\u00a0In-depth understanding of American colonial history ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing historical pieces and creating arguments based on historical pieces ",
            "\u00a0The course focuses on the colonial history of North America, from 1491 up to 1763. As a student, you will learn about the social, political, legal, and economic development of the American continent under various iterations of European rule. You are a witness to the dramatic changes on the continent that such colonization efforts brought about. The course describes the rise of indentured servitude and then the institution of slavery from the 16th to 18th centuries. The course is taught without any essential reference to the American revolution of 1776; this is a course about the empires and states that preceded the American experiment, which only comes in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. You'll get a great feel for colonial life as it affected the everyman, and explore the intricacies of colonial conflict and development, including religious life, ethnic diversity, and commerce within and without the British empire.

            "\u00a0strength: Peterson knows his stuff and loves it\r\n\r\nweakness: class was too good to only have 9 people ",
            "\u00a0This course is taught so perfectly. Each lecture flows together like one big story. This was by far my favorite history class I have taken at Yale. Professor Peterson is amazing! Highly recommend taking one of his courses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Peterson, the material, lectures, section. Pretty much everything this is an amazing course. We also had the unique advantage of the course being very small, which I think had to do with the fact that Professor Peterson was new and didn't have any course evals (Yalies are super risk averse when it comes to course selection). This meant that Professor Peterson ended up needing to lead our section, since another course with higher enrollment poached his TF. He was super available when it came to our papers, in a way that would've been impossible with a larger class. I hope more people take this class in the future it's amazing  but the small enrollment was a great surprise bonus.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much. The reading that was assigned was A LOT, and it would've been pretty impossible to read all of it for the detail required for section Towards the middle of the course, Professor Peterson started sending emails letting us know what to focus on for that week, which was really helpful. We were also assigned a few books that we didn't end up using  understandable, as the class had never been taught before and I'd imagine Professor Peterson was changing some things along the way, but I'd hope this will be cleared up in the future. Section was sometimes more of a second lecture than a discussion, which was okay  Peterson is so engaging  but perhaps something to know going in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- entertaining and engaging instructor \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- reading heavy ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength is its focus: you will get a thorough and detailed understanding of colonial life, culture, and society from the 16th to the 18th centuries. This is also an indubitably important part of global history: we see the rise of the first true empires, and the formation of European-dominated societies in the New World. The subject is well explored in the scholarship, and it is an important one to explore, as a student. The course is excellent as is; the primary source materials are engaging, and lectures supplement them quite well. Discussion sections could benefit from a greater degree of multilateralism. The way to elicit reluctant students' input is an understandable challenge, however, and is certainly not unique to this course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Peterson made a subject that could have been extremely dry and bland seem exciting and fun ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I loved this course. Super wonderful professor and super wonderful material. Everything was great. No complaints ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The readings are fascinating, the lectures are riveting. Professor Peterson is incredible. The final research paper allows you to dig into essentially any topic related to the colonial period that you want to and it's 10-15 pages, which is meaty but super manageable. Run, do not walk. Take this class!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Peterson is great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the professor was very engaging and interesting and clearly passionate about the topics ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in premodern American history. It provides a well crafted and engaging story of how empires and states operated on the American continent prior to the age of revolutions. If you enjoy American history before the United States, or are interested in studying it, this course gives a great opportunity to do so. Don't take this course if you are interested in learning much about the United States itself. If you're interested in the British Empire, slavery, or Native American studies, this is a great course. People interested in religious and commercial history from the 15th to the 18th centuries will also find much to enjoy in the course. "
