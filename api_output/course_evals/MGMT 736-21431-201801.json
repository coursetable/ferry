            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is Michael and Amy, who are amazing instructors and fostered a super open, thoughtful space of discussion. The format is exactly right, and the readings are almost all interesting. The one thing that could help students is looking a little more carefully at the amount of reading week to week, and maybe trying to reduce the page count a little bit the last couple weeks of the semester, when people are pretty swamped in other assignments.

            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend! I loved this course so much. It's helped expand my knowledge and interest in different areas of social psych/OB, and improved my confidence and ability in group discussion. It also created a great student community around the material. "
