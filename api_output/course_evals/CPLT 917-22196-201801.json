            "\u00a0Where to begin? We read so many texts, all with an aura of importance around them that caused me to pay even closer attention than usual. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a broad range of historically significant texts and films establishing the foundations of the discipline of film and media studies. I was able to sharpen my skills as a critical reader of academic essays, learning to question arguments and understand links between different authors' approaches to similar topics. I also gained a broader appreciation for the medium of film and the myriad ways in which it has developed toward disparate artistic, technological, social, and cultural developments. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered an interesting insight into the different theories that have contributed an essential part to Film and Media Studies. Based on the readings and discussions in class I now feel more confident in talking about films in an academic context and in bringing films in connection with academic theories in general. Furthermore, the film introduced me to a variety of readings that I was not aware of and some might even be useful for research projects I am working on. ",

            "\u00a0Too many written assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I really appreciated having a different professor come to class each week to discuss one of our readings. We got to see a variety of approaches and witness faculty members in action. Although it highlighted the diversity of the program, it also made the program seem more coherent--I got the sense that there was a commitment on the part of the faculty to the foundations component of the program. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: For every perceived weakness of the course, there is an upside. For instance, the course required way too much work--too much reading (including secondary readings for our three annotated bibliographies, and our two film responses), too many presentations, long conversations after our screenings--but looking back, it all seems worth it. I'm glad that I read all of that work, wrote all of those posts (and, frankly, none of us wrote more than Ido!), and talked about all of those movies after screening them. I would insist on cutting down two things. First, minimize the presentations. Each student should give two or three *brief* presentations, not four. We always ran out of time, so there would have been plenty to discuss without the presentations prompting questions (which seemed to disappear once the conversation got going, anyway). Second, eliminate the paper on which film we would add to the foundations list. We already had the chance to write about two other films during the semester, and that time would have been better spent on our final 10-page review paper. \r\n\r\nAlso, I think the readings should have been arranged chronologically rather than thematically so we could have gotten a better idea of how the field developed. ",
            "\u00a0The format for the class meetings were highly engaging, balancing time between invited scholars to speak about particular readings while always allowing for students to thoughtfully engage the conversation for the majority of the class. At times the amount of work required made it challenging to be equally engaged with all the material and discussions, but delegating different readings to different students to lead discussion helped split up the work to a degree. ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the course was on the highest level. It was great having a guest instructor at almost every session: I can't imagine a better way to step onto the path to being a well-rounded scholar in the field than meeting the faculty who work on film and media, learning about their approaches, and being able to engage in conversation with them. The screenings were happening at a convenient time and the selection of films was helpful for the understanding of the texts we discussed in class. I think the course in its present shape fully answers its mission as a proseminar in film and media. \r\n\r\nThe only drawback for me personally was the number of written assignments: some of them seemed redundant and therefore counterproductive. Presenting orally five times during the semester is rather a heavy workload already, and it would have seemed sufficient without the need to post a written response as well after each of these presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I generally enjoyed that there was a broad variety of theoretical texts provided and discussed within the class. In addition, the different professors that came into class and presented one of the readings were a great addition to the overall class discussions and it was really interesting to listen to their thoughts on the texts. The screenings were great too, especially since they forced me to watch some films that I probably wouldn't have watched myself and therefore enhanced my overall film knowledge and pointed me towards interesting films I was not aware of. \r\nHowever, there is a certain ambivalence to the material that is tackled within the course. While the class is called 'Foundations of Film and Media' and therefore it seems necessary to include a broad variety of academic sources that defined the field it might be useful to reduce the amount of 'mandatory' readings each week to what seems essential for the course instructor. Instead of 5-6 readings each week, it might be better to discuss two or three in detail. The remaining readings could be assigned to individual student who then provide a brief (online?) summary, so the rest of the class gets an idea what the text is about and if someone finds it interesting has a starting point for his or her individual reading of it. Furthermore, there is only one class session more closely focusing on 'Media' despite the fact that there are a lot of texts that might be discussed as foundational for the field (besides McLuhan, Williams, etc.). To just name a few: Gregory Bateson 'Form, Substance and Difference'; Marcel Mauss 'Techniques of the Body'; the chapter 'The Culture Industry' in Adorno's 'Dialectic of Enlightenment'; the subchapter 'Medium/Form' in Niklas Luhmann's 'The Society of Society'; Bruno Latour 'Pandora's Hope: Essays on the Reality of Science Studies'; Axel Bruns 'Blogs, Wikipedia, Second Life, and Beyond: From Production to Produsage', etc.). While this is of course also to a certain degree a subjective selection based on personal experiences, the urgency to extend the current list is there. ",
            "\u00a0The course was comprehensive and multi-faceted, involving numerous texts and films. One comes away with a general familiarity with the major figures and movements of Western film theory and history. The heavy reading load however made in-depth discussion very difficult, as each session covered around 4 very dense texts. As a result, nuances and complexities tended to get lost, and some sessions lacked focus. The course also unfortunately did not venture much outside of Europe and America. Thirdly, there could have been more coordination and integration of films and texts. One outstanding feature of the course was that Pr Andrew gave very extensive, careful and helpful feedback on assignments, and clearly cares deeply about the material and about pedagogy. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great course for anyone interested in film studies. It would be ideal to take the course during a slow semester, since it is a very involved, time-consuming course (just like the historical methods pro-seminar). \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how useful the course is for students specializing in media studies. Shouldn't they have their own proseminar in the history of the media/communications field? ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, provided the student is aware of the work required, both in quantity and quality. For students coming from other disciplines it is likely more challenging than it is for students within the Film and Media Studies Department. Either way, Professor Andrew is an outstanding instructor who I would recommend studying with to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0As a student not enrolled in the film and media program, I have taken this course not out of the need to fulfill any requirement - it was my free choice. I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who, like myself, has a burgeoning interest in film and is willing to develop this interest into one of their subfields of expertise. Of necessity, it is quite a lot of hard work within a brief period of time, but it does what it is meant to do - it professionalizes you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students if they want to get an introduction into the field of Film & Media Studies. While the workload of the class definitely is higher than for most other classes, the engagement with the readings and the class discussions are enriching and eventually you get a feeling for the theoretical notions that defined the field the past decades. The films watched during the screenings covered a great variety of genres, decades and regions and added to my overall knowledge of film history. "
