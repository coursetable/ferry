            "\u00a0I learned the development of portraiture throughout the renaissance. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a wide range of thematic elements about portraiture in the Renaissance period. We examined what portraiture really means and how notions of selfhood and identity emerge from this thinking. As a student in any seminar with Prof. Bass you'll learn how to analyze any piece of art and articulate these observations orally and in writing. ",
            "\u00a0Being an economics major, I came into this course with no knowledge whatsoever about the discipline of art history. I lacked both the knowledge base and the analytical tools that many of the other students in the class (almost all art history majors) had. This was NOT a problem at all for me in this class. Professor Bass worked tirelessly to ensure that the intense survey of Renaissance portraiture was not lost on an audience without prior background or training. In taking this class, you'll learn a world of information about all types of Renaissance portraiture from the subject's foremost expert. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar gave me a wonderful insight into Renaissance portraiture in a variety of mediums. I learned how to look at art in new ways with a critical eye, write analytically about it and develop creative ideas about the object of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a large knowledge base about the various types of Renaissance portraiture, how portraiture evolved overtime, and about the important role portraits had in identity construction.  I was also able to enhance my art-historical skills and learned how to critically evaluate art pieces. And finally, I gained insight into the large amount of work involved in creating an art exhibition and in studying a single art piece. "

            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses with this course. It has been my favorite at Yale thus far, and I truly thought it was amazing. The way that Professor Bass organized the class was unlike any other and I found it so cool to focus on a single portrait for my entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0This class is great. The first half of the semester was all about going to the art galleries on campus and visually seeing and analyzing the portraiture which we would be learning about in class. Then, the second half of the semester was in a classroom where we would discuss and see the progressions within portraiture as time progressed in the renaissance. It was very interesting and well organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in its organization and structure. The first part of the course we had the opportunity to use the YUAG, YCBA, and the Beinecke which was a thrill. The course could be improved by including some more written / reflective work on a weekly basis. This could allow some more continuous feedback on the material as the semester progresses. ",
            "\u00a0This course comes close to having no weaknesses. Perhaps something that could be improved is more class time to fully discussing the reading material. It could also be improved with a visit to the Met to see some of the more famous works we study that aren't owned by the YUAG. ",
            "\u00a0This course was AMAZING. Loved every class. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this course was being able to view and interact with Renaissance portraits in person.  More specifically, having seminars within the YUAG, YCBA, and Beinecke was a unique opportunity and Professor Bass made sure to take full advantage of it.  The readings were also conducive supplements to the portraits we viewed and helped to further enhance seminar discussions.  I was also amazed to find out about the variety of portraiture, both in styles and what seems like countless of mediums.  And finally, Professor Bass was fantastic in constructing a comprehensive course syllabus and in facilitating seminar discussions.  I would say that this courses only weakness was its high workload, but in light of how much I learned about this niche subject, I would say it is well worth it. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Bass is a legend and amazing. The course is one of the most engaging and amazing art history classes that I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a very engaging seminar and allows the students to closely analyze works of art here on Yales campus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--Professor Bass is brilliant, friendly, and clear in her expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want a class that looks a particular genre and period then take this class. I would recommend that you look at the syllabus beforehand to assess your interest in the types of readings. As one might expect, there's a strong bent towards European art, though there are several points in the course where we look at pieces from other geographies. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I've taken at Yale and is making me strongly reconsider my major choice. Please take the opportunity to learn about this fantastic subject with the most knowledgeable professor you will EVER have. Trust me on this, you will regret not taking this class if you get in. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! We get the amazing opportunity to look at collections in the Yale art galleries and Beinecke, as well as objects that are currently not on display. Professor Bass is a great teacher and full of interesting facts about Renaissance art. In this class, you really learn how to analyse portraiture analytically and engage with the pieces we study on a much deeper level. Each student chooses one painting to analyse and write about throughout the semester - this is a great chance to get to know one portrait on a really deep level and do your own research. I highly recommend this class (for both HoA majors and non-art history majors)! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student in a heartbeat. For the majority of classes, Professor Bass took us BEHIND THE SCENES at the YUAG and YCBA, which was so beyond amazing, and meant we spent very little time in the classroom. Absolutely fascinating subject, incredibly engaging class discussions, and really fun assignments (all of which were organized around the idea of developing our own exhibit and researching one specific object). Professor Bass is beyond incredible -- I am so happy she is at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, but only if they are genuinely interested in Renaissance portraiture and are willing to dedicate themselves to this class. Students had two sets of responsibilities for this course.  These consisted of completing class readings for seminar discussions in addition to studying, researching, and writing about our own individual portraits. By the end of this course, each student had become both well-versed in Renaissance portraiture as well as an expert in their individual portrait.  All in all, Professor Bass will comprehensively teach you about Renaissance portraiture and will push you as a writer.  This will in turn will result in lots of work, but, you will learn a lot about this niche and interesting subject, and, you will be a better student for taking this course. "
