            "\u00a0Knowledge: I learned a lot about the Middle Ages--particularly Gothic art and architecture--as well as the field of medieval studies, and its history. \r\nSkills: Close looking; vivid description; creating class presentations that balance comprehensiveness and concision; how to articulate a project to non-specialists in a compelling manner. \r\nInsights: I gained many insights about the Middle Ages, Gothic art, and scholarly methods, but perhaps the most salient insight I gained is that the historical Gothic has an affinity with the Baroque and the postmodern in their shared propensity for what Robert Venturi labeled \"complexity and contradiction.\" Although Gothic art and architecture seems utterly complex, it is not necessarily chaotic--it is often undergirded by a rigorous sense of order.

            "\u00a0Strengths: This was the best seminar I took in my two years of coursework at Yale. The readings were excellent, and class sessions were extremely engaging and dynamic. We spent most of our time looking closely at art, and during each session a balance was struck between lecture and discussion, empirical evidence and theoretical speculation, the concepts introduced by the readings and the insights yielded through our own observations. \r\nWeaknesses: At the beginning of the term, the number of presentations felt overwhelming. But, I am glad that I did them because I feel like I am much more prepared for my final paper. This class was a lot of work, and it would have been ideal if I had taken it during a less busy semester. Perhaps in the future, Jackie could make a few presentations (2 or 3) mandatory, and all presentations beyond that optional, that way students with extra time or interest can give extra presentations, while students who are inundated with other work can keep up. Though I think the presentations are helpful invariably strong, we never run out of things to talk about during class even when there are no presentations scheduled. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend this course to any student in the History of Art department, regardless of which period or region they work on. This was the platonic ideal of an art history seminar. It seemed to incorporate all art historical practices and methods, and to integrate them in an engaging and entertaining manner. I think all students in the department should have the Jackie experience. She should teach methods! \r\n\r\nI also really appreciated when she walked us through the development of her first book project--from seminar paper to Art Bulletin article to dissertation to published book. Every student in the department should have been present. "
