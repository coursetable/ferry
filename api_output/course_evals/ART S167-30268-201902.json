            "\u00a0By taking this course, I did not gain only the artistic skills but also how to utilize coding in a variety of ways--especially in the art field. Before taking this course, I was familiar with using code in the bioinformatics field, but this course opened a new gateway for me to discover the usage of coding in a non-STEM field. I think I will further enhance my knowledge in interactive designing skill by using HTML, CSS, JS, etc. for my future. Also, I learned how to express my idea to my peers around me because I often had a hard time telling people of my idea because my ideas are usually clear in my head, but very abstract in real life. However, people in the class and the professor helped me to be able to be confident in showing my ideas to the public. ",
            "\u00a0I came into class with very basic knowledge of coding and I was taught an extremely large amount of code in a short amount of time. I was able to become proficient in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and also apply it to create creative works in the class. ",
            "\u00a0how to use html, css and javascript\r\nI learned to step out of my comfort zone ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build websites, as well as how to use GitHub to host both code and websites online with careful version control. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of designing the webpage, javascript, css and html "

        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that the number of people in the course was very small in comparison to other courses, which enabled us to closely communicate with each other and give feedback of each other's idea/work. In addition, the diversity of students in the class--from a physics major student to a high school student--allowed us to have a variety of project results that helped me to gain lots of perspectives. However, the weakness of the course was the time. Since it was a summer course, I felt like we did not have enough time to learn all the materials that we should be mastered in. I think it could simply be improved if we had more time--more than a month. ",
            "\u00a0The Dropbox paper resource was extremely helpful since all of our lesson plans were written on there so it was easy to refer to when working on projects. There were also many opportunities to be creative in this more technical field which I enjoyed a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the class is too fast for beginners\r\nBut Matt is always available outside the class for help ",
            "\u00a0The introduction to web design that this course gives makes up for in breadth what it lacks in depth. Coming out of this course, I not only feel as though I've gained a valuable technical skill, but also that I've gained a newfound appreciation for websites as a medium for creativity. I can't think of any way in which it could be improved! ",
            "\u00a0strength, the professor is nice, willing to answer questions "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because even though this is an Art course, this would also help those who are interested in learning how to code because we learned so many techniques on how to make a website to how to interactively use different coding languages in designing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a great introduction to code if they dont know much and want to learn. It was also a fun and collaborative environment which is great for new coders. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in web design without hesitation. ",
            "\u00a0yes, you can learn many practical skills in this course "
