I now feel more capable of understanding complex situations involving people and their values. I think the policy science approach has provided me with language (symbols) and skills to understand peoples actions and describe them clearly. I feel more knowledgeable regarding my ability to develop projects and implement activities in the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a concrete framework by which to analyze and understand natural resource challenges. It focuses on the \"how\" side of solving natural resource problems and provides an important perspective for a world of growing complexity and increasing stakeholders. ",
            "\u00a0We discussed the skills, knowledge, and perspective that are required to go forth and have effective careers as environmental professionals. I think I made great progress on clarifying what I need to learn to deal with the problems I will face in my career, and I also gained a lot of this progress (a shockingly large amount) in this course alone.

This course teaches you about people and society as they relate to natural resources, and it pushes you to think about what is nature, who are people, and what should their relationship be.  This course is very unique and essential for future problem-oriented leaders in the environmental field. ",

            "\u00a0Extremely provocative and engaging material. I found the class lectures unhelpful and very hard to follow. It seemed challenging to me to understand what and why it was always being taught. More in class exercises would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Being exposed to the \"policy sciences\" is a strength of this course. The interdisciplinary approach to problem solving outlined through this framework is really a powerful and useful tool for guiding activities. The approach taken in this class is different than most of the approaches to problem solving at FES, which are primarily based on technical solutions and positivistic science. Exposing students to alternative solutions, and getting people outside their boxes of conventional thinking, is very important.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't particularly feel that the content was taught very well or that class time was used effectively. Most classes consisted of a broad overview of the policy sciences and how useful this framework is, but we never actually dove into the application of the framework in a meaningful way that allowed students to work through different parts of it. Honestly, most classes were a repeat of the broad overview we learned the first day. I was excited to dive deeper into how to apply the various parts, but we never really did.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in-class discussions were too disorganized and unfocused. Is is important for there to be a purpose to an in-class discussion and set the expectation that everyone sticks to the topic, this way students can stay focused and actually learn. Instead, most in-class discussions were open forum conversations that often didn't even focus on what we were learning through the class. \r\n\r\nI think the class would be substantially improved if the application of policy sciences was better incorporated into in-class exercises and homework assignments. This could be something like giving students prompts and problem sets where they take pieces of the policy sciences (e.g. decision function- intelligence gathering, social process- myth assessment)and apply they to real-world scenarios.\r\n\r\nI also think in-class discussions could have been better guided and kept on topic. There should be themes or topics for the conversations and students should be expected to stick to the theme rather than digressing into broader unrelated topics. This would result in us actually talking about and learning the policy sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Additional application and repetition of the policy sciences in a case study structure would provide a concrete foundation on which to consider some of the field's more abstract ideas. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths - Dr. Clark is an incredible wealth of knowledge, and offers students incredibly important tools for any career that we are pursuing. This was absolutely the most important class that I have taken at F&ES.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Dr. Clark's teaching style can be difficult to follow; she has read, written, and experienced far more than is possible for any student, and she regularly references materials that cannot possibly have been understood by everybody in the class. It is helpful to have a high quality TF in the room, like Greg Haber or somebody at or above his level of understanding with this material. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class is the unstructured class discussions that encourage students to ask questions and really dig into a topic. A weakness is that there are a lot of readings and it was sometimes difficult to see the purpose behind a certain reading. Less readings could be assigned. ",
            "\u00a0It is difficult at time to understand the concepts being taught in the course, largely because the language and terminology being used is very specific and requires an adjustment period. However, reflecting and reading deeper into the material is well worth the struggle. I also would have appreciated more feedback on our progress throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Subjectivity is am important tenet of this course. However, there is a chance this results in excessive abstraction. The frameworks thoroughly help us with that. But can there be more things we consider? ",
            "\u00a0I really can't think of anything. Maybe plan for sitce visit to Yellowstone? ",
            "\u00a0The course makes many promises. It may be difficult for the course, TF and Prof. to deliver on the intellectual rigor promised, but I think a greater effort should be made to \"mine\" issues at greater depth as promised. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions were great, even if a bit wandering and random at times. ",
            "\u00a0Susan Clark is experienced and brilliant. I think she really wants to encourage students to pursue their own directions and creates an environment where self examination and reflection is possible.  This is important.\r\n\r\nProf Clark and the TA could do more to lead more productive discussions.   Often her lectures are thick, dense and hard to follow.  Sometimes the lectures and discussions seem more like a list of things she has done, or people she has talked to, rather than new content that may be helpful.  After a while, it seemed like it was getting repetitive.\r\n\r\nSusan is disciplined thinker,and a warm person.  I think the class was excellent in providing me a useful framework.  At times, i wish the course was less meandering. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1) Having groups for weekly meetings/discussions\r\n2) The general feeling in the classroom - very comfortable setting to participate, lots of discussion\r\n3) The journals - reflection is important and not something I think most people do enough.  I found these weekly journals to be a really good tool for self reflection and evaluation and forced me put into words my ideas/thoughts/perspective.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like a lot of class time was lost because group presentations took up so much of the latter half of the semester.  While hearing everyones presentations was incredibly interesting and informative, maybe consider having shorter presentations/combining groups for 1 day so that we get to take advantage of a few more class periods? ",

            "\u00a0I would tell a student that lectures seem fairly disorganized but the content of the course is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The course material and understanding the policy sciences is great, and I think it's important for students to be exposed to. Susan is brilliant and she is a great teacher and mentor to get to now. However, the course content is not taught particularly well and class time is often used poorly. I would recommend taking the class to everyone, but do feel the delivery of content could be improved substantially. ",
            "\u00a0Expect to spend more time thinking in this class than performing assignments. Do your very best to remain focused for every minute of the three hour class; Dr. Clark regularly covers important material for the entire duration of the course, and the discussions will be more helpful if you are engaged. Do all the readings ahead of time, especially the readings from the handbook and the course book; you will benefit greatly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an unconventional class at Yale. If you want an opportunity to think more broadly, then take this class. You probably won't use what you learn in this class until you are several years into your career, but it is a class worth taking, It challenges you to think outside conventional thought using the policy sciences framework. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to benefit from this course, you need to be open to new perspectives and ways of problem-solving. Also, participating in course discussions and doing the readings regularly will be key in understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Oh definitely take it. You'll love it ",
            "\u00a0Engage with the material consistently. Take part in class discussions. The policy process is valuable, and it is worth taking a course to engage with it. The policy process explains why science in and of itself is simply not enough to address the world's concerns. ",
            "\u00a0This class is essential to understand the larger picture at FES and the world. ",
            "\u00a0take the class if you are inspired to use a set framework to dive into a particular topic.  You will be more rewarded this way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course strongly to those that have a background as scientists/researchers and have not had many policy or social science oriented environmental courses. ",
            "\u00a0There are many readings. Take the course if you like to read and devote enough time. "
