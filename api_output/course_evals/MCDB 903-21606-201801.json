I really hope this course can be more like RIP talks in other department, to get more postdocs and PIs involved.\r\nSome other departments choose the hour before the happy hour every week, and not make it mandatory to graduate students, but still the room is always full of people.\r\n(I know it's hard to coordinate as several labs are on west campus, but Friday morning is only good for a class time but not for a RIP talk)\r\n\r\n2. This course is well-organized, and the feedback form is helpful for evaluation.\r\nJosien and David invest a lot in this course and they always pay attention to your talk and take notes, this is really sweet.
