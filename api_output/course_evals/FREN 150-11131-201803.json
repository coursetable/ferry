            "\u00a0I learned essentially every key grammatical concept in French (all verb tenses, negation, adjectives, adverbs, etc), as well as a large amount of useful and rich vocabulary. I also learned how to write more elegant and fluid essays in French that avoid \"anglicismes\" -- sounding too \"english-y.\" We also read French plays and short stories, and watched a couple of movies in French. I also improved my oral abilities by being encouraged to participate a lot in class and taking oral exams. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read French literature and a lot more specific grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my spoken and written french, mainly through enriching vocabulary and learning the technicalities of past grammar subjects. Also, the works we read/movies we watched helped improve french comprehension and knowledge of francophone culture. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to practice my old french speaking, writing, and reading skills as well as learn a great deal of new grammar and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much greater working knowledge of the French language, particularly French grammar. My writing skills also improved significantly, thanks to writing multiple essays. There was also some vocabulary improvement, but the main benefits were from greater ease of speaking and much improved grammar. ",
            "\u00a0How to write and speak more effectively in French, enriching vocabulary, grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Willingness to participate, becoming close with a faculty member ",
            "\u00a0My French improved so much while taking this course. I learned a lot about French idioms and because of this class my French sounds much more \"French\" rather than a native english speaker speaking French. ",
            "\u00a0I solidified my french grammar, practiced speaking and developed fluency, and improved my analytical abilities in french. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are definitely many. We learn and retain a large amount of vocabulary simply by being asked to use it in class and on essays and tests. It is a survey of all the grammar concepts that you have probably learned before, but in greater detail and paying more attention to exceptions and more difficult constructions. The weakness of this course is perhaps the incredibly taxing work load, which I suppose is unavoidable in a high level language class. But on some days, it was simply too much work to be reasonably expected to do in 2 nights. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a wonderful course for learning French! The readings are definitely a strength. I think more feedback on oral performance would have made it better. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on a lot of technical grammar. We had learned the grammatical concepts already in previous classes as prerequisites, so it could be helpful to cover the grammar niches in our limited class time instead of reviewing the grammatical concept from the start. \r\n\r\nThe discussion and vocabulary immersion parts of class were very well done though, and the literature we read was intentional and useful. ",
            "\u00a0It is nice that it meets three times a week, but the workload for each session can be a bit overwhelming. Also really enjoyed that there was only 3 tests and we were able to dive deeper into the texts that we read. ",
            "\u00a0Our class discussions were very engaging. At times there's too much busy work with vocab and grammar, but I found that the lecture material on readings/films is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Pace was extremely fast, we didn't have enough time to go over grammar concepts. However, Madame Sherak did alter the program slightly so allow us more time. ",
            "\u00a0I think the workload of the course was reasonable but was pretty askew. Some days it would be an extremely manageable amount and other days a monstrous amount. I think on the days that we have a lot of work it should be talked about more in class. Frequently, we would have a lot of exercises and talk about them the class after the next class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very demanding but equally rewarding. It was the class that I most looked forward to attending because the size was so small, I felt comfortable with everyone, and asking/having questions answered was so incredibly easy to do because it felt like a safe and non-judgmental environment. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class, but only to people who are serious about pursuing more L5 classes in the future or studying abroad. It takes a serious amount of work and effort to do well in this class, and if you are not passionate about actually learning and becoming fluent in French, it is going to be a painful experience. The good thing is that if you do put in the time, you will do well in the class. The tests are very fair, and the professor cares about improvement over time, especially on the essays. It is a great springboard to higher level French classes because you will learn (or relearn) pretty much all of French grammar, and by the end of it, you feel very confident with grammar and ready for more conversation or literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you are interested in reaching a very high level of French. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to do future study in french. Your speaking, written, and grammatical skills will improve as natural in another semester of french, and the class is necessary to take higher levels. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class! It is a great way to keep improving your french skills and the readings are fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students. For those looking to improve their French skills, this is an excellent course. I absolutely learned more French, which was the explicit goal of the course and so it was a success. The workload and difficulty are both manageable. As long as one speaks French at a high level going in, the course should be very useful and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was great seeing my French gradually improve over the course of the semester. Madame Sherak is also such a kind and helpful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would likely recommend higher level French courses for those who are able to take them. This course was too grammar-oriented for me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. If you want to improve your french (grammar). Madame Sherak is an AMAZING teacher, very approachable and understanding! "
