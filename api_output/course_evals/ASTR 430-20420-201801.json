Taking this class actually made me feel like an astronomer for the first time in my life. "

            "\u00a0I thought that the lectures were very well put together, and the problem sets were reflections of what we were learning and made it easier to understand the material. Also, Professor Kenney posts the slides from lectures online, so they make for good study tools. One weakness is that the exams (especially the midterm) are fairly long. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any astronomy student that has a strong background in physics and astronomy. Don't jump into this class thinking that ASTR 210 and an introductory physics sequence is enough. It's a graduate-level class and it acts like it. I wouldn't take this class unless you are a junior or senior in physics or astrophysics. "
