            "\u00a0I advanced much farther in this class than I expected; meeting every day was strange as in undergrad language classes were only 3 meetings. I learned enough to get by in a Swahili-speaking area and make polite conversation. Swahili is much easier than French, but also less intuitive, especially for an English speaker. I look forward to using Swahili in other research; I realized this semester that my study of the legal semi-autonomy of Zanzibar in service of my thesis will be much broader once I have the ability to translate Tanzanian governmental documents.

            "\u00a0Excellent introduction to Kiswahili. Curriculum was well-done, assignments were more frequent than I'm used to but hardly egregious. If I did poorly on a given assignment, it was almost always because I didn't work hard enough, not because of arbitrary grading standards.\r\n\r\nProf. Wa'Njogu's tests often answer themselves; I don't know if this is intentional but it does slightly reduce the amount of memorizing work necessary. He also has an odd fondness for the third person plural, which everyone in the class knew from its constant usage - so conjugation exercises could be a little more varied in the tenses and articulation thereof. Sometimes the notice given before an assignment was rather tight, but again, never egregious. "
