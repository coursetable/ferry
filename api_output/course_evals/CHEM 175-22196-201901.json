Sections were also helpful because the TFs would go over topics from lectures and also provide challenging problems for us to solve. Problem sets were manageable and they helped me learn the topics for each week.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be better if the lectures covered material relevant to the problem set due that week, instead of covering material from the following chapter. I tend to learn better from a lecture if I read the material in the textbook beforehand, but because I am completing the problem set for the previous chapter I find it hard to also read the following chapter in preparation for lectures. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the enthusiasm of the professors. The class covers a lot of material and is definitely challenging, but the professors, TAs, and peer tutors are all very helpful and supportive. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved very quickly hard to keep up ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Instructors care genuinely about the subject matter and students\r\n-Practice exams before midterms were very similar to the real exams, good preparation\r\n-Easy to see real-life significance of subject matter\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-A generally difficult subject\r\n-Would have been better taught as a seminar\r\n-Alternatively, this course would have been perfect as an advanced organic chemistry course, but it was a bit too much for both an introduction and for all the advanced material we covered ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredibly interesting in terms of subject matter and the professors were absolutely delightful. The TAs were also very friendly and helpful and made a subject that is supposed to be terrible and hard actually pretty fun. Lectures always consisted of theory and then the practice applications of those concepts (like the development of historically relevant drugs) which made everything we learned feel very meaningful. I will miss this class dearly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--Professors Ellman and Scott, DIONDRA (best TF I've ever had; so amazing), the psets are really helpful to stay on track, lecture is incredibly helpful and I could never imagine missing\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--it is a LOT of work, and I definitely spent by far the most time on this class as compared to others. The exams are very difficult ",
            "\u00a0I think that overall, this is a very good course. I like that the problem sets are graded for completion, and the midterms and final really challenge you and make you think beyond what was covered in class. I felt as if some topics were covered more slowly, and others were rushed through, so I wish that we spent more time on difficult chapters (such as the carboxylic acid derivative chapter), and less time on alkynes and other topics at the beginning of the semester. The third midterm covered way more material than the first two combined, so I think that it should be more even. ",
            "\u00a0The way first-year orgo is taught is incredible. Unlike traditional organic chemistry classes that focus on nomenclature and memorization, this class is entirely conceptual; the focus is on mechanisms and why things happen. The tests are difficult but interesting, much like the class itself  its worth it, especially to be taught by such inspiring professors. ",

            "\u00a0The first four weeks of the course were very slow-paced, and the last four weeks incredibly rushed. There should jot be a large focus on NMR theory and other spectroscopic theory, as it is covered un the lab section.  The course was very good at preparing me to think about mechanisms for various systems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is an important course that everyone should take.\r\nWeaknesses include highly varied difficulty of tests between instructors. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong in its ability to connect abstract concepts from one chapter through the next, creating a continuous story of Chemistry. As opposed to separate sections, this made the course feel like an experience. ",
            "\u00a0It's easy to get lost and stay lost in this class and the exams are significantly harder than PSET qs. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are very good at teaching.\r\n\r\nHaving two professors is confusing since the two professors have different teaching and lecturing styles. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Umm\r\nWeaknesses: 2 professors makes it harder to maintain a consistent learning/teaching style, very few online/review resources ",
            "\u00a0Strength: professor is very knowledgable and engaging, class is well-run\r\nWeakness: more review before midterms would be nice, although it is quite satisfactory currently ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed to be very intensive and conducive to exploration. Both professors and TAs have unparalleled commitment to studying and teaching chemistry. The gap between what is taught and what is tested is unpredictable, which is probably one of the only yet prime concerns of all students in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the professors Ability to give us students the curiosity they have. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel like the problem sets were very helpful. The first few questions were relevant, but the rest usually involved an unmanageable level of difficulty that was not relevant to the material covered in class. The TF's and peer tutors were a big strength. ",

            "\u00a0There were a lot of resources to learn the material. Some of the lectures could have been clearer. ",
            "\u00a0I felt as though the lectures could have been more organized. Professor Ellman did a great job of putting titles on the chalkboard and doing a short review at the beginning of the class, and I wish that style was carried throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The only improvement I would make is make homeworks have problems more like on the tests if possible. ",

            "\u00a0All the TAs and Professors want you to learn and succeed in this class. I felt very supported in Chem 175, and I felt that I had all the resources available for me to succeed. TA sessions were especially helpful, as they were organized and correlated closely with the lectures from that week. Lectures were a little difficult to keep up with, as they were fast-paced and surveyed a lot of information from the textbook. I feel the lectures could be a little bit more organized. ",
            "\u00a0It covers a lot in a short amount of times but I feel the class sometimes goes too in depth on less important topics which arent tested and glosses over more core topics which are tested over. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class gives more to chew on than the first semester so it doesn't feel so tedious. Also, now that you know all the basics, it feels more practical. the HUGE negative of this class was the pacing. Going up to the middle of the term, the first two exams were pretty easily and only had a few chapters worth of material, which was in line with past exams in orgo I. However, because the second semester is pretty packed, this meant that the thirs and final midterm exam covered about 5 chapters worth of material--about 400 pages of the textbook. Everything from phenols to transition metal catalysts to EVERYTHING about carbonyl chemistry (it's a LOT). I feel like some of that stuff at the end could have been distributed better to make the third midterm a little less daunting ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: subject was very interesting and highly applicable, enjoyed Prof Miller's applications of organic chemistry to drug development and medicine (penicillin, AIDS crisis), and loved that class was challenging and required students to build an intuition based on a growing library of reactions and mechanisms; Weaknesses: going through practice problems in class would have been helpful especially regarding synthesis style questions or NMR/IR interpretation, mechanisms were often drawn very quickly so that if you did not keep up in class you would have to copy the board without thinking through what was going on ",
            "\u00a0The homework was nice and sweet (most times), but I think I would have benefited more from something like the worksheets the TAs gave out in section. I had to mostly relearn everything at TA sections, learn everything else outside of class using Khan Academy, and I didn't feel like I understood the material completely until after classes were over when I was studying for the final. Also, I know the curriculum stuck with the textbook, but the textbook itself doesn't teach the content in a way that was logical, so I would recommend using another organic chemistry textbook. The lab and class content did not line up at all, which made learning difficult. Finally, there was too much material on the last midterm and not enough on the first two, so I think spreading it out would be helpful for students. ",

This class is taught differently by inspiring professors who want you to succeed. Even if youre somewhat shaky on your gen chem, almost all of the concepts are new with everybody learning them for the first time. The bonds you learn about are just as important as the bonds you make with your classmates in such a small lecture course. Second semester builds on the concepts of first semester in an interesting way (more complicated, more biochem, transition metals too) that feels natural. Second semester is also easier than first semester, whether thats because you get used to the course structure or your orgo intuition is growing. ",

Prof. Ellman and Miller teach very well and TAs were very helpful to go to for additional assistance. people will warn you about how terrible orgo is or how it's the class that fails all premeds but don't fear - it isn't actually bad if you put effort in to understand the \"whys\" and not just the \"whats\" ",

This class literally made me cry because I felt like I wasn't understanding the material. I know at other universities they actually cover important fundamental material and students learn well, but I don't think this is what students here get, and I feel like it would be more worth taking this course elsewhere.
