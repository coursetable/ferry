            "\u00a0Alan is great at referring to the book or the handouts, and by presenting clear lessons in the class, the students are able to keep track of where they are headed in the lesson. ",
            "\u00a0While I do not fault the instructor for this there were issues with the projector in the classroom for the majority of the semester, usually it would work after a fashion but time was wasted and for a class that was largely reliant on projected presentations it was a necessity that it be working.

            "\u00a0Good balance to reinforce understanding of subject matter without the overburdening of an already too heavy schedule. Better balance than most YSD courses. ",
            "\u00a0The workload was great, the lessons gave us basic knowledge up front, then would level up as we got more and more sophisticated in the knowledge.  Alan wisely teaches this way, as I feel it gives us the chance to understand where we are headed while understanding how we got there. ",
            "\u00a0There was just the right amount of work added to help reinforce the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This class probably could have more assignments outside of class time. As it is grades are based primarily on the three exams given through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I hate to admit it, but there could have been more homework. However, having an assignment every two weeks was an excellent pace. "

        [
            "\u00a0More available than my schedule was to utilize the resource. The production assignment load alone would be too much, adding work study to that time means minimal to no time to capitalize on the depth I'd like to for this course. ",

            "\u00a0The examples done in class were directly helpful to the homework and understanding of the topic. It would be more helpful to write the units for numbers in an equation at the beginning of a problem and all the way through. When referring back to my notes, it was difficult to identify where some numbers came from. "

            "\u00a0I feel that the linear and circular motion sections were really clear, but the motor and gear selection were less so. \r\nI feel that there were a lot of assumptions about knowledge built into the class that should be addressed for someone who has never built or installed a machine before. \r\nWe never did an example of the selecting a motor in class and I wish we had. ",
            "\u00a0given how confusing the subject matter could be, it was great to have sample homework and test questions that provided examples that could be followed to help with the understanding. ",
            "\u00a0When transitioning from the \"theory/fundamentals\" units to the tangible unit on power transmission and motor selection/winch design, we started right away with types of gears. A day where we see a working deck winch (as an example) and go over all of the components and how they interact would have been very helpful. I have little hands on experience with stage machinery or motors in general, so in effect I was learning pieces and \"assembling\" them in my mind at the very end of the course. Personally, I find it easier to learn these types of things when presented with a fully sketched out ending of what we're looking for, and then deconstructing/examining the pieces/components. I am easily confused and lost without a strong sense of context. ",
            "\u00a0After the class I feel automation has been somewhat demystified, which is great. I still think I will have a lot of work to become adequate at it, but I feel like that is more achievable. Learning about what forces are looked at with different effects really helps to focus conversations around automation in the future. "
