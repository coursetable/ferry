            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course. On the practical side, I learned how to format a screenplay and what makes a good or bad screenplay, how to write coverage, and how to develop and write a full story. I also got to have a workshop experience which I found infinitely rewarding. I really enjoyed also talking about films we watched early in the semester for homework and being able to take in-depth looks at them as well to see how much could be embedded within a film. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to write a short screenplay (8 to 12 pages), and all of the mechanics that go along with that form of writing. Toward the end of the class, the focus shifts more to overall narrative effectiveness in workshops. This second part is where the class gets really great! ",
            "\u00a0I deepened by understanding of story structure and the proper composition of screenwriting both through the class discussions and through reading and providing coverage for several screenplays. I learned how to write a short (8-12) page script that contained a complete story arc. ",
            "\u00a0Learn the structure, format, and conventions of screenwriting; how to write concise, effective stage directions and believable, compelling dialogue; how to establish stakes, twists, and satisfying conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, we studied the screenwriting form itself, which has also surprisingly malleable over the decades. Prof. Lapadula knows this area very well and grills us on it.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we spent a lot more time discussing the mechanics of story and character, which was super helpful and honestly more pressing in the screenwriting form. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a strong understanding of narrative and storytelling, and developed a comfort with how to write, format, and structure a screenplay. I gained a tremendous amount of insight about the value of personal experience, identity, and stories  Professor Lapadula made this a class about learning to appreciate life as much as it was a class about learning to appreciate films. "

            "\u00a0I think the course is really well formatted. It gave a mix of creative assignments and practical and analytical assignments which really allowed us to learn through doing and through observing. The only thing that could maybe be improved is more of a concrete guideline or suggested timeline of how many scripts to read a week early on. I think the midterm folder deadline snuck up on a lot of us just cause we didn't realize we should have been reading scripts all the first half of the semester (maybe more of an us problem than anything else). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lapadula's feedback on your screenplay, meeting other people who care about cinematic storytelling, coverage and the other midterm folder exercises, screenwriting workshops\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lapadula is a bombastic seminar leader and he will go on lengthy tangents that may or may not relate directly to screenwriting. The second half of the course is much more structured, so this issue does not negatively impact that portion of the course to the same extent. I think that if we had been asked to write an even shorter screenplay in the first half of the course, that the benefit of some of his lectures would have been more immediately apparent. ",
            "\u00a0I really, really enjoyed this course and believe that Professor Lapadula has provided me with excellent insight and instruction. Perhaps my only wish is that there was more time available to work with him outside the classroom on story development, however it may have been my personal lack of outreach and not inaccessibility that rendered me unable to meet with him. ",
            "\u00a0Really aren't any weaknesses. Having a great class definitely helped - if everyone participates, it makes everything so much better. ",
            "\u00a0Developing and working on a single idea is very helpful. I really enjoyed refining and improving one thing over the course of the semester. Reading lots of scripts is really helpful for knowing how writers have decided to tackle problems that you're trying to work through. Activities like the dialogue passing game and what comes next were helpful in being natural and surprising in scenes. I wish we had time to do more activities like those. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this class lies in its student composition; Professor Lapadula has a strong personality of his own, and actively responds to what kind of dynamic any particular class has. That being said, the course isnt particularly organized in any set way; we were treated to many a 2 (often 3) hour lecture from Prof. Lapadula on the general subjects of character, story, and film, but nothing systematic or organized. There were two or three classes where we actually knuckled down and did writing exercises, or talked about the scriptwriting form, but the lions share of the work lies in doing your midterm portfolio well.\r\n\r\nThe first half of the semester is where most of the work is: the midterm folder is a lot of work that isnt necessarily difficult, but just takes time to finish. The second half of the semester is much more relaxed, consisting mostly of workshopping each others drafts of an 8-12 page script.\r\n\r\nFair warning: I will say that this course is hard to get into, since theres no application process. If you havent taken FILM 150, youre definitely not getting in; if youre not a senior or a film major, your chances are much, much lower. I was unceremoniously kicked out of the class last semester just by virtue of standing in the wrong place in line. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm folder is a somewhat overwhelming endeavor, but I found I was able to break it into manageable pieces. I like that Professor Lapadula trusts us to get the work done in a timely manner, on our own schedule. Workshopping was a fantastic way to engage with other students, and I really liked the small breakout groups. Honestly, there is little room for improvement  this is a great class. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is a great way to learn more about film and screenwriting and see if it is something you might be good at! ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you want to do some screenwriting and are a fan of Lapadula's style! Even better if you take it with a friend or make some friends in the class! ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in screenwriting, or in stories in general, I would definitely take this class! Professor Lapadula's engagement with the material and great insight has taught me how to watch movies from an analytic perspective and has greatly deepened my understanding of screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely yes. Highly recommend if you plan on doing Film Studies. Even if you dont want to do the screenwriting path, it's an awesome way to create a story that otherwise might not come to fruition. ",
            "\u00a0If you've ever even considered writing for TV or movies, I'd recommend this class. It's a reasonable amount of work for the first half of the semester as you refine your idea for a script, learn how to write correctly, and immerse yourself in professional scripts. As long as you work on the midterm course packet each work, it's a reasonable amount of work. After the midterm, you just get to focus on your screenplay and get it as good as you possibly can. At the end of the semester, you've got a finished script, which is incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who 1) is interested in the subject, 2) not too thin-skinned, and 3) can get into the course. Its fun, its pretty chill, often a riot, and a great fifth credit to take. Its also one of the more accessible forms of creative writing, I feel. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Any student with an interest in writing or film. I would preface it by saying it will be a lot of work early on, but that work pays off later, and Professor Lapadula makes it inspiring and worthwhile to fully engage. "
