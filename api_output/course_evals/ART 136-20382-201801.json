            "\u00a0I developed the ability to look critically at photography and understand the techniques required to produce the image during the actual capturing of the photo as well as during the intensive darkroom printing process. ",
            "\u00a0Intro Black & White Photography will teach you both the technical aspects of taking photos with a film camera, developing the film, and making prints in the darkroom, as well as teaching you about the art and history of photography. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of using and manipulating an analog SLR camera, darkroom development skills, vocabulary with which to discuss photography, and background on well-known photographers throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the things I learned include how to use a film camera, develop and print in the darkroom (such a great experience) and look at film, \"see the world\" in Black & White, the importance of light and shadow in photography, and a brief history of film photography (more like the B&W classics). Of course, through it all, I learned how /talk/ about what I was making and seeing. ",
            "\u00a0It was the best way to start formally learning and exploring my interest in photography. I learned how to use a 35mm film camera, how to develop film, make and enlarge prints. I gained a new appreciation for the medium and for artistic expression through photography. ",
            "\u00a0Ted was an amazing teacher and I recommend him without any reservation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what makes a good photo : how to take a photo manually, how to develop my own photos, and how to put together a portfolio of a cohesive project. I loved this course, and loved learning how to take and create photos in an analog way. ",
            "\u00a0This course focused on camera function and darkroom processes and I think that it did a great job of covering all of the basics and encouraging people who wanted to try more creative, outside the box things in the darkroom as well. We also went over a bit of the history of photography. ",
            "\u00a0Become proficient in the dark room is the most significant aspect of this course. Relatively little instruction on how to use 35mm film camera (1 class), but that's sufficient. Main focus is learning how to best develop prints and function effectively around the dark room. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a thorough introduction into methods and practice of darkroom black and white photography. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the ins and outs of dark room and film development. I learned of influential Photographers and the history and development of photography over the past century. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you how to use a film camera, develop film, make enlargement prints, and think critically about your own photography, those of your classmates, and those of well known photographers. While it is mainly a hands-on course in darkroom and photography practice, we did also spend quite a few important classes discussing the work of other famous photographers, field trips to Haas and MOMA, and participating in critiques. "

            "\u00a0Even more open time in the darkroom would be amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Such a phenomenal course, I honestly don't know how much could be improved without extending the semester to give us more time in the darkroom! The class is a phenomenal introduction to the art of film photography and is a really accessible way to start making photos. Ted works with you hand-on both to show you how to use the camera and how to do everything in the darkroom. TAs are always there to give advice while making prints, and the in-class critiques are incredibly supportive spaces in which to learn how to improve your work. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong in that it strikes a great balance in terms of spending class time making photos and learning about photos/photographers. The selective nature of the course may lend itself to students (and therefore a general class atmosphere) that have a collaborative, critical yet encouraging, and familial spirit. Working independently for most of the time allowed me to learn by doing, but I also had access to help and advice from the professor, teaching assistants, and my classmates whenever I needed it. The field trips were also very fulfilling and helped to shape the way I think about photography. ",
            "\u00a0Wanted the class to cover theoretical materials a little more ",
            "\u00a0The instructor and the TAs were incredible /instructors/. I'm sure they're terrific artists themselves, but in the class, what always came through was their excitement for the practice and for us, the students, engaging with it and learning how to improve our skills. Their feedback and patience and passion was critical to each individual person's experience and the class the dynamic. Though, I would say that maybe we could have used more criticism during our evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course means spending alot of time in the darkroom with your classmates and people from other photography courses. It naturally becomes a very supportive environment and I greatly appreciate the people I met and interacted with. The major strength is definitely the learning and growth that comes from you having no option but to engage with the course and the people. There's no way to move forward without that support. ",
            "\u00a0I just wish we had more time. Class was my favorite by far. ",
            "\u00a0I really don't think there's much that could be done to improve this course. The course got me excited and I'm planning on majoring in photography now. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course. There was a lot of work involved, but we were all so engaged in it and enjoyed it that we didn't mind. I would like to learn a little more about the history of photography though. We covered just a little bit, but I feel like by going more in depth in other artists work, I could have improved my own even more. ",
            "\u00a0Best professor I've had at Yale, easily. Ted is relatable, funny, and engaging. Provides great advice on how to best develop prints. ",
            "\u00a0It is one of the best classes I've taken, though it requires a significant time and financial investment. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very strong. It is interesting and involved. However, it is quite expensive, even though the Professor was extremely generous with providing extra paper and tickets to New York, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was great. Loved the amount of time we spent in the darkroom and the level of feedback we got, and how I also came out of the class with a knowledge of photographers and photography as an art form that I was lacking before. Really important and perfect balance struck. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, I've told everyone I can to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you're at all interested in film photography (and are willing to put in a lot of time taking photos and making prints in the darkroom), you'll love this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - especially if you're a first-year considering pursuing photography. ",
            "\u00a0Youll regret if you dont take this class. And youll regret if you dont take it with Ted Partin. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take Ted Partin's B&W class. It was a very challenging (time-consuming, shifting of how you see things) course, but probably my favorite, or one of my favorite, courses at Yale. Very rewarding, fun, and a great place to learn how to talk about art / be talking about art with a diverse range of students. We even got to take a trip to the MoMA. ",
            "\u00a0I highly, highly recommend this course to anyone who has even a slight interest in photography of any kind. It's definitely not an easy workload (but it's alot more fun than doing a pset and so I spent alot my procrastination time in the darkroom- it's a win-win really). Ted is an incredible professor and the TAs are equally great. Black & White photography is genuinely so interesting but learning about it through a film camera is a whole new level of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, unequivocally. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Ted is incredible and it was fun and informative. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an amazing course. Take it if you can get a spot. Taking photos for this class and being in the darkroom were my ways to escape from the stresses of college and through this class I found that I love photography and art and want to pursue it more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You'll spend a fair amount of time in the dark room, but the class is very rewarding and the experience builds a fair deal of camaraderie. ",
            "\u00a0It is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. It combined commitment to technique as well as engaging with a variety of materials. It was amazing to learn from the instructor and my peers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. If a student is interested in learning the art of film photography I would highly recommend Ted Partins class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Ted is amazing, it is awesome to learn film photography and be doing so much hands-on work. This class does require a lot of time and I would estimate I spent at least four hours a week outside of class time in the darkroom at a minimum, but it is so enjoyable and so worth it. The class also really bonds over learning the practices as most people are newbies and it becomes a really great community. Our TAs were also great and helpful. It is a pretty expensive course and that should be said upfront, but Ted is adamant about money not being an issue and people in the past have applied for CPA grants to help cover costs. If you can borrow a camera from someone that also helps considerably. "
