            "\u00a0By taking Historical Drama in the Age of Shakespeare, I had the opportunity to read all of Shakespeare's history plays which were the part of his corpus with which I was the most unfamiliar and by which I was most intimidated. This course was very generative for me; I learned loads about early modern drama, the Elizabethan era, the makings of the English monarchy, and the way that Shakespeare wrote (self-censorship v. censorship). Although Shakespeare is not my favorite playwright, I greatly appreciate his skill and craft and those aspects of Shakespeare were definitely on display in the course. I also learned how to write a decent conference presentation that would be interesting without being overambitious or lacking evidence. "

            "\u00a0The course seems well-organized in such a way that reveals that it has been taught and refined over several years. The overall structure of the syllabus worked well and let students be attentive to each play without becoming completely bogged down in any single play for weeks upon weeks; the syllabus structure invited focus on the play of the week as well as drawing connections among the plays. The assignments were simple but useful. Weekly posts on Canvas ensured that I had at least one idea to contribute to the class discussion. (Often, finding one thing to discuss online led to me having several comments for class. The individual presentation on one week's reading was helpful as a precursor to the final assignment as well as to engage with other secondary material. And I greatly appreciated the final assignment. I thought that a \"mini-panel\" or \"mini-conference\" was the perfect way to end the course and allowed me to experiment with a burgeoning idea without the illusion of a fully-formed theory or argument.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. It is especially useful for students interested in early modern drama, Shakespeare, plays, and the theater. But the richness and complexity of Shakespeare's history plays makes it so that the course can be useful to almost anyone. I would recommend the course because on one hand, it serves as a study of Shakespeare's career via his histories and on the other, it is a history course about a renaissance in Western theater and the reign of Elizabeth I. On yet another, it is a rumination about the purpose of theater and theories about entertainment and playwriting. "
