            "\u00a0I had the chance to speak French and practice reading the plays. ",
            "\u00a0In this course you will read four plays each from Corneille and Racine, providing a general overview of the important works of 17th century drama and how these playwrights differ. The emphasis is on close reading the primary texts. There are three five-page essays that do not require reading secondary sources. In general, the workload is very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0We read four plays by Corneille and four by Racine and in doing so I came to better understand what the words corneillien and racinien mean. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read seventeenth century French plays in French and how to write academic literary analysis papers in French. "

            "\u00a0The strength was that the professor seemed to be alright with leading the class when students didn't feel prepared enough to answer questions. I think it can be improved if students have a greater opportunity to contribute to class dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are its predictable structure (two plays every three weeks), which makes the workload doable. The class was a fairly small seminar that gave everyone a chance to participate. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were that besides the plays and authors, there didn't seem to be a clear thematic focus throughout the semester nor within the works themselves. I felt that we sometimes didn't get to the heart of a play or its important sections because the conversations got stuck on one question or passage that didn't let us discuss other areas of the text. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that you will have a professor who is very critical when it comes to giving you feedback on your essays. The weaknesses if this class are that you will likely not take that much away from the course. There have been classes where we spend the whole hour and fifteen minutes talking about three pages of one act. The only way someone can really enjoy this class is if they have perfect french and are absolutely in love with 17th century french plays. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the large number of plays we covered.\r\nThe weakness is that the way we analyzed plays was pretty much just textual analysis and interpretation. I feel I would have gotten more out of the course had we talked about the historical context of the plays or engaged with them as plays by watching theatrical renditions of them or reading dialog out loud in groups. ",
            "\u00a0This course had the potential to be interesting, but unfortunately, it was intensely draining and boring. The plays we read were written under King Louis XIV's reign in 17th century France, however, we never once connected the plays to their contemporary political, social, and religious context. Instead, we focused on obscure details of the Roman and Greek states described in each play. This class would have been much more interesting had Professor Saint-Amand taken the time to devise classes that would encourage us to connect the plays to King Louis XIV's France. Furthermore, we very rarely read the plays out loud in class. In the future, Professor Saint-Amand should make the effort to read large sections of the play out loud, especially as we were often assigned lots of reading and could not complete all of it, which led to quiet class discussions. Hopefully the above changes are made to this class to make it intellectually stimulating and challenging. "

            "\u00a0I might not if they want to learn more contemporary issues. This is more of a niche topic for those already interested in discussing literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone looking to practice their French--speaking, reading, and writing--and to someone who is interested in 17th century drama. If you're not interested in the rather formal structure and style of these works, you will be bored. These texts are a key part of the French literary tradition and spending time reading and understanding them is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course unless your french is perfect. Professor Saint-Amand is the Director of Graduate Studies so he holds the undergrads who take his course to the same high expectations that he holds his grad students to. That being said, he is a really nice guy in class. I almost always showed up late to his class and even missed a few, and he was still forgiving of my absences and tardiness. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, I dont feel I got that much out of it and could have just read the plays and textual analyses of them on my own. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. It was, quite frankly, one of the most intellectually boring classes I have taken thus far at Yale. The material we were assigned was intriguing, but the way it was taught made me wish I had dropped the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I really enjoyed our class discussions. "
