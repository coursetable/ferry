            "\u00a0Almost none. Maybe a better sense of the history of environmental governance regimes? I did start thinking about the limits of economic cost-benefit thinking about solving environmental problems. Nordhaus and others make the news for working on the economics of saving the environment, but the way they frame the problem seems to have some embedded questionable value judgements. "

            "\u00a0This course could be improved by focusing more on a few nuanced debates about the past or future of global environmental governance. As it stands now, we focus on memorizing various oversimplified theories which don't meaningfully contribute to our understanding of the global environmental regimes or other environmentalist efforts.\r\n\r\nThe assignments should ask us to think creatively about historical developments or new challenges rather than having us regurgitate material from lecture. "

            "\u00a0No. The assignments seemed to want us to summarize conversations we had already had in class. For this reason I did not learn much from them. Lectures were repetitive. "
