            "\u00a0I think the course raised very important issues and teaches students to be critical of research; I can confidently say that I am more critical of methodology and findings after being guided by Beth.\r\n\r\nI will say that the course did seem a bit disorganized, and the student presentations were almost always rushed at the ends. I like the the idea of having certain last names being responsible for different portions of the readings. I think this should be a regular part of the discussion to ensure that all students participate. It also makes the weekly reading less daunting. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course a lot and thought it brought a new perspective to how I think about study designs and health equity ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a great introduction to health disparities through an epidemiological lens.  It was very helpful to address disparities through different disease process/age-related conditions each week as a means to explore this content.\r\nStudent-led discussions were a great experience to do and organize, but sometimes the questions were too pointed and didn't lead to a general discussion about the readings and synthesizing the readings overall as they related to the larger topic.

            "\u00a0Beth prepared great readings that got us thinking about both structural and biological factors that create health disparities. \r\n\r\nThe powerpoints, however, didn't seem to be the main focus on the classes and were more of a formality. Maybe having a summary sheet circulated before the class with key theories and topics can serve as a primer for the readings and discussion. The beginning of class can be dedicated to reviwing the primer and jump straight into student discussions for the majority of the class. ",
