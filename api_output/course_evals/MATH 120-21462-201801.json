It was perhaps the class that both stretched me the most conceptually and taught me the most this semester.

            "\u00a0This course, and especially the section I was in, covers some very difficult material. I have no complaints about the way that we moved through the concepts and think that overall it was very well executed. Sometimes we would attempt in-class problems that were beyond our grasp of the material which would be a waste of about 10 minutes until we actually learned how to do them, but that was rare. ",
            "\u00a0Eh, it's a pretty standard intro math class I guess. Exams could be graded more nicely. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was my instructor, Sudesh. I cannot thank him enough. He was available all of the time and committed to helping us understand all concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Handouts were extremely helpful. The amount of office hours was very helpful. Smaller homeworks due each class (rather than weekly problem sets) would be more beneficial to learning the material. ",

            "\u00a0It is a really fun course, although hard. Visualizing and quantifying 3D objects was something really far from what I though I could do and when I finally learned it I felt accomplished ",
            "\u00a0The exams are worth  90 percent of your grade (40 midterm, 50 final) which is horrible and scary. Review sessions were not very helpful, except the ones by Sudesh Kalyanswamy. Sudesh is the only thing that made MATH120 bearable (even enjoyable). ",
            "\u00a0This was a great math course, and it had many strengths. Most of all, it was extremely well-organized by Sudesh. The curriculum was engaging, and there was plenty of help outside of class (office hours) available to students. In addition, before each exam, instructors would also hold numerous review sessions and Sudesh would post plenty of practice exam and practice problems, both of which really helped with exam preparation. Overall, it was an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0The approach of various TF's could be standardized, with the resources of one TF made available to all course students. I felt very fortunate to have a great TF who created practice problems with every lecture, but I imagine this course could become frustrating if your TF didn't care as much as mine did. ",
            "\u00a0-very well organised \r\n-sudesh taught the course well\r\n-could be more in depth about visualisations ",
            "\u00a0I hated how monotonous the problem sets were. They always felt like a chore, rather than an aid to learning like problem sets in other classes. I understand that practice is necessary, but I felt like the practice problems did not adequately prepare me to take the tests. I think if I only did the exam practice problems instead of any homework at all, I would be more prepared to do well on exams. \r\nMany times I felt like I understood the material, but actually the practice problems I were doing were not varied enough to completely cover the variety on the tests. There is a lot of memorization involved to even start doing problems.\r\nI realize that the peer tutor system was in place, but I never felt the need to visit them instead of my professor (Sudesh.) \r\nThe homework is supposed to be weighted much less so you can feel comfortable using them for practice, but most people work with friends until they get all correct answers anyway, even if they don't understand the material as well. \r\nThe exams are extremely high stake. If you do poorly on any single test, it is very difficult to recover because the material just keeps ramping up. There is partial credit, but if you misread a question or misunderstand the setup to one full problem (out of the 6-7 on the test) it will ruin you. I'd rather have more tests on more material to test complete understanding instead of the narrow focus on a few things it is now. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was taught very well and see no ways to really improve it. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves at a very fast pace, and I think the content is very difficult. I noticed that each instructor varies widely in their teaching styles, and although they are knowledgeable, they may not be the best instructors. I think the instructors for these courses could be more standardized to improve the student's ability to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of worksheets and extra practice problems was incredibly helpful. My professor would print out notes that would help students focus on the concepts and process of the problem instead of writing it down.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses, particularly with my professor. "

            "\u00a0Yes, good class if you want to learn more math. ",

            "\u00a0I mean you probably need it, though it's not as bad as people say it is. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, and take it with Sudesh. Best professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Absolutely take it if Sudesh is course coordinator or teaching. I initially dreaded taking this course after hearing bad reviews, but Sudesh's lectures are life changing and will make you truly appreciate how beautiful and wonderful math can be. I've always disliked math and never wanted to take more than one math course in college, but this course has changed my mind. Sudesh is really organized and provides plenty of practice problems (along with super helpful lecture notes) for each lecture, which is really useful and helpful for exam preparation. Overall, an excellent course, and if you get the chance to take it with Sudesh, absolutely take it!!! ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, it's a survivable course. Do your best to take the class with Sudesh -- he is by far the most popular TF for good reason. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that It enforces useful skills and the knowledge gained is very applicable to real life problems, although this is easier to see when taking physics alongside ",
            "\u00a0No. If you don't have to take this class as a prerequisite, there is no reason to take this class. From my knowledge, the class's difficulty depends heavily on the professor you get, and that is a risky gamble. It is very possible to ace the class if you do all of the given material, but the sheer monotony of it makes it feel un-worthwhile. If you have no intrinsic reason to take this class, avoid it. \r\n\r\nThe exams are extremely high stake. If you do poorly on any single test, it is very difficult to recover because the material just keeps ramping up. If you do decide to take this class, start strong and don't get overconfident on the first few weeks of material. It only gets harder and you have to maintain your level of understanding, or else you will fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0The grading scale is too harsh for this class for me to recommend this course to another student. I would recommend it if it was taken Credit/D/Fail, but it is still incredibly challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want/need multi-variable calculus knowledge further on in college. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. This course is very well organized and has very interesting topics. All the teachers for this course are willing to help you even if you are not in their class. It forces you to think very critically yet creatively, making it rather fun. "
