            "\u00a0Taking this class has helped me immensely in reading and writing history Ive learned about and named enough ways of doing history that I feel like I have a lot more on my palette when writing a paper, and that I am much more able to engage with content when Im reading and can identify the historiographic tradition someone is writing in. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far one of the best (if not the best) courses I took at Yale. First, the reading was absolutely spectacular, perfectly curated, and covered a wide range of topics. This course really pushed me to think about methodology, as well as knowledge construction/power in the writing of history. Second, Prof. LaFleur is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that I have gained a foundation in understanding basic trends in historical theory. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of theories of hsitory--from marxist to foucaludian and beyond. Highly recommend "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Syllabus was very well organized and Greta is a fantastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is perfect, and is exactly what a senior seminar should be. The emphasis was not on routine work, but rather really digging into the readings and having a good seminar conversation. The grading was far, the expectations were absolutely clear. ",
            "\u00a0A quicker return time on written feedback would be beneficial to student learning. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic readings, and great attention paid to the readings during the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings and interesting, thought-provoking discussions. However, would have liked more context/mini-lectures from professor at beginnng of class and more feedback on assignments, "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you are someone who reads and writes historically-leaning things, and youre serious about improving your ability to engage with historical material, definitely take this class. I would not recommend it for sophomores or first years it is best if you are already somewhat familiar (have heard of, maybe read an excerpt from) with at least some of the theorists on the syllabus. Dont take this class lightly, but it is incredibly rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a must-take course for any scholar of the humanities. ",
            "\u00a0If a student would like to learn the fundamentals of historiography, I highly recommend Professor LaFleur's class. ",
            "\u00a0yes. great theory overview ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially history doctoral students. The course fills some of the many theoretical gaps left in the HIST 500 (required first year seminar); I also have been able to use the course to start thinking about the theoretical frameworks that may shape my dissertation and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this Course to another student. The readings and dicussions were interesting and thought-provoking. I felt discussion really helped me understand nuances or tricky sections of readings. Professor LaFleur is a really great teacher and discussion leader--really knowledgeable, insightful, approachable, and funny. Don't expect a lot of feedback on any written work, however, as we got very minimal comments on submitted work. "
