            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the year long format that gives students the opportunity to work over an extended period of time on one project. It is also a great setting to work in a community of others and being able to get feedback and see others bringing ideas into an actual project. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is perhaps the amount of things we have to learn on our own in order to put a film together. Maybe more in-depth and hands on sessions around things like editing, interviewing , sound, ect. "

            "\u00a0Yes, putting a documentary together sets you a part from other students and people in general. Not everyone can say they are a filmmaker. It also a great space to share ideas with others. Most of the students take the year long course so you get to see other birth ideas and deliver at the end of the year. "
