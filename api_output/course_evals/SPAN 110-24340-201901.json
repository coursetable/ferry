            "\u00a0I got a better grasp and understanding of the grammar rules underlying certain parts of the Spanish language. ",
            "\u00a0Audited course: accelerated learning of Spanish and being able to have a basic conversation in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Enough Spanish to begin to engage with individuals in Spanish-speaking countries with some confidence. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read, write, speak and listen in Spanish. I would say this class improved my writing, reading and grammar/vocabulary more so than my speaking and listening - to improve the latter two as much as I wanted to, I had to do a lot of outside study on my own (listening to podcasts/videos/music in Spanish, having conversations with native speakers on online language exchange platforms). However, this course does give you a good foundation to build on as a stepping stone to improve your listening and speaking. ",

            "\u00a0I enjoy the small classroom seminar-style format and enjoyed the opportunities to participate in the course. However, it would be great to be able to engage more and practise more real-world conversations as opposed to manufactured conversations based on a textbook on topics that are at times not relevant to us. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Garcia is an amazing teacher.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- intensity, 5x/week with 1hr of homework/night is a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class is a great introduction to a new language and is organized in a way that is logical and intuitive. You learn how to speak, listen, read and write, and a sufficient amount of attention is given to each component. The class also incorporates many different learning styles (listening to music, Kahoot etc) which made it interesting. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Daily homework can sometimes be a chore, but it really does help. One thing I would say is that it was slightly frustrating in the beginning to come into the class not knowing a thing about Spanish, but then having classmates with some prior knowledge about Spanish (from middle/early high school). But ultimately this shouldn't hold you back from taking the class - as long as you work hard and commit to learning the language, you can advance and see incremental progress throughout the semester.

            "\u00a0Of course if you want to learn Spanish at Yale. Class size was really small so there was no where to hide in the back- you have to participate. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish I is an excellent course. The course covers fundamentals and reviews them. It builds nicely, and the Supersite homeworks are very helpful to practice the langauge. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. First of all, Spanish is a practical and relatively simple language to learn (compared to other more difficult ones). As long as you keep up with the material (and the class moves at a manageable pace), you should be able to hold conversations or write a basic, short composition in Spanish with relative ease by the end of the semester. Also, the class is taught in a way that incorporates many different learning styles (listening to music, Kahoot etc) which made it interesting. ",
