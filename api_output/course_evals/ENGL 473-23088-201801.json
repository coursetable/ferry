            "\u00a0I learned some things about the form of journalism and its ethics and implications. I was exposed to a number of fantastic female journalists who I would've otherwise gone through life unaware of. I gained first-hand experience in the practice of journalism through our final project. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this class having never read nonfiction, and now I'm putting together a list of all the nonfiction I'm going to read over the summer. This class taught me to think more critically about how writers construct their thoughts and arguments than any other class I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to great texts and learned so much from the people in the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I adored this course. First of all, the syllabus, hand-picked by Professor Oppenheimer, was filled with female journalists mostly from the twentieth century, and I loved all of the readings. From Renata Adler to Zadie Smith to Hannah Arendt, I left the class with a backbone of information bout these important authors. The discussions every week leave me pondering the subject for days after, and I always look forward to these interesting conversations. Professor Oppenheimer urges us to make controversial comments and always makes sure we drive conversations beyond the reading and into the messy realm of the modern day. ",
            "\u00a0The course forced me to read at a pace I've never really undertaken for a class before--because the material was so interesting, it wasn't very difficult! ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to think about ideas and questions in journalism. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of american nonfiction canon "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The syllabus was by far the course's greatest strength, and Mark was a great seminar leader because of his charisma and energy. I often felt a bit lost in some of the discussions in the class, but that may have been because a few upperclassmen prioritized drama over actual discussion. Some of the students in the class offered some really great insights, however, and I'm glad I was able to get to know them. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course and we read some excellent work. It would have been good, however, if we had had more opportunities to write original essays and cultivate our writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class was based entirely on discussion, so if people didn't read the assignment the conversation dragged a bit. I did enjoy that every week one person would present some contextual information on the author we were reading to frame our discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by focusing more on the mechanics and techniques of journalism, and by incorporating a workshop component. ",
            "\u00a0I think a core strength lies in its flexibility; the class discussion always led to the most interesting of places, and Professor Oppenheimer encouraged the class to explore new ideas and thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mark is awesome! Also the class was very smart and engaged. \r\nWeaknesses: Syllabus is a lot of reading, but worth it. No real guidance on papers/grading. ",
            "\u00a0Good syllabus and structure. gives a productive framework to think about writing\r\nclassroom discussions can be more structured, with more interferences from the professor "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It is only taught every two years or so, but if it is offered, take a look at the syllabus and check your course schedule. The concepts we discuss in class can be easily used to motivate your learning in other courses as well, assuming you are a humanities major. I'm more of a STEM person and I still thoroughly enjoyed this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely yes. ",
            "\u00a0Highly. ",
            "\u00a0This class is worth the time. The readings are spectacular, especially if you really care about journalism and essay writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone - English major or not. It was very insightful and raised questions about so many different current social, political, etc. topics through the work we read. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I learned a lot and had a great time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would. This course was so thought-provoking and I adored the setup -- 2 hours of interrupted discussion about the most talented, sometimes under-read female journalists. ",
            "\u00a0I would completely recommend this class. The syllabus is a gem; you will never find another course like this at Yale. Do take! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class because 1) Mark is awesome and 2) if you want to read amazing writers and think about questions. Class probably won't improve your writing too much, though. Most enjoyable was the readings and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0yes, but understand what you will get out of it- great readings, great witty professor, don't expect a huge improvement in your writing ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I LOVED this class. The assigned readings were great, and the class discussion was really lively. One of my most engaging seminars at Yale. "
