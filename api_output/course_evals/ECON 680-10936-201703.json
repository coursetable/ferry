            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different modelling methods and how you can combine the various fields of economics with public economics.\r\n\r\nThe problem set helped me to improve my practical skills and I enjoyed working on it.\r\n\r\nThe presentation helped me to think about my own research project and provided me with valuable feedback.\r\n\r\nThe course was well structured and I think Joseph did his best to make the class a valuable learning experience for everyone! ",

            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to better read papers and think through their main contributions, as well as about the various topics covered in courses ",
            "\u00a0The most useful thing I learnt from this class was about the application of quasi experimental methods in many contexts. Joe also provided a lot of useful advice about writing and presenting papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how Public Finance is interconnected with the other areas of Economics as well as useful advice regarding academic etiquette / best practices. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to evaluate a critic to a paper, differentiating between minor and major issues. \r\n\r\nI improved my paper-reading skills, being more effective in reading week after week ",

            "\u00a0I do not find any particular weakness. The strengths of this course were:\r\n- Well structured\r\n- Reasonable amount of work and well selected readings\r\n- Good balance between empirical and theoretical papers in each topic\r\n- Good overview over less classical topics of PF\r\n- Nice PS, which helped me to develop my practical skills\r\n- Coffee beans!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Has to improve his jokes ;) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good teaching, good coverage of topics, good advice ",
            "\u00a0Overall, very positive. Liked the commitment device. Forcing us to read every week (the responses) and learned a lot. I would have liked slightly more of the technical aspects we would sometimes see at the start of courses (as that is a relative weakness of mine), and for the empirical content, our discussion of methods (eg Barthik instruments) was sometimes a bit too ad hoc for me ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was brilliant overall. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly enjoyed how Joe connected the often times desperate fields of Economics back to Public Finance.  Further, he demonstrated how best to structure an article, what to look for in a good paper, and how to evaluate the importance of an article's subject matter.  One weakness is that I was often anxious to speak in class because it seemed there was a specific answer Joe was looking for when he asked a question.  I really liked Joe's lecturing, but a greater emphasis on discussion would take some pressure off when students did speak in class. ",
            "\u00a0Keep to 2 papers/week. Have pset earlier. More emphasis on final presentation earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include its varied coverage of papers grouped by general theme, its focus on exposure to many different techniques and data, and its emphasis on transferable research skills. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone with strong primary interest in public finance. I think it is a great course if you want to make it your primary field. Otherwise, I would say it is a great course to learn a lot about how different fields overlap. However, given the amount of work you need to do in order to make the most out of this course, I would not recommend anyone taking, if they are not interested in either Public Finance or Labor Econ ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, especially if someone is interested in applied topics with a focus on PF or even labour. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It covers many methods, so it's good to learn them. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would if Joe was teaching the course.  He managed to communicate the key insights of Public Finance in a short time and in an interesting manner.  It was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Anybody willing to do applied work can benefit from Joe's course. His classes are full of insights on how to shape your own research ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great lectures and readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an excellent complement to other courses even if public finance is not your primary area of focus. Many of the general takeaways and the critical thinking that is encouraged are readily transferable to other fields as well. Highly recommended. "
