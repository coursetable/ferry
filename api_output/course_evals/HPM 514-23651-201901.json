Weaknesses are that the lecture can get pretty dry and hard to follow along since there is no lecture slides. ",
            "\u00a0Great course to take for those who are interested in learning about health politics and how the structure of U.S. government affects policy/policy decisions. I personally didn't like how many readings there were, but it is a small critique given how informative the course was and how much I enjoyed taking the class. ",

I enjoyed that this course explored these topics within the framework of timely policy issues including LTC, the ACA, and other major policy movements. After taking this course, I have a much better understanding of the elements that shape US health policy.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion to improve this course is to provide the weekly handout  in a digital copy to reduce paper usage. ",
            "\u00a0Uses the literature to explore the relationships between government, political forces, and public opinion with respect to health policy. Great discussions based around the literature\r\n\r\nHow could it be improved: Sometimes I felt a little 'led', like there was a right answer to some of the questions posed by Prof. (based on the literature). It would be nice if there was time to discuss our own thoughts around the topics. \r\n\r\nThe group project at the end of the semester just about broke me, I ended up having to write someone else's section at the 11th hour, when I had other coursework and exams to study for. There was too much reading for the final assignment, which wasn't completely necessary to complete the assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely loved this course! It opened my eyes to a new way of thinking about politics and policy-making in healthcare. The readings and lecture were very well intertwined and I really enjoyed writing the policy papers. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class if you are willing to put in the work and come prepared to class. Even though there were many students in the class, it was still very much a discussion-based course where students could make comments, ask questions, and debate aspects of health policy. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic! Great way to expand on what we learned in our intro to health policy class last semester. Very engaging topic and interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Its a great show of history and balance of how government and health combined into what/where we are today.  Professor is excellent. \r\nThe one thing I would do differently is, since many people are graduating and this is one of the last courses they take.  Push the last policy paper assignment to a few weeks earlier in the semester, otherwise it really lingers on an on, and makes the last few weeks of the semester a bit tougher with competing exams. ",
            "\u00a0I really didnt feel like I learned much. It might because I have a pretty solid poli-Sci background, but nothing seemed like new information to me. I also feel like no one did the readings consistently, and I would recommend reducing both assignments by about 5 pages and introducing assignments that are smaller and force people to do the readings weekly. Both written assignments were topically interesting, learned a lot from writhing both of them.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem with this class was the group assignment. Why. Why. Why make a 15 page paper a group assignment. I was  stuck with a terrible group, had to rewrite everything, and the people in my group just didnt care. Why should I be forced to share my grade with them? If you must keep this as a group assignments, why not let people choose their group? Yes we will self select into groups that have more similar experiences as us but that isnt necessarily a bad thing. Let the people who dont care stick  together and the people who actually want to learn and work together. Also I dont see the point in working in a group for this, since we were all just answering different sections. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely amazing course! This course reminds me of why I wanted to pursue policy to begin with. I really enjoyed the breadth of material that the class covered because I had not thought about some of those topics in a health context specifically, like how this is the only course that touches on therapeutic jurisprudence. I thought that both policy briefs were also really helpful in allowing me to apply what I learned to explain concepts: I think this was definitely a more effective way of engaging with the material rather than just taking an exam. Overall, one of my favorite classes I've taken! ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course is great but the final policy brief was too comprehensive to cover in just one essay especially to be structured as a group project. ",

            "\u00a0This course was very interesting, but it was often difficult to follow along with the class due to the lecture-hall environment without a visual/presentation aid. ",

            "\u00a0Very good course, well positioned in the syllabus. I do wonder if the mix of breadth and depth could trade-off too much in terms of generating deeper policy insights but this is only a small complaint as this is clearly a well refined course. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting content and covered a broad range of contemporary issues in health policy \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings could have been better labeled on canvas which would have made them easier to find during class\r\n-taking this class should not be mandatory for all health policy students. If this class was a seminar, more people who want to the take the class would be there and would participate.\r\n-participation grades were not clear as to how they would be graded\r\n-1st paper should not be out of 10 if someone with an MPP and 5 years of experience would get a 9.5\r\n-course should have several small policy briefs with an emphasis on how to format and construct them instead of large research papers covering different topics ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Provides questions and frameworks to be able to critically assess policymaking in the U.S. moving forward: whereas other HPM courses provided groundwork and background information for understanding why the U.S. healthcare system is the way it is in the present, I feel that this class helped me to think about how the healthcare system may evolve in the future. \r\nWeaknesses: This course may be a bit hard to follow for people who do not have prior knowledge about the U.S. healthcare system and public assistance programs - for those who come in without having taken one of the introductory HPM courses, it might be good to provide informational readings on these topics so that students can more easily apply the political science frameworks presented throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Overall this was a phenomenal course. I greatly enjoyed Professor Schlesinger's teaching style of not using power points and simply orating and using the chalkboard. It was also nice to get handouts for each class with figures we could refer to. \r\n\r\nThe only thing I would tweak about this course is maybe having more updated figurers for the points discussed in class. Many of them seem to be 10-20 years old, and they still might be valid, but newer data would be better. ",
            "\u00a0The final group project leaves room for great variability and unnecessary stress. It should be an individual project or an exam. ",

Hard to know where you stand in the class, because project averages aren't published, and you don't get any class feedback until near the very end of the semester.

I understand that he was grading about 60 15-page policy memos, so I don't necessarily have any suggestions for improving the timeliness of grading, but if possible, it would have been helpful to get the midterm grades back before the end of the semester (preferably within a few weeks of the deadline).

Mark is really great at integrating everything together and relating the overall topics to specific examples in healthcare. I would say the only downside was how long it took to grade the policy briefs, but I also understand since they were very long and there were so many.

I do have two small complaints:\r\n1) he often ends lecture with food for thought questions for the class, but we never revisit to discuss them, which I found frustrating\r\n2) sometimes, he presents somewhat subjective evidence as hard evidence of his points, and I'm not always convinced. However, there isn't always time or space in class to debate him when he does this. Would like some way to be able to discuss without derailing the whole class. ",

I would 100% recommend this to policy and non-policy students alike because it is an amazing course and I think it teaches concepts relevant for every public health student moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0It's an important course in learning more about feasibility and sustainability of US healthcare policy. It's a core course for policy students but for anyone who wants to learn how to think more critically about health policy, I highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Take it.  The papers are difficult but they help synthesize a lot of knowledge in ways that a final exam or routine assignments cannot. ",
            "\u00a0Compulsory if in the policy track. One of the better Profs at Yale. Covers new content in comparison to some other spring courses which I felt re-hashed concepts that were covered in the fall. Would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for a student who wants to know more about the intricacies of health policy and policymaking. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to everyone interested in health policy - not just the policy students! ",
            "\u00a0This is an interesting course on the politics of healthcare and has some more varied content than other courses of similar subject matter. However, there is much more reading that I found necessary and the projects are relatively narrow in terms of your ability to respond ",
            "\u00a0You have to work hard to learn the material.  I have been working in the US health care system for over 20 years.  And finally through this course, I learned some basics of how the health care systems work in the US and in the world.  This course is a must-have! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended for people interested in policymaking as it relates to the U.S. healthcare system, across the public and private sector - if your interest tends toward global health, not sure how much you'd glean from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Great course with great content taught by someone who really understands this material. Would highly recommend. A lot of reading, but writing assignments will actually be useful for my future. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty much exactly what you'd expect, and it's fantastic. You're going to be made to think on your toes during the class. There is a heavy emphasis on writing. 2 assignments. No exams. I personally like this setup, but it's not for everyone. Overall, the experience was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Great learning opportunity but challenging near impossible to cover all reading assignments in a timely manner\r\nStill possible to learn/do well by performing well on the 2 writeups "
