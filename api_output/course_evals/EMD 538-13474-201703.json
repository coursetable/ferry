            "\u00a0The issue with this course is that it is a survey of challenging modeling topics that cumulatively do not get the attention they each deserve. An improvement would be to focus on just three of the methods presented so that students could become confident in a smaller number of techniques, rather than have a shaky understanding of 8 different ID epi models. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course for learning new methods being developed in mathematical modeling of infectious diseases. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Learned very interesting and very cool methods to analyze infectious disease data, learned more about coding in R, enhanced my understanding of infectious disease behavior, took away tangible skills I hope to apply to my future career, instruction was clear, assignments were reflective of course content, exam was difficult but fair, helpful feedback on assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Perhaps this is in the control of the registrar, but having two hour lectures plus a two hour lab made it difficult to concentrate for the entire lecture and lab. The professor attempted to help by giving us a couple minutes break at the hour mark. Sometimes it felt like there was too much content in one sitting. ",

I also really like every week's lab session.\r\n\r\nI hope there could be one lecture (probably the first?) reviewing basic concepts for infectious disease model (probably from Ted's class?)\r\nI hope during the lab session, we may have about 15 minutes to review the concepts during the lecture.

The lab sections were informative and fun. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Material introduced can be overwhelming or difficult to understand. I would recommend anyone taking this course to be a regular at office hours. ",

She is clear and knows what she is talking about, she has effective powerpoint slides, she even throws in jokes and cultural references for us, which is awesome.

I think it can be intimidating (personally) to speak up and ask questions in class, so group work or time to discuss the material in small groups would be an interesting activity to try. ",

It is difficult and quant-heavy, but problem sets are done in groups. The final ties everything together, and it is manageable by yourself. I would recommend the class to all EMD people. If possible, take Ted Cohen's transmission dynamics class first, but I know that people who are first years now won't be able to. ",

Even though I am in no way versatile in the methodologies presented in this class, I think it's good to have an introduction to these methods as an infectious disease epidemiologist and to know about the unique challenges in studying IDs. I learned a lot in this course and I thought it was worth my time. It is challenging, but ultimately a good experience. ",
