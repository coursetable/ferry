            "\u00a0Learn about history and historical study of the Holocaust, using a variety of different kinds of historical texts, from academic analyses to memoir testimony. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Holocaust testimony and its historiography. We read histories and memoirs about the Holocaust, as well as works discussing historical memory of the Holocaust. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very analytical course!! Definitely not about the Holocaust as it happened, but the Holocaust as a historical event/ as a memory. What historical processes gave rise to \"the Holocaust\" as we know it today, re: the cultural significance it holds? Why not other genocides? Really really fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0This is the class at Yale that has taught me most about the practice of history. It gave me a comprehensive understanding of how the holocaust came to be what it is in our public imagination, and what interventions historians can make/have made to shape that understanding. ",
            "\u00a0How to discuss the Holocaust ",
            "\u00a0study of what testimony is and how it affects study of holocaust ",

            "\u00a0I felt the synthetic essay (15 pages) was a little unfulfilling. The readings were for the most part very interesting, and Prof. Dean does an excellent job of directing the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The only small weakness is probably that the final paper was very unstructured, with no prompt. For others, that would have been great, but for me, having some direction would have been helpful. Other than that small thing (which was smoothened out by talking to Prof Dean), the course is absolutely phenomenal. Discussion is robust, and you really learn to think deeply and analytically about what you're reading, and how they're presented: reading for argumentative style. ",
            "\u00a0No real weaknesses... some class discussions were better than others, but that's to be expected. Prof. Dean is a brilliant, brilliant seminar leader. She has a good BS radar too  do the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides an inclusive survey of the important literature surrounding the Holocaust, but doesnt discuss much of the historiography. ",
            "\u00a0good reading material ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was a strong course overall ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--Professor Dean is very knowledgeable, the syllabus is great, the themes are important.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--not enough work throughout the semester to keep people engaged, could feel pretty repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the books we read, the professor, and the discussions. The only weakness is that I would have liked more feedback on my grade or how I was doing in the course. Overall, amazing course. "

            "\u00a0To be clear, this course is not a history of the Holocaust, but a study of historical memory and testimony with regards to the Holocaust. It is also not a course that looks at how thinkers have interpreted the Holocaust, which probably would have made it a more interesting class for me. That being said, if you're interested in historical memory and/or the Holocaust, definitely take it. Prof. Dean is great and super accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof Dean is fantastic (also hilarious, but in that not really intentional way? Which is the best way?) and the discussion was really fruitful. That being said, the class would then probably depend a lot on the people you're with, but Prof Dean is very very skilled at guiding seminar discussion. She'll just weave and synthesize the things we've said together and I'd be like ??? HOW??? Anyways, I left class every week feeling like I had learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would not - the course is not super well organized and there is almost no assessment to keep you engaged the whole semester.  Unless you are really interested in the Holocaust, the course on its own is not so amazing that it is worth taking on this very serious topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yesa truly great junior seminar for a history major! ",
            "\u00a0for those looking to beef up on their knowledge, it was helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed it ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend. I loved Professor Dean, the books were very interesting, and I enjoyed coming to class each week. "
