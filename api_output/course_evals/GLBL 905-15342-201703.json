            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the foundational and most influential works in the field. I also got a good sense of the sociology of the field. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to engage with some of the canonical texts of International Relations in a way I had never had the opportunity to before. My knowledge of the paradigms in IR and the core texts that developed them mostly comes from textbooks and an undergrad survey course, so I really enjoyed the opportunity to engage deeply with the primary sources. The focus on theory I think sets a good foundation for subsequent classes. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great survey course through the large debates in IR theory and security - I was not only introduced to the greats of the field, but also learned how to make focused, fleshed out critiques of the same through the engaging writing assignments and class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent overview of both older and more modern debates in International Relations. Readings responses were particularly interesting, as well as the policy paper option for MA students. Useful not only for PhD students, but provides great insights for MA students who intend to work with foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of IR theory and methods. Developed critical thinking "

            "\u00a0I thought the course was well run and that Nuno did a great job of managing the class. No real complaints. ",
            "\u00a0I understand Nuno's concern about the emphasis on theory in this course, which is somewhat apart from much of the current research in the field. However, I think it is a necessary framework for understanding and approaching IR, so I'm happy with the focus it received. \r\n\r\nI would have enjoyed more discussion of current events and how the theories we discussed look in practice. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Very engaging class discussion of assigned material\r\n- Diverse and interesting assignments for evaluating course performance ",
            "\u00a0I only audited this course, but I loved it. The reading workload seemed rather intense, but Professor Monteiro was truly spectacular. He's 100% worth the price of admission and someone that everyone at Yale should fight to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0The course would benefit from more discussions on the practical application of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale, and I have no major suggestions for revision. See question 10. "

            "\u00a0If you want to learn about IR, definitely. It's a great course with interesting readings. Nuno does a great job of synthesizing the different strands of scholarship and explaining how they relate to one another. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a great survey of key concepts of the field. I'm walking away confident in my knowledge of the key themes of the foundational works in IR. I also really enjoyed the discussion format and looked forward to the conversations each week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is as important as it is interesting ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes. Very challenging (especially with regards to the amount of coursework), but very rewarding in the end. Glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I would happily recommend to another student. It is a great intro course to IR for students who are serious about the topic. And regardless of what you think of IR itself, Professor Monteiro will make it all worth it. ",
