            "\u00a0This course was my first ever introduction to grand strategy and allowed me to apply these principles to work in the field of global health. I learned to apply a framework for addressing complex problems that I will use throughout my career in global health - it was one of the most useful and fulfilling courses that I have taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill to apply grand strategic methodology to challenges in global health. I also developed the skill to present the results of that strategic problem solving methodology in a written brief and as an oral presentation. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the steps of the Grand Strategy process and how to apply them to a range of complex global health issues. I also learned how to write and structure a persuasive strategic brief targeted towards a specific audience. "

            "\u00a0The course was very well organized and allowed us to breakup the final course product into chunks each week that corresponded with what we were learning, reading, and discussing in class. The environment was so well suited for learning - it was very comfortable and I learned so much from Prof Curry, Sam, and my peers! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--absolutely everything! Grand strategy has been one of my most enjoyable and fulfilling courses. I felt like I left the course with an immensely dense but fruitful product, while developing skills critical not only to the area of global and public health, but also professional, speaking, argumentative, and critical thinking skills. Incredible capstone to the global health studies curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how this course let me choose one particular case study to focus on throughout the semester-- this structure made the concepts we studied feel much more applied and tied to the real world. I also appreciated the mini case studies we examined in class throughout the semester, which I feel were very well chosen and represented the diversity and complexity of the field of global health. I also really appreciated how we wrote the different sections of our briefs spread out throughout the semester, because it helped me deeper engage with the concepts we were studying and also made compiling the final brief a much less overwhelming task. I also really loved having the guest \"judges\" for the presentations, who offered very insightful feedback and advice pulled from their extensive experience working on global health. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class! A more practical class than most at Yale that gives you a lot of real tools for working in global health! "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in global health - it will provide you with a framework to think about and address complex issues in the field at a very high level. Great course!! ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained from this course was invaluable. Anyone who wants to learn to apply strategic problem solving methodologies to challenges in their field will find this course beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Grand strategy and global health changed my viewpoint from believing that these two areas were at odds with one another to valuing the intersection of these two disciplines. This was the only course at Yale where I feel that I have left with something tangible that I can take with me in future work. This class was the perfect size and allowed for intimate discussion and holistic viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who is thinking about a career in global health at all. Professor Curry is amazing and brings an enthusiastic, warm, and supportive energy to this class that I am very grateful to have experienced in my last semester at Yale. I loved using one particular global health topic as a case study for the yearlong brief, and I feel like it made this class feel much more application-based and tied to the real world in a way that few others at Yale do. We tackled many complex ideas throughout the course and the discussions were always thought-provoking and engaging. I thought this class really rounded out my time at Yale, tying together many of the concepts I have been struggling to process throughout my study of global health. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, thanks to Prof Curry! "
