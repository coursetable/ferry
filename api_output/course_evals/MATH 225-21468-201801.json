But the exams were mostly computational, so I learned how to apply linear algebra knowledge as well. The lectures on Google's page rank algorithm and on the Heisenberg principle were especially interesting. ",

Professor Auel is dedicated to student learning, holding great office hours and making staff available that are super helpful. I would definitely recommend taking this over 222 if you have some extra hours per week to spare on the PSETS, as they can be hard and time-consuming. But they are definitely worth it. ",

Professor Auel doesn't expect anyone to have prior experience with proof-based math, and thus, this is definitely a great course for students looking to pursue further advanced math but do not yet have any experience with proof-based math. You get plenty of practice with proofs on the psets, but the exams are mostly calculation based. ",

Professor Auel breaks down linear algebra into its fundamental components and really makes sure that you build a great mathematical foundation and understanding of the material. The content is very interesting as well and makes you think about math in many new ways.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Super long problem sets that make your hand hurt. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Auel is amazing. He put his heart into this class and made showing up every lecture at 9:00 a.m. worth it. His sense of humor is on point. He possesses the ability to explain concepts thoroughly yet concisely. I like his pedagogy make the problem sets difficult and long, but the quizzes and exams either conceptual-based or computational-based.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I don't think many people utilized the TFs, maybe because they weren't well advertised, or because they weren't off to a great start at the  beginning of the semester. But otherwise, I honestly don't have any complaints about the class. The material did seem to increase exponentially in difficulty in the second half of the semester (after spring break), but I think that's just the nature of linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0The course is brilliantly taught and so smoothly structured- Asher is always on top of everything, and ensures you have just the right amount of support you need to pick up the material. ",

            "\u00a0Can't think of any real weaknesses. Sometimes the PSETs were maybe a bit longer than they needed to be, but I learned a lot from them and my peers. Strengths were definitely all the support that was available, as the material can sometimes be tough to grasp at first encounter. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the amount of resources offered to students, albeit office hours, peer tutor hours, or TA sessions. The course was engaging and interesting and I felt like I learned and accomplished a lot at the end of the course. While there was a lot of homework, the class encouraged group work, which made the problem sets more manageable and fun. ",
            "\u00a0The course's main strength, apart from a giving a strong foundation in linear algebra, provides students with plenty of practice and experience in proof based math. The p-sets are not 2 or 3 hour long, but rather closer to around 10 or even 15 hours. This is definitely a course that you get out of it what you put into it -- by going to office hours and talking to the peer tutors, you can essentially get most of the answers for the p-sets. But I would say you learn a lot more and it is a lot more rewarding if you take the time to struggle through the material and the p-sets and get the experience of thinking about a problem for a long time and suddenly realizing the answer (sometimes at random moments). Professor Auel is incredible and has a very strong passion for linear algebra -- it really rubs off on the students. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was definitely the manner in which it cultivated a high level of appreciation for mathematics. Although there is a steep learning curve, you come out having learnt a lot and feeling incredibly fulfilled. The course was also highly focused on learning for the sake of learning and not grades. Thus, while the problem sets were rigorous, the exams themselves weren't too bad. The only weakness I found was the need for more peer tutors. The 2 peer tutors we had were always swamped during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a lot of work (expect 15-20 hour problem sets every week) but I found that this was a strength, because I understood the concepts well by the time I was finished with the assignments. Professor Auel is a clear and engaging lecturer, and very approachable if you want to ask questions. In terms of weaknesses, my only complaint is that the first few weeks can be difficult if you don't have prior experience writing proofs, and I didn't find the proof writing sections especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could benefit from a slightly easier introduction to proofs. We had just one \"proof writing\" session and that was it. Otherwise this course is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0A very interesting course, if you can withstand the workload ",
            "\u00a0Asher is a passionate teacher and his enthusiasm for the material is reflected not just in lectures but also in review sessions, problem sets and even the final exam. This is a great course not only to understand linear algebra, but also to get a taste of what being a math major might be like. I'd be hard-pressed to find many weaknesses - it doesn't cover some topics like SVD, and the final topics were slightly rushed, though there are probably reasons for that. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I took this class just for kicks (even though it was not a requirement for my major) because I wanted a stronger foundation in math, and I enjoyed it and feel like I have learned a lot. Definitely worth it if you're interested in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. Professor Auel is a great, engaging lecturer. Problem sets are long and difficult, but the logic of how to prove various statements becomes clear as you reread the text. Attending office hours helps a lot with the problem sets. Exams are computational (not proof-based) and very easy compared to the homework. They are made even easier by the fact that the homework ingrains the material in your brain.\r\n\r\nParticularly, if you are a chemistry major, physics major, or part of any other major that requires taking a course on quantum mechanics, take this course first, because quantum mechanics is all linear algebra. I took this course concurrently with Chem 333, which is 75% quantum mechanics; everything I learned in math 225, I learned in Chem 333 first, which made math 225 incredibly easy. Given the option, I would have taken math 225 sooner to make Chem 333 easier instead. ",

            "\u00a0YES, take this class over MATH 222. You build a much better understanding of linear algebra. You don't cover as many applications in MATH 225 (as the course titles suggest), but taking MATH 225 will allow you to learn any additional applications of linear algebra very easily and quickly. Asher Auel is also definitely one of the best MATH professors at Yale. This is a class you do not want to miss out on taking (even if you do it Cr/D/F, you will learn a lot)! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely 100%. While much harder than 222, I had actual fun going to lecture and learning new stuff, even though my section was at 9 am. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course if you want to understand how algebra works and want to build up your knowledge from the fundamentals. Asher is a great prof in terms of style and caring about how students learn. However, psets take 10-15 hours usually and dominated my Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Don't expect to go to Woads. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they're willing to put a lot of effort in, but it's worth it because the math is really gratifying and the course builds up your knowledge in a very satisfying way ",
            "\u00a0Five stars!!! Asher is the best professor I had this year at Yale. This class is absolutely fantastic BUT I will say you need to have enough time to take it  people aren't lying when they say the problem sets take 10-20 hours a week. Problem sets are generally released on Thursday or Friday. Each problem set contains around four questions, though be warned that one \"problem\" may consist of a list of problems. On Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday, I tried to get through one problem a day, first writing out a preliminary solution on paper and then typing my solution using Latex. (Pro tip: Latex is not required but it will change your life!) Then, on Tuesday afternoon, my best friend/suite mate (special shoutout here, you know who you are) and I would meet at Blue State to go over our problem sets, review concepts, ask each other questions, etc. COULD NOT RECOMMEND MORE. Please take this class with a friend (or make a new friend in class!) and hold each other accountable to this Tuesday meet-up. Truly a game-changer. I used Tuesday night and Wednesday to edit so that I wasn't stressed about the Thursday 9 am deadline, as I was in the morning section. Important note: you will hear horror stories about people who pulled all-nighters on Wednesday in the math lounge to finish psets. These people generally tend to have poor time management skills and/or too much on their plates to begin with. If you are a procrastinator, then you could end up in this late-night crew. I would say, though, that this IS avoidable! I took this class and still managed to get 8+ hours of sleep every night/live my best life, etc. Another word of advice: there are a ton of resources for getting help in this class  two fantastic peer tutors, two TAs, and, of course, Professor Auel himself. Don't be afraid! You can totally do it! I was a bit nervous about this class after struggling to get a B in Math 120, and I did so, so much better in this learning environment. If you are curious about math and like challenges/problem-solving, you belong in this class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I spent forever debating between MATH 222 and MATH 225, and in the end, I'm super glad I took the latter. I think people complain about Yale's STEM departments having professors that teach poorly, but Professor Auel is by no means in that constituency. He was absolutely stunning in every respect. And I developed a solid foundation in proof-based mathematics (it was my first time doing something like this I had taken MATH 120 previously). The sections were a little large, but that just speaks to how popular MATH 225 has become in the last few years. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Asher is a great professor- his lectures are energetic and well-thought out, he is so patient and good-natured, and has one smart brain that knows seemingly all there is to know. But what really makes this course special is the structure outside the class. Asher puts a great deal of thought into each lecture and homework assignment, and ensures that you really get the maximum out of the course.\r\n\r\nBe warned, however, that the course is a huge time drain- problem sets take between 12 and 20 hours a week, so do not jump into it blindly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  I would. It is a very intense course both in terms of workload and mental challenge. Overall, it was worth it because every assignment and lecture had a purpose and was efficient. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if theyre ready to work hard. Its not always glamorous, by far the hardest class Ive taken at Yale, both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of the workload. If you take it, find friends early whom you enjoy working (read: struggling, crying, screaming with joy when you finally get the answer) with. I dont know if many people can really succeed In this course as a pure loner, nor do I think it would be enjoyable even if one could. Take it over 222 if you care about the beauty of math, the rigor of proof writing, and understanding that surpasses computation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely recommend it over 222. I think few students regret taking this class. It definitely does not feel like a waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! While it was one of my most challenging courses at Yale so far, I felt like I learned a lot, my reasoning/logic skills improved, and I made a lot of friends. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, if they are willing to put in the time necessary and are interested in learning about proof-based math. If you don't need further math than linear algebra and have to prioritize other classes, I would recommend taking math 222 instead of this course. However, if you think you will be pursuing further, more advanced math, then I would definitely recommend taking this over math 222 -- this course will give you the experience necessary for future courses that require proofs, and it is much more likely that more advanced courses will expect that you have had previous experience with proofs. It is really rewarding if you put in the time and effort, but I wouldn't recommend it if you aren't willing or able to do so. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. If you love math, definitely take Asher's course at some point. He will restructure your perspective of math, and though you will be frustrated at times, you will come out of it having learnt a whole lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're studying math, physics, engineering, CS, economics, or any other quantitative field, you should be familiar with linear algebra, and this is the best way to learn it. Professor Auel is one of my favorite professors at Yale. The course is challenging, but there are resources available for help. If you put in the effort, you'll get so much out of 225-- not just linear algebra, but logical thinking as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you have a love for pure math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course by all means if you're willing to try your hand at some proof-based math, want to get an intuitive understanding of linear algebra, and are willing to spare about 2 full days every week completing problem sets. Warning: This course will control your schedule. I routinely spent about 10-15 hours every week typing up solutions (though there were some people who somehow managed to do them in far lesser time). On the bright side, grading is very fair and you will be rewarded accordingly if you put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is better to take 225 than 222 because of learning the mindset of linear algebra. however it is much harder and time-consuming ",
