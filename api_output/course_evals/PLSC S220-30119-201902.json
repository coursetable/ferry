            "\u00a0Firstly, I study a general situation of women's representation in the US's office. We analyze the two types of representation, the influencing factors of women's underrepresentation in the office, female candidates or members of the government in other countries, etc. This knowledge helps me build up a general idea of gender study and the American political structure.\r\nSecondly, through the study, we use many statistical tools. These tools make political studies more reliable and exact. \r\nFinally, as a student who wants to study political science in Master degree in the future, I think this class makes me confirm my interest and study direction. The professor is really helpful and she gave me lots of suggestions both in my study and future plan. So I think this course is really meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about study design and the reasons we do not see gender parity in politics. Many of these reasons can also be transfered to other fields where women are underrepresented. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about data and statistical analysis and about international governing systems, in addition to a wealth of information about women in politics. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nFirstly, I think the materials we have learned in this course are really useful and clear. We could get through a general idea of gender study and lead us to think about the situation of women's groups in the world, especially in the United States.\r\nSecondly, the professor used a certain time to teach us the statistical tools which are used in the political study. I think it is really helpful!\r\nThirdly, almost every class we have a discussion which helps us share our ideas about the issues and discuss them. This is a really good way to figure out clearly about the knowledge and we could apply the theory with evidence from real life.\r\nFinally, we have set up a convenient communication tool, the slack, which help the contact among students and the professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think it is better for the professor to collect the topics of the next day so we could prepare a little bit before the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and learned a lot. I think because it was in the summer and we read a book a week sometimes it was difficult to write a reading response that put two pieces of writing in contrast to one another since they were fro the same author and about the same subject but it was certainly doable. Certain people in the class kept a focus on intersectionality which I really appreciated. We did a reading on it in the first week but they kept it tied into the discussions through out the course and i think this was really important but I'm not sure if that would have occurred depending on the composition of the calss. The professor did bring it in for sure but I really liked the explicit focus / insight that was brought in via discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful. Very well-organized, a variety of types of readings and assignments, an engaged and knowledgeable professor. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course.\r\nFirstly, for students who have the plan to study political science in the future, this course could offer you a general study of the US government, the election and campaign. At the same time, we could study the statistical tool which would be used in the political study. This helps us a lot to prepare the future study.\r\nSecondly, Yale's course involves the students from Yale, so you could study with these excellent people and discuss things and improve your study ability.\r\nThirdly, the professor pays a lot of attention to the students of the class, so the student could chat directly with the professor during the office hours and she is always glad to help the students with their questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was quite informative. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about politics, gender, representation, media, and more. The course was very comprehensive and full of both qualitative and quantitative data analysis that kept it interesting and informative. "
