With the first half of the course, we spent maybe at most two weeks doing review of some statistical concepts that might have been covered in an introductory statistics course and of some probability from 241. With the main content then, for the first half regarding parameter estimation, we covered the method of moments estimate (MME), maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), and Bayes estimates with prior and posterior distributions. Other important concepts with the first half were the Fisher information, bias and best unbiased in relation to variance, mean squared error (MSE), sufficiency, and asymptotic and exact distributions. Then, with the second half regarding hypothesis testing, we covered likelihood ratio tests, generalized likelihood ratio tests, Pearson's Chi-square goodness-of-fit test, z-tests, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression.

At times during the class it was hard to learn anything concrete as his thoughts were sometimes all over the place. I think if he was a little more organized in his thoughts and expression, especially on the board, it would increase class engagement and instill a greater incentive to learn the theory behind statistics.\r\n\r\nThe textbook for this class was exceptionally good as I learned a decent amount from it. I took this course, hoping and getting a good theoretical understanding of statistics, however I still feel like there was a lot of room to explore the theory behind the stats as we did a lot of application through R in the latter half of the course.

The course could have had more direction with statistical programming packages (i.e. tutorials on how to use them for students who have never used Minitab or R, more full example problems, etc.). I also wish that there were more problems like those in the last problem set, where we take the information we learned in the course and apply it to a problem to try and determine a model or line that best fits the data. I think that practice midterms would also have been helpful. ",

I think this could be addressed by following the book more closely. I don't think lecture should be a simple presentation of the book, but it would be nice if it aligned with the structure more closely. I also think there should be more office hours to help with problem sets. ",

The classroom in Mason Lab was not geared towards the size of the class (difficult to see blackboard) and Professor Barron tended to ramble and stand right in front of the board when he was writing. Overall, got a good sense of the material though. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: close to none. Weaknesses: terrible quality of lecture (when I went to the lectures they literally did not help at all with the psets and so I just stopped going to lecture. I was still just as confused when I sat down to the psets!), and terrible quality of textbook (making it near impossible to also just learn the content on your own). They say that you need no background in statistical computing, but objectively, having some knowledge of R would have helped on the last two psets. I think not having that skill made doing those last two psets much more difficult, especially during a difficult period in the semester. Also, PLEASE move the final (the \"second midterm\") so that it's actually DURING finals period, instead of the last Friday of the semester. That arrangement made it so much more difficult to actually review the second half of the semester, simply because there's so much going on during that last week and I did NOT have time to sit down and actually re-engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were not very clear, and I had a lot of trouble understanding the concepts taught in class - and the book also didn't really concepts very well. As a result, I had to rely a lot on online sources to study on my own. \r\n\r\nThere were also no practice exams, or any kind of practice questions other than the psets, which made it difficult to prepare for the exam and added a lot of stress to the class.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Knowledgeable instructor, instructive psets, fair tests, good level of work. \r\nWeaknesses: Lecture was sometimes hard to follow / disorganized. A lot of writing down formulae without understanding how they fit together or fit with the broader arc of the course. Not great coordination between lecture and textbook. No stats class should be at 9am. ",
            "\u00a0For me, the strengths of this course were the discussion sections - that's were I did most of my learning ! Lectures are ok but it is easy to drift away: Professor Barron likes to present many interesting topics, and sometimes goes on tangent so it is hard to keep track. In discussion section, we often focused on one topic and learned how to apply it concretely to the problems in our problem sets. The exams are fair. The psets take time but are not impossible. ",
            "\u00a0I thought lectures were not very organized and concepts were not explained well. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly sections as well as the peer tutor office hours were very helpful. I thought a more clear outline of the overarching themes during the lectures would have been helpful, as it was often challenging to understand the technical details of what was going on in the class without having a better framework. On the plus side, the exams were very fair and were a good reflection of students' understanding of the material. The problem sets were well conceived and helpful for grasping the main concepts as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs were super-helpful. The PSETS and exams were fair and straightforward.\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes confusing, but usually talking to the TAs helped sort things out. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent combination of theory and calculation, including computational techniques. The course gradually transitioned towards R coding, computational analysis of datasets. Throughout, a strong grounding in probability distributions and statistical theory was used.\r\nImprovements: Maybe feature a final project? To make the connection between regression and the earlier topics crisper, maybe reimplement earlier psets using regression? The end of the course featured lots of linear algebra that we didn't have the homework to really practice fully. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was TERRIBLE. i am really sick of these math lectures where the professors dont know how to teach or explain anything. ",
            "\u00a0The materials are fundamental to lots of science things, so its a must.\r\n \r\nThe course is not well organized, so I have to read textbook to fully digest the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0There was not any online resources besides the textbook available. I wish there was online notes. ",
            "\u00a0The class was super disorganized. Prof Barron would just write randomly all over the board in no clear pattern and it was impossible to follow what was happening and also very difficult to read his handwriting on the chalkboard. The first half of the class was insanely difficult and the second half was easy but he taught them both as though they were very simple which was bizarre and confusing. The psets took forever and often were super tedious without actually teaching you anything. The textbook was also clearly too advanced and was unhelpful as well. \r\n\r\nThe tests were really easy but class does not prepare you for them. Studying the topics on your own was the only way to prepare or understand anything. You NEED a good study group- find this early on to work on the psets and study for the exams, this is the only way I learned in this class and made the lectures so much more bearable. \r\n\r\nTo improve the class, I think you would need a new textbook that actually included examples. The psets should be simplified so that the questions on there actually pertained to class material and helped you understand what was going on rather than confusing you further. Also, it was almost impossible to get help. There was 1-hour section on Mondays which was really good but that was literally the only time you could get help for the pset due Wednesday. The rest of the TAs had there office hours after the psets were due. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor is very knowledgeable about statistics, and clearly cares a great deal about the subject. He is always responsive and kind in responding to student questions.\r\nWeaknesses: although the professor has a very strong understanding of statistics himself, he struggles to convey that understanding to students. Lectures were disorganized, confusing, and hard to follow. The course did not follow the book very closely, and the book was more advanced than the class, which made it hard to use the book to supplement confusing lectures from class. After a couple weeks, the majority of people stopped attending lecture since it wasnt very helpful. The professor frequently veered off into topics beyond the scope of the course, at the expense of teaching material that we needed to learn and that people did not understand. The course could be improved by any, but preferably all, of the following: 1) select a new textbook at a more appropriate level for the class, 2) have the lecture more closely track the textbook, 3) do not spend so much class time discussing material beyond the scope of the course, 4) teach the material in a clearer and more understandable way, 5) do not assign problem sets due the week of exams or the week after spring break. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course in that, in having this course now under my belt, I feel so much more integrated in the statistical community, even if just at the beginning stages so far. I feel like I'm starting to understand some of the concepts overall, even though there is definitely room for improvement. I think the strengths of this course were the office hours with the people. I think that talking one-on-one with the professor is extremely helpful; Professor Barron is very knowledgeable and explains concepts at your pace if you talk with him during office hours. Just from lecture, it feels like the material goes above your head, but when you meet with the professor, you get to ask questions at your pace, and Professor Barron is really, really good at picking out what you don't understand or just explaining it more clearly. The same goes for the TFs. The TFs for this course were incredibly helpful, and their discussion sessions were really helpful with getting through the class. It would have been awesome if they could have had office hours or if there had just been more opportunities to talk to them. And the ULAs were incredible too. I just want to give a shout-out to Katherine Brumberg who is the best ULA. She is incredible; she was so, so helpful with going through concepts and making things more understandable. If we could get more help, I feel like I would have been able to leave this class with a much more thorough understanding of the material.\r\n\r\nWith the weaknesses of this course, what was really difficult was that, with the lectures, there seemed to just be this level of expectation that students should either already know a lot of the background and be able to know and do most of the things already or should be able to learn it all on their own and that the class was more about filling in the details with the nuances or the rigorous mathematical concepts behind the big-picture, higher-level ideas. However, I think that for me and some of the students, this class was the first serious statistics class we had, which made the level of this class really high. For students like us, the overall goals of the various concepts then were never spelled out; they just seemed to be assumed as things we would know or be able to easily pick up, so lecture ended up being extremely hard to follow. I felt like this class seemed more like a class for graduate students, but allowing undergraduate students to sit in, rather than a class that is a core requirement for the undergraduate major. I guess it makes sense, since the undergraduate program is relatively new, but it would be really nice for there to be some restructuring so that the class is more approachable for undergraduates. There definitely isn't a sense that this is an introductory class for the major. I guess, right now, the expectations are very high for this course, at least with the lectures, and it almost makes it feel exclusive like a weed-out class instead of open for students who want to learn, but who lack the exposure or background. It would just be wonderful if it could be made more approachable, at least with going more slowly with explaining some of the basics of statistics, explaining the big picture, and explaining how things fit together. I think, right now, the focus in the class really was in the nitty-gritty details, the nuances, and the math, but then, it would be difficult to go back and make the connections back to the overall idea. \r\n\r\nHaving more opportunities to receive help would be great. This might just be a suggestion for statistics classes and the whole department in general. Right now, I think the CS department does an incredible job with offering help and how they organize office hours and ULAs/TFs so that students can get help every day of the week. If there was a way to imitate that with the statistics department, that would be so incredible. It would really help students who want to put in the time and effort to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is how relatable it is to other statistics classes. However, some of the material doesn't seem overly important to know given the age of complicated statistical software that we live in. In addition, the material covered in class was often not in the book, which is great, except that all of the homework was from the textbook, so we were forced to learn from that as well. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was well taught and had a lot of resources available. Section was extremely helpful. However, the ULA's office hours were scheduled at extremely inconvenient times when virtually no one could attend which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course was alright, up until after MLEs. After that, the lectures stopped making any sense really. Professor Barron presented the material in a very roundabout and disorganized way. He spent a lot of time being pedantic about details like whether the null hypothesis should be on top in the likelihood ratio, without ever clearly presenting what the likelihood ratio was, or when you would use it. Barron is not the best lecturer and the quality really dropped off halfway through the semester, most people I know were super confused. We also started using Minitab which made things even more confusing because 1) no one uses minitab 2) he didnt bother to explain the test he was doing before he did it. \r\n\r\nIf Prof Barron prepared organized lecture notes and could stay on topic explaining the key concepts before going into tangents the class would be a lot better. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the content of the course. Toward the end, some of the regression topics seemed a bit repetitive. For example, we would do some derivations twice and while doing new derivations in between - if you hadn't reviewed the lecture notes, it was then hard to distinguish between what was new and what wasn't. On the whole though, this was a great course. I felt like the amount of homework was just right - it forced me to learn the material but didn't take up my entire week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Baron's sense of humor and openness to answering questions and helping his students.   Weaknesses: I wasn't a huge fan of the textbook, and lectures sometimes felt a bit disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course grade-wise and assignment-wise is fine, but the lectures and exams are way too specific. I felt as if I never grasped a true understanding of statistical theory before I have to use some specific application of it. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the psets and exams were fair. The lectures are much more theory based than either the problem sets or exams and can be very hard to follow. The textbook does not always go into theory either so the main source of theoretical understanding was the lectures, which is bad if you do not learn well in lectures. "

I found Prof. Barron's teaching style to be abrasive and disorienting, sometimes similar to the book and others entirely different. The 2 midterms were both pretty fair and the homeworks are difficult but doable. Just wished I'd gotten more out of the time I spent in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course material is important for further studies of statistics, but expect to do a lot of self-studying apart from lecture because going to lecture really isn't that helpful.

This course is fairly dull if you do not enjoy the thrill of statistics and the beauty of the math behind it, although we glossed over all the cool mathematical phenomenons that make stats possible.

Take this from someone who didn't attend class for the first half of semester then did so for the second half and noticed the incredible difference.\r\nOn another note, skim through the textbook before lecture - it will help.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants to explore more of the theory of statistics. If students are looking more for an introduction to statistics or direct practical application, they should probably take a different class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who needs to take it. If you do not have to, take something else. Also, make sure you know R/Matlab/Minitab. The material is good but suffering through the lectures makes this a hard class to take for fun. Perhaps just read the textbook if interested in the subject matter? It is as if this was a linear algebra class that does not know whether it is 225 or 222. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend the course. It seems there are better statistics options. This one is kind of poorly organized and taught. But if it's required, pay full attention in class and you will learn something. You can definitely get a lot out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Needed for stats major, background knowledge is useful. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I feel neutral about this course. The S&DS requires it for a B.S., however, so I guess in that case you don't really have a choice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is necessary if you want to do anything related to data. ",
            "\u00a0No, very poorly taught. No engaging lectures, and PSETs on material we learn after due date of psets. ",
            "\u00a0I've been thinking about this question for a long time and literally still have no idea. If you're dead set on doing the S&DS BS, you might want to just bite the bullet and tough it out on this one, like I did. If you're not, you might be better off taking another S&DS course and then coming back to 242 later on in your Yale career, at which point you'll have more background anyways. This course is flat out terrible and really not worth taking for the content you learn, so literally the only benefit is doing it for the BS. The second half, hypothesis testing, is covered entirely in other S&DS courses at Yale, and the first half, parameter estimation (maximum likelihood, method of moments, Delta method, Bayesian) is stuff you could probably learn independently. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this class if you absolutely need to - there are a lot of other statistics classes that are more engaging and would teach you similar concepts. Having said that, if you are able to self-study very well, the class is pretty managable. ",
            "\u00a0Only really if you have to take it... workload is large ",
            "\u00a0With reservations. It's not interesting enough to take it for itself; it should be a bridge to another class or to something practical. If I look back, I do feel like I gained skills that could be really helpful in research, but also that I only  understood or  internalized what we were doing and I'm afraid I'll have forgotten a lot of it by the end of the summer. ",
            "\u00a0I was extremely worried before taking this course because of the previous reviews, but let me tell you: it is not as bad as people say it is ! Ok, maybe the textbook is not the best and Professor Barron is not the most organized lecturer but I could tell he was making efforts. Also, he is extremely passionate about his subject and genuinely wants students to understand the concepts. The TFs were super helpful too (Molly & Dylan) - go to their discussion section for help with homework. If you put in the effort, you will learn and the tests are faire so you can definitely do well. This is not a \"trick\" class. You just have to stay engaged with the material and it will pay off. ",
            "\u00a0Not really ",
            "\u00a0Overall a solid course. I walked out feeling like I had a workable grasp of the concepts and that I could apply them to a variety of situations. Definitely try to take it with a few friends, or find some pset buddies in the class. That was a huge help and made a world of a difference throughout the semester and in studying for exams. The exams themselves are very fair, and you're allowed to bring in a cheat sheet which is great. Homework is weighted 40% which may seem like a lot, but was a nice buffer in case the exams didn't go as well as you'd hoped. Definitely read the textbook. Barron's lectures can be a bit meandering and not super clear, but the textbook, while dry, helps get the main concepts. The peer tutor office hours were also a hidden gem so take advantage of those for sure. ",
            "\u00a0this class is not well taught. Don't take it if you don't absolutely have to. Homework can sometimes be super tedious and frustrating. If you absolutely need to take it for your major  really no need in going to lectures but absolutely critical to find a study group. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you have a basic background in probability theory. If you're majoring in STEM or a quantitative social science, you really ought to take this over the 100 level courses. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Barron is a very clear lecturer who draws connections and moves at a good pace. The textbook is wonderful and the selected problems really solidify intuitions. The work given is appropriately challenging and enough to really make you learn it. Great overall course design. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless required. Was a terrible introduction to stat and Barron is not great. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to, take it. \r\n\r\nIf you dont have to but want to know what happens when you type, say, t.test() in R, like me, you should take it too. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, dont take it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are studying anything that requires statistic testing, then I highly recommend this course (particularly in conjunction with a more applicative class like S&DS 230) to understand the theory of statistic testing and how to use them. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class if it is not required. While the material is interesting, it is horribly taught and it's really unclear what is being taught at any given time due to the terrible organization. ",
            "\u00a0The material taught in this course is very important for understanding statistics, and its not at all a repeat of AP Stat. But there is a hard problem set every week, and to learn the material to do the problem set you need to go to class (not helpful, since lecture is very confusing and often veers off into more advanced material), read the textbook (sometimes helpful since the problems are from there, but not too good), or go to the optional section with the TAs (quite helpful). This combination of hard problem sets + no good way to learn the material unless you can make the sections makes the class really time-consuming and frustrating. I didnt enjoy the course, and it could have been taught much better, but I am at least happy I (sort of) learned the material. I only recommend it if you really want a class to teach you this material. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because, even after all of the difficulties of the class, you leave the class with a much better grasp of statistics and what it entails. I feel so much more ready to move forward with statistics having taken this class, and I really enjoyed this class overall. I thought the material was extremely interesting. I think you just have to understand that to get to the point of understanding it, there will be difficulties because this class is difficult and challenging, but definitely worth it. You can do it! ",
            "\u00a0Only take this if you have to for a major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course, I think its super important info to know. The course is pretty well taught and definitely manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Depends  if you want to go to grad school for stats / math, then you should definitely take this course. If youre looking to learn how to use statistical tests on data and practice with R or something, then this class probably isnt for you. \r\n\r\nIts not exceptional, but not awful. The material covered is relevant for future statistics courses, and at times the mathematical theory behind it made sense. The class mostly gave me a way of thinking statistically, and key paradigms like finding maximum likelihood and testing hypothesis at a significance level. It started making sense the final review session, when Prof. Barron actually explained how these frameworks influence a lot of statistical tests, before everything was super confusing. Prof. Barron definitely understands statistics well but doesnt seem to understand/care too much whether students are really learning. I mostly learned from the book and after MLEs the lectures were generally disorganized and not wroth going to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would totally recommend this course! This is the first statistics course that has made me feel like I truly understand statistics and probability theory. It is really cool to know the mathematical background between the different hypothesis tests (e.g. chi-squared test, t-test, z-test) and how they are different. This course can be a lot of work at times, but it is definitely one of the more eye-opening classes I have taken at Yale. Take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you're studying anything related to statistics I found it rewarding to understand the theoretical foundations of things like regression and parameter estimation that seem to be taken for granted in more higher level or practical stats classes. The class does take some work I found it pretty important to read the textbook to do the homework problems since the lectures didn't cover everything that the problems asked, and it also always took some time after class to decipher my notes from lecture and understand what was going on (Professor Baron is kind and willing to help his students, but his lectures are sometimes disorganized and a little hard to follow). In the end though, it was a pretty rewarding class. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if you have to. The lectures are only helpful for the exams and the exam questions are pretty specific. Did not feel like I had a good understanding of the general theory of statistics. Workload is fine, about five hours a week for me. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the people who take 242 need it for their major. However, if you will use statistics in your work (the sciences and social sciences for example) you should consider taking 242 over the statistics course offered by your department because you will understand the mathematical foundations of statistics much better instead of viewing statistics formulaically. Also, if you took 238 instead of 241, I would highly recommend reading a lot of probability theory before taking the course (though taking 241 first would be ideal). "
