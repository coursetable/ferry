            "\u00a0I learned first and foremost to always be critical. If you think you are doing something perfectly and with no one to change or challenge the way you are thinking, you are definitely doing something wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I've learnt to think critically about many concepts/subjects that I never had thought to question before - development, technology, science as a discipline, tourism etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduced me to thinking critically about the practice and logic of development. I learned to problematize development as a field, as well as particular development projects. We also explored the entanglement of science and masculinity and put this in conversation with development work. Overall this course provided me with new lenses with which to think about the impact of development work. It also equipped me with tools to conduct my own post-colonial and feminist critically analyses beyond the context of development. ",
            "\u00a0Great in developing a critical perspective on development and a more international understanding of WGSS literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically analyze NGOs, the state, and the structures that mediate our understanding of poverty, aid, and international development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the assumptions embedded in development that and developed a language with which to critique development. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly improved understanding of the field of development, learning is applicable to all aspects of my life ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to various theories on post-colonialism, gender, development, and anthropology. I enjoyed being able to apply this knowledge to real situations and current global affairs. I learned how to analyze and critique current development practices. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me words and concepts to describe patterns/phenomena that I had started to notice but had been unable to articulate. In doing so, it helped me evaluate development, gender, and international relations much more critically. I felt as if I left every class with at least one new major insight, and I found the readings very relevant and instructive. I am much more prepared to analyze and participate in discussions of development, and I think this put me on the right track to help with feminist and egalitarian interventions in the development discourse. Additionally, I felt that I gained transferable insights and skills in the class that have given additional meaning/value to other classes I have taken or that have allowed me to see the world, particularly the social and economic situation, more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0All about the history of international development as it relates to gender and tech. Very comprehensive ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the content of this class was very new for me - I tend to steer clear of anything having to do with technology and development because I understood it (before this class) in very specific ways. This class broadened my understanding of technology and development in such a way that now I am constantly running into examples of it in my daily life. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding of the various critical lenses on development and how to apply them to popular and powerful discursive frameworks. This class should be a requirement for anyone who claims to be interested in development, international affairs, or global health. "

            "\u00a0I loved when we broke out into groups and were able to discuss and digest the readings in a smaller setting. \r\nI would like there to be more discussions with scholars in the field about their own research. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Grewal & Deepti clearly know a lot, and do their utmost best to include everyone and give everyone opportunity to speak in class. They are also always available by office hours and responsive to email. The concepts we learn in class are fascinating and the discussion generated can upend your way of viewing the world (if you are able to follow the conversation). Also very manageable workload. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Coming into this class as a non-WGSS major/someone with no prior experience in technology or development studies was difficult. It was intimidating to speak as everyone else seemed to know a lot more about/have relevant experience concerning these topics. The seminar felt too long (2 hours), and it sometimes felt like there was no structure to the class. I know that this was in part intentional, as the professors asked interesting questions and let the discussion go where students took it, but I often came out of each class not really understanding what the key takeaways I had to know from each reading. I also felt like the course as a whole could have been better structured - we jumped around from one topic to the next (e.g. empowerment to global health to gender & Malthusian theory), without a strong foundation of concepts to tie to each class. Also, I would have appreciated hearing back about my midterm assignment before the credit/D deadline, and I never received official feedback about my final paper proposal. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chatti and Professor Grewal were the core strengths of this course. The two professors were always really well prepared, and they complemented each other very well in discussions. I always found our discussions rich and insightful, with the professors guiding the discussion an appropriate amount. It was great to see that they were so encouraging of students bringing in insights from other courses and contexts, and often managed to incorporate them seamlessly. I also think the assignments, in particular the first one, were well designed, as they asked us to practice the methods and insights we had learned in class. So often in Yale courses the assignments are a write whatever you want, so I really appreciated the assignments' embodiment of particular learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nI would say one weakness may have been submitting the weekly reading responses after the section. While it did help us digest material, I thought that the fact that we effectively returned to discuss last week's material at the beginning of every class made the rest of the class flow less well. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussion, engaging professors and very interesting content. At times the interdisciplinary backgrounds of students in the course (especially the STEM majors trying to get a SO credit out of the way) made our discussion feel pulled in too many directions at once to be as productive as it could be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing instructors who really know how to lead a discussion! Work load is perfect. I think the course got a little repetitive in the middle and could have been better if we talked about so more recent technology developments, like the idea of economic development through FinTech or companies like Samasource. ",
            "\u00a0Professors were incredible, amazing reading and discussions ",
            "\u00a0Though the discussion was fruitful and useful to suggest differing opinions, it could often be dominated and repetitive. However otherwise, the class did a good job selecting various topics and readings and discussing them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely well-taught, excellent classroom environment/community, strong and relevant readings, well-structured for learning, intellectually challenging, meaningful, accessible professors. No notable weaknesses. One big strength was the structure - we wrote responses to the class and readings from the previous week each week. This meant that the class had incredible continuity which resulted in much more engaging discussion. Because one could reflect more and then share their thought in their response if they didn't get a chance in class, I think this encouraged students to say meaningful things in class and in the response (as opposed to rushing to say anything at all in both). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the balance between specifics and broad logics. Could have gone into more about alternative development ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: fantastic readings, good facilitation of discussion, engaging topics of discussion, good structure of the syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes repetitive discussion (although this was helpful for developing key takeaways for the course), could be slightly more applied rather than theoretical "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it stretched my thinking and forced me to question my own ideas in a productive way. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to say, and it depends on who you are/what you're looking to gain from the class. Personally, coming into this class as a non-WGSS major/someone with no prior experience in technology or development studies was difficult. It was intimidating to speak as everyone else seemed to know a lot more about/have relevant experience concerning these topics. The seminar felt a bit long (2 hours), and it sometimes felt like there was no structure to the class.

I also felt like the course as a whole could have been better structured - we jumped around from one topic to the next (e.g. empowerment to global health to gender & Malthusian theory), without a strong foundation of concepts to tie to each class. Then again, my perception of this could very well be because I was not well-versed enough in the content to make connections between classes.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Professor Grewal & Deepti are great professors who know a ton, and do their utmost best to include everyone and give everyone opportunity to speak in class. The concepts we learn in class are fascinating and the discussion generated can upend your way of viewing the world. There are some things that I see different now (e.g. development, the premium we place on science) that could be attributed to this class. If you're someone who is well-versed in these topics, this could be an interesting class for you, albeit not the most organized. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I hope that future iterations of this course are taught, and that many Yale students get the chance to take it. It brings a critical lens to a topic of vast global importance. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professors Grewal and Chatti are fantastic and the content you will familiarize yourself with will be beyond useful in future courses and in understanding the NGO boom. ",
            "\u00a0I would! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. If you have any interest in development, NGOs or technology, this course gives you a much better perspective. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0In a year of really good classes, it was the best. I would recommend this class to any student, but I would especially recommend it to students who feel like the classes in their major are not critical/constructive enough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Crucial info to understand how NGOS reiterate neoliberalism ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class to another person. It's very exciting to be doing work that is so timely and important to many of our career paths and academic pursuits. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Again, this class should be a requirement for anyone who claims to be interested in development, international affairs, or global health. The critical perspectives you gain are so so important for being able to approaches these fields ethically and with at least an awareness of the potential (neo)colonial implications of the work. Even if the course material itself is sometimes lacking in the applied elements, this class is still so necessary for anyone who wants to do that more applied work. "
