            "\u00a0Learned a lot about white women and Asian women's history spanning over centuries. I learned about a range of things whether it be about family, work, or feminism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about analyzing historical documents and pulling out common themes from theme. This course is definitely not just for WGSS or HIST majors. It provides an important lens to understand the world through, and to understand what's been written out of history. As a woman, I loved being able to understand more about intersectional female perspectives in world history. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely ADORED this course. I had never been incredibly interested in history but this class opened my eyes to the beauty of studying the past. I was able to hear, read about, and discuss an abundance of different perspectives, ideas, and issues from readings, my professor, and my classmates. I felt that I was always actively learning not only about women's history but about myself and my identity. It was truly a wonderful and priceless experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that popular opinion of a movement or entity at a certain time must be taken into account when developing ideas of that movement or entity. I developed my researching skills. I learned a lot about women's struggles in different parts of the world and about how the same social movement may have entirely different meanings in different cultures. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to understand the roles of women throughout history and the evolution of cultures around the world. I refined my writing skills and engaged in valuable classroom discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the overarching themes of women's history, such as how indigenous women in colonized countries often act as intermediaries. I also learned how to utilize all of the resources Yale has to offer for research, as well as how to analyze artwork and historical artifacts. ",
            "\u00a0I certainly developed my academic essay writing skills. Our final research paper was a great way to introduce us to historical research making and essay writing and I learned a lot as I was writing it. ",
            "\u00a0This course forced me to look at feminism critically. ",
            "\u00a0I gained important skills for studying history such as comparing between different regions or different time periods or both. I also learned plenty about womens history and its major trends. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about women's history in different cultures throughout the world.  I think this course also improved my writing a lot - it brought me up to a college level of writing history papers. ",
            "\u00a0-Gained knowledge about women in different time periods and cultures around the world. \r\n-Learned how to think more in depth about feminist issues and global feminisms ",
            "\u00a0So much! I learned so much about women over time, specifically about gender constructs and how they've both changed and stayed the same. "

            "\u00a0Strengths were in some of the topics that we covered in the class, such as feminism and the shift in the type of work that women did going from the household to outside the household. The weaknesses was the lack of African or African-American readings on women. The discussions also always seemed to go back to white women or they would go off topic for a while. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Bi-weekly readings were always engaging in subject and Professor Tannenbaum is very knowledgable about their context. The class is mostly discussion based, so often it is up to you about actually reading the works, but keep in mind that if you don't then you will have little substantial observations to contribute to class discussions. \r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes readings seemed to be a bit long and included extraneous information. Also class discussions sometimes went on tangents. ",
            "\u00a0It is hard to have discussion when the table is shaped like a long rectangle. A more circular table would be more conducive to proper discussion.\r\n\r\nI wish the professor could give more detailed responses when she grades our papers, because otherwise I'm not exactly sure how to improve my writing since she leaves so few comments. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel that there were any weaknesses in this course. Its strengths were the high level of student engagement, the enthusiasm of the professor, the class size, and the format of the class. I loved that each class we discussed a different topic in women's history and compared it across cultures and across time periods. We were always allowed to bring in our own experience as well. And, being such a diverse group of students, this was the most impactful part. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot and I am very happy that I took it. Sometimes it was hard to complete all the readings. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course was the field trips, which really helped to bring our class discussions to light. I also loved our discussions; however, I felt like sometimes we strayed so far from the theme of the day that I got confused as to what exactly the theme or idea was. I think one way to solve this without stopping productive and interesting conversations is by taking the last few minutes of class to have a concrete review session of what exactly we were supposed to take from the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I think a big strength was the diversity of the articles and other resources we have studied. They covered a wide geographical range, a long time period as., and different mediums from sculptures to poems.\r\nI really appreciated the fact that our class participation grade was based on our regular reading responses rather than in class discussion participation, which can be challenging for introverts. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated comparing histories of women; however, I wish the Middle East region was talked about more. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a very good job of covering women's history through many different viewpoints.  We learned about different cultures, different time periods, and different issues in women's history.\r\nI think a little more help with writing throughout the course may have been helpful (such as submitting a first draft of a paper, getting feedback, and then submitting a final draft).\r\nOne other weakness of the course (which is mostly just due to the fact that we are at Yale) is that there were not many different opinions in the class.  I think it would have been nice to have a little more dialogue and different opinions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: wide variety of readings from around the world, interesting subunits, helpful feedback on essays, loved the field trips\r\nWeaknesses: very little variation in the class structurealmost exclusively discussions. Made it hard to engage sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were dynamic class discussions (facilitated well), engaging course readings/topics, insightful class trips, and Professor T.'s genuine investment in our work. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in the history of white and Asian women then yes this course had a lot of good readings on that. Also to just learn about changes for women in society this class also helps you understand how certain movements and norms came about. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. It is a fantastic course with interesting readings, and I think there's something in it for everyone. A perfect first year seminar and I encourage others to try it out as a great introduction to Yale seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in women and gender studies, you can read about many interesting stories throughout times and cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this course to anyone and everyone. Whether you are a prospective STEM major or WGSS major, you will benefit from taking this class. It allows you to explore the complexity of gender constructs and apply your own experience and opinions all while hearing from your peers and gaining a greater understanding of how gender roles have and continue to impact all people. It is just wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is familiar with or eager to analyze texts. I would highly recommend it to students who haven't had a lot of exposure to women's history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I learned so much not only about women's history, but also about how to think, research, and write like a historian. The discussions were fascinating, and Professor Tannenbaum was so helpful and accessible for our assignments. The only thing I would warn about is that there are a lot of readings, but then again, I'm a STEM major, so that might not be as time-consuming or stressful for more humanities-minded people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not only was the content interesting, but the discussions are great ways to challenge your opinions and expose yourself to new ideas. Take it with Professor Tannenbaum if you can! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100% especially if you have any interested about womens histories/issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student.  I think it is a great course to take first semester - it introduced me to a seminar-style college class and to college-level writing, and was also just a very interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is an interesting class and a great way to meet interesting people. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you're looking to learn about women and the emergence of feminismwhether you're guy or girltake this course! "
