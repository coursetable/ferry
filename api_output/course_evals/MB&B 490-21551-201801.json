Now, having researched and written about it for months, I can confidently discuss my topic and research surrounding it with individuals in the field. I feel this will be a useful skill moving forward, as becoming familiar with a new body of research is important whenever one is starting a new lab project. ",

            "\u00a0I thought this course was nearly perfect. The deadlines were reasonable, and I'm very happy we were required to turn in a \"final\" draft early in the semester. This made the editing process at the end of the year much easier, and took a lot of stress out of the last few weeks of school. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are that students are given a large amount of freedom, but this comes with the drawback that there is a lack of structure, and the reports only get a single rough draft rather than several, which is scary. "

            "\u00a0One of the best things about MB&B is that it has a relatively low-key senior requirement! While your friends in other majors will be spending the whole year stressing about their theses, the workload for the MB&B senior project is not significant at all (write a <4000 word literature review and prepare a 15 minute presentation on it). ",
            "\u00a0Obviously this a required course for MB&B, but it's a great way to end your time in the major. Being divided into small groups is also a fun way to meet or reconnect with other MB&B people who you might not have seen very often before. The requirements of the course are fairly low-stress as well. As long as you keep your deadlines in mind (and don't put things off until the last minute) it's all very reasonable to accomplish. ",
