            "\u00a0Strengths - Schmertzler is definitely a very experienced and knowledgeable professor. He knows his stuff. The readings are also pretty good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - very little transparency on grading. Another issue is that although Schmertzler is clearly a very knowledgeable professor, he creates an atmosphere of condescending humor. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Good instructor who is an industry veteran. Extremely detailed book.\r\n\r\nWeakness: course is highly dependent on the knowledge level of people you take the class with and thus experiences can differ. If the class appears disengaged/disinterested in completing reading assignments instructor spends too much time quizzing people to make sure readings are done. Little individual feedback is provided.\r\n\r\nThis class could use a few TAs who are domain experts e.g. in legal drafting, financial modeling to give feedback on student built models. The instructor claims difficulty in finding such TAs, however opening the class to juniors to recruit potential ULA for the next year could be a good idea. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: super engaging professor, interesting topics, in-depth learning, active learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: little to no feedback on weekly assignments and work ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that this course is very practical, and we learned a lot of industry insights from Professor Schmertzler.\r\nThe weakness, if any, is the lack of organization and a proper way to track our performance throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A bit too much focus on the small details rather than the larger themes ",

            "\u00a0Overall, I would recommend this course if you are interested in any aspect of private equity - what private equity is, how the deal flow generally works. Also pretty decent way to increase financial fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0Good course for at least as a intro to corporate finance.\r\n\r\nYou can spend as much time as you wish and learn as much as you want. Thus despite the workload seemingly extremely challenging, in reality it is not really the case ",
            "\u00a0Super in-depth class on private equity that you really just won't find anywhere else on this campus -- Schmertzler is also amazing and is genuinely out there to both push you and help you learn\r\n\r\nTake it!! :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are planning to go into finance. This course goes through many real cases and gives us a good sense of what real private equity transaction is like. However, the reading is sometimes dry, and the modeling part would be challenging if you have never done a finance internship before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course, especially if you really want to learn about private equity investing systematically and practice your modeling skills in different scenarios. Definitely not an introduction course if you don't have proper foundations, though. The course load is quite demanding, so balance your schedule carefully if you choose to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend for any student wanting to learn more about private equity investing ",
            "\u00a0No unless you have accumulated certain finance/PE knowledge\r\nI thought I have certain finance exposure but it seems that the course requires more from the beginning ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for those interested in gaining exposure to private equity investing I would highly recommend this course. "
