            "\u00a0This course taught me so much. It allowed me to work with real clients, and create a product that is both useful in the real world, and is something that I am proud to add to my CV. \r\n\r\nI think this course could benefit from more structure around the fieldwork component. It might be helpful to set aside weekends in the syllabus that are built around conducting inventories at our field sites. One of the most challenging pieces of this class is finding time to conduct the inventory while making time for other courses, and personal life. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the extensive field experience students get, which is supported every step of the way by Dr. Ashton and the course's TF, who are both phenomenal resources. The experience of assembling and presenting a plan to a client is also a very useful experience. \r\nThe primary challenge of the course structure is getting started with data collection soon enough - due to the distance of field sites from New Haven, difficulty of coordinating schedules, and time required to impart baseline knowledge at the start of the semester, most groups did not finish sampling until November, at which case some information, such as herbaceous plant populations, are no longer visible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - all the content is there. Weaknesses - some of the lectures could be condensed. Timeline for completing different steps would be helpful, as all this info is in Professor Ashton's brain. Hard to see the \"forest\" when you're in the trees, so the more that could be provided for helping students plan and manage their own time, the better. "

            "\u00a0If you want to do field work, intend to write or interact otherwise with management plants, or want to get a grounded, comprehensible introduction to basic field soil and geological assessment, take this course. I learned an enormous amount and had a terrific time. ",
