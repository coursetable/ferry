            "\u00a0Some of the materials we covered in class were a bit ambiguous and confusing, but that may just be the nature of epidemiology. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are definitely the class set up and emphasis on group work. I think one way it could be improved would be a little more guidance on how to use SPSS. ",
            "\u00a0This course was not taught in a manner than made much sense. I really enjoyed the first lecture. You need to have a section like space or maybe office hours or just formally teach SPSS. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Fun, engaging lectures alternated with case studies was a good way to keep the class going. Dr. White is a joy to learn from.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes material became monotonous; midterms were more difficult and detail-oriented than expected ",
            "\u00a0The class is super understanding about what is to be a student and provides a lot of flexibility. The material is also kept interesting by a lot of application scenarios and fun little tidbits of information. However, for someone inexperienced with stats, the class could sometimes move too fast and it was hard to reinforce knowledge on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. White is an engaging lecturer--funny, poised, and a joy to learn from. She mixed classes up by having lectures on Tuesdays and case studies on Thursdays. She relayed information/material in a casual, laid back manner that is so different from other Yale classes, making it a unique and ultimately more beneficial experience. The learning environment was highly encouraging and positive.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes case studies were too long or too short, and it could be easy to sit back and allow your group mates do most of the work-- don't do this! You won't learn and will be ill-prepared for the final! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - fun lectures, learned lots of SPSS, got the basics of epidemiology l, hands on\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - because half of the lectures are hands on, we dont get a very comprehensive introduction to epidemiology ",
            "\u00a0I liked the structure of alternating lectures and cases, as we learn the material and then get a chance to practice it. I also like that the course teaches us how to use SPSS but through cases, instead of just teaching us theoretical information on how to use it. I also liked that there were various types of assignments, ranging from problem sets and cases to tests and presentations. I felt that this showed us how the material could appear in different contexts and helped solidify concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the format of the course! It was set up so that it was very possible to succeed. I loved that we got to practice the concepts we learned rather than just memorizing lecture notes like in some classes. ",
            "\u00a0I liked having lecture on one day and the case studies on the other day. However, I didnt feel like we got a lot of direction in lecture about the things we would need to do for the psets. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is the largest strength of this course. Professor White is lovely, funny, kind, and very engaging. It is great that she is so invested in getting to know her students and make the class applicable to the work that they will likely do in the future. It was also really useful to learn how to use SPSS and analyze real data. However I would have liked to learn higher level SPSS data analysis skills, I felt that there was certainly room for this class to be more difficult in challenging us in the data analysis portion would be very useful. The lectures were also useful but I felt that given the level and competence of Yale undergrads the class could have been more challenging and we could have dove into more high level epidemiological approaches and topics. In some ways I felt that a lot of the material that we covered I already knew due to my previous exposure to statistics and public health and that the course could have been far more challenging. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course were a knowledgable teacher, interesting content, and good applications for many majors/jobs. I think it could've been improved by a little bit more structure. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lab portion of the class, however I think it could be more structured and with a class this large have more TAs to help out, sometimes the questions were a bit vague/open-ended which either  got us to justify our points or made people confused. Overall, the material was great and delivered well, one of the few lecture courses I felt comfortable speaking up in. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. White will forever be a strength of this course. The lectures can get a bit dull, but they are overshadowed by interactive case studies on Thursdays. ",
            "\u00a0I looked forward to class every week because the professor was perfectly suited for the course. The combination of lecture and SPSS applications/practicals each week made for a good combination. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly practicals were a plus. The lectures were a bit dry and difficult to grasp without independently reading the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amiable professor, the material isn't too difficult but it's really interesting, a good introduction to public health methods. \r\nWeaknesses: The statistics parts kind of assumes that you have knowledge of stats walking into the class, so it may be a bit difficult to wrap your head around some concepts, although definitely not impossible. ",
            "\u00a0I felt blindsided by the first midterm, and wish there had been practice tests. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like the course was a bit too big for the type of labs that we needed to do... it was hard at times for the TAs and Professor ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class come from the hands-on labs that emphasize analysis of real studies and real data. ",
            "\u00a0Marney is a very nice person and tried to make the class interesting. Although her philosophy of doing-to-learn makes sense, I think that this shouldve been introduced later in the course. Sometimes the directions on psets and in class were vague and made things more frustrating than necessary. \r\nAlthough some in class examples used smaller, easier to understand numbers and situations, others used really complex/real life numbers which made it that much harder to comprehend certain topics. In the future, I would recommend using easier example scenarios before delving into real life examples.\r\nThe time constraint on the final was unrealistic - creating the spot map alone took a really long time. Reading through the scientific articles took longer than the actual SPSS portion. In the future, having no time constraint or one less section may be a better option. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: loved the in-class studies, great coverage of topic material, good explanations of the statistics behind the work, course material constantly encourages critical thinking and analysis, great feedback throughout the semester\r\nWeaknesses: more practice with/explanation of SPSS might have been nice "

The material is interesting and not overwhelming, Professor White is great, and the class is engaging with varied assignments to keep things interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No. This course is not good. It is a waste of one of your credits and your time. If you have to take it, it will be boring and useless but not awful. \r\n\r\nThis class:\r\n\r\n1. Teaches you no useful skills. I don't feel like I've come away knowing how epidemiology - or even SPSS - works. Maybe have 5-10 more equations/definitions memorized, though.\r\n\r\n2. Is extremely disorganized and poorly structured. \r\n\r\nThe professor:\r\n\r\n3. Paternalizes students to the point that it detracts from other students' learning.\r\n\r\n4. Is just a bad lecturer. Goes through slides far too quickly, simply reads off of the powerpoint, speaks too quietly for back 1/4 of class to hear.\r\n\r\n5. Never seems to have time for students' questions. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, take it if you are interested in a broad overview of epidemiology and the field of public health. ",
            "\u00a0This class was overall great! Professor White is lovely, a great person to know, and is super passionate about the material. Learning SPSS is very useful and a lot of the topics we cover are quite interesting and applicable. This is also a fairly easy class with a very manageable/low workload that makes this a good fifth class. This class may be too basic for juniors or for those that have strong stats background. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would I really enjoyed it, but I wouldn't necessarily have taken it if I didn't have an interest in public health. It's more niche-focused, but you'd still enjoy it even if you didn't like public health. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good intro epidemiology class and prof white is super nice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was perfect for everyone! Professor White is absolutely amazing and her lectures are engaging and fun with her pop culture references. But we definitely learn a lot in this course. ",

            "\u00a0I would probably recommend this class to a student who had interest in the subject. I am not very interested in the subject (I took the class for a requirement) but it was fairly enjoyable and I feel that I am better able to read and interpret articles and studies about health concerns. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class (and the instructor) - you learn at a great pace with the opportunity to apply skills as you learn them to really solidify your knowledge. You will walk away from this class confident about epidemiology, proficient in STATA (which is the best program), and hating on mayonnaise (for good reason). I would recommend this class to everyone, even those who wouldn't consider epidemiology their cup of tea, as it helps you develop skills to critically evaluate the research of others as well as improve your own future research design/analysis. ",
            "\u00a0If the person is interested in epidemiology or enjoys math/statistics, I would recommend this course. As someone who wants to go into public health, I think that this course gave me some practical knowledge but overall I was not very enthusiastic about the content as the weeks went on. ",
