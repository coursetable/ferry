            "\u00a0I learned that know how = knowledge that. Course focused on what seemed to be a very niche problem but became a lens to examine a lot of other issues in analytic philosophy de se thought/the relation of semantics to metaphysics/the role of cognitive science in philosophy and vice versa/ and internalism in epistemology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a field of epistemology I knew literally nothing about and gained a better understanding of what it means to engage with contemporary philosophy. The course filled many holes in my knowledge of key epistemological concepts, and it expanded my concept of what philosophy today can do and does. I improved as a philosophical writer as well as a thinker. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I have a good handle on the know-how literature now. It's nice to feel this familiar with an issue. "

        [
            "\u00a0No complaints! All of the papers assigned were great. Might have been nice to have additional suggested readings with background on some of the background taken for granted in the papers. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a wonderful survey of recent work on skill in epistemology while giving students the flexibility to direct the course toward their areas of interest. I actually would've loved more reading some weeks, although I hugely appreciated the professors not piling on reading just for the sake of piling on reading. Class discussions were great. ",
            "\u00a0We need a syllabus. \r\n\r\nThe two halves of the course felt a little disconnected sometimes. (It's probably tricky to create a class unified when one of the professors is only here for part of the semester.) "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Very exciting to attack a particular problem with all the tools from the last 100 years of the philosophy of language and epistemology. The course is well structured for you to succeed. The only writing is a final term paper. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a great range of material, from fundamental reflections on the nature of conceptual thought to to technical linguistics to nitty-gritty neuroscience to general epistemology. This means that there will almost certainly be material that interests you, but you here will also probably be a few weeks you find dull. Prof. Stanley is great at leading the class to break down the material, and Ive never received so much personal attention in a philosophy courseStanley was accessible for meetings and usually ended them with reading suggestions addressing my questions and an invitation to meet again once I had read them. The only drawback was that seminar didnt often involve sustained debate. Stanley acts as more of a guide through the material than a discussion facilitator. Though this model has its own benefits, it is less fun than an intra-seminar debate. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Undergraduates should be aware that expectations for the term paper are graduate level, i.e., you're expected to advance a truly plausible objection or positive account that merits 20-25 pages, as opposed to undergraduate work that is more focused on reconstructions of arguments. \r\n\r\nI would highly recommend the course. It's rare to get to learn from the foremost scholars on a field as cutting-edge as this one, about that very field. ",
            "\u00a0No. The course was disorganized and kinda frustrating. "
