            "\u00a0It was a strong review of the material covered in PHYS 200, with greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0Good insight and conceptual basis for classical mechanics and thermodynamics. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the course was taught in an extremely interesting way, and that there was a well-implemented support system. All in all, a very good course. ",
            "\u00a0Very good course BECAUSE of the professor!!! ",

            "\u00a0This is a great class. I skipped the prerequisites and it was a perfectly manageable introduction to physics. I don't think this is as rigorous an introduction to mechanics as 410. Shankar gives the intuition behind things and gives a rough outline of the mathematics behind it. The class focuses on core concepts and the problem sets reflect it (they are not unnecessarily tedious). Take this with Shankar! He is amazing and enjoys explaining things to you. ",

            "\u00a0If Professor Shankar is teaching this course, I would absolutely recommend it. He is very clear in his teaching and an excellent lecturer. The way he introduces new topics is natural and intuitive. The course helps you get into how certain Physics concepts came about as well as calculations and applications of the results. ",
            "\u00a0yes! definitely ",
            "\u00a0A fantastic class that exposes you to some really interesting and useful ways to think about physics. Prof Shankars great! He makes the material accessible, and is also very willing to explain difficult concepts again if you ask questions. Some parts were hard to wrap my mind around, but it was a satisfying and enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Only to a student who needs his Physics requirement for a non-Physics major. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it if a student were looking for somewhat of a survey course in physics. If that's the case, it was a great class. "
