            "\u00a0Energy, momentum, concentration, heat transport. Visualizing the property profile along the axis. Fluid mechanics. Applying this transport profiles to research projects. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a good understanding of the foundations of transport phenomena, and I was able to see how this framework can be used to solve tangible problems. In addition, this course provided many opportunities to learn mathematical techniques which are widely applicable. ",
            "\u00a0The course required some background on ODE and PDE theory, so it was a nice application of many mathematical techniques learned in other courses. The course allowed us to develop a methodical approach to problem solving in fluid mechanics, and was successful in showing how progressively more complex cases stem from simpler ones, and how many different phenomena are related by a unified framework. "

        [
            "\u00a0Wanted a little more visualization and real-world-applications (e.g. programming, application to different real-world situations) ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the comprehensiveness with which the material was covered. In comparison to other courses, this one was more complete and thorough. Also, the lecture notes were an excellent resource which were more useful than typical textbooks. The problems that appeared in lectures, homework assignments, and exams were engaging and interesting. \r\n\r\nWhile I was very satisfied with the course, I would have benefited from exposure to some additional topics such as numerical solutions and non-Newtonian fluids. However, the foundation developed in this course has prepared me to explore these topics independently. ",
            "\u00a0The course goes into several connected topics. One way to improve it would be to maybe break the course into 2 parts, or give one extra class per week in order to have more room for each topic. But overall, the exams were well thought, so that they were completely feasible if one put effort in the homework assignments, the lecture notes for the course are amazingly detailed, so that one can in many cases forgo the use of the book.

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student provided that they were interested enough in the subject to dedicate the time and effort needed to succeed. While this course was more challenging than most, the effort is definitely rewarded, and I finished the course with the sense that I learned lots of useful material. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, the course is a great review of fluid mechanics at a high mathematical level. Probably the best class I had this semester "
