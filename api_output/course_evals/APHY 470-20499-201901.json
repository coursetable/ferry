            "\u00a0Monte Carlo methods, simulations, stochastic statistics ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of things. Most of the coursework is in problem sets (grade distribution: 70% problem sets, 15% test 1, 15% test 2). The problem sets were about 65% programming and 35% pencil-on-paper math. I took the opportunity to learn Python, but other people used Matlab or R. Some brave souls used C++. \r\n\r\nThe material itself was selected topics out of statistics: basics of statistics, characteristics of distributions, Central Limit Theorem, random walks, percolation, Markov chains, principal component analysis, stochastic differential equations (Wiener and Ito processes).\r\n\r\nI came into the course with no formal stats background but some incidental exposure through physics labs and statistical mechanics. I had intro programming experience, plus differential equations and linear algebra. I would say that background prepared me fine for the course. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a very technical, deep, and advanced tour of the use of statistical and computational methods used in the sciences-from biology to physics- and finance.  The topics included probability theory, theory of statistics, Markov matrices, random walks, Wiener processes, Self-avoiding walks, covariance, principal component analysis, and many others. The highlight of the course curriculum was the focus on monte carlo methods. No course at Yale gives this area as much attention as the class. Any student doing quantitative work will find the work in this class extremely useful in their careers wherever it takes them - which speaks to knowledge gained in this class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an incredible survey of so many useful statistical methods that other classes simply don't cover at Yale (Monte Carlo, Metropolis, etc) that goes in-depth into both mathematical theory and practical coding simulations. We covered everything that was on the syllabus, and all of it was incredibly interesting! "

            "\u00a0Sohrab was very nice and willing to engage with students. The lectures were sometimes a little hard to follow but the online notes were an excellent resource and more than enough to make up for other uncertainty ",
            "\u00a0Wow. The course is absolutely phenomenal. I think it could be improved by just giving Prof. Ismail-Beigi whatever he needs to do his thing. It's clear that he has more or less written the whole course -- there's no textbook for the class. I'm sure that given the freedom to expand it, he would include good topics. \r\n\r\nIt was great to have a small class environment (seven people or so). If it's bigger in the future, I worry that people would feel less free to ask questions. I would look at that. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredibly well-taught and organized for student learning. Despite its difficulty, it was very easy for students to spend quality time learning the material. Not a minute of the class is wasted. The only weakness of the class is perhaps that there is not enough time in the semester to learn all that it has to offer. Thankfully, the students who took the class are left with a corpus of information that they can reference. ",
            "\u00a0This class was nominally a lecture, but because there were just seven of us in the class by the midterm, it was functionally a seminar. This led to great interactions with the professor where we could ask a question at any time. It also led us to grow closer with study groups and by showing up to office hours. Sohrab typed up the notes in LaTeX after each class which were very clean and readable with minimal typos. The psets were very hard and long, but they took up a corresponding chunk of the total grade so that the effort definitely felt worth it and helped solidify the information (for us it was 70% psets, 15% midterm, 15% final). "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course -- it was one of the best classes I took at Yale. Sohrab is a very reasonable, enthusiastic, able teacher. It's clear he really enjoys the subject material. The subject material can be rather abstract, but Sohrab does a great job explaining it.\r\n\r\nI came into the course without having taken statistics. The only statistics I had picked up was incidental, mostly from physics (physics lab, statistical mechanics, whatever stats stuff happened to be in math classes). Sohrab did a great job walking us through basics and onto more advanced stuff. Having differential equations and linear algebra under your belt is pretty necessary, in my opinion, though there were some people who didn't have it. Some programming experience is also a must. Good languages to know are Python, R, or Matlab. \r\n\r\nStatistical methods was the greatest. You should definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to another student. Do not be discouraged by the workload rating of this class. The time spent on psets is unavoidable since half of the learning is done in the assignment and since the material is quite technical at times. In addition, the psets are very doable and sometimes even quite fun to do. Whether you are interested in quantitative finance or physics or biology, this class is a must-take. It's a shame more students are not taking it since the material is integral to so many fields of research and has a great deal of applications. Sohrab is an incredible professor and makes every day enjoyable and enriching. The class is also incredibly fair. The exams focus on your conceptual knowledge and leave the numerical work to the psets and in class. Any student who plans to do quantitative work in the future would be doing themselves a disservice by not taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, so long as Sohrab is teaching this class, it will be incredible. The things we learn are super interesting and applicable to many different applications. The coding we learn isn't supposed to be the cleanest coding, it's just intended to get the job done. If you want anything close to this with 'clean' code, you'd probably have to take a graduate level course that I don't think exists at Yale! "
