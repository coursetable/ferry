            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the social and cultural context of corporations. It's less about 'here's what an LLC is, here's how corporations are taxed' and more about how people interact with corporations. Special focus on corporate personhood and its history and interpretations is fascinating, as well. ",
            "\u00a0How to read anthropology theory and thoughts about historical and present corporations ",
            "\u00a0The Corporation was very representative of the liberal arts in that it taught me how to think. I appreciated the diverse academic viewpoints that Professor Rogers presented - from anthropology to history to political science - as they gave me a holistic view of corporations. Our sections were pretty useless, but I appreciated that each one of Professor Rogerss lectures had a clear theme that he let us come to our own conclusions about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read critical enthnographies and how to connect corporate labor practices and corporate phenomena to larger national and international trends of gendered and racialized labor hierarchies. I learned how a corporation runs from the bottom up and from the top down, and I learned both the history of this structure, how it's changed, and I've been given the tools to question why it has developed the way that it has. ",
            "\u00a0The Corporation taught me about how corporations work and how people experience them. Starting with an overview of the history of the corporate form, the course traced the development of corporations into the huge companies we see today. Through the course readings and lectures, I began to understand different modes of corporate sovereignty and personhood. Ultimately, I saw the way that corporations have developed over time and how changes in corporations impacted people (both inside and outside the corporation) differently, especially with respect to identity and personhood. I feel like I'm leaving the course with the understanding that the corporation is not a static form, and the knowledge that to understand the power of corporations in our culture, we have to see and respond to the particulars of each corporation. ",
            "\u00a0At multiple times during the semester, I walked out of class feeling a little woozy. Prof. Rogers had a talent for taking aspects of our everyday lives that we took for granted and showing us the way that corporations have worked to make them so. Made me much more aware of how the things in my life and in the US have come to be. Have walked away with tools to question and analyze. ",
            "\u00a0This course was successful in achieving its overall goal: acquainting students with the diverse forms that corporations have taken throughout history. The anthropological approach of this course was helpful, as it exposed students to many different methods of analyzing corporations. This class did an especially good job at honing analytical skills through case studies and ethnographies. The class not only acquainted students with useful insights, but also sharpened our tools of qualitative analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Anthropological thinking, basics of how to read and conduct ethnography, SO much about corporations, historically, ethnographically, and legally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many anecdotes about corporate organizations and I think I gained a better understanding generally about how corporations function in our society. The class taught me about how we interact with corporations and how they operate internally and outwardly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned why humans do what we do. I really had a different perspective on life I really enjoyed the class ",
            "\u00a0This  class taught me to think critically about history, the modern day, and how the world as we see it was molded. It taught me to consider the power of language and how we talk ahout what we talk about. It made me a better researcher, interviewer, and writer. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly helpful in making me more aware of the history and workings of corporations. I feel like I have gained a much better understanding of how they work, what their goals are, and how they have changed over time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write an ethnographic paper after conducting interviews. I also learned how to use the archives when analyzing primary source documents. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a good introduction to anthropology and the study of the corporation. I gained different viewpoints towards what a corporation is and how it has evolved over time. "

            "\u00a0Great intro course to thinking critically about corporations and corporate personhood. Some readings can be hard to approach but Rogers does a good job preparing you for them and making them reasonably accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I wasn't really sure where a lecture was going, or I'd feel lost during the lecture, or I wasn't really sure what the overarching takeaway should be, or I wasn't really sure how disparate pieces fit together. I think providing more structure and direction during the lectures might be good. \r\n\r\nProfessor Douglas is really great though, as a person and as a lecturer, and the readings were pretty consistently great. ",
            "\u00a0As I mentioned above, I wish that sections had more of an aim to them. We just kind of sat around talking - yes about the material - but not in a structured or exciting way. It didnt seem as though they had a broader goal other than oh lets just have them discuss the readings this week. Of course, thats what section is for, but it wasnt interesting, and I got few takeaways. ",
            "\u00a0The course follows a fascinating history of the corporation and focuses largely on the more modern developments of the corporate form. The concepts are accessible and grounded and the readings are diversely challenging, but can be filled with jargon. The lectures are engaging, the slides are appropriately wordy, and Professor Rogers is a clear and loud speaker. Section is necessary to fully understand the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are Doug Rogers's lectures and the assigned course readings. Rogers shows a real understanding of the topic, and he engages with the complex material in a way that makes it easier to understand. The weakness of this course is its discussion section. I never left a discussion section feeling like I better understood the material, and often I left feeling quite confused. I think the course would be better if the discussion section was removed altogether. ",
            "\u00a0The readings can be quite lengthy and about half of it is fairly theoretical and anthro-lingo heavy for an entry-level class. Rogers did an amazing job of helping us pull out the nuggets that we needed from each one, however. We got great feedback re: essays and the midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was great and had many strengths. Professor Rogers is an excellent instructor, with superb dedication to both the material and his students. His personal engagement with the course helped motivate students to take the material more seriously. The main strength of the course was exposing students to different notions of incorporation and introducing basic modes of anthropological work.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, a few main weaknesses to address. First, there was simply too much reading assigned each week (between the two classes). The course worked too much as a survey, and seemed like an unsatisfying dance through many concepts and readings each week. We spent a lot of time cramming in new material and perspectives without setting aside time to synthesize all of the things we had learned. I certainly learned many interesting facts and insights about corporations from the course, but I don't know if I've come away with many coherent takeaways. I think the course can be more thematically tight and less spread out along so many lecture topics. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures frame things masterfully, synthesizing the interesting, but sometimes dense readings into narratives that are both simply presented and analytically complex.  Both assignments -- short papers -- were very well designed. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a very well organized and thought out course. I found both writing assignments to be particularly engaging and fascinating and I think they were a major strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0He is great at showing what we are learneing and lecturing. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching was absolutely incredible; the lectures were well thought out and clear, and presented beautifully. I think the readings could be improved a bit but overall they were engaging and I liked that they were woven into the lectures. The assignments were very interesting and really unique and creative. ",
            "\u00a0I legitimately cannot think of a weakness. The class was a perfect challenge, extremely engaging lectures, interesting readings, and interesting, challenging writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was an excellent course, however it is not just an anthropology class. It covers so  much more and should be listed as such. This class was great at providing an overview of so many aspects of corporations in the past and present, however I think it would have been more helpful if it were a little more engaging on a weekly basis. I felt that I never fully understood concepts until the end of the course when everything came together. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this class is how carefully it was crafted. Rogers's smart lectures and the stimulating readings progressed in an order that made sense and felt cumulative--in other words, by the end I felt like I could see the corporate forest for the trees--which is not always the case in the social sciences. The midterm and the final were reasonable but demanded thoughtful & synthetic reconsideration of the class material. As a result, I feel like I won't soon forget what I learned. The two papers were the highlights of the course. We got to conduct original research with documents in Haas, and carry out a mini-ethnography of a corporation (which entailed 2 interviews and background research). They were fun and creative, while still pedagogically useful.\r\n\r\nOther strengths: Corporate Sovereignty, the de facto textbook of the course, started out dry but became very interesting; the deep dive into the metaphor of corporate personhood, probably the most lasting theme of the course for me personally; the combination of historical, journalistic, and anthropological articles really helped me understand the discipline of anthropology (which I had never encountered before) as a distinct field.\r\n\r\nThere weren't any egregious weaknesses. I will say that our section discussions varied in quality, as I and others often struggled to complete all the reading, but I'm not sure that's the fault of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting, yet they were also very challenging at times. Sections were awful because it was always apparent when individuals struggled with the reading or just didn't do it. I really enjoyed Professor Rogers' lectures. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you're interested in the world of business -- the anthropological/social/cultural perspective is wonderful and different from your typical quantitative econ classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0It's a good class. Sometimes I felt like I'd get lost in the lectures and wasn't really sure how different pieces fit together. I'm still not 100% sure what the overall takeaway from the class is, but that might honestly just be because I'm dumb. Professor Rogers is great though, and the readings are really interesting. PSA: coming from someone who usually doesn't do the readings for their classes, do the readings, lol, the midterm and final are based off the readings. The two paper assignments, especially the first one with the images, were really cool and fun to do.  Also, be aware this is an anthro and not an econ or history class. ",
            "\u00a0The Corporation is interdisciplinary, and its a broad survey of the topic across centuries. The assignments are cool, the tests are fair, and Professor Rogers gave us choice at every step of the way on the graded materials. Im not sure how much of the course material I will remember in the future because some of it could be pretty frivolous, but the class definitely made me a better thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would definitely recommend to a student interested in the topic. Prof Rogers is great and the topic is very interesting ",
            "\u00a0After 3.5 years, this was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. Really changed my worldview and SO RELEVANT for the rest of my life. Wish I had discovered this class earlier, it would've changed the arch of my Yale academic path. PHENOMENAL CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is timely and the skills can be applied to any field in the humanities. The major concepts (rejecting teleology, neoliberalism, sovereignty, personhood) are explored in great depth and build off of each other in a way that makes each one clearer as the course progresses. It comes full circle at the end and everything will make sense. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course! The subject is extremely relevant to each of our lives, and I feel like I better understand the world around me after learning the complexities of the corporate form from an anthropological perspective. Although the readings were often challenging, Rogers does a great job of making sense of complex material. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely!! Rogers is extremely knowledgeable and personable, and makes the material easy to digest. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend the course, though I would warn students that the course can be too basic and unsatisfying at points. Professor Rogers is an exceptional instructor, and the TAs for this semester were dedicated. However, the course seems to try to accomplish too much and thus leaves students wanting for larger insights by the end. Still, the course is by no means bad -- it's a great way to study corporations in a different light and become acquainted with anthropology for a semester. Many of the readings are fascinating, and the course in general is worldview-expanding. Take the course, but realize it is only a primer and will not give you a normative model for corporations should be -- if that is something that you are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes one of the best classes I ever took. ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course! Professor Rogers is an inspired lecturer and presents the material in really engaging ways. The readings were not super difficult and you could get the main themes from going to lecture as he provides summaries. The two exams are pretty easy and the two papers are actually pretty fun to write (you use the archives for one and the other is an ethnography based on interviews). The workload is super manageable and the lectures pretty interesting! Great class! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course!!! I cannot reccomend it more if you have any interest in the humanities, social sciences, or just society in general! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course - I definitely recommend it to all class levels. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was an amazing class that is probably the most applicable to general life/business knowledge. It is tough to find business-y courses at Yale and this is one that I feel finally was able to somewhat fill that void. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an extensive view into corporations and the roles that they've played both in society and in developing society. It was based primarily around a single text, Barkan, though I found the supplemental readings to be helpful in understanding the concepts. The class also primarily revolved around the American corporation. If you are at all interested in corporations or how our current society has developed around them, I would highly recommend taking this course! ",
            "\u00a0The Corporation would appeal to anyone interested in (a) having their preconceptions about contemporary corporations both reified and deconstructed (b) learning more about the field of anthropology (c) taking a course with a reasonable work load and really captivating assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a must take course at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very relevant and interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0This was a solid anthropology class. The content of the class may be a little difficult to grasp if this is your first anthropology class, but if you enjoy anthro classes, you should take this one. It was my first anthropology class and I found the lectures to be a little too abstract, but still thought it was a quality class. There is a large amount of reading and a decent amount of the class is focused on corporate history going back to the 1700s, but the later parts are pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The history of corporations is a story of power-consolidation that needs to be examined critically. This course is a first step into deepening one's knowledge of corporate form and how it has changed over the centuries--resulting in a change to the global economic order. Rogers stresses again and again to think beyond the greedy profit-driven businessperson in order to recognize the many ways corporations are constituted and how they affect the world. The possibilities for the future require an understanding of the past. I highly recommend taking this course, if only for seeing what has been obscured from us. "
