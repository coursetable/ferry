            "\u00a0Introductory knowledge to legal concepts, and a basic understanding of legal reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0If you have never read case law for a class, this course will teach you a lot about what is important in court decisions (for an ethics discussion), what kinds of cases make their way to appellate and supreme courts (you'd be surprised!), and the ethical aspects of the justice system that compete with one another in court cases. From Karen, you'll also learn so much about how the law works, particularly criminal law. Besides the skill of reading and understanding case law, you will also practice application of professional ethical principles. ",
            "\u00a0This class offered me spectacular insight into the inner workings of our criminal justice system, and allowed me to consider thoughtfully various ethical issues that arise from its imperfections. The case law we read was incredibly interesting, and it allowed me to learn about some of the precedent guiding various issues in our justice system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to digest and pull out the essential nuggets from legal cases. Judge Goodrow grounded each case for us, and drew out the important aspects of them in accessible yet stimulating discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The class topics focused on the first amendment, the death penalty, \"junk science,\" eyewitness testimony, jailhouse informants, juries, due process and the ethical considerations around these topics. The class discussions were designed to encourage us to think about how the law works in practical application and to highlight some of the problems within the system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ethical considerations faced by prosecutors, the defense team, and the courts, the debates concerning death penalty, first amendment controversies, jury selection, implicit bias, and the problems of reliance on shoddy evidence in our criminal justice system. Excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a greater understanding of law, particularly with respect to issues like the death penalty and freedom of speech. I also learned, as a student with very little prior exposure to law, how to even read law journals and case briefs. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent overview of our judicial system's many flaws, from jury selection to inadequate representation to \"scientific\" evidence. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fascinating plunge into criminal law, specifically first amendment cases and murder/sexual assault cases. I learned to read case law, and to distill and engage with the issues in cases. I also gained insights about the US criminal justice system, about the biases that pervade the system, influencing justice, especially ones along gender and racial lines. We also talked about normative ways to better our system of criminal justice, which was particularly engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned about the different in court techniques a lawyer uses to make her case. I learned about the many many ways that our criminal justice system is biased against the poor and the underprivileged. The role of race, and socioeconomic status in death row cases. I learned a good deal of case law about 1st amendment protections or lack thereof. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deeper understanding of the criminal justice system--the ethical obligations of the prosecution, the defense and the courts. ",
            "\u00a0Since Professor Goodrow is a judge, I learned a lot about how one experiences the law. There are some things you cannot learn from a textbook. It was amazing to get a grip on how the Professor recognizes bias and change and injustice in her own line of work. Reading case law was also very illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to look at the American legal system with the incredible and irreplaceable help of Judge Goodrow, whose incisive remarks and life experiences challenge us to think more deeply and react more intelligently not only towards ethics and the law, but also life in general. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The themes and readings of the course were great! The perspective Karen brings as a former attorney and a judge is invaluable. Sometimes, you could be less engaged if you so chose because there were so many cases each week and so many people in the class, it was easy to skate by with only a couple of comments on one case. Another weakness is that the exams were not as straightforward as they could have been. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked if we were required to submit reading responses on a weekly basis, to encourage everyone to do and think about the readings in advance of class. The best weeks were the ones when most everyone came prepared and ready to discuss the topics at hand, but there were several weeks where only a few people dominated discussion; requiring reading responses, I think, would help with that.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the readings were manageable and the discussions thought-provoking. I loved being able to hear about Karen's experiences as a judge and defense attorney - her storytelling is incredibly entertaining, and it is clear she has a tremendous wealth of experience and knowledge that really helps to make the class special. ",
            "\u00a0The best and main reason to take this course is Judge Goodrow. She is an absolutely delight and absolutely cares about every one of her students. She is extremely knowledgeable and experienced, but very humble. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were fascinating and fed into interesting class discussions. In many courses at Yale the professor tends to do a lot of prodding to get students to ask 'big questions,' but in this course the students really drove the seminar. You actually wanted to speak, as opposed to sweating if a professor cold-called you. The midterm and final are not too difficult, and you really get a chance to apply what you learned during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the types of readings, the small number of assignments, the fascinating subject matter, the engaging lecturing style of Karen Goodrow and the discussion-oriented nature of the class.\r\n\r\nOnly weakness is number of weekly readings. Especially because the readings are mostly cases, it's very difficult to get through sometimes 250 pages of caselaw a week. I felt I learned a lot more about ethics and patterns in the justice system through the journal articles assigned, as opposed to the often difficult to understand case law. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion is very free-form, so it can go in a lot of productive and interesting discussions. Plus, Karen offers a lot with her experience from both the judge and lawyer perspective, so you get to hear lots of interesting stories and insights about the entire legal process. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course that raised many questions about what it means to give someone a \"fair trial.\"\r\n\r\nWould recommend sacrificing some breadth for a little more depth. Specifically, it'd be nice to spend more time reading about/discussing remedies for the issues we learned about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learning from a Connecticut judge herself, who has years of experience defending criminals in murder/sexual assault cases  Karen was the attorney involved in many of the cases we read, especially those that involved exonerations by the Innocence Project. It was refreshing and informative to be in a class with a practitioner in the field, compared to an academic, as the knowledge you gain is different and anchored very much in a practical reality. Areas of improvement: The classes about biases could have been condensed. Karen said this class could be solely focussed on first amendment cases or murder/sexual assault cases, but I would offer the opposite suggestion: that it could move through an even greater variety of types of cases, perhaps other kinds of criminal case law; as many of us have never taken a class in criminal law, a broader survey may be interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is amazing and Karen is one of the most wonderful, throughtful and caring people I have ever met. My one tiny suggestion would be to revise the final somehow. It was incredibly interesting but the questions required long answers to really do justice to the topics that we were studying. I had a hard time fitting everything into 12 pages and I am sure that most of my classmates would agree. SO perhaps rethinking the final could be helpful? Just a thought, otherwise everything was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great because it allowed for an open dialogue. It was like having an intellectual discussion among friends. Questions were frequently asked, and students or the professor would answer. It was a very open, comfortable, inclusive setting. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths largely derive from Goodrow's brilliant grasp and experience with the law. While the class was extremely informative, it was less philosophically rigorous. We didn't ask as many questions about why the law exists and how we punish. ",
            "\u00a0It covered a good range of topics relating to the American legal system and providing solid grounding. We were encouraged to not only read up on and think about the weekly topics but also go beyond, and use real-life examples for our midterm. However, the readings, though helpful, were tough for students not particularly inclined to law. It could also be helpful to distribute a list of legal terms and their meanings that will be used in class so those who might be unfamiliar have something to refer to (examples include 'mens rea' and 'voir dire'. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is an overal very enjoyable seminar. It's somewhat like a \"bookclub with Karen\", if the books were just different legal cases and opinions. Since Karen (not Judge Goodrow!!) is a judge, and not a professor, this seminar is naturally different than most at Yale. But I enjoyed hearing her perspective on a lot of these issues, and she has many cool stories and experiences that she shares with the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you can get in. Karen is one of the best instructors I've had at Yale, and her class is a wonderful all around experience. Please, if you take it, be prepared to do the readings every week, because otherwise you're not getting much out of the class, and you take away from the interesting discussions that go on. Even if you're not interested in criminal justice, this class is incredibly interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's stimulating, relevant, and Judge Goodrow is delightful. The material is interesting, and you can enjoy the class without getting bogged down by unnecessary stress. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have recommended this course to all of my friends already. This was the best class I have taken so far. Judge Karen Goodrow is hilarious and fascinating and really made us think about some of the tensions that can arise in law and various cases. Her selection of reading material was great - everything was interesting and I looked forward to the class each week. TAKE THIS CLASS. The midterm and final papers are not difficult, but encourage you to apply what you learned over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. The subject matter is fascinating and you will come out of the class knowing way more about constitutional law, historic cases, criminal justice procedures, and the lawyerly ethics, than you did to begin with. ",
            "\u00a0Phenomenal class led by a funny, engaging, deeply knowledgeable practitioner. Absolutely take it - you'll never see trials, or judicial decisions, the same way again. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a pre-law student or someone interested in understanding our criminal justice system better, especially from a criminal defense point of view, take this class! If you want to understand how questions of ethics and morality intersect with the law itself, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend it to another student. Karen is a great asset for Yale and as many people as possible should learn from her tremendous experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student looking to learn more about the criminal justice system. We read long court cases and were required to understanding the ins and outs of each case. This was at times tedious but always helpful in forming the bigger picture. The setting was very relaxed and informal. You won't really know what your grade is until the end of the year--so make sure you're okay with that before taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because Goodrow is an incredible mentor to have. She is really wonderful. She is understanding, kind and brilliant. I am grateful to have taken her course and to have met her. The material is mostly case law which was really good to have exposure to. And class was always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is an integral course that will have you analyse (some of) the underpinnings of the American legal system and Judge Goodrow is the type of instructor to encourage and challenge students to improve it. "
