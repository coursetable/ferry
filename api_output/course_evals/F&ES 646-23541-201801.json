            "\u00a0-I built more comfort (though certainly not complete comfort) with reading technical agricultural literature. \r\n-I built a more informed understanding and critique of the role of technical science in agricultural practices and the food system.\r\n-I built an in depth understanding of my choice for my local geography project - The San Francisco San Joaquin Delta Region, which was fascinating! ",
            "\u00a0introductory knowledge into supply chains, intro to how environmental non-profits work. ",
            "\u00a0During the course I gained much knowledge of agricultural science and built a holistic image of the factors in the agricultural system. I also practiced skills in specific geography analysis and offering advice for NGOs. ",
            "\u00a0Two general areas: 1. biophysical/chemical scientific background, especially of soils & plants, which was new for me; and 2. the experience of 'going back to basics' and learning as much as I could about new (to me) subjects straight away. While my knowledge is still very basic, I think I did learn quite a lot, in a range of areas, and the work of figuring out how to jump in to content so different than what I've been focusing on was a good and enlightening challenge. One thing I really loved was seeing connections between processes happening in this course, and things I have been learning about in my coursework at the Div school -- reflected especially in how we talk about science/how we read or consume scientific publications. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of ground in a short amount of time. We learned about the various aspects of agriculture systems and also considered alternate knowledge systems and approaches to ag. One of the skills developed in this course was synthesis. Writing the weekly precis on an aspect of ag required an intense amount of synthesis, and I really appreciated that about this course. ",
            "\u00a0A better sense of the landscape of how scientific literature plays into agricultural work. Better understanding of some of the theoretical landscape for thinking about food systems. Experience working on client projects. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the course focused on the more technical issues with agriculture's impact on the environment. The second half explored supply chains and the role of institutions and scientific knowledge. Our individual assignment enabled us to explore the course material in a specific location. The group project was somewhat of a consulting arrangement with a nonprofit and provided some useful, real-world experience. ",

I had come into this course mostly with a sense of curiosity, kind of expecting that if I learned more about the world from a natural sciences perspective (and learned more about learning in new ways), I would deepen and broaden the insights and learning in the religion & ecology coursework (which is often primarily philosophical/reflective, more than physical or concrete). This certainly occurred, but I received much more than I expected, too. The range of backgrounds and interests represented in the room made for good discussions which, while they were sometimes contentious, I felt were highly appropriate to the educational experience I was seeking. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. ",

            "\u00a0I did not expect this class to focus so heavily on abstract concepts like the role of science and institutions. I also thought that we would learn more about existing solutions or approaches to environmental problems in the agricultural sector. Instead we focused on the problems and how we might manage them.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructors (Prof Mark Bradford and Stephen Wood) were very open and willing to receive feedback along the way and tweak aspects of the course that weren't working as well.\r\nWeaknesses: Instructions for the individual geographic projects was often unclear, particularly in the beginning of the semester for the first few weekly assignments and the in the end of the semester for the final assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to do something more hands-on on Wednesdays related to what we learned about on Mondays (ex: analyzing a soil sample or modeling a hydrological flow). It felt a bit abstract sometimes, and I wanted to learn more about how to apply the material we learned. Maybe a case study applying the ideas we learned about.\r\n\r\nI appreciated the scope of what we covered, including the social aspects of power. This was an important aspect to include with technical material, and I think in most FES classes these issues are segregated. \r\n\r\nLectures were useful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Professors open to feedback and change\r\n-Relevant guest speakers from Yale sharing different perspectives and expertise\r\n-The local geography project as a way to integrate technical knowledge\r\n-In the second half of the semester, we had some really great discussions. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The local geography project ended abruptly after we put a lot of work into it. I think it would be great to integrate this into the group project, or to create some kind of final recommendation based on the work we've done. Perhaps this could be due before spring break so as not to overlap with the group project. ",
            "\u00a0I think the instructors did a greta job in reframing the course during the mid term evaluation. I believe the list of concepts was too ambitious for the format and that this course could have been divided in two 2-credit courses, one focused on natural science and one on social-political science. ",
            "\u00a0dove too deep into scientific articles that 1 day was not enough time to digest and fully understand before discussing it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very clear expectations & organization, engaging lectures on a wide range of topics all set up to be accessible to intro-level students (me!), welcoming of non-FES students (also me!). The value-framework material toward the end of the semester was, in my opinion, extremely relevant and well-placed. I don't know where else FES students get to talk about those issues, but I was glad they came up here. \r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the organization broke down a little bit near the end of the term, just regarding the group project expectations. I'm not sure what would have been better -- maybe if we had made time for each small group to check in with professor(s)? It's hard to say about weaknesses because I was happy to learn everything that was coming up in the course, even though I'm sure there's also a ton of other things we could have talked about. I didn't have an issue with how the course was being run before the mid-semester feedback opportunity, but I appreciated how the professors responded to & integrated that feedback in the second half of the course. \r\nI guess one thought is: I sometimes felt like the course was trying to cover too much ground for the time it had, once the group projects began taking more space. I think the group projects could probably be organized a little differently to flow better within the course -- that said, again, I thought it was all valuable, even when things were frustrating or not seeming to work easily. ",
            "\u00a0Individual projects were great - I thought the format was well-designed, I loved writing a bit each week about a topic I cared about that cumulatively created a legitimate work product. Many of the reading assignments were often overly technical to the point of being unhelpful. Wednesday discussions were overly structured and forced and required someone in the group to get up and present information - nobody wants to report-out on a group discussion in a \"presentation\" format - it's not a great way to practice public speaking skills, and the students don't like doing it. Wednesday discussions were always a drag. Group projects were a disaster. Make small groups (of 2-3, self-chosen) or let people submit something individually. Group work is really tedious in graduate school, it's really hard to coordinate, and nobody has anything enough on the line to make deliverables really count for anything valid. Working with other people can be really challenging, and a huge hurdle for learning. Also TNC is notorious for not engaging with students - our engagement with TNC during this project was a 60 minute video-conference with some pompous man with a beard and long hair who basically just pedantically described the summary of everything he knew about the subject. No clear direction. It was comically obvious how much this person liked the sound of his voice and the thought of lecturing a group of grad students about the kinds of work he does all day. Good projects need strong leadership and management - that certainly didn't come from TNC, it didn't come from Mark or Steve or Rachel (don't think it's their responsibility), and nobody in the group wants to be that person or has the authority to do it. ",
            "\u00a0The Wednesday role play during the first half of the semester was not useful. I appreciated that the instructors took the mid-term evaluations into account and didn't continue that for the second half. The client projects also could've benefitted from some additional oversight. ",
            "\u00a0As we've discussed throughout the semester, I struggled some with the discussion format for the first half of the semester. I liked the more instructor-led discussions in the second half of the semester better, and also thought the ones that focused on a specific real-world case study went well. Lectures were a strength overall, both from instructors and guests. Some of the guests got a little specific in their field of study and could have used a bit more contextualization with the rest of their field. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is perhaps two interrelated courses. The first half of the course could have easily been explored in more depth for a whole semester. The second half of the course was a little too nebulous for me although it did challenge my perspective and introduce a few new concepts. I enjoyed the lectures and individual assignment in the first half of the course. The in class activity changed halfway through the semester in response to student feedback and ended up just being discussion. We had some interesting discussions about complex issues, but I felt like these weren't structured well enough to prevent students from proselytizing and talking in circles. The group project had a lot of potential, especially because we were able to work with real organizations, but it was not well organized and we didn't have enough time. We also didn't get any guidance on how to work with our groups, engage with the client, and write our reports. ",
            "\u00a0does not deep dive into topics, only glances over them as weekly lectures have to cover the broad subject range ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - making you use the information from the scientific papers in exercises, even though we didn't 100% understand them fully. But I do think that's a realistic representation of what goes on in the real world - scrambling to read a paper, then trying to make use of it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the evolving nature of the course. The structure kept changing throughout the semester, mostly for the better, but it was sometimes hard to adapt. ",
            "\u00a0We started learning a lot of techincal aspects on ag but quickly deviated from that into confusing discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mark Bradford, opportunities for professor-led discussion, systems thinking approach, HW schedule with readings after the first learning day (avoided the problem of class just being a reiteration of readings), client project\r\nWeakness: Steve, geographical assignment in combination with client project and weekly readings (didn't allow for enough time for depth into each part) ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting content but sometimes it was assumed certain level of previous understanding of the topic.\r\nIt would be good to create a strategy to cover first the basics. \r\nSometimes the topics got really technical that the main point of the lecture-discussion was lost. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the intention was wonderful: provide a more robust technical understanding of agricultural processes in a school where most students are familiar with the social dimensions. Even still, conversations trended towards power more often than I thought was helpful. I could see both Mark and Steve listening very hard to student feedback, and doing their best to cater the experience to these voices. However, I would have almost liked them to listen less and tell us more about what they were thinking about what they know. "

Don't be afraid to let this (communication especially) be part of the same work you're doing up the hill. ",
