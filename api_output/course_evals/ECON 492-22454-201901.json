            "\u00a0I learned about a narrow field, learned to develop a new econometric technique, learned to work with text data, and gained experience working with large datasets. ",
            "\u00a0In electing to complete a Senior Essay for the Economics major, I took a significant step in furthering my economics education. This exercise allowed me to apply the economics knowledge that I learned through classroom study to solve a relevant problem or question that directly affects society. I learned a great deal about the nuances of economic modeling, and developed insight into answering a question without explicit access to data. I acquired skills related to macroeconomic calibration exercises, and learned how to utilize sensitivity analyses to provide robustness to the results of said calibration exercises. Finally, I developed an understanding of how to synthesize results into a relevant conclusion that can be used to inform policy and that serves as a platform for additional economic research. ",
            "\u00a0- obtain and clean real industry data \r\n- how to run data analysis \r\n- how to design econometric models that address my questions ",
            "\u00a0So much. The process of research is really difficult, but ultimately rewarding. I became better at programming (a lot of that), but also learned by own limitations. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my research skills and learned how to apply data analysis techniques to real-world problems. ",
            "\u00a0How to conduct economics research, STATA / data analysis ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to think like an academic and picked up some patience along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct original research for the first time and both how challenging and rewarding the process is. ",
            "\u00a0Self determination, how to develop and disseminate a survey, independent analysis ",
            "\u00a0It was a great experience seeing the project through from beginning to end. It really tied in many of the skills I have learned in my classes and being able to apply them was really rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I found the senior essay experience incredibly rewarding. I had conducted research at Yale before, but conducting year-long research in an  area of deep interest is unmatched. In particular, I understood (1) data analysis, (2) literature review, and (3) elements of finance that I was able to then apply in a creative manner. "

            "\u00a0This course is an excellent opportunity for students to gain research experience. My advisor was unsure what his role should be; more guidance from the department to advisors would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was Max, our TF. He went above and beyond his responsibilities and was always willing to meet with students enrolled in the course to discuss thesis ideas, analysis methods, or a number of other topics that were relevant to the research and writing process. His refresher sessions on econometrics, STATA, and best research practices significantly smoothened the entire process for me, and I owe a great deal of credit to Max for steering me in the direction I took. A weakness of this course pertains to finding an advisor willing to take on your project of interest. I think there should be more transparency within the list of faculty members who indicate that they are willing to advise on the senior essay. I encountered a number of professors who did not feel they could take on an undergraduate advisee, or who felt that my topic was not best suited for them, even though health economics was listed in their research areas of interest. ",
            "\u00a0I feel my ability to construct economic models and design robust tests were lacking. It would be more helpful if we can take more hands-on courses on econometrics (esp. for macroeconomics) before we start working on the thesis. ",
            "\u00a0The econ major should provide more guidance, especially with formatting, requirements, and expectations. It's bizarre that it doesn't provide any real guidance in the sense of what is expected from a student. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - you get to work closely with a faculty member, 1-on-1 ",
            "\u00a0I think the flexibility of the senior essay and free reign given is both the biggest strength and weakness of this course. I enjoyed the opportunity to explore a topic I was interested in. However, sometimes it was difficult to figure out the best path forward. I think the best way to improve this course would be to shore up the variety of methods and models taught in the econometrics sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Flexibility could be a gift and a curse. I liked it because it allowed me to work at my own pace and focus on aspects that I found applicable to my field of interest. "

            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to students with a genuine interest in research. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if considering continuing their education in economics. I learned an incredible amount of information regarding conducting economic research, designing models, and analyzing results in a relatively short amount of time. I feel that I got as much out of the Senior Essay as I got from most of my other economics courses combined. I developed close relationships with Yale College and Yale School of Public Health faculty members, and honestly I wish I would have spent even more time interacting with these advisory figures. The workload required by the Senior Essay is not something to scoff at; however, I feel like the work is worth the reward. ",
            "\u00a0A senior thesis is a great commitment, and you should be hundred-percent certain if that's something you will follow through. That being said, once you finish the thesis, it is extremely rewarding to see how much you have learned and improved over the course. As you get to write on the topics you are interested in, it is a very intellectually engaging process. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard. Do it at your own peril. I don't really regret it, but it was intensely stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, by writing a senior essay you will actually do a research project from the initial brainstorming stage to the final presentation. This is a very unique experience and can teach you a lot of skills that you can't learn from a typical course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend! However, it's important to note that your experience is highly dependent on who your advisor is, so choose wisely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The senior essay really helps you develop as a researcher and critical thinker. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely worth it to write a thesis ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is a lot of work but so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend writing a Senior Essay in Economics. Doing so not only enriches your economics experience, but allows you to gain skills of independent work and research that will benefit you in whatever industry/role you later partake in. Furthermore, learning how to effectively review literature and data is fundamental. "
