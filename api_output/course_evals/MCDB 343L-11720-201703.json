            "\u00a0Doesn't go late like in previous half, but more complex experiments mean that odds of failure are higher, which can be frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's freaking CRISPR!! How can it be any more cool? We actually learned the step-by-step way in which you create CRISPR, and it will be really fun to hopefully work in a lab that does similar stuff. This half of the class is way more organized and the TA (who I'm assuming has been doing this for a couple of years) is amazing. I can't imagine the class being the same without this particular TA.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: Not sure what I ended up getting but there wasn't much in terms of grading. we ended up doing just 2 psets, a lab notebook and a final presentation. Hopefully my grade represents the fact that I learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that you get to work with CRISPR/Cas9, which is a really cool technology that I know I wouldn't otherwise get the chance to use in the other lab I work in. One weakness is that we didn't get to see the axolotls we were doing the experiment with :( "

            "\u00a0Great class, probably the best lab I've taken at Yale. CRISPR is relevant and important, and it's amazing that we have the resources to teach it in a small class setting. ",
            "\u00a010000000% YES. Once you get through 342L (which really isn't that bad),  you've hit your stride with Prof Nelson. As you may have read in the reviews for the first half, this is a 2x a week class with a really great professor. Definitely a great way to get my a credit of lab requirements done. \r\n\r\nThings definitely ease up in 343L, as you never leave lab after 5pm. Actually, one class was even cancelled and for two classes we left before 3pm. After putting in the tough work in 342L, this feels like a breeze in the best possible way.\r\n\r\nPlus, you're working with CRISPR! This is groundbreaking stuff that you can actually say you did. the project itself is simple. Make a CRISPR system to make mutations in axolotl. It's not difficult, the requirements of the class are slim to none with just a few psets, a lab notebook (they're pretty lax about it) and a final presentation ON A PAPER in modern CRISPR research. Not even on the work you did in the semester, which is great. You actually come to understand the paper you present on in a much deeper way.\r\n\r\nThe TA of the class is also really great and IT'S HIS OWN WORK YOU'RE HELPING WITH. Both he and Prof Nelson really care about their students and want everyone to succeed in getting something out of the class ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class! It was cool to work with CRISPR and I liked that we were working on a real project instead of just learning techniques. "
