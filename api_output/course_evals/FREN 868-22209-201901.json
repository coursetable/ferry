            "\u00a0This course provided (1) an overview of the rise of print/material culture and new media in the 17th century, and the major polemics and 'querelles' that accompagnied this change, through a (re)examination of more well-known texts and a consideration of less canonincal texts that nevertheless were bestellers in their time ; (2) an introduction to the main tools and theoretical stakes of the Digital Humanities (namely TEI and interface design) through a mini-digital edition project.

            "\u00a0The course was well organized and clearly structure. Occasionally, the amount of secondary/critical reading seemed unweildly and detracted from the ability to discuss primary texts in detail. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. I would highly recommend this course. It provides a fresh approach to a literature that can often seem uninteresting to non-specialists, and the theoretical questions raised by 17th-century texts and problematics have a great relevance to other centuries (especially the 18th and 19th).
