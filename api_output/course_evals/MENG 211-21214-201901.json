            "\u00a0The exams were not very consistent with what we learned in class and what the problem sets asked. I think class was structured reasonably well for the most part although sometimes it was difficult to follow all the way through derivations. Having a test be 3/5 content we haven't explicitly covered was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Very good instructor, towards the end the material seemed a bit tacked on, perhaps keeping good transitions between topics through the end would be good. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is good, it's your typical engineering lecture. Judy is pretty funny at times though! I think the lectures are helpful, especially when we go through examples. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the problem sets were very reasonable and well-balanced for this course, although giving a double-length problem set over spring break was frustrating. I think the thermodynamic relations section needs to be revisedit was very hard to develop intuition for why we were doing the things we were doing. I also think approaches for ideal gas/cp/cv problems could have been better explained. The power plant tour was great. ",

            "\u00a0While the materials are great, the exams are quite arbitrary and depend on a lot of materials taken from sections not covered in class or psets. The performance throughout the semester is not an accurate indicator of your performance since the final exam holds such a high percentage of your grade and the exams are inconsistent with the material covered. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course covers a lot of valuable information, and in general sets up and progresses through the material quite well. I think that there were few external hep sessions at times that are available to all students. ",

            "\u00a0psets are fine, exams are pretty hard. there could maybe be more context as to why this stuff is important ",
            "\u00a0The main concern I have with this course is that it seemed like it was always taught such that we would be able to do pset problems. For that reason I don't really feel prepared for any real-world-stuff. Some of the exams had material that tested our conceptual understanding of it all, which was good, except we weren't taught to think that way and so I was always discouraged when I didn't know those underlying concepts. So yeah, I wish it were taught with more of a focus on the concepts behind it all, and how to think about it all more abstractly. I did think that the psets were reasonable and there was plenty of support, though. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were less direct teaching to the textbook, and better integration with other courses in the major and outside of it. This is a complaint I have about pretty much every Yale College STEM course I've taken. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend you take this before fluids (and even materials science) if at all possible, because both classes make lots of references to enthalpy etc. without stopping to explain. Prof. Cha is pretty good and is refreshingly not overly intense. Make sure you have a good concept of how things were derived for the examsdon't just learn equations. ",

            "\u00a0yes, if you think you'll need thermo. psets are fine but exams are tough, and Judy doesn't curve the class much, so it's a hard A. not the most interesting material ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you have to take it. It became a drag near the end of the semester, and it wasn't easy by any means. But it can be interesting if you make it interesting for yourself. The homework problems are kind of like puzzles, which could be fun and rewarding. The lectures were pretty boring a lot of the time :( but they weren't too bad and they taught me what I needed to know. Read the textbook though! that's really helpful ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they find the material interesting and are not afraid of tedious calculations. ",
