            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of the history of development theory and practices. I enjoyed doing the readings from different points in the last 60-70 years as well as considering the case studies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the groundwork of development, primarily from an economic-historical perspective. I also improved upon my strategy and policy analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0The class providing an incredible overview of the evolution of development thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant about economic history and how countries develop over time. I learned about the specific strategies that countries can adopt to experience high growth as well as specific case studies of countries. Ultimately, this class has helped me better understand economic fundamentals and cultivate a strategic mind which can better assess why some countries can grow while others cannot. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the people in the seminar clearly know a lot and are very engaged. Prof Mohan is also super experienced and it always fun to hear his anecdotes.\r\nWeaknesses: the discussions could have been better moderated. The readings are copious and no one really does them so the class time itself is spent in these very didactic lectures and there is little to no engagement with the material or constructive debate. I wish we had also done readings considering more all-encompassing development philosophy, such as amartya sen, partha dasgupta etc. ",
            "\u00a0Limit time on student presentations to no more than 15 minutes, and then extend class discussion time. I also wish we had looked at least at one African country (it seemed a little too Asia/Latin America focused to me, especially considering that Africa is truly the next frontier for development economists). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you get a serious depth of the development thinking and strategies.\r\n\r\nWeakness: it rarely focuses on the weaknesses aka bad strategies for development and rarely on Africa in specific ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great Professor, great case studies, great discussions, great lectures and guest lecturers. \r\n\r\nWeakness - lots of reading, sometimes not that much time for discussion some days, class runs over 10 minutes most days (but I personally didnt mind because I found the material so fascinating).

            "\u00a0I think it is a cool course to learn about the history of development economics and development strategies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very interesting material that spans across many regions and time periods. You learn a ton about economic development in all aspects: theory, policy, history. The readings are on the heavy side, but they are all very well selected and super insightful. And of course, Professor Mohan is an absolute expert in the field. His insight, anecdotes, and sense of humor all contributed wonderfully to the class. Expect for this course to be rather lecture-heavy compared to other seminars here (usually a student presentation, and then professor presentation, then discussion at the end). But again, there's so much insightful material and knowledge that Professor Mohan relays, so it's not at all bad to sit there and listen to him for a lot of the time. Towards the end, the material felt kind of repetitive, but take it as a sign that you really internalize the main takeaways about economic development and lessons for policymaking. Workload is manageable, and the papers were actually enjoyable to write once you get into it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved this class. I came away having learned so much, and Professor Mohan is a committed, fantastic teacher. the knowledge base also really builds upon itself such that what you are learning towards the end of the semester is deeply intertwined with what you learned at the beginning. Truly, this is a great class that steeps you in the field at a deep, rigorous, intellectual level. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. If you are into development, you will be clueless without this knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This has been one of the most influential economics courses Ive taken at Yale. If youre interested in macro policy or developing countries this is the go to seminar! "
