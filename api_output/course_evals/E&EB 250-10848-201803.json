            "\u00a0The course provides a broad overview of terrestrial arthropods, with insights into the anatomy, physiology and behavior of all major groups. Throughout the course, I have learned about the phylogenetic relationships between different taxa arthropods, evolutionary theoriesincluding convergence, analogy and homologysurvival strategies and more. Spiders are also covered extensively during the second part of the course, which I appreciated a lot. E&EB 250 helped me familiarize myself with the scientific literature by reading papers and writing a synopsis of current research related to the material covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the behavior, characteristics, and impact of arthropods and came to appreciate their incredible and essential role throughout the world much more. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about arthropods. If you are at all curious about these fascinating organisms, then you should definitely take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about arthropods! Even though I am far from an expert I feel incredibly knowledgeable now about entomology! We covered a wide range of topics, and due to my high level of engagement, I know that I will carry this knowledge with me going forward. It really complimented what was taught in the corresponding lab; together the courses converted us into amateur entomologists! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a topic that I never would have considered myself interested in. I was able to both be interested in the class as well as engaged. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly learned so much during this class - I was always excited to go to class and learn about arthropods! Literally, you learn so many amazing facts about insects and how to read scientific papers. I'm pretty sure that my sister, who goes to a different school, knows about the same amount of information that I do because I always tell her about the cool things that I learn about during class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about arthropods that I had never even heard of.  The videos shown during lecture are fantasticthey act to enhance what you learn, not as a filler to take up time.  I mean, who doesn't love listening to David Attenborough talk about spiders and ants? ",
            "\u00a0I learned a considerable amount about a topic which I had never previously studied. I did not expect to be as engaged as I was. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about all sorts of things related to arthropods and insects including life cycle, body plan, behaviors, evolution, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I knew essentially nothing about bugs going into this class, but now I can confidently say that I know more about them than the average person by a significant margin. The class is mostly just absorption of content, and I payed fairly close attention through the course. There isn't much to gain besides a deep and broad knowledge of insects and other creepy crawlies, but honestly that's pretty neat. ",
            "\u00a0I should say, I took this course as a science credit. In my opinion, it is a wonderful one because it does a great job of emphasizing big ideas in evolutionary biology, like different theories of selection, genetic diversity, and arthropod behaviour. This course gives great insight into the world of scientific thinking while grounding it in fun material that to most will be unknown enough to be refreshing and surprising. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only a huge amount about arthropod body plan and ecology, but also how to impress people with my random bug knowledge. A stranger asked me if centipedes hatch with all their legs. Just the previous day I learned that NO they are NOT. Instead, they are born with only about 8 legs and every time they molt up until adult hood they grow a new body segment and with it a new pair of legs! The person who asked was impressed and I was impressed that the lecture/videos had prepared me to answer such questions. I also appreciate so much more what complicated environmental relationships bugs have both intra and interspecies. Without bugs, there is little decomposition of plant matter, many fewer species of plants (so many plants have devolved with pollinators), and lack of food for larger animals. We talked briefly about the insect apocalypse that currently sees insects at their lowest numbers since record keeping began and I am both scared but also hopeful that people in the class will have both respect and knowledge of bugs to help people understand why insect decline is an indication of hard times to come.

            "\u00a0I have only positive things to say about this course, as it was exactly what I expected and hoped for before enrolling. One of the best features were the insect videos, which were absolutely stunning. Other than that, Marta was quite engaging, very energetic and passionate about the topic. Maybe she could go slower when explaining the slides; it would definitely help make her delivery more clear and effective, but overall I was satisfied with every aspect of the class. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the interesting material and the use of videos for making the material come to life in a sense to where it was easier to understand, visualize, and learn. Marta Wells, the professor, is also a great strength of the class as she is passionate about the material and exciting to listen to during lecture. One weakness was a guest lecturer from UConn who presented material in a very opinionated and less effective way caused by her incredible bias against beliefs that contrast her own. ",
            "\u00a0It incorporated a lot of media and presented the material in an awesome way. ",
            "\u00a0This has probably been my favorite course so far at Yale. I cannot think of a single downside to the course. We learned so much, and I looked forward to every lecture. I left the class amazed by nature and excited to learn more! I even enjoyed writing my final paper, which is rare for me. We were able to explore topics we found interesting. The hardest part was picking a topic because there are so many incredible topics to choose from! A funny side effect of the class is that I'm now interested in incorporating more arthropods into the American diet. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the class structure is perfect how it is. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wells is an amazing lecturer - her powerpoint are always clear and she gives in-depth explanations during class. The exams are definitely very fair and the paper is fun to write because you are able to decide the topic. ",
            "\u00a0I really don't see any place this course can be improved.  Lectures are well planned, the material is interesting, and the exams are all very fair.  Marta has good practice exams released beforehand that give you a great gauge for what to expect, and the grading is very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wells was a fantastic, engaging and knowledgable instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Very engaging and interesting lectures with great videos! Marta is an amazing lecturer who is both passionate about what she teaches and kind and engaging.\r\nWeaknesses - Not many; if anything, maybe a bit more direction on the expectations for the final paper, but other than that, it was a great class! ",
            "\u00a0The class is both extremely broad and quite deep. You get into pretty much every aspect of insects, from diversity and evolution to anatomy and mating habits, so the volume of information covered is definitely an advantage. Marta Wells is also one of the class's biggest strengths. She is a fantastic professor and I cannot praise her engagement highly enough. She rocks. As far as weaknesses, it is one of those classes that is just a straightforward lecture. Marta gives the information and you're expected to absorb it. A few more assignments or in-class projects or activities to shake things up might have made it less samey and homogenous. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Wells is the key strength. She is a wonderful instructor, incorporating lots of video material to spread out the more dense material, and keeping the readings minimal such that they relate strongly to the material we learn in class. Additionally, she makes lots of time for her students. Multiple times in the semester I sat with her for a few HOURS to discuss any course material I felt I had a poor understanding of. I think the only thing that perhaps could be improved would be the consistency of the sound ;) ",
            "\u00a0I loved the videos throughout lecture to solidify concepts. I would have liked to be able to access the videos easily on Canvas when studying for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture material is a bit fast, but the videos are both an enhancement to illustrate concepts and a chance to catch up on note taking. The lecture material is very detail oriented while the exams are a bit more interpretive, which allows a more creative application of memorized course material.\r\nA strength of this class is that the teacher is clearly very passionate. The lecture isn't always very interactive, but it is understandable given the amount of material there is to cover. I did like when a guest lecturer came and demonstrated how mate selection works by assigning envelops that were labeled for sex (M/F) and fitness (1 being least fit and 5 being most). I think that the review sessions for exams were less helpful because they were not well organized. Overall, I enjoyed the class a lot and feel much more informed about arthropods (even if there is so much more to learn)! "

            "\u00a0From the perspective of a non-stem major who needed a science credit, I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially if a student has any interest in biodiversity, arthropods, or the diversity within ecological interactions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you have the room in your schedule to take this class, definitely take it! I loved every lecture. The class was extremely interesting and I was constantly engaged in the lecture. The professor is probably one of the best at Yale! She really cares about her students and if you are not passionate about arthropods at the start, she will change that for you by the end! Probably my favorite class so far at Yale! (And take the lab too if you have the chance!) ",
            "\u00a0As a person majoring in the humanities, I loved this class. Marta's passion is infectious and the way she structures her lectures makes it really easy to learn new concepts. If you're a humanities person like me, your high school biology background will probably be a good enough foundation for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I encourage Yale students to step out of their comfort zone and test a field they never otherwise would have considered. I think that for non-STEM majors, this is not only a great class to get a science credit in, but a great class overall. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to another student. In fact, I am trying to get a few of my suite mates to take the course next year. The course is so interesting, so if you have the chance, take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to someone else.  I, personally, find this sort of subject matter fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for any student marginally interested in the sciences, the material in this course was highly interesting and the class was fun! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are a non-STEM major who wants an interesting but not too difficult science credit, then take this class. Marta is an amazing professor who is very kind, and she shows lots of cool videos in lecture that make it more interesting than just taking notes off of powerpoint slides. Very good class, and it actually feels like you learn a decent amount. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I only took this class so that I could take the lab. If you want to take E&EB 251L, the lab class (WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU DO BECAUSE IT IS THE BEST CLASS AT YALE), then you have to take this lecture, so I recommend taking this course just for that. However, if you're thinking of taking this course as a gut science and don't plan to take the lab, it totally works for that too. There is very little work (3 midterms of which you only have to take 2 and one two page essay), so it's a piece of cake and an easy A if you put in the minimum effort. If you're looking for a super engaging and fulfilling science course, this might not be the one for you. Marta is great and the information is exciting, but it's just another lecture class if you don't take the lab along with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This is the \"gut\" science you've been looking for. The workload is manageable, the tests are designed to test your knowledge (not trick you), the professor is incredible, the material is interesting and you'll actually learn something. I enjoyed this class much more than I thought I would. I'm really not a huge arthropod fan in general; the only reason that I tried this class was because I had a friend taking it. I'm so glad that I did though. This class is really a hidden gem. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student looking for a science credit. It is no gut, as the exams require that you study a good amount, but the material is fun and the concepts you leave with are widely applicable beyond arthropods. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone, but especially to people who thinks bugs are cool but also might be a little squeamish about them. This is especially true if they are already familiar with environmental science jargon. I thinkfrom this class people gain a healthy respect and appreciation for insects. Do go to lecture- it is the primary source of information that will be on the tests and makes much more sense in person than just the slides themselves. "
