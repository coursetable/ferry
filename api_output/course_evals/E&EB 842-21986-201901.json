            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was to provide a comprehensive introduction to the topic in an accessible format. The hands-on labs were engaging and fun. A possible area of improvement is the choice of the studying materials: Fleagle's textbook is comprehensive, but the content is presented in a rather encyclopedic way. This was sometimes unnecessary if one studies the lecture slides. Perhaps some book chapters could be substituted with more engaging journal articles. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the structure of lectures early in the week and labs later in the week. This allowed for more preparation and time to review notes before the labs, which helped me get more out of them. I could focus on the various features we discussed in lecture, rather than having to immediately recall that information. I like that the labs were designed to learn these features and not trick you. I also enjoyed the lab exams and the opportunity to practice identifying different primates. The questions on the lecture exams were quite easy and straightforward. "
