            "\u00a0I gained exposure to a variety of methodological approaches to historical research. I would like to think that I improved my ability to read critically and engage well with my peers in a seminar setting. In addition to these skills, I have thought more about teaching, and what kind of planning and organizing goes into structuring a course. ",
            "\u00a0The primary skill I gained through this course was to think on a deeper level about history texts and the study of history in general. It certainly challenged me to engage with texts on a critical level that few classes I have previously taken did. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to new and significant texts in African history, and also pushed me to think deeply about historiographical problems specific to African history. As someone interested in using oral sources, I appreciated seeing different approaches to incorporating oral sources into academic research. For me, this class was an introduction to writing historiographical essays and synthesizing information succinctly with a critical lens. ",
            "\u00a0This course has challenged me to think about new methodologies for my research. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of different methodologies used in African History; better understanding of key works and \"turns\" in the historiography "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think the course really did expose me to historical methods I had never even thought about; historical linguistics is something I knew nothing about, for example. I really enjoyed that the course traced a variety of approaches that have been used to study the past, and how these methods change depending on the places, people, and period being studied. I think the assignments were well-suited to the material we were engaging with, and I enjoyed getting to rework my historiographical essay over the course of the semester. \r\n\r\nFor some reason, the seminar dynamic was a bit strange at times. I don't know if this was just a function of the class size, but the seminar setting was a bit tense. \r\n\r\nSaying that, I enjoyed the class overall. I liked the readings a lot, and I think that I did learn a lot over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The historiographical essay was a big strength of the course - it was a challenge to balance a range of ideas and find themes among the five works, but doing so helped me hone my analytical skills. My favorite assignment was developing a class module, because it was a practical application of a lot of theoretical problems we had been dealing with during the course.\r\nAt points it was hard to understand the historiographical interventions that were being made by scholars we grappled with. Part of this, for me is that I'm new to the field and was being introduced to a whole slew of ideas and intellectual challenges, but it would have been helpful to have more groundwork in terms of how the scholars we were studying were changing the understood norms of the field. Professor Magaziner helped set up the early texts in this vein, but towards the end of the semester it became harder for me to understand the thread of interventions. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the excellent selection of monographs and the passion with which the professor led seminars. ",
            "\u00a0There were several very long, difficult books in the middle of the course, and a few weeks of easier works at the end. It might have been helpful to stagger some of these. "

            "\u00a0I definitely would, although I think that it would really only make sense for students of African studies, or history to take the class. A survey course would be more suitable for someone without much background in African history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they were a student with solid background in history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class for a student who wants an introduction to the kinds of historiographical interventions that Africanists are making, but I'd recommend that they have some foundation in the field before taking the class. I felt like I was doing a lot of catching up, or learning a lot about a little, which was unsettling at times but important to do. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I am particularly impressed with the professors selection of monographs that reflected virtually every part of Africa south of the Sahara. We read cutting-edge books that propose new methodologies for doing African history and this is something worth recommending. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only those with strong interests in African history. "
