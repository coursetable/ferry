I also developed quite advanced skills into the identification of complete and fragmentary skeletal human remains. Thus, I have acquired valuable insights into the practice of sorting, identifying and studying skeletal human remains. Having taken this class, I feel qualified to engage with these materials and expand my skills autonomously. "
