            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Covers a wide range experimental techniques\r\n- Discussing experimental results with researchers who work in the field is insightful in understanding their significance\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Given the wide range of backgrounds of students in the class, it was regularly an issue that we were unsure of what components of the paper were critical to understand, making the student session entirely unproductive. A simple bullet-point document highlighting what is considered significant in the paper before reading it would be helpful for this and would make the learning process much more effective. I understand that a write-up mentioning what components of a research work are significant and should be read carefully is not representative of reading research papers in a professional setting, but one also doesn't usually read papers in fields completely foreign to them.
