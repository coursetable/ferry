            "\u00a0An understanding of how different fields influence policy and environmental management. ",
            "\u00a0Client project was really helpful in my career development and focusing my research. ",
            "\u00a0Some great insights into how decisions actually get made on the federal level, and how to weigh scientific, legal, political, cultural, economic etc factors in coming to a decision. Good discussions of strategies and factors relevant to high-level federal natural resources and ESA/habitat-related initiatives. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from the client project and policy paper assignments, specifically about project management, community-based applications of renewable energy, and how to approach stakeholder engagement around complex environmental policy issues. I also found Jim Lyons' framework for approaching environmental policy issues to be a useful organizational tool (breaking the issue down into questions around the science, legal, policy and social dimensions is a helpful start to the engagement process). ",
            "\u00a0I didn't develop many new skills as a result of this course. We did do a few debate exercises in the first few classes that challenged me to think about issues from the standpoint of views I didn't hold, which I think is an important exercise.\r\n\r\nMy client project was more useful to me in terms of skill-building than the course. I got to dive into an issue I had almost little familiarity with, but that complemented the work I did during my summer internship. I learned more about the subject matter of my project than I did from course materials. "

            "\u00a0The class followed the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were helpful, though at times a bit technical. Client projects occupied the majority of the time commitment which varied depending on the team. ",
            "\u00a0Client projects were really interesting and better than expected. The course was more about communications and process than I had expected. I had expected more on the contemporary issues and challenges and more of a forward-looking approach, instead of relying on analysis of past events. I liked the class a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Not that well -- I thought the class readings and discussions would be more engaging and interesting platforms for learning than they ended up being. ",
            "\u00a0My expectations for this course were much higher than reality. I was excited about the course material, because I thought we were really going to dig deeply into scientific, political, ecological, legal, and social issues and how they intersect with the environment. The title of the course drew me in - I thought that courses like this should be taught more at FES. Unfortunately, the reality of the course was much different.\r\n\r\nThe readings were generally unhelpful. They were either 120 page documents that no grad student truly has time to read, or they were 1 page news articles from the New York Times or USA Today, which are only sometimes informative. \r\n\r\nThe lectures were also not particularly helpful. I had high hopes because Jim is well-connected and obviously has a wide range of experience working on environmental problems. But the majority of lectures focused on his work with sage-grouse conservation. I enjoy when professors supplement their lectures with personal stories, but in this case, the personal stories often replaced the material we were supposed to learn about. Only talking about sage-grouse was not as useful for my interests. "

            "\u00a0Client projects seemed poorly organized and class discussions were often stifled by poor facilitation from the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Course goals and structure were a bit unclear. Over-reliance on just three case studies over the length of the semester. It would have been good to vary the case studies or examples instead of continually bringing up the sage grouse etc. Since the three case studies were federal initiatives that the instructor had a pivotal role in, they also were presented in a slightly subjective manner. During our in-class debates and discussions, interesting lines of thought were often shut down before they should have been. Readings some weeks didn't connect well to each other, and it would have been helpful if the instructor had explained his goals for the readings and discussions each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- client-based projects. These were interesting and by far a highlight of the course for me. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- organization and quality of instruction. Client projects took several weeks to roll out, which made the actual work a squeeze to fit into an already busy semester. Would have been better to get those previewed and assigned in the first week or 2. Also, class discussions and lectures didn't seem to be very well prepared, and were fairly repetitive -- I felt like more time could have been spent planning the structure of the course, and during the semester, it would have been better if the class had actually stuck to the weekly topics of discussion that were planned; most classes felt like a bit of a free for all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I had a more positive client project experience than most folks in my class, I think. I enjoyed my group, and my client was professional and always available for check-ins. The material was interesting, and my group was able to complete the project expectations. We had a good group of students in the class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I just didn't get much out of this class besides the project. I chose the project that I did because it complemented work I did with my summer internship and because I was interested in the issue. But the rest of the class was not particularly informative to me. The lectures were long, disorganized, and without much substance. The first lecture had a strong turn-out during shopping period, but the subsequent class only had the 7 of us who decided to take the course. That was unfortunate - I think the class could have been stronger with more participants for discussion. There was so much potential for this class to be informative, and really take what we learn at FES and put it into a real-world, problem-solving context. Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to that billing. \r\n\r\nI was also disappointed that we barely had class after spring break. On the one hand, it did clear up some time for us to work on our client projects, which was helpful. On the other hand, we are all paying for the class, and to miss about 4 of the 12 or so classes we had was a lot. \r\n\r\nI also did not like how we did not get the list of potential client projects until 1 day before course registration closed. As a second-year deciding between 2 Capstone courses (with the need to apply to one of them), this was very stressful and highly inconvenient. It would be much better to have the list of potential projects available as soon as possible so that students can make informed decisions about which courses will best meet their needs. "

            "\u00a0Course is heavily dependent on client projects and can really make or break the experience. ",
            "\u00a0Jim Lyons is an amazing resource and a great guy, and full of stories about his experiences in government. Client projects are great opportunities. Don't get too hung up on the class structure, just go with the flow and you will enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class for the client project if nothing else  that was a great learning experience for me. Jim Lyons is also a useful contact if you want to go into public lands management (particularly in the West), and he's a very nice guy; however, he often seemed ill prepared for lectures and didn't insist on a very high level of intellectual rigor for the class. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it. Susan Clark teaches the same kind of interdisciplinary problem-solving framework, but you will learn a lot more from her. \r\n\r\nIf you are considering taking it, take a look at the client project offerings if you can - if there is one that is appealing to you, that might help you decide whether to take the course, because the projects do allow you to do a deeper dive into an area of personal interest and make worthwhile professional contacts.
