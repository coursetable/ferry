            "\u00a0We definitely got a lot of experience in writing frequently, though it was in a very different style than is customary in a class cross-listed as history of art. I learned a lot about contemporary artists, many of whom I hadn't heard of before I took this class. I also learned a lot more about art criticism, simply by being exposed to so many critics over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Being able to talk about art intelligently and honestly, generally a good exposure to the nuances that come with the art critic world, leave with a good understanding of museums, art columns, critics, exhibitions, and so on. Also develop skills as an editor ",
            "\u00a0This class exponentially improved my writing. Although this is my third writing credit at Yale, my writing improved more in this class than any others. But not only did I learn how to write well, but I learned how to analyze paintings and readings with a critical eye. We read a number of art reviews, and I began to fully understand the art critic world. Overall, this course furthered my academic development. ",
            "\u00a0Obviously, I learned about contemporary figurative art, yes, but I also learned how to talk about art in a way that isn't entirely academic. How to write vivid descriptions, how to express a thoughtful critique, how to use art to talk about broader themes. ",
            "\u00a0How to produce good quality, concise writing on a quick deadline, how to think critically about art, how to pull techniques from existing and modern day art reviews ",
            "\u00a0This course is more than a skills-focused exercise in art criticism. Yes, I intensely developed my writing mechanics and journalistic voice. But beyond that, I developed knowledge about the contemporary art world over enthusiastic conversations (which Professor Spillane encouraged) about mine and my classmates' interests--artists, museums, the art market, you name it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how artists produce visual language use various mediums to convey ideas in their work. I learned about how to critique, curate and propose amongst a classroom filled with artistic and passionate artists and people! ",
            "\u00a0Ive become a much better writer since taking this course, as well as developing a need to write on a regular basis. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me the best of the moment insight into the contemporary art world, gave us familiarity with the leading contemporary figurative artists of today, taught us very direct and useful strategies for writing effectively in any format but especially for a news publications /audience. ",
            "\u00a0I never thought I was someone who could enjoy writing. I think this course is useful in teaching us how to teach ourselves techniques to become better writers and consumers of information. "

            "\u00a0This class requires you to write a lot, which is great. It also requires you to read sometimes absurd quantities of texts and one weekend required at least 4 hours of documentary-watching in addition to the absurd quantities of text. Most of the texts were never even discussed in class. The workload for this class fluctuates greatly, making it occasionally frustrating. \r\nFor some reason, all of our writing assignments were due on Saturdays at 3pm, which as someone who often has commitments at this time, made it difficult to complete them on time. Perhaps a time deadline of midnight might be a little more appropriate to a college student schedule. \r\nI felt that though we received feedback (completing two drafts of every assignment), the expectations were not clear. Granted, it is a somewhat creative writing course, so there can't be concrete guidelines, but I often found that after following the feedback received on the first draft, completely different things were asked of me on the second draft, thing which were not marked on the first even if they were present there. I found the feedback to be inconsistent from draft to draft, and the expectations were unclear.\r\nThere is a trip to New York City (to the MET) listed on the syllabus. There was no mention of how this trip was to be funded, which turned out to be out of pocket of the student - the cost of a round trip train ticket as well as entry to two museums. I think that it is inappropriate to expect not an insubstantial financial investment from the student when it is not explicitly marked on the syllabus. Also, as there is generally available funding from the English department, I think that this could have been avoided. \r\nThis class also operates without any given grades. I very much realize that grades are not the be all end all, but for about the first two thirds of the semester, the only feedback was extremely ambiguous in terms of how I was doing in the class, so that by the time we were roughly told how we were doing, it was too late to be able to fix it. More concrete, constant feedback might be a better motivator as well as a more helpful indicator of class performance. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting and fast paced and a strong community develops out of it, easily one of the best courses I have taken at Yale \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some interesting topics felt rushed over, the course could possibly benefit from being extended ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is how it forces you to improve your writing. There are weekly blog posts and essays, so you can't help but get better at writing. Another strength is how the course teaches you to analyze art of all types, not just figurative art. I could easily walk into the Met tomorrow and write an essay about any of the paintings, as this course trained me to do so. Finally, another strength is your awareness of the art critic world. Before this class, I was afraid of the New York Times Arts section, but now I can read any article with ease, and probably know the author. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is the lack of guidance. Professor Spillane doesn't believe in grades, which is important but also stressful. I would have no clue on whether or not my essays were improving, or where I stood in the class. Additionally, some nights would have 4+ hours of readings and films to complete for class the next day, but we would only talk about one article. ",
            "\u00a0The small seminar style (11 students total) was really conducive to fostering a great atmosphere in which we all got to know each other pretty well and have great discussions in class. You also get weekly feedback on your writing, so you can continue to improve. There are a lot of readings and documentaries we had to watch for class, but we often only ended up talking about one thing on the syllabus assigned for that day and never talked about the rest. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the weekly essay topics that are fascinating and fun, the artists we look at in class, and the workshop environment once a week. The weaknesses are there is a lot of reading but none of it really gets discussed in depth. Most of the class time for discussion is used to discuss a review chosen by a student which is great. Sometimes the readings are discussed but most of the time they weren't really engaged with in depth. Same for the movie screenings. ",
            "\u00a0The extremely high level of student engagement proved the be the course's greatest strength, along with fascinating readings and carefully constructed assignments. I'm frankly struggling to come up with substantive suggestions for improvement. One possible area for growth, though, could be the way peer editing is handled. Every student's paper was peer edited once, and while that one editing session was super helpful, I'm wondering whether an alternative system that would allow for continuous peer feedback (perhaps rotating partners?) might be more helpful in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Spillane is a genius and the format of the class was fantastic! ",
            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course is its greatest strength- I cannot imagine it being taught so effectively by someone other than Margaret Spillane. If she chooses to leave this course it will lose its best part. "

            "\u00a0This course is interesting, and I suppose is good if you want to learn about arts criticism. However, if you are someone who wants feedback from your professor as well as a structured environment, this is not the course for you. In addition, this course requires a lot of investment, to be prepared for class but also to be able to complete all of the things that are sometimes unexpectedly thrown at you. This is not a class that should be taken on lightly - it took me probably 2 to 3 times as long to prepare for this class (and longer on writing weeks) than any of my other classes, in which I can definitively say that I learned more useful information. I would recommend this course, but with reservations. The way the course is taught is ambiguous and inconsistent, and though there are sometimes lively and interesting discussions as well as fun and intriguing prompts, I often found myself wondering what precisely I was supposed to be taking away from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. Spillane and the community that develops from the course are amazing things to experience. Generally a wonderful place to experiment as a writer and develop skills necessary to art criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you are at all interested in art, art critiques, or improving your writing. Professor Spillane is a S T A R. She will help you improve your writing tremendously, and she will be extremely helpful and supportive along the way. This class is essentially a grown-up version of English 114. You have two versions of every paper (first version and final version), and each person has one essay workshopped. However, unlike 114, this class has a strong emphasis on grammar and syntax. Be prepared for lots of blue scribbles on all of your papers. This class really improved my writing, and I am extremely grateful for that. Be warned that there is no grading system, but Professor Spillane meets with everyone to give their mid-point grades. Also, the workload is daunting and often most things aren't discussed. But overall, definitely take this class. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend this course! but be prepared for a LOT of work -- there's a writing assignment due every Saturday at 3pm. You submit your first version of an essay on one Saturday, you get it back on Tuesday with lots of comments/feedback from Margaret, and then you revise and resubmit the second version on the next Saturday. It's definitely a rough deadline -- 3pm! Saturday!!! -- but there is quick turnaround with feedback, which I really appreciated. One of your essays will also get workshopped at one point by the entire class -- I don't know if I found my workshop to be totally helpful, but the process is interesting. There is also a class trip to NYC, which was not funded unfortunately, so just be aware. It was fun though! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! The course is pretty inclusive and great experience for anyone, whether very experienced in writing/thinking about art or no prior experience at all. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, and I have! Take it if you like to think about or talk about art, whether it's all you've done for years or this class would serve as your introduction. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it! It will change how you fundamentally write and examine and interact with the world around youbeyond the world of art, actually. ",
            "\u00a010000000x yes. I have already recommended this to everybody I know. Margaret Spillane is AMAZING, has firsthand knowledge about everything and everyone we talked about. IIbe never been in a class where the professor so obviously and deeply cared about each student, and where the student were actually treated full like intellectual equals. Not only was he professor student relationship great but you become close with the other students in the class, which makes the experience all the better. Plus, trips to the YUAG, getting to pitch to the curators,  and a field trip to new york! What more could you want??? ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- You will improve the way that you learn significantly. "
