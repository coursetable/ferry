            "\u00a0I learned to be a better writer and became much more acquainted with some of the classics! These were tales and myths I had only heard of or read about in adaptations (ie Percy Jackson in middle school) but I got to know them so much more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned how to better analyze texts and think critically about specific moments and texts as a whole. Also, my ability to write thoughtfully and concisely improved in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this was the first truly college level course I took and it in turned prepared me for all future writing and literature courses at this level. I feel capable of delving deeply into symbols, themes and motifs present in works of authors spanning centuries. In addition, my own writing and analysis has improved greatly. I can closely evaluate and respond to passages of text and extrapolate those thoughts into larger ideas. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a good literature essay, analyze texts, and present ideas in a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the famous works in the western canon ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write literature papers and analyze ancient texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned useful tidbits about how to make my papers better, such as information about transitions, paragraph organization, and more. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that most of the texts we read are in translation was at first a challenge for me as I could not analyze texts as I normally did, looking closely at authors' language. This meant I learned to appreciate symbolism, structure, and pace a lot more. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt to be a lot more thoughtful and careful about my writing. ",

            "\u00a0One vital strength around which all the other positive components of this course were based was the reading list. I loved it! It was diverse in terms of genre, style, author motivation and time and place written. The discussion in class occasionally became bogged down around small points of questionable value but the frequency of this tendency to manifest itself diminished over the course of the semester due to Professor Markovits' agile manuverings. ",
            "\u00a0The materials were unexpectedly interesting so finishing the reading is not a problem if you don't procrastinate. Amazing lectures, brilliant peers, Professor Markovits knows the materials inside out and offers all kinds of insights and asks thought provoking questions. ",
            "\u00a0You will gain a lot, but the pace is too fast ",
            "\u00a0The professor was excellent and I really enjoyed the reading, but sometimes we did too much at once and I wasnt able to process. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that I learned a lot about writing papers, and a weakness was that I often felt our discusssions had no direction and were purely based on our own observations rather than a larger point or argument about the work that the professor wanted to get across. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are simply that the course teaches strong literary analysis skills. It really helps understand and reflect of complex and difficult texts. "

            "\u00a0Due to the intensity and overall strength of the course, I feel extremely prepared to take on any literary challenge I may face in the future. ",
