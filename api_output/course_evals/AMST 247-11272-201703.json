            "\u00a0Being a STEM major and who had taken a more general public health class in a previous semester, this class was particularly fascinating as it introduced another aspect of how medicine and science is portrayed and conveyed through media. It was fun to see how primary source media (i.e. movies, advertisements, posters, videos, etc.) were analyzed and how they contributed to medicine's role in society. It was different from the more general overview course that I had previously taken in the sense that media was the main focus. ",

It could be improved in that the section meetings could be a little more exciting. The only thing is that the overarching objective of the final paper could have been communicated better instead of just how to write well for it. ",

I went to every lecture and did all the readings, but did worse on the midterm than I did in any of my stem classes, which was frustrating. I feel like effort in the class was not reflected in grades, a sentiment shared by many peers.\r\n\r\nOverall I loved the lectures and while the final paper was challenging and somewhat vague, it was a good learning experience. The readings were very interesting. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course was undoubtedly the expertise of Professors Berland and Warner in presenting such an expanse of time filled with important events in a palatable and engaging matter. I really loved lectures. The big weakness was that your experience, and feeback in the course in general, depends entirely on the quality of TA you are assigned to. I'm sure it's hard to screen for quality in TAs but the lack of engagement and cooperation in our section as a result of our TA really tainted the experience for me and, I fear, my grade. Comparing experiences with my friends in other sections was a bit disheartening. ",

            "\u00a0The course was not at all challenging but also the professors and TAs were never up front about their expectations. I think that in order to really get more out of the course and enjoy it more, it would have been helpful to know what was expected of me! For instance, for the exams I learned pretty much everything from the course (dates, people, big ideas, etc). I wrote what I felt was a really good and cohesive response to the questions but then the feedback I got was \"good, seems like you know everything, I would've liked to hear you talk more about this!\" But there's no way that anybody could know that without getting inside the TA/Professor's head. The grading really didn't reflect what student's knew. It seemed like in part because it was such an easy course, they just graded kind of randomly in order to have a better distribution of grades rather than giving all As which is kind of annoying. ",

By learning about the state of medicine at the time and how the media portrayed it you learn a lot about history as well due to the historical context which I thought was really cool. The lectures were very engaging because we analyzed old posters and photographs as well as watched some videos about topics like mental illness, venereal disease, and tuberculosis. Furthermore, the readings were interesting and pretty manageable. The only thing I would suggest is to have the lecture slides uploaded on Canvas. ",
            "\u00a0Both lecturers were a little quiet (probably because it was in the YUAG), but I thought the lectures were very engaging and interesting since they had so much media and film. I understood the need to go non-chronologically, but that was sometimes a little confusing. However, I think section can make or break the course-- I didn't have a great experience with my TA, so the exams were unnecessarily difficult and stressful. ",

I like the lectures from week to week and the information is interesting and relevant.\r\n\r\nI think that the course could be improved with less or shorter readings. I would also like if more of the slides could be posted (or, if picture copyright is a concern, at least some form of lecture notes or summary of relevant information) to make it easier to study. Finally, I think that the tests could be improved. I would appreciate if there were some kind of guidelines (like a grading rubric or sample essay) and, in the case of the picture questions in the midterm, if the questions were a little more recognizable/easier to write about.

This course was extremely useful for general understanding of the world around us. The only weakness I can think of was maybe a lack of communication with the professors, but TAs were extremely engaging and very helpful so it wasnt a big deal. ",

This made for a much more sensible studying fashion, as you can understand what's happened in themes or in chronological order, especially if you pay attention in lecture. The major weakness of this course was the lack of order of the information as it's given to you. Lecture topics were very interesting but all over the place in terms of order throughout the semester. Any review session gives a clear timeline, though, and it's easy to make your own. ",

The class focuses on media, so it's always very helpful to see the images or video clips they share as part of the lecture content. Something I found myself wishing while studying before exams is that important names and dates had been included in the slides, just to make sure I got them down when taking notes. I also thought the review session held by Megann before the final exam was super helpful!! ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this course to any student. Its an incredible class that can be relevant to any major at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Media and Medicine is an amazing lecture and was I was excited for the lectures throughout the semester. Although there is a lot to read, you can pretty much skim through the readings for section. The exams were also pretty reasonable, as long as you paid attention during section and lecture. Overall, you will learn a lot of interesting and fun aspects on the history of the American health care world. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course material is interesting and the structure allows the student to investigate what they find interesting about it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting class even if it's not within your major, it applies to a lot of different fields within lectures (mental health, advertising, gender roles, race, medicine, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0This class is a gut depending on your TA. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are really interesting and worth going to. The topics you explore and discuss are all very relevant to our lives and important to think about as a person constantly exposed to all kinds of medicine-related media. The workload is very reasonable and not hard to keep up with. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to others because it's a really great class that offers incredible insight into a profession and medium that have both profoundly shaped our lives in ways we didn't even realize. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are interesting and I liked the course, but be wary of the grading. It was far stricter than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a great class. Be aware that your experience is going to almost completely depend on the quality of the TA you get. If after the first couple of sections anything seems off, I'd book it to another section. Hopefully that will save you from the trouble I experienced! Otherwise, this course is SO interesting. As a STEM major, I learned a lot about history and of course media and medicine. But for me it was really great to plug in the scientific timeline I had in my head to historical events and to understand mindsets throughout the 20th century. Super cool and would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is not a lot of work and this knowledge is worth having. ",
            "\u00a0yes! super interesting, fun course. ",
            "\u00a0This is actually one of the courses at Yale that I've left feeling like I understand how history has shaped medicine today- super applicable content and fun lecture! also it's low key a gut because most of the exam prompts are common sense lol ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend if others were interested in the intersect of media and medicine in America. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. I thought the material was super interesting, the professors were engaging and the readings weren't super heavy and were very reflective of what was being taught. Definitely a chill class to take if you are interested in history or medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Super interesting for everyone. I'm an econ major and wanted a humanities credit. This one was perfect for me. I really liked the material and the workload is minimal. ",
            "\u00a0Not really - the course is really low workload which can be nice but I wouldn't say it's just an easy A. The grading depends pretty much solely on your TA and different TAs have different expectations and grade differently. However, it was really hard getting just grades back without any feedback on ways to improve. Overall a very frustrating course. I can't say I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great way to learn about the involvement of media in the medical field and it opens one up to a new side of medicine often unseen to the average person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a nice, relaxing, fun course where I still learned a lot about history, medicine, and how the media influences how we see things. While we learned about a lot of past campaigns, many of the techniques and stigmas can still be seen today and it's cool to now be able to recognize and watch out for those now. This class also only had a midterm, a seven page paper, and a final. This is a great class for a STEM major who needs a HU credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- if you're at all interested in film, history, medicine and public health, it's very interesting and important. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Even if you're not an HSHM or even premed, the course was very insightful and has changed how I approach media advertisements. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course.  It teaches you a lot of important things about the state of medicine in America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good overview of the history of medicine and public policy in America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is so great. Lectures are really interesting, the topics are relevant to everyone's lives, and the workload is not bad at all. I would definitely recommend this class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have actively recommended this class to other students because it gives historical context to medicine and its effect on media and vice versa. Thought it was a very interesting history course for non-history majors. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Light workload, interesting content, easy to retain. It is a win win. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I didn't particularly enjoy this class, but it was okay, and I wouldn't recommend against it if you are interested. The lectures were average in terms of content/excitement, the material was easy enough to comprehend/learn, readings were kind of long and not always exciting (but on par with other HSHM lecture courses). Midterm and final consist entirely of essay questions -- not my preferred format and I didn't feel like I was given enough guidelines to be prepared to give the kind of answers they wanted at first (plus the midterm is pretty rushed), but I know a lot of people found the tests to be easy enough so I think it just comes down to stuff like your preferences, strengths, and TF/section. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is centered around two entities that are very present in our lives, and the history and growth of media and medicine is quite interesting. The workload is fine, and it's a class that allows you to determine your level of engagement by how much work you put in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for both film majors and pre-med/STEM majors alike since I found this subject interesting even though I do not plan to major in HSHM. The workload is not terrible; the readings are the basis of what is talked about in lecture from Prof Warner and Berland; discussion section is once a week, this class is different from other non-STEM classes I've taken since media analysis is at the center, instead of more contextual things; TA did not really given super clear feedback in the beginning on how to improve that; lectures are also not posted on Canvas, so in order to make the best of the class, you should take diligent notes ",
            "\u00a0The individual lectures were usually interesting, but the course was disorganized. I would have preferred a more chronological approach to the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone considering a career in medicine / science or a career in media / journalism would benefit from taking this course. Really enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this class. It was an excellent class and had a reasonable course load. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting, a little gutty, but I learned a lot and I enjoyed myself. This class is probably really easy to get an A- in, but really depends on your TA's specific interests to get an A in, which I think is quite unfair. ",
            "\u00a0This class will superficially expand your knowledge of how the media has historically influenced medicine. It will not touch on any current events and modern media, nor will it challenge your thinking in any way. Take it if you like sitting in history classes memorizing facts. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course. The material is fascinating, the lecturing good, and the workload is such that you can actually enjoy the course without being overwhelmed. I definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Media and Medicine is a great course! You analyze films, books and posters that relate to medicine. Enormous numbers of premeds + midterm/7 page paper/final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Many lectures were so interesting because they were on topics that we would know of/understand/like and then go deeper into the semantics of how/why they came about. It wasn't overly full of historical terms or boring lectures, so take it! ",
            "\u00a0would 100% recommend to another student. Not hard for the amount of information you are learning. Interesting material and pretty easy workload ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the workload is pretty light and very manageable. I will say that going to lecture helps if you aren't able to do all of the readings, because the lectures usually give you a pretty good understanding of important events and content that will be needed for the exam.

            "\u00a0No doubt about it, this class was a gut. ",
