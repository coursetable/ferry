            "\u00a0I loved this course- I took the other half last semester and this semester was just as amazing! I learned so much about writing research papers, increased my presentation abilities in section and with the oral exam, and learned a ton about France's history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about not only French history, but about the French people, the country, and the culture in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained lots of knowledge about nineteenth-century France, obviously, including the role of different intellectual movements, the role of class, religion, regional variation, language and national identity, economics and historical contingency. Primary source analysis and secondary source synthesis were also important skills I gained from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I learned a moderate amount from this class, but not a whole lot beyond what one typically expects from a low-level history class in college or an AP class in high school. I learned a lot of facts about France and about John Merriman's personal life (which was often interesting and worth hearing about, to be fair!) I do have a good sense of the basic historical forces at play in France between 1789 and 1871, largely thanks to the assigned readings, and some limited sense of the experience of an \"average\" Frenchman in this time, thanks to Merriman's focus on the common man. ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive understanding of the timeline of French revolutions from 1789-1871. Political, social, cultural, diplomatic themes and subjects were explored throughout the period. Learn about some fascinating figures like Napoleon/Robespierre an gain an appreciation for the difficulty in sustaining a democracy/republic in the context of the power of the feudal system and church. ",
            "\u00a0The modern history of France is so much more complex and interesting than I ever would have known. This course will help you understand how France has been molded and how the culture has developed since the end of the 18th century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about both French History, and important skills like critical reading and understanding major themes. Unbelievable class- huge fan. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved and I learnt more about French history and how its impacted modern French society ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about French history in this course--hadn't taken any european history before it, so it was a real eye opener. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding of French history from this course, particularly with regard to what could be called the \"social history\" of France -- an approach that goes beyond the \"great man\" version of history and follows instead the everyday citizens that were often the real engines of social change. Professor Merriman is particularly fond of this method, and it's refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0We developed historical writing skills including researching primary sources and using them in historical essays. ",
            "\u00a0I knew very little about this period in France's history, so this class is probably one of the most informative courses I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the French Revolution and the subsequent revolutions of 19th century France. I learned how governmental actions intersected with citizens' sentiments and how the passions of French citizens paved the way for revolutions worldwide. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the inner workings that lead to the French Revolution and the following events, but also the inner workings of French society today. "

            "\u00a0Great course, awesome professor who makes lecture fun for all with his stories etc. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes lectures are a bit hard to follow but other than that I cannot think of any improvements. It's a great course! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is well-structured for student learning. The sections are especially helpful in clarifying what may have been a bit of an unclear or tangential lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course, although at times I felt that the syllabus could have been more explicit. What percentage of one's grade is the midterm worth? What about the paper, the final, and section participation? Does lecture attendance count? Furthermore, more details on the scope. length, and other requirements of the paper may have been helpful (e.g. perhaps a prompt). That said, the freedom to pick a topic of personal interest was rewarding and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is a compelling and charismatic lecturer and he obviously had a lot of knowledge of the course's content. The TFs were also very helpful and structured section well. \r\n\r\nIf I had recommendations, it would be for the lectures to be more fact-based and less focused on storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\n-Merriman is an entertaining guy--has lots of interesting life perspectives and experiences to share, and clearly really has a love for the country of France and its history\r\n-a good basic history course that lets you explore different approaches to history at a pretty low level\r\n-the focus is on the content, not stupid grading metrics or trivial things like that\r\n-does make you love France \r\n-you will know a lot of things about France when you're done! \r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-section was very disorganized\r\n-lectures were often quite rambly and focused on points that could have been said much more concisely--lecture time was hardly ever carefully crafted or planned out. this is likely because Merriman is an old guy who's tired of doing the same lectures for the bajillionth year and wants to keep things lively for himself. regardless, this made it a bit hard to focus on the larger scale structure of the course sometimes \r\n-most people in the class didn't do the assigned readings, which made discussion sections a bit difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: knowledgeable and entertaining professor, well-run sections, interesting lectures, strong subject matter which was also not too complex.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: wish there was a map quiz (France then, and France now) like in other history courses I've taken which is never hard but really helps with getting a sense for the geography and people/places of a country. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures could be better organized. Expectations for the midterm, final, and paper were also not very clear until shortly before they were to be completed. I really appreciated Professor Merriman's experience, incredible depth of knowledge, and excitement for the subject. ",
            "\u00a0This is an ok course. The lectures, although consistently enjoyable, do not cover very much material and could largely be replaced by reading Professor Merriman's textbook. There are actually too few readings assigned so that sections can't be much of a discussion and are mostly used to clarify the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The course is set up to be student-friendly. Oral/discussion finals are huge for saving you time during finals period/reading week. If you don't do well on the first midterm you can still bounce back fine (or that is what Merriman says at least). ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses. Between Professor Merrimans lectures and Charlottes sections, I had the perfect combination for success. If you enjoy learning there is no better class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were pretty good and Merriman cares a lot about his students. I think his lectures are a little disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: professor Merriman ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is subject matter and Merriman\r\nWeakness is sometimes the lectures are a tiny bit all over the place, but that's Merriman! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is extremely passionate about all things France -- its language, its history, and its culture. That shows in every single lecture. His teaching style is conversational and exciting. This isn't the sort of class that is conducive to meticulous, organized note-taking; instead, you can (and should) just sit back and listen to him explain the key ideas, and you can write down the big-picture stuff as you go along.\r\n\r\nThe TFs are fantastic (at least when I took the class). I can't overstate this. They are brilliant, enthusiastic, patient people, and they are excellent at clarifying Professor Merriman's lectures and boiling them down to key historical concepts that are easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0The Final Paper in addition to a Final Exam is a bit excessive. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course effectively went through the period the title describes (1789-1871). I appreciated the relatively low reading load because I think as a result most people did the entirety of the reading which made sections much more productive. However, the lectures tended to be disjointed from the assigned reading and sections which made it a bit blurred as to what material we would be tested on for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed this course. The lectures and he sections were very entertaining and the readings not too heavy, but interesting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course! Merriman is an excellent professor with a strong passion for France. You will come to view the country in a new light and appreciate the struggle of the French people in this era. It is very fascinating to view French history through the social lens that Merriman often uses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it was fun, informative, and approachable. As a History major, I still think this class would be good for anyone with an interest in the time period, regardless of major or background. ",
            "\u00a0Will give you a good overall view of french history from 1789-1876, with some cultural views as well. The Professor is amazing, though if you're looking for a more formal/intense study of french history you'll have to provide a little structure yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Interesting and not too stressful ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't necessarily recommend taking this course. I was hooked during shopping period b/c of Merriman's flair and passion and wanted to take the subject just because he excited me. However, as the course progressed, I found that sometimes he lacked organization in his lectures and it made it difficult to follow the structure of the course. Ultimately, Merriman is a character, and an influential historian, and it's fun and fascinating to hear his (very strong) opinions and life experiences. And you will develop a love of France from taking this class, along with some basic knowledge of a lot of facts and a sense of various approaches to history (e.g., dwelling on the \"common man\" vs. leaders and major political party shifts, etc.) However, this course didn't change my life or make me think deeply in ways that most good Yale classes have. I didn't get any feedback on any work I turned in the entire semester, and I'm not sure I got much of anything out of the sections. This is a fun, light class to supplement a schedule--not an essential in my mind. Take it if you enjoy watching Merriman talk about his life and have a love for, or a particular reason, to study French history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for any lover of history ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated Professor Merriman's experience, incredible depth of knowledge, and excitement for the subject, but lectures were often difficult to follow given their sporadic and disorganized nature. It was difficult to know what to study for the midterm from my notes from class. That said, I really liked the content of the course; French revolutionary history is influential and important and I left with a considerably deeper knowledge of it than I had going in. I chose to take this class partly because I was blown away by Professor Merriman's first lecture during shopping period. However, the course certainly did not meet my expectations, and I am not sure I can recommend it wholeheartedly to other students, although I did still learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone at Yale, not just a History major. Professor Merman is so passionate about what he teaches, and it is such a pivotal span of European as well as World History that all can benefit from the experience of his lecture. He is committed to teaching and hates the concept of testing, so your midterm and final are catered for you to succeed. It is a wonderful class that I honestly wish I could take again. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe. This is the easiest history class I have taken at Yale, which is really neither here nor there. If you've taken European History with any depth in High School, though, this course will likely be redundant. Professor Merriman is lovely, but disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome and interesting course, and same can be said of Merriman. If you are doing the European track for the History major this would be a great course to take. Even if you aren't a history major it seems like a course that would not be too intense to handle. \r\nThe one research paper is the most challenging aspect of the course for sure, but if you find a topic that interests you than it can actually be fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- 10/10. This is the best class I have taken at Yale. Should be mandatory for a history major. Regardless of your particular focus, the skills learned transfer anywhere. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's a good course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, professor Merriman is an amazing professor and his knowledge of French history is incredible. I was fascinated by the course and enjoyed all the reading ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. While the subject matter itself is interesting, the structure of the course - ranging from Merriman's lectures to the readings - was a disorganized mess. Professor Merriman is a nice man, but his lectures are disjointed, meandering, and confusing. A significant portion of lecture, especially those in the second half of the semester, was devoted to long digressions on contemporary France and Merriman's distaste for tourists. Most of the knowledge I now have on the subject came from Wikipedia, as my lecture and reading notes were largely useless. ",
            "\u00a0Great course--Merriman is wonderful and a legend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I recommend this course to other students without reservation. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting class, Merriman is a really chill professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, especially if you are interested in France and its history. Professor Merriman's lecture style may be confusing for those with a rigorously organized way of operating, especially because he doesn't really teach in chronological order. Don't expect a clear structure. Just think about the concepts he highlights in class, write down the general ideas, and then let the TFs clarify what seems confusing (and they'll also make the chronology clear, which is extremely helpful).\r\n\r\nOverall, if the study of French history and culture appeals to you and you're willing to be flexible in your learning style (meaning just going to lecture and absorbing Professor Merriman's talks, rather than trying to keep a rigorous note-taking regimen), then I would definitely recommend this course to you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and No. While the course is interesting and has an easier workload than most other history courses, the lectures are very disorganized. Merriman is very nice and a cool guy to talk to outside of class but his lectures are about 20% historical fact and 80% talking about his homes in France. He isn't able to stay on topic for very long which makes it hard to pay attention in class. The one good thing about his class is the exam. It's an oral exam which only takes thirty minutes of your time. He provides the seven questions of which the TA will pick three beforehand so you're easily able to prepare. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect survey course for this period of France's history. Merriman is a living legend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students looking to increase their historical knowledge of France and who is looking for a small lecture with an enriching section. ",
            "\u00a0I would greatly recommend this course to any student, whether history major or not. It is a very entertaining course and, if one is interested in French culture, very insightful. "
