            "\u00a0I understood a lot more about the cases in Arabic grammar, and I really got the verb forms drilled into me. I learned a lot of vocab as well. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed an advanced understanding of Arabic grammar as well as significantly expanded vocabulary in addition to improved speaking and listening skills. This was a great course for learning standard arabic as well as Syrian dialect. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot of Arabic vocabulary and my grammar has significantly improved thanks to Professor Aziz's efforts and competency. He is truly a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the most important rules of Arabic grammar to the point where I can understand the grammar in Arabic texts such as news articles or short stories. I learned a large amount of Arabic vocabulary to the point of holding higher level conversations. I learned strategies for approaching Arabic texts and conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Continuation of Arabic-- more grammer, vocabulary, culture, and songs. "

            "\u00a0I think shaami is not integrated well with the course, so I did not end up learning much shaami at all. I think L4 teaches grammar very well and really helps you understand the fundamental structure of arabic. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the amazing teacher Muhammad Aziz who strives to provide his students with a very strong background in the Arabic language while also taking the time to challenge the students while still making sure that everyone understands and is caught up. ",
            "\u00a0I think that overall the course is really well structured and it's clear that Prof Aziz always prepares it beforehand so the class is pretty smooth. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size is really helpful in improving our individual levels of Arabic. It is easy to engage with the other students and work together to improve our language skills. The textbook format of the course is structured and beneficial, though I am not a proponent of all the companion website exercises. We had more writing exercises than in past semesters which helped improve my knowledge of the language much more. We spoke almost exclusively in Arabic which helped with our speaking skills.\r\n\r\nThe grammar is difficult so we should have more exercises in that. ",
            "\u00a0The assesments in this class do not reflect the level of engagement with the course material.  I think students would benefit from weekly vocab quizzes that are about 10 mins in length in orger to ensure everyone is up to date on material.  With only 4 quizzes and 3 tests, there is a lot of weight on very few assessments and there was no partial credit for some of the tests. "

            "\u00a0Take this course if you want to understand grammar a lot better and acquire more vocab. If you want to improve your speaking and comprehension, however, you will have to supplement that quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take the class with Muhammad Aziz. He is wonderful and a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Prof Aziz is great and you would learn so much. Coming from a French school and not knowing much Arabic, taking this course with Prof Aziz really helped. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning Arabic at the high intermediate level. This class heavily focuses on Arabic grammar and vocabulary so students should be mindful of that before signing up for this course. ",
            "\u00a0yes, continue taking Arabic, but consider going abroad if you actually want to learn the language!  This class is very independent study in style. "
