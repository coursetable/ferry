            "\u00a0The discussions and new ways of thinking that I've experienced through this class have spilled over into many other aspects of my life, in a pleasantly surprising way. I'm a STEM major, so the course is a refreshing exposure to humanities. I also found it very satisfying and beneficial to my intellectual and personal growth. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about how animals exist in Western philosophy, ethics, and literature. It also was useful for practicing  applying theory (philosophy, cognitive science) to literature in order to ask deeper questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a phenomenal exposure to animals in literature and in ethical theory. I enjoyed reading and exploring how animals have been perceived throughout history, and gained a better grasp as how our society views them today. ",
            "\u00a0Information about animal rights and cognition, how to analyze texts seriously ",
            "\u00a0SUCH A COOL CLASS TAKE IT!!! The workload is fine it is a lot of reading but only two papers, professor Kramnick is awesome and really cares about his students, even brought his dog to class sometimes ",
            "\u00a0Learned to think about animal consciousness, literary representation of animals, and our ethical duties towards them. ",
            "\u00a0portrayal of animals in literature ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about animal ethics, the food industry, the history of animals in literature, and even specifics on the physiologies of particular animals. \r\nIt also created a space for solid seminar discussions and to work on writing papers. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I simply wish there were more time to review the books we read. Possibly having a separate course for animal literature would have allowed more time to go in depth. The animal ethics portion was very well executed. ",
            "\u00a0Format of the class discussion was great but a little stale after a while, a field trip would have been nice ",
            "\u00a0be prepared to speak at least once every class because participation is a big chunk of your grade, go and meet with him about your papers he will help a lot and is really insightful ",
            "\u00a0I would personally have enjoyed a greater focus on literature (and more literary theory) rather than moral philosophy. There was somewhat of a disconnect between learning about ethical duties and analyzing the role of animals in literature. ",
            "\u00a0great readings, good discussions, I like that the professor started each seminar with a mini-lecture to show us how we're all moving along in the course ",
            "\u00a0strengths: content was interesting, and covered a wide breadth of types of literature that involved animals (for example, everything from old fables to Peter Singer) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a phenomenal course. The topic was interesting and Professor Kramnick is a thoughtful instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the papers were great and the discussions were in depth and interesting ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! Kramnick is awesome and the class offers a lot of unique perspectives on animals, will make you want to go home and hug your pet ",
            "\u00a0I'd be hesitant to recommend it. The course really doesn't go in-depth on literature or literary theory (despite the course name). Seminar discussions were often quiet and dominated by Professor Kramnick. Discussions mainly summarized the readings and I felt I gained few new insights from them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course, but don't be fooled into thinking it will be a gut. It is super interesting with (accessible) readings from many different authors and viewpoints, and a top 5 course I've taken at Yale. ",
