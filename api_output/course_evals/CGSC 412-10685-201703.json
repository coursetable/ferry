            "\u00a0Learned a lot about different traits that make humans unique and how many of those treats may not be as unique as we think. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how humans evolved particular traits and what makes them different from other species, as well as various ways of approaching human uniqueness through empirical evidence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the enormous body of literature and research that have been done that theorize about human uniqueness. It was very interesting to discuss in class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about animal cognition and some about human as well ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about comparative psychology and evolution that I was completely unaware of. I also got a lot of practice with digesting psychology research and learning how to write a psychology research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight on different aspects of possible human uniqueness. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of different aspects/abilities humans have that are thought to be unique via journal papers, theory and comparative studies. I learned about animal abilities compared to human performance. I also learned to critically and closely read journal papers for discussion. Ultimately I took away that there is no one feature that determines human uniqueness, and that uniqueness may be more of a quantitative quality than a qualitative. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths were the discussions. It as helpful that Mark led them for the most part and opened it up for us to have conversations more easily. Feedback/comments on reading responses were also interesting at times and provided useful information or sources to follow up on interesting topics ",
            "\u00a0The course would likely be better taught as a smaller seminar. Our class had (I think) over 20 people, so there were big disparities in participation. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion over the readings as a concept is very good - I really like the outline of the class. However, the setup of the room and the size of the class (too large) undermined the course - the table was very long so that people who were far away could not or just did not talk as much and there were too many people that it felt like a lot of people didn't get involved in the conversation. Also, I felt as though the end paper wasn't really related to the content of the course as proposing our own study didn't really relate to what we learned about human uniqueness. While I really like the concept of doing readings and discussing together, it might have been nice to vary the format of the class once in a while - watching a video for the first time together and discussing or something like that - maybe talking about implications in society or different philosophical approaches. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions were very interesting and I think the design of the course made it so you had to keep up + engage with the material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Reading response format is good and makes the class more engaging\r\n-Very interesting readings\r\n-Class is well structured such that each class meeting is connected to the theme and to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Mark lets the class drive discussion, which usually works, but our class was particularly quiet. At times, I wanted him to take more of an active role, by forcing people to bring up in class interesting points that they wrote in their reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the reading response system where there was a pre and post. They were pretty low commitment if you did the readings, and the post pushed me to ask the question that I had in my pre if the class discussion didn't get to it. \r\n\r\nA weakness I saw was that the readings became a little dry towards the end. I definitely enjoyed the earlier readings where there was a lot more theories and evidence that was presented in the papers. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was we did a lot of interesting readings and learned a lot of different material. A weakness of this course is that because its a seminar its dependent on the participation of the class and our class was not very active. ",
            "\u00a0Having both the pre and post reading responses helped to solidify information. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting! Themes vary; lots of features explored. Professor is helpful and gives lots of great feedback. Papers are diverse. Reading guides and guided questions for discussion helped. Organized curriculum.\r\nWeaknesses: the timing of the class....it was kind of hard to focus from 3:30-5:20 on a Monday especially right before dinner. Also maybe instead of just research papers the readings could be mixed media: TED talks, articles, reviews (like in the last week's readings). ",
            "\u00a0Awesome class, cannot really think of anything to improve other than building a little bit of camaraderie amongst the students by splitting off into small groups if a discussion is stalling out. ",
            "\u00a0It was well taught with great content. The assignments were designed to build our skills in writing and thinking. No weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! Great course, chill, not much work, super interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Even if you aren't super interested in the material, Professor Sheskin is very knowledgeable and you can learn a lot from him. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting class, and I would recommend it to another student if they were interested in reading scientific papers about psychology. If they are more into philosophical/soul-mind-body/religious/etc., then this class is not for them as it is more focused on scientific aspects. ",
            "\u00a0Would only recommend if you're a cogsci/psych major. If you are it's a really good look at some interesting topics in the field. If you aren't you might be a little out of your depth ",
            "\u00a0This class is fantastic! Very interesting readings, great professor and fair assignments. However, be aware that this course is definitely geared towards those with extensive knowledge of psychology and Mark expects the class to drive the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Incredibly interesting material with an amazing and interesting professor. Not huge workload and only meets once a week. Would definitely take the course again or take a year version of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty interesting and a good sampler of features of human uniqueness. It's cross-listed as psych and cogsci but there are a lot of cogsci theories (like merge) that you might not have really learned about if you were a psych major. I liked the content and readings but in general don't enjoy seminars/discussions that much. I probably would have reeeeally loved the class if it were a lecture, or at least maybe part lecture. Either way I enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, great class and very interesting ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great content, great teaching. Even as a senior focused on comparative cognition, I came away learning so much. "
