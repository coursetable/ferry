            "\u00a0This course really opens your eyes to so many truths about Iran that we never get to learn here in the United States otherwise.  Professor Siamdoust is a wealth of knowledge, informed by her extensive first-hand experience with the topic and her scholarly work following her time in Iran.  Professor Siamdoust is also incredibly insightful and is able to provide an alternate, non-Western perspective on the issues, which is frankly necessary for any true, in-depth study of Iran. Not only is the material incredibly interesting, but looking at Iran through the cultural lens by analyzing film, music, and media makes the work all that much more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible course, which taught me an exceptional amount about the historical and modern culture of Iran. Given the amount of Orientalist literature that pervades this area of studies, I was excited by the nuisance of this course. I developed a discerning eye for literature and news written about Iran particularly the culture of Iran. I also gained an invaluable level of knowledge about Iran, its history, its politics, its people, its diaspora, and its culture. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a strong background in recent Iranian history through a valuable cultural approach. Not only did I learn about the intricacies of the politics and government of the state, but engaged intimately with many aspects of Iranian life through media. We did this by engaging directly with music and film. Not only do I feel like I have a greater understanding of the history of the Islamic Republic, but I am comfortable that I have a valuable understanding of its nuance and anomalies. "

            "\u00a0This course is structured very well.  I really liked the reading responses because they force you to reflect on the readings before coming to class (but not every week, so that you can choose to write about the readings that you particularly liked or were interested in).  Professor Siamdoust is great about creating an outline for each class, so that I felt like I knew what I was supposed to take away from each week, while still allowing for plenty of discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was brilliantly constructed. The seminar discussions were focused, but flexible enough for dynamic conversation to be had and connections to be formed. The course readings are high in volume but the information is vital and incredibly accessible. I have no suggestions for improvement; it was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course were fantastic. Professor Siamdoust was a phenomenal discussion leader. The assignments were constructive and engaging. I have no criticism. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! A course like this is critical to understanding Iran, but moreover crucial for any student attempting to amass a well-rounded knowledge of the world.  Yes, it's a seminar, so there is reading (which I recommend doing to make sure you get the most out of the class) and you're expected talk in class, but that level of participation only benefits your learning. Definitely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Very much so. It was exceptional. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student and have done so already. The lens through which we studied history and society was valuable and challenging and I'm grateful for the intellectual experience. "
