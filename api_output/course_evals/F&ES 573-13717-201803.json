            "\u00a0I learned that there are many issues relating to urban ecology impacting communities all across the country - that there are many moving parts. It is necessary to tackle these issues with a multi-disciplinary approach and really understand all the relevant points. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible class and I was impressed by the high quality of content and insight we learned! The themes Morgan chose were excellent  compelling, exigent, relevant to our urban world (even as an Arch major -- Im not in forestry). He really puts his own spin on each topic, making it relevant. Definitely take this class if youre interested in a wide variety of topics related to urban design, but also want a well-tailored amount of depth + detail! \r\n\r\nTopics/knowledge - We covered topics from community-focused urban design in the industrial age all the way to the how urban slums or the science of climate changes is drastically altering our world. Every lecture was really interesting, with the *right* amount of anecdotes from Morgan to illustrate the examples and make them come to life. I felt like I went from 0 knowledge about urban ecology to a high level over the course of this semester. It was all enjoyable, which can be hard with these technical topics. \r\n\r\nSkills - probably biggest skill here was parsing! Its a funny term but essentially the ability to deconstruct a VERY complex problem down to the fundamental connections, and represent this in a way that is palatable + understandable to an audience. Super useful if you need to give Board Presentations, etc in the future. Also helpful for identifying ACTIONABLE ways to impact the urban world. We drew these diagrams for one reading a week. Practice was really helpful! \r\n\r\nIt also seemed that a lot of my classmates got a lot more confident in speaking over the course of the semester due to the practice presenting this work! Morgan emphasized the importance of this skill (due to his real-world experience) and provided really useful gentle + effective feedback through the semester. \r\n\r\nBiggest Insight  - Practical, Real Change is hard. For one, lots of organizations, communities, land use frameworks (etc) have to come together. Scale is important and completely changes the needed approach. BUT. Change is not impossible. A good understanding of organizational frameworks and the parts of a complex problem, and ability to choose good leverage points, give you the best shot at initiating it. ",

            "\u00a0I learned systems thinking through a tool we developed in this class called parsing. I also learned about urban ecology as a field and the methods it uses to understand cities, people, and places. ",
            "\u00a0The most valuable learning opportunities in this course were from learning about how to \"parse\" a problem, or analyze its parts and perspectives, and develop effective solutions. We applied these skills to a problem of our choice, and with this framework, I felt capable of identifying the downfalls of the problem we examined and how the problem can be addressed to remedy its social challenges. This analytical ability will be valuable in the future. I also most enjoyed the class that delved into the topic of environmental justice. The readings for that topic were the most eye-opening. ",

            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectations. Wasn't sure what to expect from the syllabus alone (covered a lot of topics). But first few lectures were rigorous, interesting, insightful. Morgan is a great lecturer, it comes naturally to him! Was surprised in a great way by his amount of practical experience, which makes its way into the way the course is structured. The topics and practice we did felt applicable. Which is great, not many classes at Yale are. I think the same class with a different professor would have felt different, potentially less practical and alive. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Morgan is a pretty great guy. He is optimistic about the world changing in good ways, but also knows it takes a good amount of nuance, insight, and flex to make it happen. He instilled this in his stories and it was refreshing, compared to other classes at yale, to know things can be done. ",
            "\u00a0decently so ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well. The first few classes made it seem like there might be more discussion/social sciences than there were, and I do feel a bit let down on that front. ",
            "\u00a0I did not expect to come away with a \"hard\" skill, so to speak, of being able to parse problems. This tangible skill, in additional to contextual knowledge about urban ecology, exceeded my expectations for the course. ",
            "\u00a0It's a broad topic, so I didn't expect anything too specific or in depth, but I wish we had talked more directly about the concepts, problems, and solutions in urban ecological systems, as opposed to looking at them through the lens of the parsings. ",
            "\u00a0Well ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",

            "\u00a0A big weakness of this class was that the assignments were not very clear from the beginning. It was difficult to understand what was expected of us throughout these assignments, especially since we never got feedback on them. It was very clear that we were the experiment class. Once the semester came to an end, it was easier to see why these assignments were important, but figuring out what was required was difficult. I think a major improvement would be to give the students weekly feedback so they know how they are doing and if they are on the right track with the parsings - not just the people who were presenting for the day.\r\n\r\nA strength was the broad range of topics covered throughout the course. It was interesting to see how conservation, water issues, and environmental justice all were issues in an urban ecology problem. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very practical, very enjoyable. Great lecturer. Really well selected topics. Morgan is a great teacher and instilled an appreciation for the complex world of urban ecology, and how we can insert ourselves to initiate real, effective, change. Big focus on practical insights (not just philosophizing). I learned more in this class than most of my other classes this semester. Take this to get a great overview of urban ecology topics. \r\n\r\nI loved that we had the chance to Shape our learning through 3 ways. (1) Every week you choose 1 of the readings to focus and parse. (2) You also get to choose an example from online sources relevant to the week and talk about it a bit in writing form. (3). The final project is a choose-your-own-adventure. This allowed everyone to zoom into previous work they had done in the working world, or focus on a topic of interest. I loved it. Everyone had a lot more energy in their presentations than if the topics were assigned. \r\n\r\nThere definitely was NOT too much work in the class. It was conducive to discussion /absorption and reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Not many. Just thinking back, I guess there are a few topics that were a bit less memorable. The patch dynamics lecture was very technical, and probably the least memorable for me. Maybe more important for others? There was a lot of reading and it could be hard to do it all! but it was all interesting, so its hard to complain. TBH, a quick \"abstract\" or 3-4 sentence quote or \"most significant takeaways\" (something written by TF/student/Morgan) at the top of the more \"technical\" ones might make them more compelling. ",
            "\u00a0more transparency of homework assignments and class assignments ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Parsing, field trip, final group project, examples of interest\r\n\r\nWeakness: In-class lecture was formatted strangely and mostly felt like a waste of time. I think more activities/discussion would have been more worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I think that seeing other students' problem parsings was valuable. However, I would have enjoyed more time spent listening to Dr. Morgan Grove lecturing, perhaps instead of having students present an example of interest every week. While problem parsings were valuable, I would have preferred to have gained more contextual knowledge through lectures.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I think that we would have benefited from getting feedback on our problem parsings on a weekly basis. It felt like we sent our parsings into a black hole, so not gaining feedback was a missed learning opportunity... Especially because it was such a central part of our final project, we might have been able to meet Dr. Grove's expectations better if we'd known whether we were heading in the right direction. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Morgan being a practitioner with lots of experience. The field trip was great and brought to life the issues we were discussing. It was very thoughtfully planned out which was appreciated. The teaching team overall was great and it was neat to have Colleen sit in class for an additional practitioner perspective. \r\nWeaknesses: Broad scope, would have liked more in-depth looks at case studies, or more systematic way of considering urban/environmental problems and what makes a successful solution. More time spent on systems thinking and causal loop diagrams (since that seems to be a focus at FES) as opposed to Morgan's parsing model (we talked a lot about how to best organize or add symbols/colors to our diagrams which I feel like should sit in another course). I thought the lectures were often too short and the parsings/examples of interest presentations took too much class time. ",
            "\u00a0Good work experience ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting, and I really loved how we could choose our own topic for the final presentation/report. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was learning how to understand complex situations in a visual and different way. I thought that part and the field trip were well done. However, I think the weakness of the course was not learning going into the subject more academically and learning how to visually show information. I had a hard time visually showing what I was thinking especially not knowing how to use design software and not having a design or visual background. I felt I was at a disadvantage because of that.

            "\u00a0Personalize your learning! There are ample opportunities to do this in the class. Use them. Choose topics youre interested in for your parsing/example, and use the presentations to get feedback from Morgan/Clara/Colleen. \r\n\r\nAsk more questions! Morgan has FASCINATING stories to tell from his time in the field. Take advantage of it. Also, you can ask subjective questions too. It's cool to hear a real practitioner have an optimistic, grounded outlook on the field and opportunities for change. \r\n\r\nLook ahead at the readings, select the most interesting ones ahead of time (week before), then download them to your phone. Read them while you're eating lunch or a snack  gives the ideas more time to \"marinate\" in your head. This will help you create (1) more interesting takeaways and parsings about the problem (2) help you personalize the reading to things you notice in the outside world when you're out and about. ",
            "\u00a0take it if you want a flexible teaching of urban ecology ",
            "\u00a0Definitely go on the field trip. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Morgan Grove has a lot of experience and knowledge to share about working on environmental issues in urban environments, so ask questions, talk to him after class, and read as many of the readings as you have time for, because there's a lot of great content. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time the class was offered so I expect it will be different especially if its part of a new urban curriculum at FES. I wouldn't take it again as it was offered this semester, though. ",
            "\u00a0Do a group paper ",
            "\u00a0Great course if you're interested in the material! ",
            "\u00a0My advice would be to know whether or not you are looking for a class that will provide visual communication to show employers you understand a particular problem. If you are looking for more academic learning or are new to urban ecology, I would not recommend this class. "
