The course is writing-heavy, and provides excellent training in art historical writing.

            "\u00a0The class is extremely well organized, with clear milestones that are designed to ensure successful essays at the end of the term. The two or three meetings that Prof. Bass hosts with other essayists are valuable for troubleshooting ideas, and having more of these (or encouraging students to meet and converse more frequently) could improve the class even more.

            "\u00a0This capstone class was an absolute joy, and students who know they have a particular passion within the history of art should absolutely write a two-semester senior essay. Having the opportunity and support to dive deep into a research project is extremely rewarding. "
