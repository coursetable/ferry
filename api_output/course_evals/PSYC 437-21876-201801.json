            "\u00a0Innovative thinking; creative analysis; comparative study of cognitive science, psychology, and computer science ",
            "\u00a0This class is a broad overview on AI from multiple perspectives.  You learn how psychologists/cognitive scientists have thought about the problem, as well as gain some exposure to how machine learning researchers are tackling the problem. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to a lot of different topics related to artificial intelligence and cognitive science. I developed a lot of knowledge on different theories of learning, and how they may be implemented in machines. It was also a good introduction to particular AI methods like machine learning, reinforcement learning and deep neural nets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what artificial intelligence is. As someone who had little experience with the \"machine\" aspect of the course title, I enjoyed getting higher level insights into the debates of a field that can often seem mystifying and incomprehensible. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt about many big topics in cognitive sciences including what is artificial intelligence, machine language, machine morality and machine theory of mind, etc. A good introduction to the key concepts in cognitive sciences. ",
            "\u00a0Great exposure to different areas within AI as they relate to findings in cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience.  These areas were linked in a coherent and effective way. "

            "\u00a0The class kinda jumped the shark midway through, when we were assigned a super technical long reading that no one really understood. The more philosophical/accessible topics were more engaging, but I feel like everyone eventually zoned out ",
            "\u00a0Lots of opportunity for discussion and interaction between students, weekly reading responses prompted intellectually stimulating conversations in class, very interesting material ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of readings is quite impressive, and it's easy to see that Julian has put a lot of thought into his selections.  I think the discussions could have been more fruitful had we been given some prompts before class.  The way discussions were run this semester, Julian would pull ideas from people's written reading reponses and ask them to elaborate.  While this ensured that many ideas were brought up during class, it made discussions often feel disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is its openness to various different approaches to the topic, both in terms of discipline (e.g. psychology or computer science), and in terms of focus in written responses and discussions. Discussions varied from broad, philosophical discussions, to more focused, specific and technical discussions of topics in computer science or cognitive science. Another strength was Julian's teaching style; he did an excellent job facilitating discussion. I also really enjoyed the presentations and thought they were a good way of gaining knowledge about more complex papers without having to read and decipher them myself. The exact balance between presentation and discussion needs to be more finely-tuned, and it would have been great to get the slides of the presentations for our own learning.\r\n\r\nThe broad interests of the people in the seminar was a weakness as well as a strength. It meant often the content of the course was aimed at the lowest common denominator, so the discussions of every topic were very basic. This was great when the discussion was on the topics I was not super familiar with (mainly the computer science topics), but not so great when it was on some of the topics I was familiar with; I'm sure the opposite is true for the people who were stronger in computer science, so it is hard to think of a solution. A good solution was the tiered readings (the presentation readings were harder, so if it was in your strength area you could do them voluntarily), however I can't think of a solution for this in the in-class discussions. Julian did a good job by taking the time and making the effort to explain concepts and theories to the whole class whenever anyone mentioned one, so we could all make an effort to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed each individual class and reach week the readings were both doable and engaging. Additionally, I felt like Professor Jara-Ettinger did a good job moderating the discussion. However, I felt like discussion was often stifled because of disparate levels of knowledge. A wish a little more time in the beginning had been spent going over the basics of AI to get everyone up to speed. I also wasn't a huge fan of the presentation format. A lot of times the presentations felt distinct from the stuff we were talking about in class and I wished that presenters had been required to explicitly explain how their paper connected the papers that everyone had to read for that week. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are very interesting and the field of cognitive sciences is also rapidly developing over the last 50 years so all the research is very exciting. However, 2 hours a week is too short for the class, a lot of time is spent on the presentations which give a good overview of certain papers/arguments but is generally disconnected from the rest of the discussion. It also does not help that we do not get to read the papers that are presented so it can be a little confusing when it gets too technical. The discussion is interesting but the class size is too big for really focused discussion, we usually ends up meandering around and not getting to the actual meat of the discussion. The class could be improved by splitting to two 1.5hrs sessions and having a more structured discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic overall--super interesting material, engaging discussion, thought-provoking assignments.  The only thing I think could be improved is the pacing of classes.  Sometimes presentations would run very long and/or we would have extended discussion on a single topic.  As a result, we would not cover that much of the full breadth of topics and perspectives related to that week's reading. "

            "\u00a0Take Minds, Brains, & Machines! It is one of the most intellectually thought-provoking classes I have had at Yale. Do not miss out if you are a Senior! ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend - especially to any computer science/math/statistics students who want to learn more about AI more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. It was really engaging, expanded my knowledge on existing interests, and opened up more avenues of interest along the way. It was very well-structured considering it is a new seminar! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is interesting and combines two topics that lead to interesting discussion. ",
            "\u00a0it is a good course to learn about the developments in cognitive sciences (the field itself is exciting enough) but the course needs to be more structured for everyone to get the most out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if you can get in.  It was one of the very best courses I've taken at Yale.  The material and discussion are extremely engaging and interesting.  Julian's terrific at presenting the material in an understandable way and offering insight into the more obscure areas in the field.  Workload is very reasonable--moderate amount of reading with a weekly response, one short presentation on an additional reading, and a ten-page term paper.  Definitely recommend! "
