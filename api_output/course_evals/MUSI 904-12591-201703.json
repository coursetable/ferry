            "\u00a0A greater appreciation of the music (and history) of the Beach Boys as well as vastly improved project organization and writing/editing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Beach Boys, their music, and band members' lives; about the music industry, popular music, and music production from 1950s-1970s; and about rock journalism, fan culture, and writing about popular music. \r\n\r\nI developed my writing skills and improved my research process, especially the beginning stages.

            "\u00a0I cannot imagine a better organized or more successful seminar. It was absolutely wonderful, from start to finish. ",
            "\u00a0Having the guest speakers visit was great, but there was less discussion after some of the presentations than there could have been. Depended on the day, though. Enjoyed that the course was designed to let us really dig into our research projects, and getting feedback from our classmates on a weekly basis was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength was how well thought-out and well researched the course was from beginning to end. Strengths include well conceived and well timed assignments and readings, receiving regular critical feedback, access to experts in the field, and observing peer projects develop over the semester. I also appreciated the small class size, which facilitated easy conversation and the exchange of ideas among the group. In the future, it would be interesting to consider more critical perspectives on the band/pop music. "

            "\u00a0Yes, though only if the music of the Beach Boys (or related music) interests them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course offered an excellent in-depth examination of a particular kind of music. Most importantly for me, this course offered the time and support for the kind of deep research and careful writing that graduate courses are supposed to offer but often overlook. "
