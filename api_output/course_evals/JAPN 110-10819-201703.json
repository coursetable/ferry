            "\u00a0Reading, writing, and speaking Japanese ",
            "\u00a0I learned elementary Japanese, just as the course promised. You progress pretty rapidly. By the end of the course, I was able to hold a basic conversation in Japanese with my classmates, which was pretty exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot more confidence in speaking the Japanese language and definitely learned how to approach the language in terms of reading, writing, and speaking. "

            "\u00a0I did not like the rotating classrooms nor the rotating teachers, as I feel with language learning I enjoy having a consistent group who helps each other and understands each other's growth. It felt very impersonal with strangers constantly. The course also moved very very fast in the second half, while very slow in the first, and I feel like the pacing could have been better. I also strongly dislike the textbook, and wish we had one integrated hiragana Japanese textbook, rather than a romaji textbook and hiragana course packet. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course is engaging and makes sure that you're practicing the material through daily homework and classroom activities.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the classroom activities were confusing. When we were doing more complicated grammar forms and saying them out loud as a class, it was hard to figure out what I was supposed to say (since the voice of the class is jumbled) ",
            "\u00a0The strength was that we met everyday so the previous lessons and vocabulary weren't forgotten. We also practiced speaking in class which I found to be very beneficial. The lectures were fun and easy to understand despite the fast pace of the class.\r\nThe way in which assignments were to be done was a bit confusing in the beginning, but I got used to it in a few weeks. The book was a little bit difficult to understand, and I would have preferred having one professor for the semester. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class to another student who is passionate about the Japanese language and culture. This is a great introductory  language class for reading writing and speaking that also delves into Japanese culture through these three aspects. "
