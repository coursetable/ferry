The first exam was probably a third of the material seen on the third and fourth exams, and the second exam was about half. Professor Breaker is a great, animated teacher, but his pacing often fell behind, so we ended up rushing a lot of things for the last exam (namely, biosynthesis of all 20 of the amino acids). Professor Engelman was less engaging -- his lectures were a little more monotone, so harder to pay attention to. The information was well-encompassed in his slides, though. The grading for exams was really harsh for the most part (although the TA's were strangely nice for the second exam) -- there are times when we got points off for not including in our answers information that wasn't even asked for in the question.

The instructor wasn't great at explaining the big picture. Instead, we spent a lot of time painstakingly learning very specific pathways, and he seemed to expect us to understand how these related to the big picture implicitly and magically understand what was important to know for the tests.

            "\u00a0Strength: Professor Breaker is really excited about the material, so his teaching is engaging. He's also good at explaining things and answering questions. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The TA's were rather harsh in some of their grading on exam questions -- sometimes we got points off for not including in our answers information that wasn't even asked for in the question. The material gets exponentially harder over the course of the four exams, so be prepared for studying to only get tougher. The third and fourth exams included an outrageous amount of material. It wasn't clear if we should memorize every mechanism of glycolysis/citric acid cycle/oxidative phosphorylation/fatty acid synthesis and degradation, and Professor Breaker just told us to use our best judgment about what was most important. I thought fatty acid synthesis and degradation probably wasn't as important as the first three concepts, but low and behold, the only mechanism we had to draw full-out was fatty acid degradation. Basically, memorize everything. ",

Still loved this class! ",

However, there was a lot of nitty-gritty information on each test and it felt random as to what was considered important and what wasn't. It would have been nice to have some practice non-graded psets in between the tests so we would have some idea of what we were expected to know for the tests. ",

Breaker and Engelman were great lecturers and I felt like I learned a lot in this course. I think the review sessions offered by Breaker before the exams were really helpful in focusing our studies on important concepts. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The latter half of the course felt a bit rushed, but Breaker mentioned that it was his first time covering the material. ",

Although it seemed a little daunting at first, I actually liked how there were just 4 exams, each 25% for the class. This meant that there was not a cumulative, which makes a lot of sense to me in terms of relative importance of pure memorization versus conceptual understanding. ",

After the first exam, we knew how to study and how to develop our skills for the next exam. However, I did feel like the professor was a bit of an air head. He didn't care about how well we knew the material, or whether or not our section times actually worked for us. ",

            "\u00a0I thought Breaker was a really good professor, and his tests were very fair. There was an emphasis on understanding the material as opposed to simply memorizing it, which is necessary in biology classes. The material was taught well but the textbook isn't great. I also wish the course itself could go a little more in depth into some of the topics, but I guess that is what the MBB biochem is known for. ",
            "\u00a0Great course and lots to learn. Nothing too crazy or complicated ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I love how there is no cumulative final-- there are four midterm exams, so you don't have a final exam for this class during finals period, unless you miss an exam then you have to take a cumulative final during finals period. Prof Breaker is also a nice professor.\r\nWeaknesses: we didn't really learn much about regulation during metabolism, which I feel like is supposed to be an important part of biochem ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well facilitated for student learning ",
            "\u00a0A big strength of this course is Prof. Breaker. He is really organized, a wonderful and engaging professor, and very willing to help students with material they find confusing. Another strength is that the course covers material in depth, while also giving a nice overview of various topics in biochemistry. One weakness was that the expectations for exams were a little unclear in terms of what we needed to studyfor example, it was mentioned several times that we wouldn't be tested on mechanisms but we have several mechanisms questions on exams. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course it that the subject matter is manageable and fascinating in the first half of the semester. Its weakness is that, however fascinating, it is not manageable during the second half of the semester. The difficulty of the class increases dramatically upon the introduction of glycolysis and the rest of cellular respiration. The class is not difficult because the material is difficult, but because the material is overwhelming in quantity. Moreover, unclear expectations about what material would be tested increased the difficulty of the class. Both the overwhelming quantity of material and unclear expectations on the part of the professor should be resolved for the next iteration of this class. ",
            "\u00a0It doesn't have a final and there's no homework. Still, we sometimes got practice exams, but never received answer keys. We can't learn what we are doing wrong if we don't get answers. The class also requires so much attention to detail that you memorize everything for a second and then forget it all after. ",

It's just a lot of stuff that should probably be more concisely organized, but again, hopefully that improves. ",

Biochemistry will require a lot of attention and time regardless of which course you take, but I genuinely liked Prof. Breaker's teaching style and the topics we covered in this class. I cannot stress enough the importance of the professor who is teaching you materialI have taken a lot of lecture-style classes, and Prof. Breaker is probably the best lecturer I've had. He's clear, knows how to pace himself so students follow what he's saying, and organizes review sessions before exams to cover any gaps in our understanding. The material can be tough, but Prof. Breaker guides you through it, and if there's anything confusing he and TA's are happy to answer questions. I would also note that I believe this was the first year that Prof. Breaker was completely in charge of the course (with Engelman covering just 4 lectures), which is maybe why I liked it so much. ",

One thing to note is that mechanisms were a focus of the exams despite Breaker's instructions \"not to study the mechanisms.\" Breaker loves mechanisms and will test you on them. Apart from this, I learned and enjoyed this class, which is all I could ask. ",
            "\u00a0If you don't have to take this I would not. It's a lot of stress for no reason. The tests are really difficult and there isn't a lot of provided preparation to help students. ",
            "\u00a0After much waffling between MB&B 300 and this course, I chose this one and it was 100% the right decision. This course is so much easier (there are 4 non-cumulative midterms, no final, section is optional, and no psets) and tends to have fewer hardcore biochem students so the curve is better. I put in around 40 hours total into this class (~10 for each midterm, a little more for the third and a little less for the first) and did fine (granted, I previously took MCDB 200 which has some overlap and knew the amino acid structures from MCAT studying). If Javi is still a TA in the course, make sure to attend his marathon review sessions if you choose to skip class because Breaker occasionally goes randomly in-depth about a topic that is only lightly mentioned in the slides (this is what I did). In previous semesters, Prof. Clay was difficult to understand but she no longer teaches at Yale and Prof. Breaker has taken over her section of the material. "
