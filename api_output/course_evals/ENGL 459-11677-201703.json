            "\u00a0I knew that I wanted to be a science writer as part of my career, and I feel that I developed extremely valuable skills for this. I became a much stronger writer and journalist, and learned not just writing techniques but also how to report, pitch articles, engage with the audience, and tell a compelling story that speaks to a wide range of audiences. ",
            "\u00a0I became a stronger reporter and storyteller, and I learned how to explain scientific concepts to a general audience without using jargon. I also learned how to pitch stories. By talking to established science journalists, I learned that there are many different ways to be involved with science journalism in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Probably one of the most challenging yet applicable courses I have taken at Yale, I've finished the course with a greater awareness of how to construct a journalism piece and the flaws in my writing. I've learned a tremendous amount about how to improve my writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0It was an amazing class! I'm very happy with the format and can't think of anything I would want changed right now. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zimmer is a very experienced science journalist and he reads every assignment with a highly critical eye. I appreciated his tough feedback because it forced me to quickly improve my writing. I think this course is designed to get students thinking with the mindset of a journalist in just a few months. I also learned a great deal by reading examples of great science writing and from discussing them with my classmates during class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Zimmer is an extremely helpful and patient critic "

            "\u00a0DEFINITELY take the class, especially if you're interested in science writing or journalism at all. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is interested in explaining science for a general audience. You will learn a lot very quickly  this is like science writing boot camp. You definitely get out of this course what you put in, so try to invest yourself to make the most of your time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although this course takes a lot of time and effort, the sacrifices were definitely worth it. A must take for anyone looking to work in journalism or the scientific field. You will leave the class a much better writer than you started. ",
            "\u00a0You'll learn a lot. That said, it's not for the faint-hearted; a lot of writing and reporting goes into the class, and the feedback is often pretty harsh. But go into it knowing that you are a good writer (after all, you are considering an intense writing class), and you'll come out feeling even stronger as a writer, with a renewed interest in science journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, with very challenging assignments. Professor Zimmer is brilliant, and he will push you to your limits. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in science writing, I would highly recommend this course. It's an incredibly useful class for writers, scientists, and doctors, and taking a science writing class from Carl Zimmer is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He's one of those people who is not only good at his job but also good at teaching other people to do the same thing. I grew a LOT as a writer over the course of this class and produced some pieces I was really proud of (even published a few of them). I think his strength is in teaching writing rather than reporting, though, so you'll be figuring some of the reporting stuff out on your own. The class is a lot of fun - those of us who stuck with it through the end enjoyed workshopping each other's pieces and learning about all different kinds of science together. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in science writing, this is a good class to take for the in-class discussions and readings. However, the grading is brutal, and you should start out Credit/D and only change to a letter grade if your grades improve after the first couple assignments. Even though all the evals say to Credit/D, I thought I'd be different, and I was not. Credit/D this class. "
