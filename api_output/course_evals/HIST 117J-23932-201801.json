            "\u00a0I learned about the history of chemical weapons, submarines, air raids, mines, nuclear weapons, and biological weapons. This course identified many themes in regards to arms control and examined the philosophy and ideology driving weapons sanctions. ",
            "\u00a0This Course was great in teaching primary source analysis, especially of treaties, agreements, legislation, and public opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of US Arms control, a topic I previously knew nothing about. I also feel as though I developed my research skills and my comfort in a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0During the course of the semester, I vastly improved my document analysis skills via the weekly document analysis presentations and the research paper project. "

        [
            "\u00a0This was a very well organized seminar and a great introduction to the methodology of a historian. In addition to learning about arms control, we gained experience in sources analysis and essay structure. ",
            "\u00a0It felt a little repetitive at times regarding the subject material ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the accessibility of the professor and the interesting content. I feel like a weakness was the lack of discussion in seminar, the classes usually turned into a fairly straightforward analysis of the facts in the readings as opposed to meaningful debates or conversations between students. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class with incredible professor. John Maurer is an excellent discussion leader. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the strengths of the course are the instructor, Professor Maurer, as he is extremely engaging and really wants to help all of the students improve their ability to read and analyze historical documents. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you're interested in a history seminar but don't know where to start! ",
            "\u00a0This was a very solid and well-taught class with a professor who is very excited about the material. I wish more discussions could have been had that extended beyond the details of the reading but great class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, learned a lot about an area I didnt know much about. Great professor who is very knowledgeable about the course. ",
            "\u00a0Class is focused on writing skills and the professor does an amazing job of preparing history students to collect, analyze, and write about primary sources. Great course to take if you want writing practice for the senior thesis ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student interested in 20th-century international affairs or military history. The readings and discussions are phenomenal, and I think any Yale student would gain a lot from the course. "
