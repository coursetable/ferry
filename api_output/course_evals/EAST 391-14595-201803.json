            "\u00a0The course gave an in-depth overview about the various religions that have been present in Korea and their relation to the country. ",
            "\u00a0Because I took this class, I now look at religion in the world in a different and more insightful manner. I learned a lot of the different theories regarding religion, historical backgrounds of Asian religions, and an understanding of how to analyze religiosity. Rarely does a class impact my worldview deeply, and Prof. Kim's constant questioning of religiousness and secularization really rubbed off on me. Now, whenever I encounter anything that has to do with religion, my line of thinking is very different. The most interesting thing that we learned in this class was how patriotism or national ideologies can be considered a religion and the implication of such strong belief. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more insight into the diversity of religions in Korea and how they have influenced its culture overall. I really thought this was a great introductory course that surveyed the many aspects of ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about korean religions, skills to think deeply and critically about religion. ",
            "\u00a0Essentially a survey course on the various religions present in Korea. Spend a week or two focusing each on Buddhism, Christianity, Shamanism, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an expanded view of korean history and religion, but also placed it all within a global context. So much of it was applicable to much more than just Korea. I learned more about myself from this class than perhaps any other class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Was able to gain broad insight and overall perspective on Korean Religion and the associated culture intertwined with it. Extremely well put together course syllabus that keeps you captivated, learned from the confucian roots of Korea to Protestant Christianity, Buddhism, Juche of North Korea, and more. ",
            "\u00a0Introduction to different religions in Korea, religious theory, cultural studies--it was a whole mix of things!\r\nI learned to look at religion and culture more critically, and I also gained historical understanding on Korea which I felt I lacked before. "

            "\u00a0Professor Kim is an amazing lecturer. I really liked the format of the class - the first part was a lecture and then the second part was a discussion about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course was Prof. Kim's knowledge and passion for the subject. He is an incredibly engaging professor, and his interest in religion makes the class much more exciting. He was able to communicate his vast knowledge to a class of students who mostly had not thought deeply about religion before. Furthermore, the readings and movies that he selected were very pertinent to the class and were fascinating to read. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kim is awesome, however, the class set up having students lead discussion for half of the time did not work.  Student facilitated discussions never moved beyond superficial discussions of the texts we were assigned. ",
            "\u00a0This course had an extensive body of knowledge that provided depth to each of our weekly topics. The movies were relevant to the topics and brought a more human element to supplement the readings. Overall, I thought this class was very well taught for its first offering with its lectures, guest speakers, and discussions.\r\n\r\nSometimes Professor Kim goes a bit overtime during his lectures so there isn't much time to discuss the readings, but apart from that everything he had to offer in this class was very satisfactory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:readings were thought-provoking\r\nWeaknesses: seminar wasnt pulled off very well. Presentations by students were not designed to create environment for engaging discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I wish our discussions were longer and bit more engaging. The student presentations of the readings was a good idea, but I think conversations could be more rewarding with engagement by the professor. Content-wise, the course was beautifully organized, all the readings were relevant, and the GUEST SPEAKERS WERE AWESOME. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hwansoo Kim is an absolute strength and Yale is so lucky to have him. I walked in on the first day of shopping period, and immediately knew I had to take this course simply because of him. He is so engaging and kind, thoughtful and informed. He immediately knew all of our names when we walked in the next week. I feel so lucky to have been able to take this class. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I will say is that sometimes I felt we were a bit rushed. We simply did not have enough time to get through everything because there was so much to cover and so many adventures to be had! ",
            "\u00a0Again, content was very solid and very interesting guest speakers to provide valuable perspectives from the people practicing variety of religions. Professor was very effective in guiding discussions and giving brief intellectually stimulating lectures. Discussion time could be allocated better with more evenly distributed setup across all the students as that was somewhat uneven. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong and I enjoyed the first half of the class where the professor gave a presentation, as it introduced us to a foreign topic in an easy way. I enjoyed every one of the readings. The second half, which was the discussion, was led by students and this usually ended up being a summary plus small-group discussions. Often times it was hard to get to the point or hear from everyone, even though that's one of the strengths of a seminar. I wonder if it would be useful to either convert it to a lecture-seminar (leminar) of a larger size and gain more insight from Professor Kim or cap the seminar and engage in more in-depth conversations, with more professor guidance.

            "\u00a0Yes! You get an amazing overview of religion in Korea and what that also means in the context of globalization and Korea's growing soft power. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students - the course is so interesting and the professor is very knowledgeable! ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you are looking for a class to expand your horizons, take this course. It is perfect for both students who are majoring in religion and students who are slightly interested in world religions. I recommend going to at least one class because Prof. Kim will captivate you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend anyone interested in even just the relationship between religion and culture. This course makes for a gentle yet insightful introduction to religion studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would to people who are interested in learning more about religions and culture in korea. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It's a relaxing fifth class that will keep you really engaged. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Whether or not you have any interest in Korean studies, this class is a MUST! I learned so much that is so applicable to almost everything. Hwansoo Kim takes a personal interest in every student and I truly feel this class was one of the most fulfilling Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Doesn't matter if you are interested in Korea, religion, humanities, or a STEM major. This course will keep you stimulated the entire semester while questioning and looking within for your own values and where you stand on religion. ",
            "\u00a0I would 200% recommend this class if you are interested at all in East Asian studies, Korea, religion, culture, or just in need for some refreshing class. Honestly I learned a lot about religion and culture that I didn't get a chance to think about, and it is a good introductory course as I didn't need any background information coming in. Professor Kim is super patient and explains things very well so it is a learning experience as well. If you get impatient with classmates though, or do not like free-form student-led discussion, this might be hard for you. "
