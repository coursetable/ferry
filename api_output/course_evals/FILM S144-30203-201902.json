            "\u00a0I learned how to use different equipment and work as a team to create four projects. ",
            "\u00a0The hands-on experience offered by this program is a rare gift for Yale students; we are thrown into a subject completely blind, giving us permission to blunder, fail, and improve. Being able to dive into the realm of expensive film equipment and editing software in a low stakes, removed setting is the perfect way for beginners to dip their toes into production. \r\n\r\nThe program divided the sixteen students into groups of four, adopting a rotation system that ensured each student got a taste of the various major roles in making a film. Each student had a chance to act as the writer/editor, the director, the DP (cameraperson), and sound. On a broader level, this system worked very well; each student had a much better understanding of in which areas their talents and insufficiencies fell as a filmmaker. However, there were minor kinks in the system that led to some students having a skewed experience. For example, I was the cameraperson the week of our Silent Film project. I got to handle a Bolex and use real film, but I also didn't have a chance to learn or operate the more advanced (and relevant) cameras used in the subsequent weeks. Another project involved recreating pre-existing scenes from real movies, meaning the assigned writer for that week never had a chance to write the script. \r\n\r\nCollaboration was another HUGE element of this course that varied greatly depending on the group. Some groups tackled their assigned roles completely as individuals, meaning the writer was entirely responsible for writing the script and mainly removed themselves from other aspects of the project. However, other groups viewed the roles at very loosely defined and collaborated through each stage of the filmmaking process. Regardless of the system each group used, we learned more about how to discuss and compromise on a very creative, subjective process. ",

            "\u00a0I think this course really benefitted from being in Prague, but I was very upset at how opaque the course grading system worked. ",
            "\u00a0In my opinion, the strengths of this course resided entirely in the hands-on experience of filmmaking. The resources at FAMU were incredible, and it really was an amazing experience to \"learn by doing\" in an environment that expected nothing more than beginner's work. You are really thrown into the mix of things as a student, so the program is kind've like \"expert level\" with \"beginner's expectations\" if that makes sense. In other words, you aren't given a watered down, baby step approach to filmmaking. You are simply thrown as much information as possible and challenged to absorb as much of it as you can. That being said, the days of hands-on filming/editing experience probably only amounted to about 30% of our class time. It was by far the most valuable of all the class experiences, so I don't know why so much of our class time was devoted to other things.\r\n\r\nI think this program has so much potential and truly some rare gems to it, so I found the weaknesses of this program to be extremely frustrating. The most pressing weakness of the program is the obscene amount of class time.  At a minimum, we were in class from 9am-5pm, with one hour for lunch. Most days, it went longer than that. We were also in class on more than one occasion from 8am-8pm. These hours do not include the amount of time it took for transport (30 min each way), nor do they include work/reading assigned to us outside of class (100+ pages of reading in a night on many occasions) If all of this time was devoted to filming and hands-on learning, I could see the value. After all, many sets in Hollywood do stretch that long. However, in most cases that class time was devoted to disconnected lectures and walking tours. It was virtually impossible to explore Prague on our own time outside of the weekends. Student were inevitably extremely exhausted by the final week, leading to less engagement in the classes and lectures. Half of Study Abroad's reputation for being a formative experience derives from allowing students the unprecedented independence to explore a country and culture foreign to their own and forge their own path. I could've been in a film program on campus at Yale and not known the difference because all I saw was the inside of the classroom. \r\n\r\nAs much as I loved Jitka and as cool as it was to discuss the history of waves of film on Mondays, I would significantly cut, make optional, or even eliminate these aspects of the program entirely. The strongest part of this program is undeniably the hands-on experience, and I think the program and the students would be far better off embracing that strength rather than diluting it with broad film-history coverage and tours of locations that students both could and should have the opportunity to seek out on their own. Cutting these aspects of the program would create a more feasible time schedule for students, who in turn would be more engaged, happy, rested, and creative. My classmates and I all unanimously felt very constrained by the demanding schedule of the program, yet felt that the amount of actual absorption/learning done in proportion to that time schedule was frustratingly low. \r\n\r\nOn the other end, one area of the program in which I would have liked to see MORE structure was the communication between professors and students, especially at the beginning of the program. The camaraderie formed throughout the program was entirely a result of the effort of the students, not the instructors. We were made to fend entirely for ourselves in getting to know each other and our professors. There were no ice breakers or real group bonding activities. We took it upon ourselves to do ice breakers, group dinners, and chat up professors. Had there not been such an active effort by many of the students to bond, we would have certainly left the program with no interest in speaking to our instructors or each other again. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that the material was tested and reinforced through the weekly exams. The first weekly exam was rather open-ended, vague, and difficult as a result. However the later exams were far more straight forward and relatively easy. They were a great buffer for the project grades. The greatest weakness for this course was the lack of structured feedback. Almost every instructor had a slightly differing opinion and would tell the groups how they could have changed their project. This resulted with a varied and vague description of how it could have been made better. Sometimes they would all agree on one thing, but then one would butt in and say the exact opposite and they would all change their minds. Also, I have no idea how the grading of the projects actually worked. Just one day the grade would appear on Canvas with no actual feedback or reason as to why. The grade averages seemed to be getting lower with each project even though our projects got objectively better with each one because of our increased experience. It would help the students greatly if comments or a rubric were provided that explained why points were actually taken off. The instructors provide the groups with so many criticisms that knowing why that amount of points was actually taken off would help greatly. Another weakness was the fact that the FAMU instructors would often not fully listen to or not understand our pitches and instead of trying to understand and help us improve our idea, they would suggest a completely new idea. It would have been far more helpful if we consistently worked to improve our own ideas with their help instead of just conforming to the instructors' idea of what our idea was. In addition to that, clear instructions or information about framing of shots was never provided. This is fine except for the fact that during the showings the instructors would criticize our framing or shots and then suggest how we should have shot instead. This is something that should have been suggested to us before shooting to help us. We are inexperienced and don't have the same eye as they do, so we need guidance. This could be accomplished by structuring the schedule to have another day for storyboarding or even just focusing more on that. If we work with the professors and talk about our sequence of shots and what we want them to look like before shooting, then the instructors would be able to correct us and suggest shots before shooting, and not after when it is impossible to change things. Finally, the criticisms and feedback of each project are great, however they are obviously individualized to each project and situation. When receiving feedback, I really appreciated when the professor managed to generalize their statement so it could be applied to other projects. It was useful when they gave their specific criticism, and then explained it with a generalization. ",
            "\u00a0Way too much class time. The syllabus states that there will be quite a bit, but in reality there is even more. Compounded by the amount of work outside of class, there is barely enough time to appreciate the city. The professors in general pretend to be on your side, but often their comments during and after the film making process are like night and day. Often, they will critique your pre-production process after saying that it was fine during. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the strengths of the program were the insights offered by the many many instructors, the resources available through FAMU, and the film festival that we were able to attend.  I though the major weakness was the amount of class time, that ate away at my ability to retain much of the information I was getting. ",
            "\u00a0In general, shooting and Jon's lectures are useful, but some of the instructors at FAMU aren't so much. Although I think I learned a lot, I wish we went deeper in at least one aspect. Everything felt very surface-level. But professor Andrews clearly cared and prepared for our course, which made our experience very delightful. "

            "\u00a0Only for the study abroad experience. ",
            "\u00a0This is a tough one. There were many things I enjoyed about this program, but there were also an equal or greater number of things that I disliked. I think this program could be improved DRAMATICALLY with simple, quick changes. Like I said before, I was enormously frustrated by the amount of class time and how it constrained our ability to independently explore and form our own experiences in Prague. I found that the lectures consistently lacked engagement, enthusiasm, and direction, which was a disappointment considering the prestige of both Yale and FAMU. There was absolutely no class discussion in lecture, and students were given very little chances to critique and comment on each others' work. Hardly any of the professors asked questions or created hands-on activities surrounding their areas of expertise, despite it being very easy to do so. For example, both editing and sound lectures could have prepared clips (or even used our own footage) and had us use the software to create various desired effects. When learning the cameras, we could've been given a specific location or object and been told to shoot it at various angles trying to elicit a certain mood in each shot.  Bruno was an exception; he had us recreate the lighting of several portrait images using the camera monitors and lighting equipment. Ironically, the other professors expressed concern over and made fun of Bruno's teaching style, but he was the only one who consistently asked us questions, presented an organized powerpoint, and utilized hands-on activities, all of which the other professors lacked in some way.\r\n\r\nAnother hugely important change that needs to be made in this program was the instructors' consistent dismissals of experiences of women. None of our film instructors in this program were women, and, although Yale's on-campus film program is also a male-dominated sphere, I had never before felt the issue of sex/gender infringe upon my learning experience as strongly as it did this summer. One incident during the program occurred when groups were pitching ideas to the class for the final project, and one group pitched an idea involving a man reaching out to an old childhood friend (that happened to be a woman) for emotional asylum when he finds out that his mother has Alzheimers. Our instructors' first comments had nothing to do with cinematic images, scripted-dialogue, or production issues. Instead, the instructors suggested that the story would be more compelling, relatable, and realistic if the characters had a romantic relationship, going as far to state that men and women beyond elementary school are not capable of non-sexual relationships. Several women in the classroom immediately pushed back, but the discussion was swept under the rug. After class that day, our instructor posted a Facebook post on our class page retracting his use of the word \"sexual\" and elaborating on what he originally meant, positing a Psychology Today article as backup for his original claim that men and women cannot engage in platonic relationships after puberty. As if that wasn't frustrating enough, all the other male instructors in the program liked the post and immediately chimed in in the comments. One posted about how viewer wouldn't recognize the world of the story to be realistic, as the male viewer wouldn't recognize a world in which a man and woman are friends without sexual tension. Another posted a meme about Freud and sex. Only male students liked the post, and any pushback by female students in the comments was met with another dismissal by one of the male instructors. It was alarming to me that - rather being concerned with opening up a dialogue and potentially learning from younger female students whose experiences differed from their own - our ADULT instructors seemed far more interested in proving they were \"right.\" Although this experience was the most tangible, there were many instances throughout this program in which I felt dismissed as a woman. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a wonderful course to take for hands-on learning of film production. You learn an immense amount of information in the five weeks and come away with a lot of experience. Just prepare yourself going in that the criticisms can be very harsh despite the professors knowing that most people come in with no experience. ",
            "\u00a0Not exactly sure. If you want to study abroad, probably not. If you want to learn about film, then maybe. Unless you are really excited about the material, maybe don't take it. The only saving factor for this program was that my fellow peers were amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I am not sure and I may not be the best person to ask. I had a particularly horrid experience that I am not sure to ascribe to the place, the political climate or the program. I do enjoy filmmaking opportunities such as this one being available to students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you get to experience Prague, shoot short films, and watch a lot of films in the film festival. "
