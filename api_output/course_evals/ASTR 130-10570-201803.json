Prof Fischer has a great way of teaching complicated material in ways we can understand, and giving us an appreciation for the bigger picture. I learned about how we have and continue to discover planets, the status of our search for life-suitable planets in our galaxy, the scale of Earth in the universe, etc..

Most of the basic astronomy and biology (yes, this is a part of the course) I learned in high school already, and it was really only after the midterm that we started doing anything that seemed relevant to the main thrust of the course. The different methods of exoplanet and life detection were pretty interesting, but that was a small bit of the course compared to the seemingly endless stream of useless facts we had to memorize for exams with little applicability elsewhere. Overall, kinda fun class and not very difficult, but a lot of the information was frustratingly esoteric. ",

Next, we continued in our study of the formation of life on planets analyzing the formation of RNA and DNA on planets. Finally, we concluded the semester studying exoplanet detection methods with the purpose of discovering other habitable planets such as the Doppler technique. By completing this course, I have acquired a better background on the formation of the universe and where we sit in the grand scheme of its history. I have also gained insight on what current scientists and astronomers are doing to discover other potential exoplanets with life. ",

I think the planetarium trip was awesome, but I think that it would have been better if it wasn't cloudy (as if that's within the control of the instructors). It was a wonderful class; I can't really think of any weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Fischer and the TA's are awesome. They are really friendly, approachable, and accessible via email and piazza. The course is well designed, but in my opinion, spent too much time at the end on the quantitative possibilities of life elsewhere. I actually enjoyed learning about discovery methods and the history of the field more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 9 Psets, 1 midterm, 1 final, 1 short paper; Prof Fischer wants to give you an A even if you don't understand anything\r\nWeakness: The Psets are straight up busywork with little to no meaning. The grading is biased depending on the TA that grades it. The midterm was a piece of cake but the short paper was extremely tedious for no reason. I was told this class was a gut, but it was a trap. THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT. It's a lot of unnecessary work. Spent about 2 hours a day working on her homework assignments that were filled with numerous typos and discrepancies. Overall, although I only attended class about 5 times throughout the whole semester, I can say that this class is a good 5th class to take if your willing to do the work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes felt like a bunch of not-really-related things were being thrown at us for us to memorize at a surface-level understanding ",

I feel much more capable at approaching this question now, and I better understand how we must move forward to develop a better understanding of how life started on Earth and where else it may exist.  Broadly, Dr. Fischer instilled in me a greater appreciation for science as an approach toward answering difficult questions.\r\n\r\nMy main criticism of the course is that it's a bit memorization-heavy for the midterm and final: Many of the questions were based on factual recall.  But the problem sets and project afforded us an opportunity to analyze a new situation and synthesize our knowledge toward a particular question/objective, which I very much appreciated.\r\n\r\nA wonderful science course, particularly if you're a bit hesitant to take one! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were sometimes hard to understand because it was a lot of new information to process for non-science people. However, Professor Fischer did her best to make everything understandable and accessible. Some of the psets were really hard, and I wish more instruction was given in class about how to approach solving problems like those on the psets. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Debra Fisher is a power house professor that can make students excited about anything.\r\nWeaknesses: logistically, the course was a bit disorganized -- don't know who's responsibility that is, but losing our papers after they were submitted electronically is a bit unheard of. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course balanced breadth and depth well, and spending a lot of time on exoplanet detection was very cool. I also liked going to the LFOP. \r\nHowever, the units on biochemistry, biology, and previous mass extinctions felt kind of redundant, and I think most students already had a good understanding of those ideas. I think more time could be spent on specific topics in astronomy, and less on background topics in bio/chem.\r\nI also felt like sometimes we were being led to answers (e.g. the chance of life forming on earth, the incidence of life in the galaxy) rather than being free to come up with truly unique WAGS. \r\nAlso, I'm not sure what was supposed to be happening in sections. I never went, and I didn't feel like I was missing anything ",
            "\u00a0Strength: interesting content, good professor. Weaknesses: The course covers such a broad range of surface-level science - from chemistry to geology to physics to biology - that it's an overwhelming a lot to keep up with and memorize for the midterm/final. Lectures were interesting but hard to stay engaged in. Most people are taking this to fulfill their science requirement, so the vibe of the class is generally less enthusiastic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Debra Fischer is amazing, kind, and a strong and organized presenter. Weaknesses: Slow grading, section not always useful, and the information we needed to know for exams didn't seem all that interesting or important to our larger understanding of the universe and our place therein. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is very well-designed insofar as by the time you reach the end, you can see the arc that Professor Fischer had built, making everything come together nicely. Having weekly psets & online quizzes, while sometimes difficult, made me do the readings and actually think through the info I was being presented with. I also appreciated that HW was 40% of our grade, because I put a lot of work into it, and there were also five sessions of optional section or office hours each week that you could go to before the HW was due. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fischer is fantastic and the textbook (Flexbook) that she wrote is a great source of information. Furthermore the engagement through Piazza was fantastic. Completing the homework and quizzes on Canvas was frustrating sometimes as some questions couldn't be answered using just the course materials. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting content, accessible to non-STEM majors\r\nWeaknesses - TF grading speed ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized to facilitate student learning. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: a good intro to astronomy. Right pacing for beginners. The enthusiasm of the class is great. The emphasis on learning instead of scores is really encouraging. The paper and HW was a good hands-on way to learn about astronomy. \r\nWeaknesses: the Canvas quizzes should weigh a little less. Sometimes they were very long. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fischer is a really engaging speaker and was always willing to receive feedback from her students, which meant that she was pretty flexible with deadlines. Her office hours were always really helpful. Professor Fischer also made the class study guides before the midterm and final, which were extremely helpful when studying.\r\n\r\nThe final paper's peer review process could have been facilitated better because I personally only received feedback from one of my two reviewers, and the feedback received wasn't specific at all. Also, I wish that I could have received feedback on my homework assignments sooner because much of the final paper's content came from the homework, but I didn't know whether or not I had answered the homework questions correctly. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course did a fantastic job of exposing students to basic astronomy and ongoing efforts to locate extraterrestrial life. I do not have any suggestions on how the course material or structure could be improved. I would recommend, however, that TAs for future iterations of the course provide feedback in a more timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fischer is amazing but the content is not very engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really nice prof, somewhat interesting material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not great TA team (felt like they were not great at explaining material), felt disjointed at times. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was Professor Fisher - she really made the class very engaging and placed the topic within a broader context that was relatable to me. A weakness was the grading of assignments. It would have been helpful to have a faster turnaround so I could know where I stood in the class. I understand that the grad students were probably very busy, but it seems that a schedule or some sort of organization would have been helpful. They were giving back grades very quickly up until mid-way through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the class is very interesting and is something different from other classes at Yale, which is nice. It is a good break in your schedule that feels like you are learning things that are actually applicable and we may witness in our lifetimes. ",
            "\u00a0It was broken down well for non-science majors, but Drake's equation was confusing at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The course is powered by Fischer's passion. It's seriously contagious. Sometimes I wish it was organized a little better, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- While the material could feel a bit dry at times in a given lecture, overall what we were learning was really fascinating. \r\n- The exams and grading were very fair. \r\n- Professor Fischer was really passionate about the topic, which was very evident and made class more engaging.\r\n- The class felt low-pressure and not too difficult, and it was clear that Professor Fischer wanted us to succeed and do well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The files for the course on Canvas were not very organized at all which sometimes made studying and doing the weekly problem sets a bit difficult. \r\n- Sometimes Professor Fischer moved a bit too fast in lecture. \r\n- Professor Fischer knows this, and it wasn't her fault, but there was a period where the grading was very slow. ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is its ability to introduce many easy to understand topics that cover a wide breadth of astronomy. Its weakness would be that it is not the class for anyone looking for a very rigorous or serious introduction to the world of astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized to have a light amount of work (and none of it seemed just like busy work on the psets). Debra is a super fair prof. and she knows most people take this class for the \"easy\" science credit. She is also not out to get anyone on grading, she genuinely cares that we learn and are engaged with the material. Honestly, the content was super interesting, but the best part about this class is the stellar professor. I love Debra; she is encouraging, sweet yet simultaneously a badass, a feminist, a leader in her field, and a great lecturer! I would recommend taking the class just to have her as your professor!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was my favorite course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: psets are often a good mix of quantitative and qualitative info; Debra Fischer is kind and understanding and clearly passionate about her work; work is graded fairly; the peer feedback assignment was super helpful\r\nWeaknesses: flexbook at large cant be searched, psets (especially those with simulations) are time consuming; sometimes lectures seemed long and it was hard for me to stay interested as a non-STEM major ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and offers a different perspective than most other courses in that we see exactly how small humanity in the grand scheme of the universe. Debra Fischer is really makes the course great, but it is overall a little disorganized and sometimes the material is so broad it is hard to know what exactly is important to study, ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely disorganized. The TAs rarely got back with me in a timely manner. There was little understanding between the students and the professor on what to do for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught well. I thought the HW's were confusing at times. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by reducing the amount of time spent on biology. The important information is about how organic compounds are able to form through natural processes, and how these compounds are common elsewhere in the solar system and the universe. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this course was well branded as it was advocated. As a non-STEM major, the course did a good job in easing me into the material and fostering an interest in astronomy. I felt that the Flexbook was a unique aspect of the course that served as a reliable, yet digestible source of information. Furthermore, I thought the lectures were useful and fleshed out details in the Flexbook or in the problem sets. Overall, the course was great to engage all sorts of students. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. I have 0 complaints. It was the most interesting course I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the problem sets and the final research report featured unnecessary grunt work. So while the excercises were very interesting and instructive, it was often frustrating how much time we spent doing tasks (searching for planetary figures and fussing with technology) that took away from my ability to work on other classes and enjoy the material of this class ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was organized in such a way as to make learning easy and teach students about the world. I honestly think this class was built perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really cool topic, and it was definitely taught at the right level for a bunch of non-science majors. That being said, a lot of times lectures could feel pretty disorganized, and the way that slides were formatted could make it pretty difficult to follow along if you're a visual learner. Overall though, I would say that this is a very solid intro-level class designed to accommodate basically any level of science knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Material was clear and interesting. Tests were fair, but psets get a little like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are sometimes a lot more difficult than the exams, but really cool information. The final paper was super cool! Professor Fischer is so cool and such a nice professor! Sometimes class material can get confusing, but that's mainly because she is covering a whole field really quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The course had an engaging lecture, although it sometimes felt too long. I liked the many forms the class took, like the planetarium visit. However, I thought the semester paper was a rather bland assignment that I gained relatively little from. Some of the problem sets felt like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: DEBRA FICSCHER IS A QUEEN. My goodness, I cannot express this strongly enough. Not only does this professor know her stuff -- she also genuinely cares that you understand, retain, and engage with the material!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I loved my TA (sam), but the turn around for the psets was much too long. Because the last few psets were particularly important for the final paper, I wasn't exactly sure if my interpretations were correct because I never got feedback. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: exciting lectures, great Professor, passionate TAs who held well organized office hours.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the methods of evaluation. I was pretty upset by the homework quizzes every week which were less about understanding the material and more about scanning and then reproducing the FlexBook for particular lines of text and praying to all the gods above that your interpretation of the questions wording was right.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the emphasis on rote learning in this course when it came to just neededng to spew out numbers like the age of a body in the universe or that of some phenomenon was rather annoying. I felt that the same points, devoted to an essay or math question would have tested my understanding of this course a lot better. ",
            "\u00a0The professor makes the material easy to understand and engaging, through the structure and with her teaching style. A weakness was that I thought the final paper could have been structured a little differently. I think it would have been beneficial for it to be more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course does an excellent job of providing resources to review when trying to understand the material and to complete your homework. The lectures were generally engaging and the professor was generally fascinated by her work which made it easier to listen to. The lecture notes were posted online and our online textbook accompanied each lecture and allowed us to gain a second source on the material. Both of these materials contained all of the information to complete our homework which was very fair, still requiring us to decipher the material. Discussion sections also allowed us to ask questions about the material or our homework which was good, also it wasn't mandatory which was nice so no student felt compelled to attend.The midterm and final exam was also created very fair relative to the material covered during the semester. The study guide clearly outlined any information that would have to be known for each exam. The only confusing part of the course came when we started using the orbital simulator and weren't sure if our results were correct. This caused confusion and maybe this could be improved if there was a better manner in which we could check whether our data was on the right track rather than having every student email the professor or TA. ",

            "\u00a0I think section should be mandatory, and more feedback on the aer would have been useful - however, the rofessor was consistently engaging and tried to make information as accessible as ossible. The flexbook could do with some assessments and udates, but overall I really enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent science credit, and a good class if you are simply interested in the search for extraterrestrial life. Professor Fischer is a remarkable teacher, and the course is admirably designed to be interesting without being overly difficult or monotonous. ",

Many people in the class complained that it was super hard, but that is bc they literally never came to class. It is super easy to do well, EXTREMELY interesting, and Prof. Fisher is INCREDIBLE. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND TAKE THIS CLASS!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE! ",

This course is disorganized and comes with more work than should be necessary. If you are to take an astronomy course, I would suggest taking a course taught by Michael Faison. His class is probably as difficult as Professor Fischer's, but it is at least organized properly. Debra Fischer is a nice person and clearly very knowledgeable.

Though I was skeptical of the math at first, there really isn't that much at all. The only time you'll really have to do calculations is during the weekly open-book, open-note, untimed HW quizzes. The midterm and final were very fair, and the study guide the TA's provide is incredibly helpful if you gather a group together and fill it out beforehand. In terms of material, it was awesome. I never learned about astronomy in high school, so learning about the Big Bang theory, extinctions, exoplanets, and planet detection was AMAZING, especially because it was taught by someone so integral to the field.

The problem sets and online quizzes follow the professor's online textbook so they shouldn't take too long. The exams are also designed fairly with a study guide that should be completed prior to the exams. This will ensure a really good grade on the exams.
