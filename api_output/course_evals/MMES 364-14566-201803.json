            "\u00a0I developed are more comprehensive understanding of authoritarianism and possible explanations for it in the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0A survey of contemporary Middle Eastern politics ",
            "\u00a0This was a great introductory course on the middle east north Africa region. I learned how to engage with classic political science literature on the middle east, which is a helpful skill for any future straight polisci classes. I also learned how to write a critical review of a memoir for one of the essay assignments, which was a very interesting topic. Professor Nugent is an expert in her field (especially Egypt-if you're interested in contemporary egyptian politics definitely ask her about her research) and even though this was her first year teaching the class, she was a very encouraging and helpful professor! A  classic polisci course! ",
            "\u00a0Introductory Middle Eastern history with some insight to modern studies in the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0This class has been a very interesting and rewarding class for introductory Middle East Politics. It has a comprehensive political science approach to understanding Middle East politics, in particular the lack of democracy. It has a good balance between political theory and historical analysis that makes the class very interesting. "

            "\u00a0Professor Nugent was a first time professor, but overall it was good, though I think depth could be improved a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0The course felt like it could have eliminated certain lectures (discussed in class), but overall felt very well structured. ",
            "\u00a0I think one weakness was the way the course content was distributed-- that's not to say that what we spent A TON of time on (i.e. authoritarianism, pre-statehood history) wasn't valuable, but i was personally more interested in current international relations and recent conflicts in the region. However, overall, I really loved this course. I find that many MENA classes I have shopped are super intense and the students in them are super aggressive about how much the purport to know about the region- but this was not that at all! Super encouraging learning environment. Professor Nugent promised we didn't have to have any prior knowledge on MENA and she was right- she does a great job explaining all of the integral key terms and historic events that you otherwise would be nervous to ask about. I definitely think one of the biggest strengths of this class was the low-stakes learning environment and small class size, which allowed us to not feel nervous about asking silly questions or asking her to re-explain or repeat. really really awesome!! ",
            "\u00a0The course style (lecture--2 times a week with section) did not seem to be the best fit for the material/class size.  I wonder if a seminar or \"leminar\" format would have been better to have more time in class for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this class is that it provides a good foundation for Middle East politics and working knowledge to be a better consumer of information. However, a weakness is that this semester, it didn't focus much on politics within the last 2 decades but rather more on the earlier 20th century. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if they have no background in the Middle East. If you have background in the Middle East, this might be a bit too much of a review. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The Middle East is an important region about which to learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student- polisci major or not- if they want to brush up on their knowledge of the Middle East or learn it for the very first time! It is a great way to orient yourself in a sphere of very very complex history, culture, politics etc. Though you obviously won't get to go super in depth in each country, it is a great and fun way to see if you are at all interested in diving in further. Though there are some case studies and the book assignment allows you to go in-depth, it also covers general themes and trends which is super interesting. Professor Nugent also does a great job making sure she isn't oversimplifying though- it is the perfect balance of breadth and depth!! Highly highly recommend if you're at all interested in the Middle East or if you want to learn more! Great survey course! Super kind prof! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a good introduction to the Middle East; I would definitely recommend if you want an introductory course, but this class is mostly a survey of the Middle East (so a wide spread of material with not that much time spent on any one topic).  The workload was very manageable, but more heavy towards the end of the semester.  Overall a nice class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students if they want to have a good introduction to Middle East politics. "
