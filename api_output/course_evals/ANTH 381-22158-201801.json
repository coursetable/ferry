            "\u00a0This course taught me a lot about sexuality and gender as viewed across different cultures and time periods. A lot of theory, and a lot of ethnography was read and discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about my identity and queer identity in general. I especially enjoyed writing my final paper--very edifying and gratifying. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the nuances of LGBT activism, and the ways campaigns can be employed for nationalist causes. ",
            "\u00a0How to think critically about the initiatives that human rights groups start in order to help global LGBTQ+ communities, how to rethink the language surrounding LGBTQ+ communities, what queerness means, who sets these standards, and a lot of the problems associated with transnational organizing and things to be cognizant of.

            "\u00a0Strengths) Good readings. Interesting discussion. Student presentations were well done and engaging. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses) Discussion often meandering and not focused enough. Too early in the morning. Slightly unstructured course. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Difficult to follow if you have not read similar literature in the past\r\nStrengths: Fun if you are interested in queer identity or human rights! Definitely very comprehensive despite the minimal amounts of readings. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: too many readings that feel redundant ",
            "\u00a0This class has fascinating material, and Professor Reid is great at leading discussions. The workload is very manageable. It might be good to spend less time on student presentations so we can have more time for discussions. The readings also began to feel a bit repetitive near the end, so it might be good to find a way of diversifying the types of ideas we're engaging with as the course progresses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The flexible nature of the response papers (counting the best 8, letting them be turned in over the course of the semester/when is best for us) \r\nThe readings were incredibly interesting \r\nI liked the presentations that we did\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I didnt feel like there was much guidance on the response papers in terms of your expectations (what counted as an innovative argument, how to get an A on the response papers)\r\nIf possible (depending on your busy schedule), I think it would be great to do two classes a week instead of just one because I felt like I didn't get as much conversation between students as I wish we could have\r\nI think more in-depth feedback on assignments would be helpful for our development as writers \r\nIf you're going to continue the presentations, I think firmly establishing that they are supposed to be five minutes is important because I think the extended presentations really ate into conversation and class time. I suggest that you either set the presentations to be longer or cut students off at 5 minutes. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the topic and have familiarity with the topic that can help the dense readings become a bit easier. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this class for Graeme Reid. He's incredibly knowledgable and is a well known figure in the field. The classes best aspect is the opportunity to learn from him. Apart from that, I wasn't terribly thrilled about the course. There are too many readings (bound in the largest and most expensive course pack of my Yale career) and the readings begin to feel redundant very quickly. The assignments and requirements for the class are manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered incredibly interesting topics, but I was dissatisfied with class discussions. While we would typically have three readings a week, discussions would usually only cover one and maybe start to touch on a second. We had weekly student presentations that were really interesting in bringing in various topics. Prof. Reid is great at leading discussions, but sometimes I wished he would bring in more of his own experience as the director of Human Rights Watch  he often taught it as a professor, not someone who works with these topics in application on a daily basis. I also wish the course talked more about human rights campaigns in the present. Also keep in mind the quality of the course is heavily dependent on who is in the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This class explores the intersection of human rights campaigns and LGBT activism in a very nuanced way. The readings are fascinating, and Professor Reid is a wonderful seminar leader. I highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because Graeme Reid is an amazing professor and brilliant scholar, and the readings are super interesting. I think if you're looking at the realities of human rights issues, this is a good course to start with. "
