At the end of the class, I can now nebulously look at a plot of land, a watershed, or a fishery and begin to piece together how one might put a price on it. I expected to walk away with a more concrete knowledge of the field. But since the field is still developing, there is no hard and fast path to evaluating natural resources. It's an exciting field of study! ",

            "\u00a0I would like more finance (capital markets) connections. I didn't get much out of your formula derivations, perhaps because I was looking for practical skills and less academic economics. I would have preferred to replace some of that time with talking through real-world problems, e.g. reading a newspaper article and starting to build a model around it. I wish we'd walked through building a model in advance of the final project. Since I learn best from concrete examples, I would have liked to talk about some contemporary problems and develop those inputs. \r\n\r\nWe never used the bubble and square model drawing concepts again, so I'd eliminate that lesson. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets could be hard to follow and require tons of group collaboration and input from the TA to make them workable. I suppose that's half the point, but I can't help but feel like they could be a little clearer. ",
            "\u00a0I hope the lectures could be better ties with assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of practical skills but a huge commitment. I learned so much but it would have been nice to go deeper on certain topics so I felt like I mastered some things instead of just simply figuring it out. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really good class. The lectures were interesting and informative, and the homework helped build useful skills. I like Eli's idea of separating the course into a conceptual class on sustainability and an intensive methods class. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all of the lectures and felt like I got the most out of those and the final project.  The problem sets each came up very quickly and I never felt like I was able to fully dive into them like I would have wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the class is that it covers both the concepts and the tools needed to for analysis of natural assets. The reading materials were all good and helpful for understanding the class. We had plenty of opportunities to explore tools through excel and r assignments as well as a self-directed group project. The difficulty of the material made the class a high priority and kept me engaged throughout the semester. The professor and the TA were excellent with scheduling office hours and making themselves available to students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course include the focus of math in the course. It makes sense that we need to understand the underpinnings of the theory we were learning, but most students seemed to struggle with the math involved in the economic analysis. Perhaps we covered too much material and the class should ideally be split into two, with one going into greater depth on the math and tools than the other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material covered is very interesting. I don't believe the course should be split into different sections. I think that the heavy quant aspects sprinkled in with theoretical interpretations of the models was good. I think that more examples could be used in class to concretize the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the final project, taking a deep dive into the value of a specific natural resource system. I developed some important mathematical tools to carry out these sorts of evaluations. Some of the problem sets were a little abstract and excel/solver heavy (or R heavy) so at times I was more focused on getting the programs to work than I was focused on the math. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are how innovative it is. Some things that could be improved are: Eli is good at explaining the meaning and intuition behind the course content, and good at explaining the mathematical foundations of practical applications. He could improve the way in which he connects these two aspects of the class. Often, when he explained the math he did not link it to the intuition, or presented examples. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class is that it introduces you to a lot of hard math that is found in many equations that evaluate natural capital. You get introduced to working in R (although a bit abruptly,) with Excel solver, and calculus in general. The weakness of the class is that the problem sets are so math-heavy that it's hard to often see the theoretical connections that are drawn in class. I felt I got really good at making spreadsheets, but didn't always understand what they were saying. However, I will say, I was underprepared quantitatively for this class, and many of my classmates were able to draw those connections. ",

A good chance to explore a topic of interest related to the course. The assigned books are very helpful for further discussion of course topics and for completion of homework assignments. Requires comfort with basic calculus. TA office hours are a must. ",
