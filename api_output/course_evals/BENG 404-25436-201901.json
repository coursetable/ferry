            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class! The biggest technical skill I learned was Solidworks, but I also learned a ton about orthopaedics/bones and the medical device design process. I would learn such interesting things about bones and the way that implants like hip replacements work that I would tell people over dinner and send screenshots to my friends about it. ",
            "\u00a0How medical devices are regulated, general engineering processes, different career paths ",
            "\u00a0Greats course about design process, especially in relation to medical devices. This year it was skewed towards orthopedic implants for the beginning part of the course. Later in the semester, there was a greater variety in the type of projects. Learned SolidWorks, Finite Element Analysis, FDA Approval protocols, design process, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe professors cared SO MUCH! You could literally feel how much they cared about all the students. They put a ton of time into organizing MULTIPLE field trips, 2 or 3 to Yale New Haven Hospital/St Raphael's, 1 to Stryker in Mahwah NJ, and 1 to Orchid Orthopaedics in CT (if I remember correctly). They also worked to give us *at least* 1 speaker every week either from the hospital, a successful startup, or a company like Stryker. These speakers discussed all kinds of topics and a lot of them are high key very important/renowned/busy so I really appreciated the effort that must have gone into scheduling these guests. The professors also spent a ton of time at office hours helping students and were always a resource I felt like I could reach out to for help. They are also very invested in each student's professional success and put in a lot of effort making sure students could shadow in the operating room and even put together an alumni list, building up a network of people who have been in the class to help future people in the class get jobs/etc.\r\nThe TA, Anthony, was also a legend, staying up super late helping people with Solidworks and other stuff.\r\nI learned Solidworks. As in, I can genuinely put that down as a skill on my resume and not feel like a fraud, which is great.\r\nThe final projects were all extremely interesting, and I really felt like every group had developed something cool. A group member and I are currently thinking about patenting our project.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nClass time. Attendance really suffered toward the end of the class, which was a huge bummer. I think it's because the class is a 9 am. Not sure if moving the class later is possible since Dr. Wiznia literally runs from class to the operating room, but being at 9 am is a little unfortunate.\r\nThe first project in the class was way more difficult than the second project, so I'd swap the order. I felt like I was sprinting while doing the first project and then jogging the rest of the course, which was not ideal, and might lead people to drop the course thinking the entire thing is going to be an intense grind.\r\nAdvertising. This class really focused on orthopaedic medical device design for at least 2/3 of the semester, so I'd recommend being more explicit about that in the course description. I was fine with it and found it super interesting to go really deep/narrow into the subject, but others were put out by all the Solidworks and orthopaedics stuff. ",
            "\u00a0End of term projects should be longer. We had a lot of guest lectures, wouldve been nice to mix it up more. ",
            "\u00a0There was a HUGE variety in the speakers and was a great course for people interested in industry. Field trips to simulation centers, different companies, etc were awesome. \r\nDrawback was that there was very little/no time to work on projects in class. So a lot of time was committed to going to office hours/spending hours on your own. ",
            "\u00a0This year's version of the course was poorly executed.  We only ever had guest lecturers.  The professors gave only 2-3 lectures all semester. While I appreciate the effort of our professors in setting up the guest lectures, it made the course feel incredibly disjointed and disorganized.  I never felt that I was building on my previous knowledge from earlier in the year.  Nearly all of the guest lectures focused on either (a) what it was like to create your own medical device startup, or (b) what it was like to work at a medical device company.  The guest lectures were extremely repetitive, and often boring, since they were on pretty much the same topics every time.  I would suggest that next year, the professors create an overall outline of topics to learn during the semester, and bring in fewer guest lecturers, and only when it is extremely on-topic.  Also, the whole class often felt like it was constructed to help students get a job in the medical device industry.  I understand how this could be very helpful to some people, but it is not what I, or many other students, were looking for.  It is marketed to seniors in their spring semester, and many of us had a job already during the course.  It may be better to have this course during the fall semester.  Or, just tone down the job focus entirely.  I didn't take this course looking for a job, I took it to learn about design principles and exercise scientific creativity, neither of which I feel I got to do much of.   I also did not take this course to learn exclusively about orthopedics, which is what the course turned out to be.  I wish we had more varied material.  I also wish we had gotten to focus more on design principles and less about the intricacies of SolidWorks, and, even more so, less about the intricacies of FDA approval.  Or if we had started more general instead of diving right into those details. ",
            "\u00a0More accurate course listing as Solidworks focused ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was very interesting and I really enjoyed the projects and field trips. The only weakness was that because the class was so fast paced and all of the projects were group projects I felt that basically only half of the class learned how to use SolidWorks and the other half just worked on the papers/presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strong focus on orthopedic medical devices. Course would have benefitted from projects within other fields as well (biotech, pharma). Workload was also heavy and time-consuming with limited time to complete the first few projects. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! Just know what you're getting into. This is a class you should take if you want to learn a lot and want to be really engaged. It's hands-down the most interesting/engaging BENG course I've taken, fyi. If you know yourself and know that you don't want to be engaged/don't have the mental energy, don't take this course because you'll just be playing yourself. It's not that you will drown from the workload or anything like that, but you just won't have a good time and your apathy will ruin the course for others. ",
