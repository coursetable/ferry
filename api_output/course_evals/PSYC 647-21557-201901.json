I gained an entirely new vocabulary and knowledge base that would serve me well in any capacity where I would be crafting policy, doing law, or just simply contributing to an organization. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in cognitive science or political science or law. I think Professor Tyler's passion for social psychology as it pertains to the legal field is both infectious and necessary; if the class taught me anything it's that we need to learn more about how people think in order to better structure our society "
