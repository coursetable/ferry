            "\u00a0I learned about plant molecular biology and important systems to understand to look at large questions in how plants function. My ability to read dense scientific papers in molecular biology also dramatically improved throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the current state of the field in relation to plant development, defense, and epigenetics. I enjoyed the News and Views assignments that pushed me to critically read complex papers and produce a easily digestible summary and analysis. "

            "\u00a0The class is easy if you read the papers and think about them. The problem is that its evident when half the class doesnt read them and then you have to wonder if they will even be penalized for it when grades come out since its a vague, effort-based grade. ",
            "\u00a0The course was set up well with each of the four professors teaching their expertise. Shorter introductory lectures each week prepared us for the papers, though more lecture time could be have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that instructors could have engaged more with undergraduate students. "

            "\u00a0I do recommend this course to seniors in MCDB. Plant bio is pretty interesting and the casual seminar style is a nice change of pace. The only work is to read two papers before class once per week and then write four short review papers which are not bad. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The material was interesting and the professors were all engaging. Weekly readings could be challenging but discussions went well and were always interesting. For the final project we gave a presentation to the community which was a nice change from typical Yale science courses and got us to think about science communication in addition to the high level science covered in the course.
