            "\u00a0Knowledge not only on vocab and grammar and idioms, but also on Chinese culture and important topics in politics, and the media. ",
            "\u00a0Additional language skills across all fronts. ",
            "\u00a0I saw huge improvements in my grammar and vocabulary. I also learned about Chinese culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0I built upon my Chinese speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much more thorough understanding of the modern Chinese language, as well as engaging with new historical and cultural information. This course gives you experience in discerning formal and informal language, and helps you learn the differences between similar words. I found this focus on word discrimination particularly informative. ",
            "\u00a0Formal Chinese skills, greater knowledge of contemporary Chinese culture, confidence in formal speaking and in giving presentations, skills in writing detailed essays, and character writing/memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Zhou Laoshi is such an incredible professor. Must take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Chinese language skills, ability to develop professional vocabulary talking about political issues such as marriage and immigrants\r\nChinese essay writing skills, speaking, and listening ",
            "\u00a0I feel that my Chinese improved in all areas of listening, speaking, reading, and writing, while taking this course. I also appreciated how the lesson content also helped us to learn about Chinese history, culture, and contemporary society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to give good presentations and think on my feet "

            "\u00a0Overall great course. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses to be spoken of. Zhou Laoshi's teaching method is very engaging, and he obviously cares a great deal about his students and their progress. His handouts are very helpful as well. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! I love the focus on speaking and grammar as opposed to rote character memorization.  We had lots of interesting discussions in class and out of class assignments that tied what we learned to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class was great overall, my only criticism was that there was a bit too much stress on formal Chinese. Nobody at this level is near fluent, I think it would be a better use of time to learn how to say certain new terms than to learn how to say terms I already know in a different way. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course included the focus on developing different skill sets: not just writing, but reading, speaking, listening, and cultural knowledge. I also thought this class was strong because we did not focus on character writing, so I was able to spend much more of my study time learning grammar structures and vocabulary. One element that could be improved is maybe more evenly distributing work throughout the semester so that there isn't so much to do during test times. Other than that, I thought it was a very well-designed course. ",
            "\u00a0Zhou Laoshi really cares about his students succeeding and truly loves to teach. ",
            "\u00a0Most of it were strengths--well organized and well taught. The only downside was that the sections got too big and there was little time to drill or practice the things learned. ",
            "\u00a0This course has interesting assignments that are enjoyable to complete. I also think that doing the Quizlet many times was a great way to continue reviewing past vocabulary. I think because of that, I am more likely to retain what I learned in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the homework that reinforces what we have learned in class and the quizlets. It could be improved by more "
