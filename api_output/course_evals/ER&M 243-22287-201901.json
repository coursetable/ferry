            "\u00a0I learned about the history of religious liberalism in the United States from the 1800s transcendentalist movements to today. I gained insight into the structures of privilege and power that allow some people and not others to form their own spiritual identity. I learned about the ways in which economic structures, particularly neoliberalism, shape the way that spirituality is commodified and packaged to the American public in the form of various experiences such as boutique fitness, New Age practices, dietary trends, and advertising. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely loved this class. Taught me to think much more critically about religion/spirituality, and how it intersects with race, class, forms of privilege and oppression, etc. ",
            "\u00a0If you engage with this class, you'll learn how to rethink terms we take for granted and critically think about what religion, spirituality, tradition, etc. really mean and how they work in our late-capitalist society. ",

            "\u00a0I feel as though I developed a stronger sense of who I am through lessons learned in this course. I gained deeper knowledge of very important concepts that penetrate our everyday lives, such as cultural appropriation, neoliberalism and belief. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an amazing overview of the US intellectual history of decoupling spiritual practice from religious tradition. It offered a lot of insight into the impact that Christianity and other dominant white religions had on the US and how these religions continue to shape stereotypes present in US society. I learned that the SBNR tradition is actually very old, not a newly 'millennial' phenomenon as some people would like to claim (usually when talking about \"snowflakes\"). Professor Grewal also shed a lot of light on Islam as a religion and cultural appropriation in a way that was beautifully unbiased and very informative. It is worth noting that this class IS NOT an examination of multiple religions as I thought it would be when I applied. In the end, it was far more interesting than that. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how spiritual but not religious is an extremely broad term that can mean anything depending on the person. ",
            "\u00a0To think critically, learned a lot about myself, challenging my practices ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better understanding of myself and my position in relation to cultural and political climates, as well as the history of spirituality and how it continues to influence American and global culture. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of contemporary trends and nuances in culture ",

            "\u00a0The ability to examine my personal feelings about my spirituality with a broader context in mind. This course led me to consider and begin to understand how the way I self-identify may impact the world around me, contribute to discourses I might previously have been ignorant of, and connect to historical trends.\r\n\r\nThis also course allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the history of spirituality in the United States. Most importantly, I learned that this topic cannot be discussed without also tackling the larger issues of cultural appropriation, colonialism, capitalism, and countless more.\r\n\r\nFinally, I learned that saying \"all religions are good and share a common goal\" is not always an antidote to intolerance. Rather, it might give us a free pass to keep \"foreign\" religions safely at a distance by convincing us that refusing to take a closer look at the complexities of and differences between religions is acceptable.\r\n\r\nI learned so much! Can't possibly list it all here. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of life knowledge by taking this course: I learned about religion as a category rather than as a tool for comparison, culture, appropriation, spirituality, privilege, and so much more. I developed more informed opinions and beliefs in my own spiritual life and personal development as well. ",
            "\u00a0I have developed so many great skills and insights during this course. Professor Grewal fostered each students' skills, knowledge, and insights to think from a personal and scholarly perspective. I, personally, have learned how to think more critically by taking this class. ",

            "\u00a0I learned more in this class about current events than any class I've ever taken. It really helped me understand our current social climate from a sociological, historical, and cultural perspective. "

            "\u00a0This class is great. You learn so much in such an engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Zareena Grewal is brilliant. The book choices for section readings are awesome.\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures can get very off topic and feel really hard to understand, and there are way too many readings for this class. To have two entirely different reading assignment schedules for lecture and sections is a lot to ask, and there are a lot of assignments for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Super interesting subject matter! ",
            "\u00a0I really like how interdisciplinary this course isour assignments drew from a rich variety of resources, including theory, history, fiction, and our own lives. I really liked the balance that was struck between lecturing and opportunities for student participation and activities for peer interaction during class. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is too broad to really dwell on any of the elaborate concepts that are front-loaded into the course. It feels quite disjointed. Every concept in and of itself is interesting and rich, but it feels disconnected. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this class! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nVery interesting mix of theory, novels, popular media sources. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nMore discussion of theory in section ",
            "\u00a0It feels like there are so many assignments in the professors attempt to make the course not a gut. However there is so much reading its almost impossible to do it all. Additionally we dont even discuss all of the readings in class, which reduces the incentive to do the readings. Fewer and more focused readings would be preferred. ",
            "\u00a0The topic is very interesting and the balance of cool articles, history, and novels is great and a rare one to strike in the same course. I also liked how interactive the lecture was.  However the organization and the way students are evaluated really needs to be assessed in this class. The readings are a lot to do so it can be a bit frustrating to spend lecture summarizing them, but more so it was very frustrating when class would start very late or when the whole class would be spent watching a movie which we could watch on our own. Also the section would have been a great opportunity to discuss the novels but the discussions were SO shallow if not nonexistent as we literally went over basic plot points. Also since the book reviews were such a small part of the class assessment it was clear that many people had just not read the book. The fact that 60% of the grade is based in essays thats arent very connected to the reading material causes students to largely not prioritize doing the readings, which really affects the tone of the class. If the readings were more evaluated in some way or with a final students would be more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0very interesting readings for class, the novels for sections were too much though. \r\n\r\nthe questions and discussions during lecture were super enjoyable and thought provoking. \r\n\r\nthe Schmidt reading was very helpful for learning about the rise of religious liberalism and spirituality - it gave a great historical background. \r\n\r\nAmazing professor who is informed, has interesting background knowledge that she integrates into the course smoothly. ",
            "\u00a0The class us interactive. There are a lot of discussions, videos, music and other ways to make the class engaging. However, there is also a lot of reading, like so much reading especially during the first half of the semester. A way to make the class more enjoyable and still educative is to reduce the readings. It would be so helpful and people will still learn and think as much. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, different from other courses being offered\r\nWeaknesses: The course covers a LOT of ground, doesn't progress in any meaningful way (jumps from topic to topic), assigns way too much reading and doesn't cover that reading in lecture or section. It was REALLY unclear to me why we had to read novels for section, given that we didn't even have enough time to talk about the readings. It would make way more sense to read two or three novels and devote the rest of the time to covering the extensive course readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Zareena Grewal is an amazing and engaging professor, very interesting material and readings \r\nWeaknesses: sometimes Professor Grewal will pick you out to talk about your experiences in class, whether you wrote them in your essays or a very small nod/shake of your head in response to the class, sometimes didnt want to speak out because it felt like I was going to be judged by the class ",
            "\u00a0This course made me rethink a lot of things I encounter daily - its cross listed in a bunch of departments and we touched on almost all of those. Little disorganized but Zareena ties everything together by the end ",
            "\u00a0The class was really well taught, especially given the format that Professor Grewal led each class with. I think the only critique I would have is to teach in a way that is a little bit more linear and make lecture slides perhaps available. I wish I could draw on them now as I move forward in life, but I don't have them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Inspiring, well-selected content\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to understand purpose and the progression ",
            "\u00a0So strong overall! My only suggestion is to lighten the reading load, as doing heavy readings for class on top of books can get to be a bit much and makes it difficult to engage with all the relevant material. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best course I have taken at Yale. It is interactive, fun and immensely interesting. Lecture doesn't seem like lecture, but rather a discussion through which the Professor tries to convey a concept or idea. It is by far the most engaging form of teaching I have experienced and the class I have enjoyed the most. ",
            "\u00a0The class is great because of the content and relevance. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers an insane amount of incredibly important topics without ever glossing shallowly over any of them. I learned that so many issues I had previously assumed to be entirely separate were actually deeply interconnected. The best part of the course for me was leaving a class feeling incredibly enlightened, but having no idea how we ended up on the topic we did. After every lecture, I was eager to talk to my friends about what I'd learned. I also loved the balance of dense religious theory readings for lecture with novels for section that related in specific ways to the larger topics we discussed. I was also always engaged due to the variety of assignments: we wrote papers based around interviews of people in our lives, designed our own fortune cookie messages and interpreted Koran verses for Canvas discussion threads, and even took field trips to boutique fitness classes to see first-hand how capitalism impacts spirituality. This course was incredible.\r\n\r\nThis course is not particularly structured, which I suppose some might see as a weakness but did not bother me personally. Everything we covered was captivating, and I never felt lost or confused. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly engaging lectures, most readings\r\nWeaknesses: some of the readings were excessive compared to what we discussed in lecture; section was not very engaging ",
            "\u00a0I think this class met too often. We had a 75 minute lecture twice a week, as well as a 50 minute section. To improve this course, the lecture should be 50 minutes, twice a week, plus a section. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a really good job on surveying the topic and question of \"Spiritual but not Religious.\" It definitely wasn't what I had expected, but you really do learn a lot! The workload has also declined in comparison to the first year it was taught, so I wouldn't be too worried about that. There were three short narrative papers and three book reviews total. However, I do think the format of how the books are read and discussed separately in section could be improved perhaps incorporated into lecture somehow as well. I found it difficult to finish the books while there were also weekly readings for lecture as well, and sometimes I would skip the book readings. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: fantastic readings & course material\r\nweaknesses: lectures will not make sense/be very engaging unless you have done the readings! ",

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale, and Zareena is an amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0Though I had a few qualms with the way class was run, I still absolutely would recommend this course- it's a great 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome class. No second midterm/final, so after the midterm you can just sit in class and listen to Zareena make controversial statements. A thoroughly enjoyable time. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! I think that spirituality and its role in shaping our social, political, and economic world/how it in turn is shaped by these forces is something that every Yale student should think about. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, always left class feeling very energized and inquisitive and introspective. The papers are also really fun to write (get to learn things you may not otherwise know about the people you interview)! ",
            "\u00a0Take the class! Lots of reading, but just do it! ",
            "\u00a0This is a complicated question. Zareena is a very cool person and I really enjoyed getting to know her over the course of the semester. She is funny, very knowledgable, and likes to make her students think, so being in lecture was usually a good time. With that said, the course has some serious flaws. As great as Zareena is, her lectures often had zero structure. Like actually none. We would be talking about a reading, and then suddenly she would start talking about frats at Yale, then to a different reading, then pull up a Youtube video that seemed unrelated, then we would start talking about cultural appropriation. Our second lecture was about cultural appropriation, and I walked out feeling like I knew more about it and how it causes harm, but then at least 50% of the lectures in the course mentioned it. Very rarely did she add more to it, she would just re-say what we had already talked about. It was almost bizarre. The sections for this course are separate from the rest of class because you read novels that you only talk about in section and not in lecture. But, Zareena also assigns a huge amount of academic readings for lecture, and then is surprised when people don't do them. It's a lot of reading for a lecture; if she assigned half as much, I think people would actually do them. With all this said, I enjoyed the course even though I don't think there was enough material to fill really half a semester, let alone twelve weeks. The assignments are easy, the grading is easy, and you will be fine. It's a good 5th class if you want a lecture that is sometimes interesting, but sometimes a waste of time, unfortunately. Love Zareena though! She really is very cool, the course just needs some serious revamping. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0The subject material of this class is quite interesting, as is the way that Zareena runs the lecture. If you do all the readings which are quite interesting you will get a lot from the class, however the structure and assessments of this class are organized in a way that you have very little incentive to do this. This would make the class pretty easy while lecture still enjoyable but you would feel quite disappointed by the end that you didnt delve as deep into the material. So the class is really what you make of it in the end. However discussion section was utterly unstimulating and this was a large disappointment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! it covers material that I feel is left out of most yale course work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fun class. There is a lot of discussion and arguments. There's also a lot of reading, for lecture and for section, so be ready to have a lot of homework. ",
            "\u00a0This isn't a bad course, but it will only work for some students.  I would not recommend it if you prefer a strong sense of organization in lecture. Professor Grewal jumps around between topics and doesn't really get through most of the reading. Some lectures will be interesting, some will feel like a waste of time. There is far too much reading--there were some novels I didn't even open. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend this class!! Make sure to take it sometime during your four semesters, its a great class that makes you think about the machinations that drive Yale and America, and while you wont learn anything groundbreaking about yourself (its not Life Worth Living), you do learn a lot about modern millennial society (that kind of includes you) ",
            "\u00a0YES great senior spring course. Chill but also learned something. The readings are really great, you can get either your Hu or Soc requirement. Great. Prepare to get called out in class and for Zareena to know who you are ",
            "\u00a0YES, I think every student should take this course and with the intention of learning, not trying to get a good grade or just doing things for points. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. It was eye-opening, engaging and just, in general, an amazing class. I would take it all over again if I could. The readings for section (and that we write papers on) are usually fiction (the Life of Pi, Blankets, 40 Rules of Love, etc.) which means that during the class you actually get some leisurely reading done which is rare for a Yale class. Professor Grewal is an incredible wealth of knowledge and can offer so many insights into Islam in America, cultural appropriation and its effects, and just general issues that you likely wouldn't have considered before. Her goal was to \"make the unfamiliar familiar and make you question what you know\" and she absolutely does that. The class is also very well structured to get a good grade, even despite the scary introduction. As long as you're engaged, you'll likely do really well. ",
            "\u00a0no ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you will dedicate yourself and are openminded. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The grading isn't too harsh, so if that's what you're worried about, don't be. Either way, this course is worth it. You'll learn to think critically about structures and institutions around you, gain a deeper understanding of yourself and the way you want to live your life, and uncover information about the history that shapes our society that you never knew existed. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is the best course I've taken at Yale and the one from which I have learned the most about myself and my culture. This course makes you better understand the role of religion in your life and in your society which I feel is one of the most important things in our culture. If you do the readings and participate in class you will find that this is an extremely rewarding course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is so interesting and applicable. I feel like I have learned so much about myself and it has truly changed the way I think about the world. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for consistent weekly work, a clearly defined syllabus, PowerPoints every day in class, and knowing exactly what will be on the midterm, this course isn't for you. But if you're looking to drastically increase your self-knowledge, learn a subset of American history that is frequently overlooked, evaluate myriad current events from fascinating new perspectives, and be moved to tears by readings, this course is for you. As someone who has always known I'm not an atheist but has never really been sure of how to define myself, this course was life-changing. If you are at all curious about your own relationship to spirituality, spirituality in America, or religious issues facing our country today, TAKE THIS COURSE!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes! I would recommend this course to anyone- whether spiritual, religious or not, whether you have thought about these topics extensively or not at all. This should be added to your bucket list of Yale classes. It is so fascinating and such a unique opportunity to learn things that will be beneficial to your personal life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. Professor Grewal's dedication to the students and the course material is unmatched. I think all undergrads should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Take it, it's definitely worth it. One of my favorite classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to anyone on campus to take. I wish more people were able to join the class because discussions in lecture really allowed people to think critically and evaluate the implications of religious and spiritual experience as they related to all spaces of human life that are currently affecting us today. The current application of knowledge presented in class lecture that can be referenced in everyday life makes the class fulfilling to go to. A decent amount of readings, however, are required for the class. Proficiency in critical assessment of text and conveying a message can also help to ensure success in this course as participation is heavily encouraged. ",
            "\u00a0yes!!!! i really enjoyed this class, it will teach you how to engage with the world around you from a perspective that understands that our culture/society has been constructed in a way that privileges the experiences of a few (whites, etc) and ignores those of others (Muslims, other minority groups) and also was really convicting for me personally to use my position of power/privilege in order to help those with less power instead of being complacent. will change the way how you see thew world ",
