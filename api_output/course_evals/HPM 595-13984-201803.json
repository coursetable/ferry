            "\u00a0It's a great class that provides a comprehensive review of FDA laws with case studies. Prof Kesselheim is knowledgeable and experienced with FDA laws, which gave me insights into the class! He also communicated with students through daily FDA related news often and kept us in check. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, incredible lectures and guest speakers, all around very happy with the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very comprehensive introduction course for someone wants to learn about FDA Law and Policy. The  materials covered a broad collection of topics  and with good supporting cases. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course that covers a lot of very important material. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lecture course at the law school. As an mph student, I guess I was expecting more of an interactive learning experience with more discussions, especially when they limited the number of mph students according to how many law students took the course. There were discussion points, but it was more of a guess-the-answer type and some byo current events. There was so much hype about it at the beginning of the semester, but all in all it's quite a normal lecture about the history of the FDA. It's cross listed as a ysph course, but you feel like you decided to purposefully take a Law-school-only course. \r\nThe greatest strength was that the professor was really an expert.\r\n\r\n+ This really shouldn't be cross-listed as a YSPH course. if it is cross-listed in ysph, the class should be more welcoming of ysph students and their backgrounds. During the extra classes we have to take, maybe there should be a quick basics of what-1Ls-learn overview. Securities, trade secrets, how to effectively read a case, etc. I do not think this class should be taken in complete absence of other basic law classes. Or at least have a TF. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to FDA law and policy. The lectures are extremely informative. The students who take the course are able to discuss readings and current issues at a high level so the discussions typically brought out interesting points. The only weakness might be the lack of interactive work with other students. We had one \"extra class\" that was optional, but the group exercises in decision-making during this session were very stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0This course introduces students to the most important food and drug law concepts.  I would make no changes.  Professor Kesselheim has accomplished a near miracle with the comprehensiveness and breadth of this course, without making it feel like an oppressive amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0Great course for those interested in pharma/ FDA law ",
            "\u00a0strengths: donuts, good overview of history leading to the current FDA framework, fast-paced, interesting topics covered in the extra classes\r\nweaknesses: we're graded on participation but sometimes lectures can be so jam-packed that there's not much room for class discussion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent instructor; Engaging discussions; A nice mix of primary and secondary readings; Challenging final project\r\nWeaknesses: Class only meets 8 times, plus bonus sessions for YSPH students; I think more writing assignments throughout the semester would have been helpful, though given the class size may require a TF.

            "\u00a0It is a true pleasure to learn from and speak with Dr. Kesselheim. He is brilliant and very talented at leading a course on and discussing FDA law. My only feedback would be to minimize the details of some regulatory lectures and focus more on discussion instead. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kesselheim gave thoughtful feedback and was always available to students, despite living in Boston. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kesselheim has a very energetic teaching style and always brought us Donuts (*not as a bribery so that we will rate him 5 star). He is very logical about the flow of teaching materials and all the materials are specifically selected. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Kesselheim is truly expert in this field. He is also wonderfully supportive and giving of his time. One of the best! ",
            "\u00a0Yale is lucky to have him.  Hes a true expert but also one of the best teachers I have ever had at any level.  Hes funny in an endearing way.  Hes THE expert.  No one else knows how much Aaron Kesselheim knows about FDA law.  Hes extremely gifted at balancing lectures with the Socratic method. ",

            "\u00a0It is a great class if you are interested in FDA laws. It is in general an overview and comprehensive review of FDA responsibility and specific regulations. But it is not a techinical class ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class - definitely take ",
            "\u00a0A very good regulatory introduction course for anyone wants to enter healthcare industry. ",

It was well-structured, and legal developments are covered chronologically, so even if you're not intimately acquainted with the US judicial/legal system, you'll be able to catch on easily enough. I particularly like the discussions on controversial cases, and hearing about recent FDA news in the class newsletter. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended. ",
            "\u00a0This course does not cover the Food or (really) the tobacco aspects of the FDA. If you are interested in drug regulation however, this is a must. "
