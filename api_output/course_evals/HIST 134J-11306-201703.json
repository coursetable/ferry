            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to do thorough history and learned a tremendous amount about Yale and its role in developing the nation and world. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first course in which I REALLY did archival research. Developing those skills was fun.\r\n\r\nIt was super interesting to learn about my school's history and imprint on a national scale. \r\n\r\nAnd this class was FUN! Fun with its field trips and guest speakers and activities and general vibe. Gitlin knows how to make a class engaging. \r\n\r\nI love Yale even more now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Yale and actually like the school even more as a result ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough understanding of how Yale's history is connected to American history. Professor Gitlin gives students a first-hand account of Yale history, which all of us in the class are so wonderfully lucky to have had. ",
            "\u00a0A unique look at Yale which no other course could have offered--truly one of its kind. The field visits, interactive projects, etc. were very helpful. "

            "\u00a0Best course, a must-take if you can get in ",
            "\u00a0THIS COURSE COULD NOT BE IMPROVED IN ANY WAY. PROFESSOR GITLIN IS THE BEST THING TO EVER HAPPEN TO THE YALE HISTORY DEPT. ",
            "\u00a0ONLY strengths. Should be on every Yalie's dream schedule. School spirit has never been stronger. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course is great! The only thing that could be improved is having a more tailored syllabus. All the readings are great and helpful, but, in class, we rarely have time to discuss all the readings. It would be helpful to have separate, realistic lists for which readings we will discuss and which readings can be optional. "

            "\u00a0Take this if you want the 'Jay Gitlin' experience. Hell of a ride. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to anyone--it's a great history course and will boost your enthusiasm about Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Jay Gitlin is one of those professors who CARES, about the material and about his students. \r\n\r\nYou'll have amazing guests at seminars (Sam Chauncey is the GOAT), get to do fun activities like drink wine and sing Cole Porter, or have class in the Yale Corporation room, etc. \r\n\r\nIf you're a senior history major, you simply must take this class before you graduate. If you're younger than a senior and this interests you, try your best to get in. \r\n\r\nThe final essay was also a lot of fun to research and write. Gitlin and Bill Landis were immensely helpful during the process and make it a pleasure. \r\n\r\nSometimes Prof. Gitlin can be a little bit too much, but overall this class is a blast and a Yale CLASSIC. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY!!! Please take this. It is fun while also teaching you so much about Yale ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS A GEM OF A COURSE! IF YOU DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE, THEN YOU ARE MISSING OUT ON ONE OF THE BEST PROFESSORS, LEARNING ABOUT YALE HISTORY, AND ONE OF THE BEST EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. TAKE THIS COURSE! ",
            "\u00a0YES. Prof G is a legend who will teach you fascinating things about Yale, America and most importantly, yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Yale and America if you know what you are getting into. Professor Gitlin runs his own show. There is no discussion. It's a good class to sit back and take it all in, but it's not engaging or even rewarding. Graveyard tour was cool. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a fun class, and Professor Gitlin is great. You learn a lot about Yale, but also, a lot about the American context which shaped Yale and also how Yale shaped the US. "
