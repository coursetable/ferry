            "\u00a0This course is really what all English seminars should aspire to. I learned how to read an author deeply and engage with critical literature with care. I found my mind become more porous as a result of focusing on a single author as well. Each class discussion felt like my brain had been opened up and sweet nectar poured through all the crannies. Woolf wouldn't me to wax poetic here, preferring I just come out and say what I mean, but as Woolf would also understand, sometimes its so hard to explain what you mean, life doesn't work like that. To say what \"knowledge\" I developed would be to betray the point of this course, which is to get students to stop thinking about their education as the acquisition of skills and insights, and start seeing it as a place to explore one's own (and other's) consciousness. In fact, if you really want to jot down in some administrative database what I \"learned\" from this course, put down this: \"ENGL 446 taught me that Yale hasn't properly educated you until you take ENGL 446.\" ",
            "\u00a0A thorough overview of Virginia Woolf's life and work, as well as a decent understanding of the reception history throughout the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Of course, I learned so much about Virginia Woolf and her writing. It was such a treat to study one author for a whole semester, and I feel like I have gained a vast knowledge. This course often touches on the general period of Woolf's life, and so I have a better understanding of the Victorian and post-war eras as well. \r\n\r\nProfessor Homans is an invaluable resource and mentor. She is available at every step of the process in learning about Woolf and writing the final essay. She knows so much about Woolf and is very good at sharing that knowledge in class. She also gives very good advice about framing questions, organizing the essay, and consulting other sources as you reach the end of the semester. I feel very lucky to have been in her class for a smester. In all, this was one of my favorite classes at Yale and I definitely recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned way more about Woolf than I ever thought I'd know, and also learned to start a research paper very early ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to read across a wide range of themes and perspectives over the long literary career of Virginia Woolf. I gained more familiarity with her most important texts and was able to create analyses out of the dialogue between her works and the secondary materials she wrote supporting her writing philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about Virginia Woolf's life and the historical context of England during her lifetime. Since I did not know about late 18th/early 19th century England, this was an interesting class.\r\nI also learned a little bit more about the modernist approach, although to be honest I still don't really understand it completely. But modernism has always eluded me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a bit about Virginia Woolf's life and work, as well as how they fit into larger literary and historical contexts. "

            "\u00a0This course presents the greatest hits of Virginia Woolf, which is basically all of Virginia Woolf because she's an incredible author and thinker. The sheer amount of reading sometimes gets the better of you, but I suppose that's sort of the point: to feel like Virginia Woolf and her accompanying scholars always have the upper hand. One slight issue I had was with the discussions. Professor Homans does a ROCKIN job in class, but for some reason only about half the class engaged with the material. Of 14 people in class, only about 6 spoke on a regular basis, which is disappointing considering THESE ARE SOME OF THE GREATEST BOOKS OF ALL TIME. I'll never understand why Yale students have nothing to say. \r\n\r\nI probably sound like one of these anti-WGSS people when I say this, but I wonder if the class would attract a different level of discussion if it weren't cross listed with the WGSS major. The English majors in class were by and large the driving force behind each discussion, and I think some English majors might avoid the class altogether because they're worried it's heavy on the gender theory (which it really isn't). So, bottom line, make the class English only and you might improve class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class discussions led by Professor Homans. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for each week were very heavy, but I wouldn't have cut anything. It was very helpful to have all the resources on the syllabus to consult when writing the final essay. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I can't think of any weaknesses. I wish we'd had more time to read the Hermione Lee biography, although I don't know how that would've been possible given everything else we were covering ",
            "\u00a0I loved the reading list of the semester, and each seminar was truly enlightening-- building upon the overarching themes of the semester while also encapsulating the themes unique to the novel being discussed that day. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include getting to read almost all of Woolf's works, plus supplementary diary readings, essays, reviews, and other historical documents. This is the epitome of a survey course.\r\nHowever, as with all survey courses, the depth of intellectual engagement with the readings was rather shallow. In fact, we were often expected (though not technically \"required\") to read several dozen pages of material that we either did not discuss at all in class or only touched on briefly. This made me wonder if shorter, more targeted supplementary readings should have been assigned instead. ",
            "\u00a0The course is challenging, but rewarding. The seminar allows for meaningful discussion about Woolf's work, and Professor Homans does a great job of guiding the class while still letting students go over areas of interest in the texts. I would recommend maybe one fewer week of student presentations, as I didn't find it too helpful. Or perhaps split into groups for mini presentations? "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS IF IT'S THE LAST THING YOU DO. I REPEAT, DO NOT GRADUATE FROM YALE AS AN ENGLISH MAJOR IF YOU HAVE NOT TAKEN THIS CLASS. Okay  caps lock off now. Seriously, the other reviews here are positive for a reason. We didn't all get brainwashed by the professor to write this stuff. Professor Homans really is a superb section leader, but more importantly she's a teacher, an educator in the old traditional sense. She won't just show you how to read Woolf, she'll teach you about identity, and consciousness, and literature and biography and pretty much anything you could imagine. Yes, there's a lot of reading, but Professor Homans KNOWs there's a lot, so she's not expecting students to be 100% up to speed each class. That said, make your best effort to read the novels (the secondary lit is so-so) and this class will be rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Especially if you know you like Woolf's work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I whole-heartedly recommend!! This course was the perfect seminar to cap off my time as an English major. I learned so much about writing, reading, and Virginia Woolf. A truly irreplaceable experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you can get in, TAKE IT!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course! If you have any interest in the novels of Virginia Woolf, or would simply love the opportunity to read, discuss, and analyze beautiful prose, this class is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to student who is a Woolf fanatic and/or is very interested in modernism and confident in their ability to analyze it. I would not recommend this course to anybody else, as it quickly becomes a very difficult course to navigate if you find that you do not, in fact, enjoy or understand Woolf's writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you enjoy seminars and are able to put aside ample time for weekly reading, I would definitely recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0An incredible class. Professor Homans is brilliant, warm, and engaging, the texts are amazing, discussion was always very engaging. "
