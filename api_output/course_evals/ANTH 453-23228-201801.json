            "\u00a0One of the best courses I have ever taken at Yale. A broad overview of anthropology as related to health, equity, and other intersectional identities including gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, etc. Touched well upon Humanitarian Interventions as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main thing I learned from this class was how to critically analyze publications. It was funny because I found myself critical analyzing pieces of work outside of the context of this class but as a science major that really isn't a skill set that I have had to use often. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about when concept of health equity and about where the field of anthropology intersects with it but also lots of discussions about applications ",
            "\u00a0I received a broad overview of major topics and concepts in the field of medical anthropology (and beyond), and was able to practice applying those concepts towards analyzing various health interventions for both their impact and their equity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of writing, I also had practice making very concise yet effect arguments through both the critical analyses and the final paper. Cutting down an extended analysis into just a couple of pages was no easy task, and I'm very glad that I got to develop this skill over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0great class that discussed various key concepts and conceptual frameworks to understand and critically examine health equity/health disparities. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the vocabulary and knowledge skill set to approach discussions on health and interventions with an equity lens. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an in depth look at what the concept of equity means and how it can be applied to health and health outcomes around the world. Through the class readings and discussions, this class taught me to think in an open-minded way, with the goal of promoting fairness for everyone. I also learned about what kinds of interventions work best for which situations and the benefits and drawbacks of different types of health interventions. ",
            "\u00a0An in-depth understanding of current issues in global health equity, health disparities, and the policy measures that can be put in place in order to combat health disparities. We learned how to read and analyze ethnographies as well as social science papers. Ultimately this class allowed for a larger appreciation of the vast array of social determinants of health and equity that exist. ",
            "\u00a0I developed such a robust understanding of the issues and approaches to health disparities. My understanding of the topics covered is so much more nuanced. As someone who has taken a lot of health classes, it was helpful to have many of the issues covered in one class in an upper-level seminar because I feel like I have a much deeper understanding and could talk intelligently at length on many of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very important if you are interested in policymaking. It teaches you about the differences between equity and equality and its implications for society. I never understood the power of unintended consequences associated with making policies. Take this course to learn what factors to take into account vital concepts in life such as multi-level thinking, syndemics, and stigma. It equips you with vital tools! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more clearly and to the point; how to use research highlights to capture the essence of what I'm saying. I learned a tonne about the importance of anthropology and human experience in the field of medicine and global/public health. I'm also taking away great frameworks for how to think about about problems. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS THE BEST COURSE I HAVE TAKEN AT YALE \r\nI WILL LITERALLY TELL MY GRANDCHILDREN ABOUT IT \r\nTHIS IS A HIGHLIGHT OF THIS UNIVERSITY ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the causes of health inequity as well as frameworks for change.\r\nCovered topics related to health such as race, stigma, gender, mental health, structural inequality, and changing the culture of health.\r\nA major message of the course was how social factors determine health outcomes and unequally distribute health outcomes across populations.\r\nPracticed writing succinctly to get across a point persuasively.\r\nI learned just how much social inequities can lead to inequitable health outcomes, and the course reinforced my commitment to social justice. This course put a spotlight on how important it is to value the health and well-being of ALL people, as well as how to accomplish this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply the principles of health equity to a variety of topics and critically analysis and design health interventions using these principles. "

            "\u00a0Strengths) Amazing instructor and TA. Well chosen readings. Insightful discussion. Reasonable workload and assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses) Very overview based, more breadth than depth. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class could be improved by accepting less people into it. There were too many people and I often found that if I wanted to contribute I couldn't say more than one thing a class because I wanted everyone to get a word in. It was strong though because I really liked the style of having small groups present the readings and the class discussion was always fun. The guest speakers were also super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the readings were amazing, Professor and TA were wonderful\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - discussions werent as enlightening as the readings often ",
            "\u00a0The course makes you apply broad anthropological and social science concepts in evaluating specific case studies, so you learn what ingredients make up a successful and equitable health intervention in a given context. Seeing how these different factors interact to influence health outcomes is so eye-opening. Class exercises, discussions, and reading/writing assignments also do a good job of forcing you to challenge your prior assumptions, think critically about any particular health intervention, and practice articulating coherent and concise arguments.\r\n\r\nWhile the relative freedom in terms of structuring the writing assignment and final paper/project was refreshing, I maybe would have liked to see a little bit more formal guidance on developing my critical writing skills -- either in class at the beginning of the semester or through 1-on-1 appointments (though I realize now that I should have reached out for appointments myself). ",
            "\u00a0it was well-taught, with very interesting course material. as with some seminars, it was guided largely by student discussion, which wasn't always the most productive (we students sure are great at using many words to say very little....) I would love to have heard more from the instructor CPB and aalyia, both of which were very knowledgeable individuals. this could be done easily without running risk of turning a seminar into a lecture. the instructors were good about taking student feedback, and they worked hard to incorporate feedback in the way they structured the second half of the course. great job bringing in compelling speakers! ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely fantastic. The variety of small and large group activities, the student presentations, and the in class discussions were stimulating and enjoyable. The guest speakers were great but I think I would have actually preferred having one or two more class sessions with just our class and fewer speakers. ",
            "\u00a0The class readings are a great strength, as they connect very well with each other and greatly facilitate class discussions. Professor Panter-Brick is definitely the greatest strength of this course, as her interactive way of teaching is truly engaging for her students since it allowed us to speak our minds and at the same time think critically about the course material and apply it to our everyday lives. ",
            "\u00a0CPB is a wonderful professor and person and we all adored her and her dedication to the material and her students. She was the greatest strength of the class as well as her ability to foster engaging discussion, give meaningful feedback and bring in very exciting guest speakers. All of the students were highly engaged and dedicated to the class and its material. The weakness was that at times I felt that we wouldn't really discuss the readings that much or dive into the themes but would instead talk about various adjacent issues. The activities were interesting but at times I think that we would have been better served to engage directly with her in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The class is interesting, but the workload is very high. Instructions were vague, often filled with buzzwords instead of clear, concrete directions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learning how to write effectively for a science/medical anthropology journal audience. Engaging readings and format. Class discussions always sparked ideas and kept my mind turning over what we discussed. Having the presentations of readings was very helpful. \r\nWeaknesses: I wish Professor Panter-Brick played a larger role in class! She's so amazing, and I wish I could have heard from her more. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that each seminar is student-led, which means that there is no regimented structure for each week making classes more fun and engaging. In addition, you get two insights from the course instructor and TA, which generates very interesting discussions. The other main strength has to be the variety of the topics taught in this class; even though at first it seems that they are not related, looking back you can see how they all interact with one another.  Lastly, we get guest lecturers who are experts in the field and this adds a different component of discussion to the table. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class was always engaging, varied, fun, and interesting. We covered a wide range of important topics in health and really dived into them in some depth. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class size was slightly too big - at times felt quite competitive to have your voice heard. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated slightly more concrete suggestions when it came to improving on my CAs, as it was always difficult to tell if I was going in the right direction with my edits until it was too late. ",
            "\u00a0SUCH A FANTASTIC COURSE\r\nhowever, the one minor weakness is that every seminar resulted in the same conclusion in that health disparities are intersectional and health equity requires a multilevel approach. although it felt redundant, I feel that this in itself was a take home message of the class. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: super interesting readings; you get to pick from a list of readings each week; at the beginning of each class, there is a group presentation to do an overview of the readings and hammer home main points; Professor Panter-Brick and Aalyia are amazing instructors who are super caring, funny, and passionate about the subject; the guest speakers were the highlights of the course for me because they were SO interesting and knowledgeable; only three 2-page papers throughout the semester, and a 10-12 page final paper.\r\nWEAKNESSES: sometimes discussions were a little boring and didn't go much further than the basics. I've taken many social science courses related to social injustice, so during many of the class discussions I felt like the content was a little obvious. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved class discussion and the case studies. The readings were also amazing. \r\nWeaknesses:  a few more guidelines for the assignments might have been nice "

            "\u00a0Yes. One of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale. If you can get in, take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! I didn't need a writing credit but its an awesome pre med writing credit. For anyone interested in public health especially on a global scale this is a great class too. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend the course -- try your hardest to get in (shop multiple years if you have to). Everyone is ready to engage in discussion regarding these (important!) factors that determine health outcomes, and you leave the class with quite a broadened perspective of health way beyond simply healthcare. You'll appreciate the various concepts covered in class once you see how they are or aren't incorporated in various health interventions and how effective and equitable the interventions are as a result. Definitely start the critical analyses and final paper/project way in advance -- while it may not seem like that much work at first glance, it's surprisingly difficult and time-consuming (but worthwhile) to extract a concise and coherent argument from your various readings. And do as many readings as possible (1) because they're so interesting and (2) because they're the lifeblood of the course, particularly the discussions and of course the writing assignments. Plus the atmosphere of the seminar is so friendly and comfortable, owing to the wonderful personalities of both CPB and Aalyia, our TA. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class if you're interested in health disparities from looking at health disparities and equity from an anthropologist's perspective. good content, compelling readings, and excellent professor. You will get a lot out of the class if you're willing to put in the work to engage and wrestle with the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in health or anyone considering going into a health-related profession. This class provided me with absolutely crucial insight on what it means to be healthy, why we care, and what health equity looks like. The students Professor Panter-Brick picks for the course are wonderful and incredibly kind and insightful; by the end of the semester, we had developed a great dynamic as a class. Professor Panter-Brick herself is, well, a star of her field; she is brilliant, wise, kind, and very sharp. Definitely take this class, if not for the subject material, then for her and the other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! This course is great for everyone, but especially for those interested in entering a health-related field. Professor Panter-Brick is truly amazing and her teaching style made the class an incredible time. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! This was a relatively hard class to get into and it was clear that CPB had handpicked the students that were in the class to make sure that there were diverse perspectives in the room and that everyone was very dedicated to the topic and public health. CPB is a great professor and someone you definitely want to get to know during your time at Yale. If you are interested in global health or medicine this class will change the way that you see medicine and health moving forward.  It was a fair workload and so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I most definitely would! Especially because a lot of students were pre-med/biology majors with little exposure to this approach to health, it was compelling to watch them learn a new health framework and it is reassuring that future doctors who have taken the class will have an understanding of the complexities of biosocial understandings of health. For non pre-med people, it is also a fantastic class and what we learn can be applied to any variation of health/policy/legal/academic profession. Also, the cohort who takes the class is just fantastic!  So it's fun to learn from everyone in the class as well as Professor Panter-Brick and Aalyia. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you have any vague interest in policymaking, It is an eye-opener and teaches you how to take various variables into consideration when designing a piece of policy to ensure that nobody is left behind. You have many students in the class with a variety of interests and backgrounds, which teaches you to look at these policies from a different perspective. Looking at issues from various lenses is key. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, yes! If you can get in, this class is a pure gift. Prof. Panter-Brick is a world renowned expert and she has so many lessons to impart to her students. The critical analyses and final paper are different from any other assessments I've done and not your typical essay, but they've made my writing stronger. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in health disparities (or even health in general), I would absolutely recommend this class. This class is what you make of it, and you will find the lessons incredibly insightful and fascinating if you are dedicated when it comes to readings and discussions (they will still be insightful otherwise, but it won't be quite the same and will make for a less compelling discussion). This has been my favorite class by far at Yale, in part because this is already a topic I enjoy, but also because Prof. Panter- Brick (Aalyia) are phenomenal instructors who are clearly invested and love to interact and engage with students. The lessons learned in this class will likely serve me for the rest of my career and life. ",
            "\u00a0YES DO IT\r\nIT MAY CHANGE YOUR LIFE ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are at all interested in social justice, public health, or health inequalities, definitely shop it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take it if you get the chance! "
