The examples and case studies presented in the course were from different parts of the world, which gave me a global perspective on the application of different techniques. \r\nI developed technical skills that where applied in the team exercises, for example, the design of an agroforestry business.

I heard that normally the course had a field trip to Mexico, but considering Eric's life-situation, it is perfectly understandable that the field trip was less immersive than other years. ",

They could be simplified and streamlined. Also, I felt like I would have liked a bit more context with every lecture. Sometimes we jumped right in and it was confusing to be discussing so many little details. I would have appreciated the opportunity to take a step back and consider the main point rather than focus on the little details. ",
            "\u00a0Eric Toensmeier's inspiring example, deep knowledge and competence, and contagious enthusiasm for the beauty and importance of his life's work is the greatest strength of this class. I found hearing him speak each Tuesday night both informative and inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0I have tons of respect for Eric- he walks the talk! He's knowledgeable about so many things in the agroforestry space.  Very happy to have been pushed to write that final paper (as much of a hassle it was!).  Thats a really valuable experience.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have loved the opportunity for more student discussion around these topics.  For example, in discussing the value of meat-eating and grazing practices, it could have been interesting for the class to have a prepared debate, where teams on either side would read up on materials to support their stance and then have a fact-based debate.  \r\n\r\nI also question the value of the modeling exercises: I would have preferred that academic studies were assigned as readings (grazing, value of woody perennials for carbon-sequestration, financing mechanisms- case reports on land leases/payment for ecosystem services/etc) with more time allotted for discussion at the beginning of class (and maybe even cold-calling for student-accountability). ",

I recommend offering it earlier in the day.\r\n- I think this should be a full-semester class instead of a 6-week class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Warm, engaging, and open professor that I willing to answer any question and ensure that students understand the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:Not a very strict structure, so if you want to learn the material you have to be committed to doing the readings on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - professor has decades of experience living and breathing (and planting!) the material. Great contacts, enthusiastic, and empowering. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very informative and engaging. The opportunity to write a research paper about a topic of our choice was wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe homework exercises did not require much thought. I wonder if it would be helpful to develop more of a longer term design project that requires more intellectual engagement and research from the students.\r\n\r\nThough there are reasons this course could only be taught for half a semester, it would be great if it could be a full semester. ",
            "\u00a0It's a shame that the course was shortened, but I understand the circumstances.  For the time we had, I'm not sure what else could be done to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0The course excelled in introducing students to different types of agricultural methods and crops, their pros and cons, and their suitable environments. Professor Toensmeier's book was a handy tool to have and a good resource to go back to for more in depth information. I thought the weekly exercises were interesting a well thought out. However, I feel that I could have gotten more from them if they were tied together more intentionally. For example, instead of picking a general climate, it would have been cool to pick a specific area, like the Himalayan mountainside or Wyoming, and to develop a carbon farming design/land management plan/business model for that specific setting over the semester through the different homework assignments. That way, they could build on each other and go more in depth while providing opportunities for students to develop more concrete, practical skills and deliverables. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the expertise of the professor and that he wrote the textbook, which is an amazing reference and toolkit for the field. I found very few weaknesses with this course. "

The course empowered me with a much deeper understanding of the role of agriculture in climate change mitigation, introduced me to the old and new practices available to agroforesters, and presented me with many inspiring examples of organizations and role models. If you're interested in sustainable agriculture, it is hard to imagine a more inspiring person than Eric Toensmeier to learn from. His deep knowledge/ competence and contagious enthusiasm for the beauty and importance of his life's work is the greatest strength of this class.

Eric provides a lot of support but I felt, since it was only a 6-weeks course, that it was too little time for me to think about the topic, find related bibliography and write a final paper.\r\nOh, and also do buy the book! It costs like $50 on Amazon! ",
