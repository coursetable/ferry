            "\u00a0In-depth exploration of three thinkers: Hannah Arendt, Judith Butler, and Judith Shklar. Ways of comparing and contrasting their thoughts from multiple perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0The course is designed to think about refugees and exile from the perspective of exiles. The classmates you have are all really passionate and a certain political persuasion. Of course, you gain a lot of wisdom just by listening to Benhabib talk. ",
            "\u00a0I got a pretty good introduction to Arendt, Butler and, Shklar from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good survey of the concept of exile in relation to the Jewish experience. It touched upon many different perspectives and backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Helped me gain a familiarity with 20th century political thought, to consider the status of human rights. Helped me develop a better understanding of continental political philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to thinkers that I had never read before, this semester. I really enjoyed reading a select few writers in the course. Oftentimes, classes have such broad syllabi that you feel that you can't really get a grasp on any one thinker. Focusing on Arendt, Shklar, Butler and Said was both challenging and highly enjoyable. Over the course of the semester, I feel that I was able to identify patterns in their writing, and places where their ideas overlapped. This kind of cohesiveness is difficult to find in many syllabi, and Professor Benhabib provided a selection of reading that I found very thought provoking. \r\n\r\nI also found that my writing improved in the course of this class. Having written and presented on each of the thinkers we looked at, I feel as if I have finished the class with a good foundation in this specific area within political philosophy. While there is much still to read, and learn, this course has made me want to engage more in this material. "

            "\u00a0The major strength was the opportunity to focus on a few key texts in each class, without spreading ourselves too thin. The major weakness, in my opinion, pertains to the syllabus: after the first month, the readings and the discussions seemed to lose focus and coherence, insofar as they were meant to deal with the class themes of exile, statelessness, and migration. It would have been more apt to name this course \"Arendt, Butler, and Shklar,\" since much of it is about these three figures, but not necessarily about their views on exile. In addition, I strongly disliked the student presentations we had every week; they didn't add much to the discussion. We could have used those chunks of time much more effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Most of the class is listening to a person do a presentation and then listening to Benhabib talk. There isn't much room for discussion, and you often get only one or two chances to speak in class. This is fine for some people and not fine for others, but for me it was nice because there were a lot of section assholes in that class and this method regulated a lot of discussion, although we still went on tangents. I think the problem is then we never really fully addressed questions or tied any loose ends, and Seyla likes to cold call on people which can be terrifying. Overall, I think the strength of this class is the amazing classmates that you get to have and the amazing teacher you get to be in the prescence of for two hours a week. But a weakness is definitely that there is not an extreme amount of rigor in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that I learned some useful information from the course, but sometimes I felt that the seminar discussions were a bit lackluster. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings could be rearranged in terms of order and it would be very helpful if Eichmann in Jerusalem was included. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was well-structured, though I feel it would have worked better as a course 1) without the inclusion of the Said readings (which felt too disconnected from the themes explored by Arendt, Butler and Shklar), and 2) if we had read more of OT and perhaps had more background readings (even optional) for Arendt and Shklar. Another criticism I had was that the syllabus could have assigned more readingsthe class generally only required 4 hours of preparation per week. With some readings, such as the Butler readings, it obviously made sense to focus on closely reading a few short sections. But I often felt that in other class sessions we had not been assigned enough material to sustain an engaging discussion about the texts for two hours. Overall an excellent class. Professor Benhabib is brilliant and deeply inspiring. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the reading material on the syllabus, as well as the way the course was structured. I found the paper writing, and in-class presentations allowed me to engage with the material in depth.\r\n\r\nIn seminars I would have liked there to be more discussion, as it often felt like the only people who spoke in class were the people who were giving the presentation on that day.

            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you have previously enjoyed the works of some of these thinkers, or if you really want to take a course with Professor Benhabib. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you can get in! Seyla is a stressful person but it's important to keep in mind her lack of American upbringing and her general lack of time for undergraduates because she's so busy. But I really enjoyed being in her presence and that is enough. ",
            "\u00a0Very eclectic and not particularly organized, but a really interesting selection of thinkers.  In some ways more of a lecture than a seminar, but worth it to hear Professor Benhabibs perspective.  Pretty low workload. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list was spectacular (even if it didn't quite match the course title) and Prof. Benhabib's comments during class were always brilliant. The class was less explicitly about contemporary issues in migration and more about the theme/subject position of \"exile\" in political philosophy, particularly in relation to Jewish political theory, Zionism, etc. It was also really cool to have a syllabus in the philosophy department with just women and people of color as primary texts (white male philosophers relegated to commentary), and moreover to have this presented not as subversive or marginal but as a political philosophy canon. However, discussions were not always well-guided and so ended up fairly shallow or tangential. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes,  but only those very experienced in political theory. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed taking this class, and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in political philosophy. This class, while theory oriented, was fantastic in that many of the theoretical questions we engaged with, had serious implication for events happening in the news in the US and around the world. I really enjoyed getting to apply the thinking of people like Arendt, Shklar, and Butler to thinking about DACA and the refugee crisis in Europe. "
