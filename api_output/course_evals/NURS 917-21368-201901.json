            "\u00a0An basic understanding of the application of advanced statistical methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this course.  I definitely acquired more statistical skills, both for doing statistical analysis and interpreting statistics in research.  It was a great foundation for moving forward with more advanced statistics. ",
            "\u00a0A lot!! We learned about the most used statistical concepts used in Nursing Science: ANOVA, t-test, chi-square, linear and logistics regression, multilevel modeling and power calculations. Also, we gained a good \"working knowledge\" of the SAS program. "

            "\u00a0Because of the advanced nature of the course, I would recommend that students take an entry level biostatistics course before taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were useful and not overwhelming for each week.  They provided a great basis for understanding the topic.  Instead of having students answer the discussion questions that were covering large topic areas, I would have liked to have a basic overview (in the professor's words) of the topic and then follow-up discussion questions.  Sometimes when a student gave their answer to the question it was confusing, so if it were done in the reverse order (professor overview of foundation topic with follow-up discussion questions), I think it would have met the same purpose while giving everyone the same foundation. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: great professor teaching the course, who is willing and ABLE to explain the concepts to ALL levels of understanding. Thank you so much!!\r\n\r\nWeakness: perhaps the fact that Yale offers very little SAS tutoring, could impeded students in their learning...or their ability to trouble shoot and get extra help. Also, using SAS on MAC is a bit more difficult, so I would spend perhaps more time on teaching students about using the university library computers for SAS work. "

            "\u00a0Yes - great overview, and of all the statistical courses I've taken, this was the best at integrating topics into practical labs.  It was definitely a lot of work, and I put more hours into this course than I think I have ever put into a course before, but I can't see how else it could be structured that we would get the same information in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. And I actually am glad that YSN has decided to teach SAS and not just go into SPSS...it is a much more elaborate program to learn statistics on. "
