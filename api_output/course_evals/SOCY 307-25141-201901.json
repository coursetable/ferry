Only illustrating one side of this extremism takes it entirely out of its relative context and demonizes just one group of people while intentionally overlooking its equally dangerous counterpart. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. At Yale, there are not very many opportunities to study radical and extreme right movements and this course does an excellent job giving an overview of the academic literature and thinking surrounding them. It uses both this academic material and more contemporary focused media sources to provide students with an understanding of just how the radical right operates and how difficult it is to classify it.
