While the inner workings of the deductive system are arguably the focus of the course, learning about them in the context of classic philosophical arguments really allows you to reflect upon the syntax/semantics distinction that often gets overlooked in the everyday use of language. Close-analysis is always a great skill to have, and this class at its heart is really about that. ",

While the procedural skills (the skills needed to complete the procedures to solve problems) of the course are rather confined to the realm of first-order logic, the conceptual skills on which they are built can certainly be applied elsewhere, particularly courses that require deeply theoretical writing.

            "\u00a0This course is interesting and valuable. Nevertheless, I think it could be better taught in a seminar setting, forgoing the lecture altogether. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie in the sections, because they are a godsend. Lecture was difficult and confusing 90% of the time and sections were the time to really ask questions and get clarifications on everything we weren't sure about. I would say a weakness was the pace. The class moved super quickly and we never got a chance to master the material unless logic came naturally to you. ",
            "\u00a0This was possibly the most illogically structured class I have ever encountered. Particularly because it is a requirement for the philosophy major, I navely assumed that it would expend effort on linking the systems of first-order logic to how we can use the concepts in context to evaluate arguments (ex. going over types of fallacy, what consistency looks like in plain English, etc.). Instead, the vast majority of time in class felt highly unhelpful, as it usually seemed like digression upon digression and did not spend very much time going over basics like what words mean or concrete directions/tips. Since the lecture often meandered, it was difficult to tell what was important to take note on, and often things that were important to note were gone over so quickly that it was impossible to get the notes down in time. Additionally, the textbook is very disorganized and supremely unhelpful, especially since it hardly syncs up with the way the course was taught. ",
            "\u00a0This is the least logical course I have ever taken in my entire life. The textbook makes no sense. There's a final less than a week after the last midterm. We learned new material days before the exam during a makeup class that was a mile away. \r\nThe class would've been hard enough if it was presented in a way that was easy to understand, but without that, it was extremely difficult and required me to meet with my TF and go to office hours multiple times per week. Also, the first two midterms are in class and are EXTREMELY rushed so even though I studied, I made lots of careless mistakes because there was no time to look over it. \r\nThe class needs better overall organization, more structure, and better handouts that make concepts clear. Kenneth Winkler is an interesting lecturer but because he understands the material, he doesn't spend enough time on it for others, who aren't as logically talented to learn it. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting and there is great context given about philosophy, but sort of unclear and sometimes a little disconnected to the material tested on the exam. The textbook should not be made mandatory... it's very dense and difficult to read and was largely useless except for providing homework and practice problems. Both the professor and the TFs made themselves very accessible at all times and were willing to explain everything in detail. ",
            "\u00a0I think we spent a really long time on the first unit and there were a number of lectures which were very amusing and fun but not so full of content. ",
            "\u00a0The end of the semester seemed to pick up very quickly, and I wasn't sure if I could keep up entirely. Conceptual ideas are also rather hard to grasp, and I think they need to be laid out and explained in relation to each other in the beginning of the semester so that students understand them better. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated how responsive Professor Winkler and TA's were to feedback. I think the constant availability of the TA's and the professor were very helpful for those who were struggling to keep up with the material in the class. Unfortunately, that meant that the drawbacks to the course was that it seemed to go over new concepts fairly quickly and there wasn't a lot of time to fully understand the material before exams. I think this could be improved by having more section time to devote to understanding the material. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, lectures that went over the homework problems were very useful. ",
            "\u00a0HWs are reasonable and helpful, tests are a good level, resources are very clear and interesting. Reading the textbook is a waste of time, though; very repetitive, and redundant with lecture. I would suggest eliminating it, and posting scanned selections for reading assignments when relevant, and not redundant. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-organized and builds up the material in a adequately-paced incremental way. ",
            "\u00a0There were times when I felt like the lecture covered things that I understood but did not go over the topics I did not understand\r\nI remember there was one lecture when Professor Winkler was going over a derivation from the homework, and he did the first few steps--which I had gotten myself--and then the rest of the derivation, which I did not get, he said \"we can leave this as an exercise to the student\"\r\n\r\nI like the way he structured the course (especially after he explained why he did it the way he did at the end of the course)\r\n\r\nHe was very helpful :) ",
            "\u00a0Well organized and clear expectations. Tests were very fair and the homework load was quite reasonable. Very good class. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the course is strange, with almost two months before the first midterm and then two weeks between each of the subsequent tests, but other than that it was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Some lectures are pretty slow, just him going through problems. ",
            "\u00a0It's really hard when taught by winkler. the exams were okay but there were too many of them and the material was difficult. and there was SO much homework ",
            "\u00a0The lectures, too often, spent more time on irrelevant (but fun) anecdotes and extraneous applications of the concepts than on the actual concepts themselves, leaving much of the learning burden to be picked up outside the classroom and in section.\r\n\r\nMy TA, Sam, redefined what above and beyond means. She did so much to facilitate our learning the material and preparing for tests. The work was front-loadedthe hard part is learning what we're doing, and the easy part is practicing and learning how we're doing it.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the class are that lectures were entertaining, and the material is innately interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought making the homework a completion grade was a good move, because it allowed them to assign us more difficult problems to prepare us better for the exams. I like how the course also brought up interesting content in the philosophy of logic, instead of just dryly focusing on translations and derivations. Having that background made me more motivated to work hard on the translations and derivations. The only weakness of the class was the fact that it was heavily end-loaded in terms of exams. There was something like three exams, including the final, in the last four weeks. ",
            "\u00a0This course should be advertised as much harder than it is. Emphasizing the philosophy gives a false impression to the student as to what the course is. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Cool class, cool lecturer, cool beans, learned a lot about logic and will probably continue to take logic classes (267, 427, etc.)\r\nWeaknesses: SSS114 sucks for finals because there's always some weird noise going on. Also, at one point we went off syllabus, and so when I got sick I was kind of confused as to what exactly was going on in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting enough but the presentation of the material was often overly-formalized and made it more complicated than it needed to be. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because of its sections. My T.F. was wonderful at breaking down the concepts learned in class into bite sized pieces and I really felt solidified in the material only after section and office hours.\r\n\r\nThe classes were a little harder to understand, but Professor Winkler also made himself available to explain again after class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the Teaching Fellows / discussion sections were really good. We went over a lot of practice problems during discussion sections, which helped me better understand what I read in the textbook, my homework, and what would be tested on exams. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt that the lectures less useful than the discussion section. During lecture, the professor would at most go over 1 or 2 homework/exam problems. Most of the time was spent talking about ideas from other philosophers or other concepts that I didn't feel were very relevant to the course. The professor usually went on a tangent during lecture, and I personally was not interested in the additional concepts he was talking about. Other people in the class were interested, but I wasn't. ",
            "\u00a0Office hours were always very helpful for this course and the long homework assignments, while time consuming and frustrating at times, really helped give a complete understanding of the material. The last two units were not covered with as much depth as the first one, which made the last two units more difficult to understand. ",
            "\u00a0In my view, a great strength of the class is that it's not too hard and not too easy. Also, the sections are a strength because they gave us time to practice problems, especially derivations, in a more intimate setting.\r\n\r\nSome drawbacks are that it felt like we spent a ton of time preparing for the first exam, and then had very very little time to prepare for the second and third exam (and then glided over meta-theory in a way that didn't really feel fair for the third exam).\r\n\r\nAlso, I think some of the TFs had different understandings about how much they were expected to do to help their students prepare for each exam. I really liked my TF (who I've written about below), but I heard from classmates that some of the other TFs held extra review sessions (and even, in one case, alluded to what topics would be featured in the essay questions), which seemed kind of unfair. ",
            "\u00a0It was a thorough introduction to first-order logic for those without a background in the field. The course started slowly and then, by the end, flew through the last few units, which were significantly more complicated than the material covered in the first month. I would have appreciated starting a bit faster and giving more time to the concepts in the last half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that (1) every week's new lesson felt like an enhancement of things we had learned in previous weeks (this was really useful because it meant that, by the end, there was not a lot of material from the beginning that needed to be reviewed because we had been using it all along) (2) the homework schedule is well balanced: crowded enough that we constantly have to be engaging with the material but lenient enough that it accommodates for students' other commitments and well-being and (3) there is a clear attempt on the part of the professor and the TAs to help students understand the material.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses of the course were that (1) the class schedule was unorganized and it was difficult to figure out what the assignment of the day was at times (2) information crucial to the final was left out the last \"real\" week of classes and only covered during a make-up class/review sessions during reading period, and (3) the three exams of the class seemed unevenly spread, with less time and a lot more pressure on the second and third exams. ",
            "\u00a0I like the general outline of the course, with the move from SL to PL and so forth. The problems sets and textbook were both very helpful as well. \r\nThe main weakness in the course was, in my opinion, the lack of preparation for the first two exams, namely the time constraints. We would spend the whole class period or section time working through one or two problems, without really preparing for an exam where we would have to work three derivations, a truth table, true or false, and an essay in the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Winkler is great, really engaged, and teaches the material well\r\n\r\nHonestly no weaknesses  the course does what it does well. ",
            "\u00a0I thought derivations were by far the most interesting and challenging part of the course, and some of the focus on definitions was less compelling. As we spent more new concepts, we were assigned less challenging derivations to help us get used to the new concepts, which made the course slightly less intellectually engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material. I was struggling to keep up towards the end. A lot of concepts weren't explained thoroughly. The concepts that were explained thoroughly were explained really well and I was able to grasp them. If the class went over less material so that everything could be explained just as thoroughly, I think the course would be great. ",
            "\u00a0Winkler is clearly a lovely, smart man, but his lectures are so rambly.  Maybe I'm biased because I was in this class for the QR credit, but I just could not have cared less about the long tangents we went on.  He also made a ton of mistakes, which made it sometimes hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0The foremost strength of this course is Professor Winkler. His lectures were not only conveyed information but injected life and energy into a subject that could easily be caricatured as dull. His anecdotes about philosophers were some of my favorite moments in the course. I also thought that the amount of practice problems that Professor Winkler posted were useful in preparing for the exams.\r\n\r\nThe one weakness of the course that I would mention would be the number of exams. Given that only two classes separated it from the second exam, the third one seemed rushed and not as necessary as the first two. I think that the material on the third exam could have been incorporated into the final, thereby preserving a better 'balance' of coursework throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is intuitive as one progresses and the canvas file updates are excellent. However, grades were never posted on canvas. ",
            "\u00a0this term, with professor winkler, the class grading was very harsh as compared to last year's with professor miller. for professor miller's class, it was possible to get a 40% on the final and an A on the exam. For professor winkler's class, there is no curve. ",

But it seems that the book shouldn't be required -- we hardly used it by the end, and it often only complicated concepts. Also, especially near the beginning of the course, key tips needed for deriving were not introduced until much later in lecture, so several of the early p-sets required many hours of speculative guessing, although that might have been a good thing in the end. It's also good that more time is given for the first two tests, but perhaps practice timed exams should be given before the first two to prepare for quick deriving. The metatheory introduced on the last day could have also been introduced two lectures before, with additional lectures on other types of logic following. ",

There was a ton of pretty non-engaging textbook reading that sometimes diverged from the content of the lectures, and 2 psets almost every week. They allowed you to skip up to three psets and still get full credit, but these were still incredibly intense for someone who is naturally bad at, or doesn't get good help with the subject. Some people breezed through the psets in under an hour, while I grappled with most of them for 7 hours. I felt the workload was a bit too high. Your mileage may vary depending on natural aptitude, professor, and TFs. ",

The tests, while not too particularly difficult, were rather difficult under their given time constraints. While one may have felt that they had gained mastery over the materials through problem sets, this mastery would not necessarily shine through on the tests which could be lengthy given the trickiness of problems.

Out of all my friends, I was the only one who remained in the course until the end of the semester.

It is also only tenuously linked, in the course, to actual use to evaluate arguments. Also, mistakes were constantly being made during lecture and on the assignments, which made it difficult to know what was accurate, undermined the amount of confidence one can have in the leadership, and which was also frustrating because it should not be on students in an intro level class to catch the mistakes of their professor. This was very disappointing, because it seems like the subject matter would actually be interesting and highly useful if presented in a more coherent, direct, and intentional manner. If you need to take it for the philosophy major and aren't married to the idea of being a philosophy major, maybe choose a different major to avoid this class. ",

I feel like the things we learned have no real-life relevance. In life, I will never translate English into symbols to see if an argument is valid. I guess I did learn how to think logically because we often had to derive a conclusion from a set of premises using the rules of the logic language. However, besides that, I did not see the point of learning the different topics. I was not interested in what the professor had to say about other philosophers or the meaning behind different rules. I learned a lot after a semester, but I don't see how this knowledge is useful/applicable. I don't feel like I gained a lot from this course. But that's just my opinion. ",

Lectures are alright (and can be funny/entertaining, always a plus), though, as with any QR class, I think you mostly learn through application. There is homework due almost every class, but it usually doesn't take long/can definitely be done the night before and you have a few free skips for those really busy weeks. \r\n\r\nExamples chosen for homework and tests can be very abstract, which adds a layer of difficulty. Generally, though, things are understandable. Make sure when you're doing the homework or reviewing, you pay attention to sentence or problem types (i.e. \"When I see this symbol or word, I should translate it as that\" or \"When I see this in the statement I'm supposed to derive, I should start by assuming that\").

Don't be deceived by the lack of numbers, exponents, integrals, etc.  the course requires a good deal of mathematical intuition and can prove (pun intended) quite difficult if that's not something that comes naturally to you. If it does, the class will be a breeze. So don't take the class because you think you'll be mindlessly plugging values into a bunch of equations.

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to other students. First Order Logic is one of those classes you didnt know you need until you take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend PHIL 115 to any student. It is fun and interesting for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Winkler is one of Yale's more engaging lecturers, and he does a wonderful job explaining the material thoroughly. If you are able to grasp the basic concepts of the course, i.e. translations and derivations, in the first few weeks you shouldn't have much trouble and will probably be fine forgoing the readings and just listening to the lectures. That said, the difficulty of this class seemed to vary greatly from student to student. Professor Winkler does a great job focusing-on/re-explaining concepts that people had trouble with, helping students who are struggling (he strayed from the syllabus a bit in our class to provide greater weight on later exams for those who did poorly early on), and providing innumerable materials to deepen understanding, but ultimately logic just seems to really click more for some people than for others. Be prepared for the material and midterms to get harder throughout the course (but not unmanageably so). This is a must take for potential philosophy majors and anyone interested in developing a detailed understanding of argumentation structure. Also, if you are thinking about taking this course, try to take it with Professor Winkler, he is everything. ",
            "\u00a0I took this as my QR, and for me it was quite difficult. The professor and the TFs were friendly, but I struggled intellectually with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was an interesting introduction to a certain part of philosohpy ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as it helps with many analytical skills that are useful in both the sciences and the humanities. Moreover, it is a challenging quantitative reasoning course, but not a particularly daunting one; it is truly an introductory course to which a student of any academic discipline can comfortably fit. ",
            "\u00a0I took the class thinking that by formally studying logic I would improve my reasoning and thinking, but that was not the case because formal logic is far removed from rhetorical logic. Otherwise, its a good class. "
