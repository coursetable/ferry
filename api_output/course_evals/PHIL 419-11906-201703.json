            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Descartes' system of thought, and about the surprisingly large field of Descartes interpretation. Along the way of becoming more familiar with Descartes' work, I found myself learning a good deal about his scholastic predecessors and also about how to apply the principle of intellectual charity to the examination of the history of philosophy. "

            "\u00a0There was a good selection of secondary sources for this course, which were thought provoking and often in fruitful dialogue with one another. Discussion was particularly lively, and there was certainly a good amount of back and forth among students. Professor Della Rocca did a good job in doing blackboard explanations of important concepts to make sure that everyone got on the same page. I had a little bit of trouble knowing what to expect for classes earlier in the course, because we wouldn't always talk about all of the readings (in part because we got somewhat behind at the beginning of the term). There was something of an attempt to get students to prepare to lead a discussion, and unfortunately only one student accepted that offer, perhaps some sort of incentive might have helped? I think it would have helped the course significantly to add a few more of those. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The seminar is very well-structured, and Prof. Della Rocca is a great moderator and teacher. His understanding of Descartes and rationalism has ramifications well beyond the history of philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating class for someone interested in delving into a particular author at some length. The discussions were conducted a high level, the papers are challenging (but manageable of course) to write, and the diversity of perspectives in the papers assigned was impressive. However, one has to be able to keep a good perspective on what they are doing. It is a rather strange experience to go through this course and all this argument about an author that no one in the class really thinks was right. It didn't suck all of the passion out of the course (indeed I at least felt very strongly about certain points), but it just means that there is a kind of abstract interest and reflection that one needs to cultivate to really stay interested.
