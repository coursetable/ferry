            "\u00a0Math 112 taught me almost all of high school calculus and more within the given three months.  It was a very difficult course but it is definitely important to have taken a calculus class here at Yale. ",

            "\u00a0Good base in calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper unferstanding of the basic fundamentals of calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to solve problems mathematically and better understood key calculus principles. ",

            "\u00a0This course reinforced a lot of the calculus work I had already done in high school while giving me a greater fundamental understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt about the philosophy of Calculus. Coming from high school where maths was just fact, it was interesting to see where the differentiation equations came from and the power of estimation. I had never done limits before but I had covered the other material in high school. Because it was the first section covered, this made the first midterm the most challenging for me. I also never thought it was possible to do maths without a calculator but this course has shown me the power behind factoring and the meaningful applications of other mathematical computations. I am always interested to know where things come from so I really enjoyed that aspect of the course. Thank you Maths 112. ",

The sequence of lessons was logical and easy to follow. I personally found the teaching style of my TA to be relatively disorganized, which was something I struggled with, however, the overall content of the course was very manageable and approachable, as was the workload. ",
