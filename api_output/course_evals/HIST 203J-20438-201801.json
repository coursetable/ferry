            "\u00a0We had some great field trips, especially the one to York which enhanced our learning experience. Reading primary sources like the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and Beowulf was interesting and helpful. Most of us didn't come into this course with a lot of knowledge about this time period/these people so more lecture/instruction on the subject would have been helpful before diving into our own discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Exciting topic, given the hype from the TV series Vikings. The course is very illuminating about the culture and long-lasting effects of the Viking age in England. The course also helps hone critical thinking and strong analysis of primary sources. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The structure of the course is quite messy. "
