            "\u00a0Thinking critically while on a trip, digging deep into Wyoming issues, managing group dynamics, public speaking, reflection ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep appreciation for the human and social dynamic in environmental and conservation work. I also gained a significant depth of knowledge about western land management issues. ",
            "\u00a0This class was wonderful! One of the best ways to learn is by getting out in the field and talking with folks, and this class was a great way to do that. ",
            "\u00a0I learned invaluable field analysis skills related to the human dimensions of the environment. I also gained deep insight into the state of Wyoming and began to understand the conversation around our national parks. Justin taught me a great deal about a region of the world I had never visited. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good opportunity to consider how different communities and participants influence environmental policy. ",
            "\u00a0Really fantastic itinerary on this course - gained a deep understanding of the political, social and cultural factors at play in shaping the west into the landscape it is today. Being able to meet with elders on the Wind River reservation and then transition into a day-long meeting with students at BYU Idaho allowed the class to grapple with and question how these different communities use and exist in a landscape often defined by conflict. ",
            "\u00a0Gained experience on the ground working with and speaking to community members living in Wyoming who gave insights into the greater issues effecting the North American Western regions. Engaged with a  variety of topics and disciplines from history to wildlife ecology and political science to sociology. Gain experience speaking with diverse groups of stakeholders and communities, and engaged with the Wyoming landscape in a way that few other experiences ever could. Also gained insight into the interworking of the political apparatuses and social implications that are tied to the conservation land in Western Wyoming. ",
            "\u00a0Experiential field-based learning and immersion with the support of peers and a professor. There is no other course at FES that is structured around such variety -- in stakeholders and landscapes -- and I was appreciative of navigating this experience with a class, rather via independently. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes I feel that as people age, we require stronger stimuli in order to expand our way of seeing the world. This course pushed us to think more critically about conservation, race, and energy through our field experiences.\r\n\r\nIn this experience, I observed myself and my peers struggle with some of the most difficult questions we will face as practitioners, researchers, and people.  I've also been able to observe how we have engaged differently with the FES community after returning. In a small way, through the 14 participants, the class has made small ripples through our school as a whole. Wyoming changed us in ways that could not have happened at Kroon, Sage, or Marsh Hall. ",
            "\u00a0Because the bulk of this course took place out of the classroom, it allowed me to develop skills like critical listening more effectively. The field course consisted of many meetings with different groups around Wyoming, ranging from government officials to natural gas workers to tribal leaders. The diversity of the people that we met challenged me to listen to what they had to say more carefully, and critically think about how their knowledge and experiences enhanced what I learned in the classroom at FES. You can learn a lot in the classroom, but there really is no replacement for going out and talking in person with the people about whom you are learning. \r\n\r\nAs environmental managers and foresters, I really think it's important to have those hands on, personal courses where we interact with the people we are learning about and going to work with after graduation. Environmental issues are also social issues - it's not just about science. In Justin's course we were really able to make those connections between social, environmental, and political issues by being out in the field. "

            "\u00a0It certainly exceeded my expectations and I feel that this knowledge is much more important than I perceived it to be prior to taking the course. ",
            "\u00a0I was blown away by the complex issues we considered during the field portion of the course. I did not expect the conversations to be so meaningful and divisive. ",
            "\u00a0This class far exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0The trip was as expected and provided plenty of good learning opportunities with different communities in Wyoming and Idaho. Some of the field experience were incredibly meaningful and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Above and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0Perfectly aligned with expectations. ",
            "\u00a0This class exceeded my expectations exponentially. I did not realize the extent of the differences in the American West. This class was structured around understanding the social and political landscape of conservation and entailed us meeting with different stakeholders daily. The reality of that felt like drinking from a \"firehouse\"--confronted with just how different the West is from the Northeast in cultural norms, politics and ecosystems, but also how complex and contentious environmental issues are in the United States. This is a perspective that was much needed in my education and will certainly fuel my work to come. ",
            "\u00a0I came to the class hoping that it would deliver on the academic commitments in its syllabus in the way that most courses seek to do. The course went beyond my academic expectations and, additionally, offered interpersonal and spiritual growth unlike anything else I have come across at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Very well! I'd taken Justin's North American West Case Study course in the fall, so I knew that his work focuses on the intersection between political, social, cultural, and environmental issues. I also expected to learn a lot from being out in the field, talking to people as opposed to reading about them in a book or article for homework. I knew I was going to learn, and that I was going to be challenged to think differently and examine my own perceptions and stereotypes, and I was. The course definitely met and exceeded my expectations in terms of what I learned. Not only did I gain more knowledge, but I was also emotionally moved by a lot of the people we met and experiences we had while out on the course. "

            "\u00a0The build up of the course worked well with all of the readings that we have to prepare us for the trip. I think the course could benefit from a longer before-trip preparation element. We all knew we were stepping into some emotional and intense situations, but we were not prepared enough for it. \r\n\r\nIn terms of the trip itself, there were some problematic moments. The group dynamics in our cohort were tense. The group that split apart from the rest of the group I think should not have been allowed to go because it created an awkward and tense rest of the trip. I know we are all adults and should be able to explore our interests but when you sign up for a trip, you sign up for a specific itinerary that the TA and professor spent valuable time putting together. The option of splitting away from the itinerary and the fact that people actually did that affected my own experience while on the trip. Additionally, there was a massive blow-up when the students returned, in many ways because they had such a difficult experience logistically when they did split up, which caused massive stress and animosity within the group. This should have been a point of intervention on the professor's end. The fact that everything was dealt with by just the students made everything much worse. There should have been way more facilitation and input on the professor's end. Many students were left feeling extremely stressed and uncomfortable during that time which affected a lot of people's experiences. Additionally, there should have been more emphasis on creating space for group reflection after meetings so that people could air out how they were feeling. The fact that this wasn't incorporated into the course is what caused so much anxiety to build up in the first place.  Additionally, nothing was ever really aired out once we got back so there was lingering tension between many people in the group. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the teaching faculty and the field-based, hands-on learning experience it provided. The weakness of this course is that it is somewhat intellectually and emotionally draining. ",
            "\u00a0I would prefer to have met a few more times prior to the field portion to get to know each other as a group and establish some group trip norms. ",
            "\u00a0The course would be better served by a hotel for the time in a jackson. The two rental condos caused logistical and interpersonal problems. Other than that this course didn't have any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The trip was well-planned and provided a diversity of perspectives on environmental policy. At points the fast-paced and busy schedule of the trip seemed to wear on students and made some of the group interactions difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was well organized and helpful. I think that a bit more information about the trip, our hosts and planned excursions would be helpful in preparing for the trip. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely strong class, one of the best I've taken at FES. The strength of the course was of course the field component--  I was particularly engaged by our time at the Wind River reservation and believe it provided a space to engage Indigenous issues rarely given space at the School of Forestry. Only suggestion I might have is some more time to digest and discuss our experiences amongst each other while on the trip, but of course this is difficult given the limited time we understandably have in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- incredibly dynamic itinerary (we got to meet with politicians, activists, biologists, educators, religious leaders, philanthropists and doing so consecutively and in a short time span provided some really interesting insights) \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- minimal focus/time spent on interpersonal dynamics which were essential for processing and cultivating a safe learning environment ",
            "\u00a0This course is  the best I have taken at FES and there are no glaring weaknesses. For small improvements, I think there could be one or two fewer students, there could be fewer visits to different sites and more time individual and group reflection, and perhaps students should spend an additional day or so on the Reservation.  Please continue to support this course and explore ways of bringing some of its strengths to other classes here. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think field courses are always really valuable. In this Wyoming field course, we had a chance to interact with folks that we don't normally get to at Yale, and I think that was really valuable for challenging our assumptions and perceptions. As someone who is interested in Western issues and moving out West after graduation, I was also glad to learn first-hand about how environmental issues are perceived in the region. Another strength of the course is the readings - Justin is really good at selecting engaging, illuminating readings. In addition, we got to read excerpts from his own forthcoming book, which is fascinating. \r\n\r\nAlso, Katie - our superhero TA! She got us all organized each morning, was there for all of us whenever we needed her, and took care of me when I got sick partway during the trip. \r\n\r\nAlso, though our group had some issues (see below) we also learned a lot from each other, and I think it's really special to share an experience like this with a group.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: As with any group field trip, group dynamics can be hard. Our trip was jam-packed with activity, especially in the front end of the trip. We learned a lot of new things, and many of our experiences were emotional and challenging in ways that we didn't expect. I think the trip would have benefited from some time built in where we could have debriefed the day as a group - what we learned, how we were feeling, what was surprising, etc. There was so much to take in, but because we jumped from activity to activity, we didn't get much chance to talk about what we learned as a class (besides in the car rides between meetings) \r\n\r\nWe also had some tough group dynamic breakdowns resulting from tension and miscommunication. While it was nobody's individual fault, it really took away from some of the things we learned and my particular enjoyment of the trip. I don't think we should have allowed the group to spilt up partway through the trip. While we are all adult graduate students, there were moments during the trip I think we could have benefited more from Justin's leadership, as the professor and organizer of the trip, to diffuse tensions and set group norms. Justin is so relaxed, which generally is great! But there were definitely moments we needed a firm leader to take control and bring the group back together. "

            "\u00a0You should absolutely take this course as it was probably the best learning experience and environment imaginable for this topic area. Additionally, any class taught by Justin Farrell is worth taking! ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to work very hard during spring break - this is when the bulk of the course occurs. ",
            "\u00a0It is an incredible experience! Take it seriously! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great experience to see the various participants and stakeholders of an important and relevant landscape and a great opportunity to get out in the field applying topics learned at FES. ",
            "\u00a0Rest before the trip. It's a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Take full advantage of the incredible spaces for discussion and active learning that Justin has worked to create on this trip. Unlike many other FES course which remain bogged with route theory and memorization this course engages students on the ground and those who are willing to take full advantage of that opportunity stand to not only learn more that they would i other settings but also develop relationships with people on the ground that can be invaluable latter. I remain in contact with Lynette GreyBull from the Wind River reservation and am hoping to return and do collaborative work with her and the Northern Arapaho in the near future. ",
            "\u00a0With whom you take this course is just as important, if not more so, than what this course entails. The realities we were confronted with demanded group processing that is not built into the class or particularly facilitated by the instructors. I would urge a student considering this class to consider how vulnerable they are willing to feel around those who have also signed up to take the course. This class catches you off guard. The itinerary is packed, you will be interacting with very different people and places and it demands a level of presence and honesty in order to be at all worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Read Justin's books, they give context to some of what you'll experience. Be attentive to group dynamic and bring all the empathy you can. ",
            "\u00a0This course is one of the best I've taken at FES! Aside from the problems that our particular class encountered as a group, this course is fantastic. Justin did a terrific job of putting together a group of diverse students - including racial and gender diversity, first/second years, people who'd been to the West and people who hadn't, etc. One of the highlights of the course was not only learning from the people that we met, but each other as well. Each student brought a unique perspective to the group and to the issues we were learning about, and I really appreciated how thoughtfully Justin put our group together. We got to experience such a wide range of people and activities during the course - from climbing a natural gas rig to snowshoeing in Grand Teton National Park to staying on the Wind River Indian Reservation. \r\n\r\nMy main recommendation is definitely take the course! You will learn so much, be challenged, and have the opportunity to do things that you may never get the chance to do. For instance, we got to meet a group of Northern Arapaho tribal elders, who generously invited us into their home and put up with our questions. This course allowed us to have those kinds of unique experiences in spades. You'll learn from your classmates and Justin as well.\r\n\r\nJust a word of caution - this course is exhausting: mentally, emotionally, intellectually, and even physically (our car got stuck in the snow for about 2 hours and we had to dig it out!) Just be prepared for that and take care of yourself. "
