            "\u00a0This is a very niche class with a specific ROTC rubric, so strengths are clarity of instruction and relevance for future Air Force work, but the weakness is that we have to cover a lot of required material that at times doesn't seem useful. ",
            "\u00a0Appreciated relating class discussions to real-life situations. Diverging from curriculum script when class engaged in productive conversation about leadership issues was much more impactful that sticking to the slides. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that I learned a lot during lecture that was easily applicable to other leadership roles. However, I felt that a lot of the time, when we divided into groups to fill out worksheets, it was busy work from which I didn't learn much other than how to quickly search google. I felt that the point of that was to learn how to work together and delegate the work, which did occur, but I did not retain much from these activities. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is a built-in reliance on anecdotes from combat, live leadership crises (cadre & cadet), and current strategic debates to augment the drudgery of the prescribed nationwide curricula (all of which Col McCarthy took great care to build into the course, from daily current-challenge briefings to bias papers) . The weakness of the course is its occasional failure to do so, leaving 40 quite sharp cadets to the insult of memorizing 'the 7 types of critical thinking'  a self-apparent joke in irony. ",
