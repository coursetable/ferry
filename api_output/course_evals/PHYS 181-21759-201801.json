But on top of that, most concepts covered in PHYS 181 were more abstract because we were dealing with electrons and particles, as well as fields that cannot be observed directly.

Her demonstrations were eye-opening.\r\nThe class notes are stellar.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of a single thing I disliked about the class. It was remarkable. ",
            "\u00a0The class is interesting and Steinacker does a good job explaining concepts. The homework is long but satisfying to actually complete in its entirety. The main drawback of the class is strangely how much Steinacker wants everyone to do well. That alone is obviously a good quality, but she curves the exams so strongly that people have no incentive to actually do the PSETs, and don't. The PSETs are graded slowly and comments are often completely useless (e.g. Question 2: -5), so it's hard to tell what you did wrong. ",
            "\u00a0This class has no weaknesses. Although it could be difficult to understand the material at times, professor Steineker is an amazing professor that makes learning Physics worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are quite tedious and long, but the test questions are typically well written. ",
            "\u00a0The PSETs are ridiculously time consuming and the resources available to assist are clearly insufficient. There is a huge disconnect between the material taught in class (its very simplistic) and the PSETs and exams (very involved and complex). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are that the class is planned very well so that no topic is rushed and that there are always office hours and peer tutors to assist you.  The weakness is that it covers a lot of material, which can be difficult for someone who has never been exposed to it before. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are really straight-forward and easy to follow, and they are conducted at the ideal speed. Prof. Steinacker really is the greatest strength of this course; its always very evident that she cares deeply about her students and about physics. Back in high school, I took AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism and understood maybe one quarter of the material. This time around, not only did I understand all the material, but I also became very interested in the subject. However, the problem sets were way too much sometimes. After the first midterm, we often had to complete ten problems a week, which was stressful. I do recognize the importance of the problem sets in learning the material, but I also think perhaps the difficulty of some problems can be adjusted. ",
            "\u00a0You're only taking 181 because you have to, but it could definitely be worse. Steinacker is super nice and a good lecturer -- she really cares, and really goes the extra mile to make sure everyone understands everything she's deriving on the board during every class. Main weakness is the workload -- problem sets regularly take 10+ hours/week if you don't know people to share answers with. Not super fun. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly problem sets with 10 problems on average were pretty killer. Maybe lighten the load a little? I'm sure students would appreciate it. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of instruction from Professor Steinacker and the peer tutors was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Frankly I think this class does exactly what it should.  The syllabus is of the correct length, and the lectures are interesting.  There isn't much to say. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses at all. It is difficult, but the course is incredible and the teachers and support system is incredible. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength is it's high expectations of its students. I was able to engage with the material because professor Steinacker never doubted my or the other students' abilities. The course is also well organized and rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course w Steinacker!!! Take this course if you plan on taking physics -- it's harder than mechanics, but def take w Steinacker!!! She's such a gem ",
            "\u00a0The PSETS are way too long and difficult for someone who has never seen magnetism in their life. This course very much advantaged people who had the opportunity to take AP physics classes in high school that mine simply didn't offer. Shorter PSETS that resemble test questions a bit more would better facilitate learning. That being said, I love Steinacker so much. She is so enthusiastic about Physics and is definitely the reason I wasn't miserable in this class. She does a great job of explaining topics, is SO organized, and really goes into helpful detail. She also dedicates so much time to help students in office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structure the best way it could possibly be for an intro physics class. The professor got rid of every unnecessary procedures that were irrelevant to teaching, and she has done her  best to make the class seem small through interactions with the students. ",
            "\u00a0Yale needs a truly introductory Physics class. This is not it. ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely fast-paced for someone with only an intermediate level of calculus. Although the requirement is MATH 115, you require at least MATH 120 to properly understand the rudiments of the course. The problems assigned on this course also sometimes use random mathematical expressions that would not have eventually figured out unless they seek help from the professor herself. \r\n\r\nHowever, the course is really good at developing one's problem-solving skills and great at improving one's confidence when it comes to quantitative reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths this course is that the subject material was very interesting and, of course, professor Steinacker is amazing in every way. The only downside of the course is that the problem sets toward the end of the semester started becoming incredibly taxing to finish on time. I understand professor Steinacker's intentions with them, but they were very tiring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Steinacker is an amazing lecturer and definitely cares about her students. The course will give you a very solid foundation of the material. If you keep up with the psets, you will have a great base for higher level physics courses. \r\nWeaknesses: This course takes over your life!! I worked on the pset almost every single day and definitely had to go to office hours. If you have a tight schedule or classes that overlap with office hours, it will be very difficult to do well in my opinion. You really have to plan the semester around it. ",
            "\u00a0More demonstrations in lecture! They are fun and helpful for learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course is pretty good for a large, introductory science course, and much better than many other intro science lectures at Yale. Lectures themselves are kind of hard to follow and not particularly interesting but the lecture notes posted online are the best thing; and the frequent office hours/peer tutor study halls throughout the week are a really great and helpful setup as well. ",
            "\u00a0Going over more examples in the lecture would be helpful because even though we learn the concepts applying them individually is really hard and I think we should have worksheets if possible to work on more problems in class as participation instead of one problem in which we discuss for a few seconds ",
            "\u00a0This is an exemplary course. Demanding but highly rewarding and very well-taught. Adriane Steinacker is a phenomenal professor who puts every ounce of herself into this course and her students. I only have the most positive things to say about the physics 180-181 sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Good course. Prof. Steinacker does a good job enforcing the concepts and provides an astounding number of resources to help you do well. If she's teaching it I'd recommend over the 171 course. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are unnecessarily long and take far too much time to actually be productive. It would be far more productive if problem sets were of a more reasonable length and difficulty so that students actually had time to study the content and understand it. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very supportive of student learning. The professor, the TAs, and the peer tutors were all super dedicated to helping us learn and gave countless hours to helping students with problem sets etc. I think the structure of the class lessons could be confusing and not as engaging as I would have liked. I think that there should be separate physics classes for engineering and premed students because this class was pretty challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course all around. ",
            "\u00a0Very few weaknesses. One is that sometimes points are taken on exams for things that aren't necessary to solve the problem(I.e. Labeling a diagram).\r\nStrengths are numerous. Lecture notes are posted so you can refer to them outside of class (especially when doing homework). Professor Steinacker is amazing, her passion shines through her work and her teaching and she is always very well prepared for class. If you want to take physics, you'll be in good hands with her. ",
            "\u00a0Hard course, but required ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the course would benefit from having more study sessions available, which would be more conducive to a greater amount of schedules. ",
            "\u00a0Fast paced lectures and challenging tests, but Professor Steinacker really looks out for all students. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures can be a little dry sometimes just because every piece of material is not as exciting for everyone. However, Professor Steinacker is very engaging and provides every opportunity for you to learn and master the material. ",

Professor Steinacker is amazing and she loves to interact with the students. Even though the problem sets are difficult, there is a lot of help--office hours, peer tutors, and study hall. Lectures are very organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing. The lectures are very thorough and all the formulas and concepts follow eachother in a very natural progression. My only complaint was that the problem sets took a very long time, and I think i could have still understood all the major concepts without having do all 10 problems on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0Great resources for when you're struggling (office hours and study hall almost every day) and Professor Steinacker really works hard to help her students succeed. Lectures can be fast and psets are time consuming but fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker is definitely one of the strengths of the course. Her engagement and interaction with the students is outstanding and got appreciated by all students who took the class. Although the psets are challenging and time-consuming, they were beneficial to review and understand the course material. Moreover, long office hours and additional peer tutor hours made it possible to finish them in time. ",
            "\u00a0Adriane is one of the best and most passionate physics professors out there. However, the concepts are hard! Make use of her various resources and you won't get behind. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Steinacker - she's kind, caring, generous, witty, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Her lecture notes are great, so the textbook is practically irrelevant, and the course follows PHYS 180 well. The official study sessions and especially the pre-exam review sessions were helpful. Homework wasn't assigned for exam weeks.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some students already know the material. The lecture notes are long. There was always a lot of homework, but it got worse after the first midterm when the practice problems unexpectedly became mandatory, effectively doubling the amount of required work each week. Furthermore, the problems are challenging, so I think every mandatory problem should be graded for credit instead of grading a random subset of problems. Feedback is minimal and slow. ",
            "\u00a0Improvement by discussing what we are solving for before we begin he problem. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly well-taught and interesting, but it's also really difficult and pretty time-intensive. Although I know that the problems on the psets are intentionally difficult to force us to engage with the material from class, I do think that the amount of time those psets required was unreasonable, and that I could have spent more time making sure I understood each problem if there had been fewer problems and more time to do them. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like it sometimes took me a while to grasp the concepts, like I wouldn't always get them right away at lectures but would understand them better once I did the PSETs ",
            "\u00a0Adrianne Steinacker is fantastic an pushes you to your limits.  Absolutely amazing lecture course that felt like a small seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course, and the class is taught well, but the psets are hard and the content is difficult. However, the TAs and the instructor do a great job of offering a wide range of office hours and study halls to work on the psets. ",
            "\u00a0On the whole, I found the entire intro physics sequence (180 and 181) to be impressively comprehensive. I would have liked it if we had spent a bit more time on introductory circuits. Finally, I would have appreciated one more lecture on the Maxwell equations (just out of curiosity) ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the lecture material does not align with expectations for homework, but Prof. Steinacker's office hours and continuous support helps us then. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Steinacker did a great job demonstrating how we got the formulas we use, and her psets complemented lectures nicely, allowing us to apply the concepts we learned. Lectures got boring from time to time, but that's the nature of learning formulas. Luckily, Steinacker liked to spice lecture up with demonstrations and videos. Additionally, the psets could be pretty long and sometimes difficult, but they really reinforced the ideas from lecture, so they were worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of resources that are available to students like office hours, peer tutors, study halls, and one-on-one meetings with Adriane.   In this respect, there are a lot of paths to turn to when you are struggling.  However, this course is very difficult, and some people just do not have enough time to get through all of the work in the most meaningful way.  Extremely hard and long problem sets make us prone to rushing through without necessarily understanding, which hurts us when we get to the exams. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of course material, this class provides a great introduction to physics. In terms of course mechanics, I liked the grading system, with a big emphasis on homework and test corrections on the midterms. However, most importantly, I felt that midterms were graded very inconsistently, with similar work netting very different points. Also, I didn't like that one small mistake could lead to points being lost in multiple places -- for example, incorrect copying from one step to the next perhaps would lose one for the mistake, certainly would lose one for the incorrect answer, and certainly would also lose one for using the same (incorrect) expression in the next part of the question. Losing at least two points out of 50 for a very simple, careless mistake is very frustrating. In addition, I felt that oftentimes the homework assignments were manageable conceptually, and that the physics was, with effort, definitely understandable, yet the problem took 30 minutes or an hour to solve because the algebra or the numbers were very difficult, which was frustrating given that the problem sets were already long. In addition, I have two more logistical suggestions. First, since Professor Steinacker explicitly states that multivariate calculus is not required for the class, it would be great for the class listing to be updated to reflect that. Second, office hours for peer tutors often changed throughout the semester and were different from what was listed online (understandably -- peer tutors are students with busy lives). Sometimes peer tutors made permanent changes to their tutoring schedule, and sometimes they would have a conflict that necessitated rescheduling one session. Some tutors would let you know via email. However, several times I would show up to a peer tutor based on the schedule posted online, and he or she would not be there. What might work really well is to have a Google spreadsheet with the schedule of the peer tutors, Professor Steinacker's office hours, and study halls, keeping the schedule for all the support available for PHYS 180/181 in one place. Ideally, each week would have its own page within the spreadsheet. Everyone in the class would have view privileges. Peer tutors and TAs would have edit privileges, and could edit the time/location of their tutoring both on a week to week basis (e.g. a midterm during study hall) or on a permanent basis (change in the peer tutor's schedule for the semester). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - extraordinarily well-taught, lots of support, regular problem sets reinforce understanding, generous grading policies\r\nWeaknesses/improvements - information can appear overwhelming, and/or some homework problems may be frustrating as approaches for how to solve them are not apparent from material covered in lecture.

            "\u00a0No. Prof. Steinacker, when you're reading this: Doing the same integration over a path, but with different letters does nothing for student understanding. Taking revenge against your students after they missed \"easy\" exam questions is unacceptable. Generally, in a scientific field, copying ideas or somebody else's work is frowned upon. As a student, if I borrow ideas (especially verbatim) I am expected to cite them, otherwise I get excommed. I just wish that you would use the same standard to this class. The problems, which are almost always challenge problems from other textbooks, never have their autorship clearly identified. The TAs close an eye on cheating, which happens to an alarming frequency on the exams. It's a bearable class, but the introductory physics courses here are terrible. \r\n\r\nAs a footnote, Steinacker is actually very dedicated. She spends a lot of time in office hour and cares. She is a genuinely good person. But she totally needs to overhaul the class. ",

            "\u00a0The class is interesting and Steinacker does a good job explaining concepts. The homework is long but satisfying to actually complete in its entirety. The main drawback of the class is strangely how much Steinacker wants everyone to do well. That alone is obviously a good quality, but she curves the exams so strongly that people have no incentive to actually do the PSETs, and don't. The PSETs are graded slowly and comments are often completely useless (e.g. Question 2: -5), so it's hard to tell what you did wrong. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a strong interest in physics this class really gives you a great foundation. It can be a lot of work but none of it is too frustrating, given that you put in the time understanding the content and/or going to office hours. ",

            "\u00a0YES! Everyone that needs to take physics should take it with Professor Steinacker. The material is very interesting once you get a grasp of the quantitative parts of it and can actually understand the real life application of the different topics learned. Professor Steinacker (and her team of peer tutors) make the course very enjoyable and provide a lot of support to learn in the class! You will not regret take physics 181 with Professor Steinacker. ",
            "\u00a0No. The assignments were much too tedious given the material and generally didnt help advance knowledge of physics. The final exam wasnt so much a cumulative test of all the topics we covered hroughojt the year as it was a third midterm on topics covered in the last week of lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would because I felt that it covered all of the basic physics topics necessary for any STEM-related field. ",
            "\u00a0Back in high school, I took AP Physics C E&M and hated it (and I only understood maybe one quarter of the material). But after taking PHYS 181, I have a pretty firm grasp on the material and also became very interested in the subject. So, in a way, PHYS 181 taught me how to love Physics. With that said, the problem sets require so much workeven more than PHYS 180. But if you truly put a lot of work in PHYS 180, you should be able to handle the problem sets in PHYS 181. Only take this if you are ready for the work. You might be spending 10-15 hours during some weeks. If you do take it and put work into it, you will be rewarded. (Definitely do not take more than 5 credits when taking PHYS 181! I took 5 credits this semester and had absolutely no time) ",
            "\u00a0Again, you're probably only taking 181 because you have to, but you could definitely do worse in terms of required classes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. While we did not cover as much material as Physics 201, I would recommend 181 over 201 to any student, regardless of their physics background, because Professor Steinacker is so wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0This class fulfills a requirement.  The best part is Prof. Steinacker because she so obviously cares about the material and her students, but besides that, the class is perfectly adequate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it covers a lot of topics and you learn a lot, but you have to be willing to put in a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Without a doubt. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Steinacker is incredible. Yes it is a lot of work, but the class is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY ",
            "\u00a0Adriane Steinacker is the best teacher Ive had at this school. If youre debating between 181 and any other physics course, know that with Steinacker you will receive every bit of support that you need. Her lectures are clear, her passion is high, her office hours are poppin, and her psets will stretch you in a good way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if professor Steinacker is teaching the course. She is a true educator. ",
            "\u00a0Take this only if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0I would, if you understand the math for it and the phenomena it covers, you learn to appreciate physics more. ",
            "\u00a0Tests seemed overall pretty easy throughout the year. Psets are better with friends. ",
            "\u00a0Most students have to take this course. However, students should take this course for professor Steinacker alone. She is single-handedly the best professor I have had at Yale without a doubt, and she continually amazes me. This course is much more challenging than 180, but it is much more cohesive and comprehensive than 180, and, in my opinion, the superior course. You will have to invest more time into understand the conceptual basis of what you are doing for this course compared with 180, but it is worth it. The problem sets are even more important this semester than they are last semester, and I suggest that you find a group of people to consistently do the problem sets with rather than just getting the answers from someone else and rushing through the problem set. The final covers a lot of material, and you need to prepare well, but, that being said, I think the midterms were much harder than the final. Do NOT slack off preparing for the midterm because *many* students that easily got an A in 180 bombed the midterms and regretted not putting more effort in. Don't fall for the trap of thinking that you will get the same grade you got in 180 because this is certainly not true for most people. Besides that, pretty much everything else is the exact same as 180. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I took it as a pre-med biology student and still really enjoyed the material. In comparison to 180, 181 has a lot more interesting topics. The thing is, this class will take over your life. Or, at least if you are doing it honestly and thoroughly, it will. The psets are designed so you have to work collaboratively and go to office hours. Although there are study halls, the TAs there are usually much less helpful than the undergraduate ones. I did know some people who seemed to work alone, but I think if this is your first time taking physics from 180, it will be difficult. If you have already taken 180, you know the drill.\r\n\r\nProfessor Steinacker is an amazingly committed teacher, so it is always a pleasure to learn from her. Just beware the workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great professor and useful knowledge for everyone. Really glad this was my physics class! ",
            "\u00a0I'm guessing you already took 180 if you're looking to take this class so you probably have to, and sure. I'd recommend it over 171 for sure. ",
            "\u00a0OMG, this class is hard especially if you have not taken Physics before, but if you seek help at the beginning and go to office hours, yo should be fine ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I obviously cannot compare this course to the other intro physics, but I can confirm that it is an excellent, well-taught course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought it was a reasonable way to finish my physics requirement. There are a lot of resources available to help you do well - use those and you will be fine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, since it is the only course at Yale that offers this particular set of knowledge and skills. However, the course definitely has issues (psets are far too long and hard). ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Professor Steinacker is amazing, and you have to take physics at Yale you should take it with her. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its not super stressful and the work pays off. ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take this ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student potentially pursuing engineering or medicine, because the topics discussed related greatly to both disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take it, but honestly it is a pretty solid class. I enjoyed it even though there was a lot of work involved. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - especially with Professor Steinacker ",
            "\u00a0Yeah ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if Professor Steinacker is teaching it. She truly is amazing and makes the class doable. Be prepared to put in a lot of work though. ",
            "\u00a0No! Don't take it unless required. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommened this course to another Yale student. This course is great for pre-med or engineering majors ecuase it covers all the physics that has very practical application, rather than focusing on the theoretical aspects. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course because I feel like I learned a lot of really amazing stuff. I'd also warn that it's quite a bit of work and you need to go get help if you need it - the resources are there but they don't chase you down. Steinacker is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it would definitely recommend taking this course. Steinacker is an amazing professor, and although the workload is quite large, you'll end up doing well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, you have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend students with little preparation in physics take PHYS 180 and then PHYS 181. The highest-level physics class available to me in high school was AP Physics 1, which is algebra-based, and I was able to understand the material in this physics sequence. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The professor was great and there are always TA willing to help as well as the professor herself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, despite its difficulty and workload. Professor Steinacker is one of the best professors I've had at Yaleshe really cares about all of her students, and she devotes an enormous amount of time and energy to supporting every one of us. She made the course worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this over PHYSICS 200 - Steinacker has office hours 4 days a week and is very helpful. She cares so much about her students and supports them how ever she can. There's also study halls every night - there will be plenty of help if you need it for this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, because Adriane is a wonderful teacher and the course is very well organized despite it's large size. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great intro to electromagnetism. If you have not taken physics before, you will come out of this class with a really thorough understanding of the basics (would recommend!). If you have already taken physics and are comfortable with multivariate calculus, consider taking a higher level physics class. You will still learn some stuff from this class, but the problem sets take forever (6-10ish hours if you know what you're doing) and you'll learn more from a more advanced class. ",
            "\u00a0This is challenging but rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Physics 181 may not be the most exciting class you'll take at Yale, but Professor Steinacker doesn't let that stop her from teaching like it is. She loves physics, and with her as your professor, you can't help but love it a little bit, too. That is, until she gives you a pset filled with \"gems\" that she loves writing and you hate solving. But with office hours almost every day and more peer tutors than you can count, it's not hard to do well in this class. Granted, it takes quite a bit of effort, but it's well worth it to get a solid groundwork in physics. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student unless it is required for a major or for pre-med prerequisites.  If the conceptual understanding of physics does not come easily to you, it will be very difficult to get through all of the work.  This semester it was honestly painful trying to survive this course. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I would. The problem sets are really hard -- expect to put in 10+ hours a week -- but prepare you well for midterms and the final, and there's a lot of support, including Professor Steinacker's office hours and peer tutors. You'll end up with a great understanding of physics. I love that the class does not require multivariate calculus (despite what appears online) or any prior physics knowledge. Obviously I can't compare to other intro physics sequences, but overall I had a good experience in PHYS 180/181. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Extremely well taught. You will understand electricity and magnetism well after taking this course even if you have not had prior exposure to those subjects! "
