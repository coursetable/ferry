            "\u00a0I learned what political, social and economic events and currents shaped the development of unique types of music in western and southern Africa. I also learned how to actively listen to music and hear certain unique elements. ",
            "\u00a0How to analyze music and understand the context in which it was produced. ",
            "\u00a0I got a glimpse into contemporary ethnomusicology through the lens of sub-Saharan Africa. I learned how to analyze African music through auditory, sociopolitical, historiographic, and network-theoretic perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course taught me how to listen to music from Sub-Saharan Africa with knowledge of socio-political context at the time of it's creation. It was very interesting to study the traditional music of various regions and how these evolved into neo-traditional and then into more contemporary music that involves global and local influences. ",
            "\u00a0A broad knowledge of various indigenous African musical styles, ranging from traditional to contemporary. ",
            "\u00a0A survey course into Sub-Saharan African music. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great intro to academic close listening, and a really fun one at that. The music was a joy, and both Prof. Veal and Lin did a fantastic job of balancing group listening with history and anthropology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much. Everyone should take this class. It is so different from the other music courses at yale and professor Veal makes all of his classes worthwhile. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths was the targeted subject matter by country/region and the amount of listening that takes. ",
            "\u00a0The material for this course was fascinating, Professor Veal is an engaging lecturer and I greatly benefited from exposure to new fields (postcolonial studies, African studies etc). I sometimes felt that I would gain more from the lectures if the powerpoints he used had more information, and felt that the discussion-style classes we had would be improved by going farther towards the Socratic method - in other words, decide on which mode for a certain class and stick to it. The readings for this class were excessive, and I would have gained far more from them if there were fewer - for example, readings on social function of certain musical forms are well and good, but reading a detailed explication of indigenous guitar styles is quite unnecessary. Also, I sometimes felt that section would benefit from more structure, or specific material set aside for section - otherwise it wastes time. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class, the only assignments we had besides the reading were in-class quizzes, allowing me to focus more on my STEM classes. Also Professor Veal is hilarious.\r\n\r\nSome things I thought could be improved:\r\n\r\nInstead of spending class time on watching movies, it'd probably be better to assign the movies to watch on our own.\r\n\r\nMaybe this wasn't the focus of this course, but I feel like we didn't cover much about current musical styles and artists. It'd be nice if there was a unit for that.\r\n\r\nThe readings were a bit extensive at times and often not discussed in class. There were a couple of times when he indicated that we only need to skim the readings for that day, if he continued to do that for all the readings that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of those classes where everyone involved brought something unique and important to the table, either by their background or discipline. I enjoyed the collaborative, open-ended structure of section; and no lecture ever failed to enlighten me on something that I had never before considered. The course was fun and engaging and incredibly informative.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses: were often assigned a bit too much reading, not all of it immediately relevant to lecture or section. This might be addressed by separating readings into \"required\" and \"optional\" groups, or directing students to read with certain core ideas in mind. ",
            "\u00a0The subject material is well organized and we covered music from various regions in Western and Southern Africa. I wish we could have also studied more music from Eastern and Central Africa. However, I also understand that studying more areas would reduce the level of depth we could go into for each region. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredibly well taught and the instructor does a great job of making each area of African music accessible without dumbing it down. If there were any weaknesses it would be that the presentations on contemporary music were often glossed over. ",
            "\u00a0The course exposes you to a lot of great music! I felt that it could significantly benefit though from more recent texts, however, as the majority of what we read were from before 2005, which felt a little dated. I also think some form of reading responses, such as a paragraph or two, would benefit everyone, as I think the majority of students didn't do the readings as often as we should have, and we couldn't really have any substantial discussion or be prepared for the info better. ",
            "\u00a0Great introduction, lots of interesting musical material we get to listen to. Only weakness is that sometimes there is a tad too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the tests were always a surprise so I never really knew how to prepare. It was also sometimes difficult to know what was necessary information to know versus what was just interesting to learn. There was also always a lot of reading that we never got to. I also think having a section for such a small class was kind of a bummer but I really appreciated our TA. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you have previous background in any Afro-diasporic musical forms (jazz, reggae etc.), as once the class ventures into African popular music it becomes far less interesting if that's not the case. I would also caution music majors to think carefully before taking this class, because of somewhat variable technical standards and the fact that this music is quite different than what you've previously studied. The academic material associated with the field, however, is fascinating and gave me an entirely new perspective on musical cultures in general, which is the primary benefit those who don't wish to go into ethnomusicology can derive. Be careful with Professor Veal - some like him and some don't. He's very intelligent and a great lecturer, but certain organizational aspects can be quite frustrating, and he doesn't seem very in touch with the demands of student life (read: assigns way, way too much reading). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a good course for music majors and non-majors, even if you have no experience with music. The workload is really manageable, and you can get away with skipping a couple of readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; despite the workload, this class is a great way to broaden anyone's horizons. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed listening and analyzing all the music and gaining a better understanding of it through the historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. My favorite courses at Yale are ones that you can implement into everyday life. This course will have you hearing drum patterns and African motifs in virtually every form of popular music and will additionally give you the historical background to understand why this is the case. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely. The course is unlike anything I have done before, and as a musician it was a great insight into how similar and different African musics are from the Western musical traditions that I know. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Fun and interesting class if you're a musician or not. (Easier if you are a musician though) ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course for someone who loves music but does not want to get into the overbearing structural parts of music classes. It is absolutely refreshing to have a course like this that is completely different from everything else at Yale and Professor Veal is so amazing. The material is not too challenging but be ready to be confused and frustrated at times with the structure of the course. "
