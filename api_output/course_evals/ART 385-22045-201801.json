            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different technical skills and tools that are used in different performance areas. This is helpful as I look to create performance opportunities for myself in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to incorporate my prior knowledge with new found skillsets that I have never touched before. The course is an interdisciplinary study that is so wonderfully put together. ",
            "\u00a0How to devise with a fully company! ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a bunch about choreographic thinking and thinking about how we can set ourselves creative boundaries to work within to produce work. I learnt about taking ideas on board from a team and integrating them into a piece, about trusting my instincts about things that feel like they fit to me. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing, interdisciplinary understanding of the interrelationships between theatrical performance, dance, and the digital technologies that can be used to make the overall performance truly shine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the value of teamwork and gained insight about the collaborative creative process. I also learned a lot about the interplay of mediation and live performance. ",
            "\u00a0I had not had much exposure to devising a piece like this prior to the class, so it was a completely new experience to create an hour-length piece from a semester of exploration. The works of the various filmmakers we studied have inspired me and exposed me to a lot of different ways of thinking about the camera and what it can capture. In addition, I learned more about the potential for media in performance - the class perfectly captured the title. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the knowledge and expertise that each instructor brings to the course. A weakness is the time it took to get the final performance to come together. As enriching as the late night tech week was, it was poor timing being the last week of classes with final papers and theses due. It would have been better if the performance was a week earlier or if we were able to have earlier nights. ",
            "\u00a0I think the schedule was kind of packed, especially due to unforeseen circumstances. The rehearsal and reviewing process could have started probably a week earlier. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like we didn't engage with some of the readings as much as we could have/ as much as i would have liked to! ",
            "\u00a0Tremendous course, not much to improve upon other than a sense of structure from the very beginning of the class, in order to understand what we are working for and how to evaluate ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0Both a strength and weakness of the class is having 3 professors/directors. It allowed for a diversity of thought and disciplines to be represented and covered but also at times felt a lot of cooks in one kitchen. ",
            "\u00a0There are probably next to no classes that are structured like this, and this open ended/explorative. It was amazing to have this much interaction with incredible professors, and to work so closely alongside them. I will echo what many of my classmates said: that the respect we were shown not just as students but as collaborators was impressive, and created an incredibly supportive atmosphere. I really enjoyed just getting to play around all semester.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I felt like a lot of the \"creation\" was rushed - for example, we would have 5 minutes at the end of a class to create a performance with our classmates, and, after throwing it together, were then surprised to find it featured in our final performance. I personally am someone who needs considerable time to think through a piece, and I ended up feeling not proud of some of the small group performances put up in front of the class because they felt rushed. It would have been nice to have a more democratic process about what was put into the final performance, as I really liked some stuff that didn't end up in it but wasn't crazy about other moments that ended up being prominently featured. All in all, however, it was an interesting exploration of artistic creation and an incredibly unique experience. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! If someone is interested in learning more about how to put a performance together or hoping to expand their range of performance this is a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, especially if you're interested in melding different art disciplines, or have only explored one/none and are interested to learn more. It is a course that pushes your boundaries in many aspects. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if you want an intensive, lab-like experience in devising live performance. I had an amazing experience working with people from all disciplines and skill sets in creating a really cool performance. But know going in that it's a lot of work both inside and outside the class time, especially during tech week! ",
            "\u00a0I would. It was amazing to get to work with johannes, joan, and emily, all of whom were so giving with their time and experience. for someone whose interest in art and art making lies across various disciplines in art and performance this was for me the ideal class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this course to fellow students, it truly changed my perspective and made me engage with new materials in ways that I wasnt familiar with and learned new ways of experiencing novel academic disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this class to another student. Getting to combine intellectual knowledge with creating a piece as an ensemble of people from diverse academic disciplines was an invaluable experience. Each process will be different with different people but it's absolutely an amazing experience. It's the most interdisciplinary class I've taken at Yale so far combining: art history, film and media studies, theater studies, performance/dance studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want a unique theatrical experience and class unlike almost any at Yale. You will get to create an hour-long performance project alongside incredible professors. However, if you aren't someone who likes very experimental theater/devised work, you might not like the open-endedness of the class and small group work. "
