            "\u00a0The course teaches the history of the Near East (particularly Mesopotamia and Egypt, along the Tigris, Euphrates and Nile rivers) from 14,000 years before present up to the time of the Hittites, Seleucids, and Ptolemaic Egypt. If you love ancient civilizations, then you'll love this course. If you don't love ancient civilizations, you'll learn to love them. Toward the end of the term, the course jumps to c. 1900 CE and analyzes the past century of conflict and history in the Middle East, in the context of the ancient history. Along the way, this awesome course teaches you that history is much more than what you find written down in texts and writing. You'll learn that the modern discipline of history is a collaborative and interdisciplinary one. Textual descriptions are important, but archaeology and climatology (both of which you will learn) can often provide strong causal evidence for sociopolitical dynamics. The rivers, naturally, play an essential role in shaping early civilizations. This course deserves its cross-listings. It really approaches history as this dynamic and interactive science, the confluence of many different modes of inquiry. Environment, archaeology and history are united in the study of how civilizations arose and prospered, why they rose and fell. I'm convinced that everyone can find something interesting in this course, whether you're a physics or an English major, the lessons of the longue dure are for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about Mesopotamian and Egyptian history from prehistory to the present in a climatic context ",
            "\u00a0We analyzed climate and archaeological evidence from Egypt and Mesopotamia and studied how climate affects Man and history. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to archaeology for the first time through this course and was given a solid idea of the intersection between history and a little bit of anthropology through material culture. I think my biggest takeaway from this course was the general theme of the impact changes in the natural environmental has had and can have on human society and the development of civilization. ",
            "\u00a0This class develops a relatively clear theory of how human development was guided by environmental changes.  In addition, a historical timeline of the near-eastern and Egyptian civilizations is established. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked learning about how the professors conducted their research: the main theses of the class is that climate change is responsible for civilizational collapse. In order to support that theory, they analyzed different patterns in archeology and in the climate record through a combination of traditionally historical methods and geological methods. I learned a lot about how scientists determine what climates were like in the past and how those results are matched with the historical record. The methodology is unique to these professors, who are pioneers in this study. It was incredible to be taking a class with them and learning not only about their methods and conclusions, but how they developed those methods and the execution itself in a way we would not have learned from just reading their papers.

            "\u00a0The strengths are that the professors are super knowledgeable and the content is fun. As a freshman seminar, there is more of a focus on the content rather than on grades. The weakness is that the class is 95% lecture and 5% discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It was definitely not the freshman seminar experience I was looking for. I expected a much more interactive and discussion-based class, and instead, it was really just a lecture in an intimate setting. The lectures were rather disorganized, but my biggest issue was that the seminar questions for each class meeting were really enormous questions--hard to answer from the readings and certainly too broad to answer with one session. I don't think I left with a well-rounded understanding of how to answer them. ",
            "\u00a0This class runs out of steam in the second half of the course.  There are fewer readings assigned, and the readings that are assigned are only tangentially related to what is covered in class.  It seemed almost as if the professors ran out of material to teach. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is enormously comprehensive, with quotes, questions, and diagrams that really supplement the readings and provide a focused direction from which to prepare for class and complete independent work outside of class. However, more organization would be great in the sense that the dates on the syllabus should be up to date with the new year, and the readings should all be posted at least two days before class; it was very frustrating to have to find the readings in obscure places in the internet and library when the syllabus said they would be posted to canvas. Sometimes, though rarely, we weren't able to find the readings at all. Also, it was hard to put together a really clear timeline given the difference in geologic time and historical time, so more clarity on that would be really great, though the professors were great when we asked or went to office hours. This is a really great class with great professors; a little more organization on logistics would be great (logistics being distinct from content :) ). Thank you again for a great term! "

            "\u00a0Yes, without hesitation. An understanding of long-term history is critical for the appreciation of the societies and civilizations we have today. This course fills a gap in the usual curriculum by exploring the most ancient history available to scholars today, and explaining the most current scholarship on historical climate dynamics and archaeology, in the light of long-established textual traditions. It is a unique blend of past and present, with tremendous explanatory power and consequence. Everyone can, by focusing on a particular part of the seminar readings, find something they would love, since the course is so expansive. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Really interesting class if you like history or science ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to future freshmen. It gives you a great taste of what Yale is all about, and the professors and class are just overall amazing! ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not--especially if you're looking for the freshman seminar experience. Take it if you're interested in an archaeology and geology lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great.  Definitely take it if you can.  It gives an interesting theory of history that, I for one, totally believe, that you won't see anywhere else.  Nobody else is doing environmental history like Weiss and Manning are.  I'm glad I could learn history from professors who have a better answer for \"why?\" than just \"this historical figure decided to do this and that's why it happened\".   Studying the factors that guide human behavior was fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked learning about how the professors conducted their research: the main theses of the class is that climate change is responsible for civilizational collapse.

The dates on the syllabus are not updated for the current year, all the readings for the entire term are thrown together in the same folder, and sometimes the readings are not posted at all. With a little patience, these are small things that do not detract overly from a really substantive and unique class with the leading professors in the field. It should be said that this is more a lecture than a seminar, but we can ask questions while the professors talk because it is a small group. "
