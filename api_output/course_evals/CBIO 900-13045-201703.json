            "\u00a0This course had very little novel information that we did not get during orientation. Given the significant workload of our other courses and lab research, it was a serious time commitment for the benefits received by the course. ",

            "\u00a0I'm not totally sure. Graduate school timeline and minimal coding. ",

            "\u00a0The modules on how NIH Grants work, Dr. Grecco's talk on presentations, and Dr. Ramon's talk on approaching academic thinking and learning were the positive talks in this course that I felt better prepared me to be a graduate student. The rest did not present any new or useful new information. The sections on coding should be optional for individuals with prior experience in coding and computer science. ",
            "\u00a0Some topics of the course are very helpful to us. However, I find the programming part not helpful and efficient. ",
            "\u00a0Addressing issues with coming into graduate school/presentation creation were helpful. \r\n\r\nOther sections were entirely not useful or productive in anyway, such as the endnote session that only instructed on how to search for papers and did not touch on endnote at all. \r\n\r\nThe MatLab portion of the course could have been useful if tailored more towards utilization in biology and less how o make matrices. While it is good to know the basics of this programs, teaching the basics in a context of biology at the beginning (ex: addition is very straight forward, just incorporating this into higher order functions or experiments would be more productive) would have made the class more accessible. Additionally, the structure of these sessions was not conducive to dialogue or inquiry into how to do things slightly outside of the guided work, and individuals were reprimanded for trying to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Most lectures were unhelpful and ended early so I believe the information could be synthesized and done in fewer lectures. ",
