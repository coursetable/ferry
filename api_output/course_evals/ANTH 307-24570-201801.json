            "\u00a0An exposure to theoretical texts on the anthropology of play and cultural histories of play and toys. I learned new ways to discuss this material, due to the many different backgrounds of the students in the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to take initiative on doing a final paper whose topic I am inherently passionate about. Dr. Blanton gave us the critical readings and theories necessary to then go forward independently with our individual projects. I developed the capacity to run with my ideas, as well as to learn from other students' ways of approaching artifacts and objects. ",
            "\u00a0play is serious work "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the topic, which has inherent interest for the students, as well as the fluidity of the syllabus and readings, which the instructor adjusted as the semester unfolded. The size of the class and the attention I received from the instructor was exceptionally high. I also appreciated the interactive elements of the course: films, objects, group activities, presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes got behind time because we would do a lot of personal sharing and it was a pretty big class, but its fine "

        [
            "\u00a0If it's ever offered again, yes! A really fun course with an energetic, caring group of students. Anderson and Matthew did an excellent job leading us through a large body of quite difficult theoretical and historical material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. Dr. Blanton is passionate about his field and subject, and that is a positive thing to witness and participate in. The readings can also be applied to many other fields and topics ; it is worth knowing and reading these theories so that they can be used for other courses or projects in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was fun and engaging ",
            "\u00a0yep ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was so fun. I gained a totally different perspective on the importance of toys and games, and it was never boring - even though it was two hours, the class was often broken up with different activities (including designing a playground out of paper). The readings were really interesting and never too much, which meant that basically everyone read them and we could have a really good discussion. There was a lot of freedom in the final project which was really great because you could basically do whatever you wanted. ",
            "\u00a0Play was incredible. This class changed the way I think about the modern 'games' that shape my daily life. I learned that contemporary notions of play negotiate with a long history of religion, work, capitalism, and other themes. "
