            "\u00a0Some of the lessons felt a little repetitive and I could have used more background on a few methods before the ethical discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was composed of a majority PhD students which made it hard to follow as an undergraduate student. I was definitely challenged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: discussions, feedback, and office hours are all very in-depth and helpful. Morgan and Professor Nugent are both amazing--two of the best I have had at Yale!! \r\n\r\nIt might have been helpful to spend a little more time on how to apply mixed methods techniques, as opposed to focusing on the theory, but there was so much critical information packed into one term. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Great way to start thinking about independent research/ if you are a junior, you can plan out your thesis in PoliSci! ",
