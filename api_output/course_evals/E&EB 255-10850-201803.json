            "\u00a0You learn about literally every group of Eukaryote in this class. It's insane. If you ever had even the slightest of interest in knowing what the diversity of animal life was like, this is the class for you. One of the best phrases I learned in the class and the one that I think explains the class the best is \"vertebrates are just invertebrates that happened to develop a spine.\" I think that really sums up the course. You will learn a little about everything, even things that don't come to mind immediately when you think of the word invertebrate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a huge amount about the diversity of animals, and about each of the individual clades. I've also learned a lot about how to approach biology and diversity, and about reading biological papers. "

            "\u00a0I like the overall structure of the course, and I think the lectures were all informative and helpful. I think if possible the readings should have started earlier, because doing the readings gave context to the stuff we were learning, and also refreshed my memory about things we'd learned in class. Another thing that I think would have helped me is if the different clades we looked at were presented using a more regular structure. For example, in some clades there was an approximate number of species shown at the beginning, and in some (usually the larger ones) there was a list of synapomorphies, but the inclusion and presentation of these facts changed a bit between clades. If these kinds of things were always presented in the same order (e.g. if \"this is the clade and it's common name, there are about this many species, and they live in these habitats, etc...\" was the way every new clade was introduced) it would really help me organize everything within my head, and would make my note-taking easier. Really, though, these are small things that might have helped me along a bit. I thought the course was great, and it had just the right mix of giving an overview of animal life, delving into specific organisms and how they function, and talking about core ideas and trends in biology.

            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to every student. Whether you're an ecology major looking for their organism course or a humanities major looking to learn about animals, this course is fascinating. The content could carry itself alone, but Casey talks about each animal with a love and wonder that is just so captivating. He has the enthusiasm of a toddler and the intellect of a genius, which makes sense since he's a leading scientist in his field. And the workload was so reasonable! Yes it's a lot of content, but it's learned at a very manageable pace and the occasional quizzes provide a great way to make sure you don't check out. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course to take if you like animals or if you are at all curious about animal diversity. It's a comprehensive view of all the animal life on Earth, and it is also a great introduction to topics in animal diversity and in biology as a whole. "
