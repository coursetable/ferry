            "\u00a0I think the biggest weakness of this course is the fact that it could be a course based in active discussion with a bit of lecturing if more concise but engaging readings were given. The biggest strength was that Professor Jackson knew the material very well. ",

            "\u00a0I think it would be simpler if the course was chronological. Also too many readings for the amount of time we had to do them. This course would be more engaging if the workload wasnt so daunting and if it was organized in a way that made more sense, since its so fast paced. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the course could potentially be improved if it took on more of a seminar-style approach than a lecture one. I enjoyed the readings that were assigned, the different perspectives that they exposed us to, but I would have appreciated the opportunity to voice my own pinions in class. "
