We spent about 4 weeks covering the L2 material, which at times was quite challenging, however the course was structured in such a way that we learned through repetitive use of the language, even when moving past certain grammatical topics.

            "\u00a0As we moved to L2 content, it started feeling like it was going much faster. I think this was because the L2 content was more difficult than the L1 content. So perhaps go faster on the L1 content to leave more time to spread out the L2 content. ",
            "\u00a0One of the weaknesses of this course was simply just the pace, however I think this was a strength in some ways as well. Having the language so condensed was certainly difficult and while we had class for 3 hours a day, 5 days a week, it also required 2-3 hours of self-studying on those days as well to keep up and do well with the language. I think that having the program entirely in Italy made a huge difference, especially living with a host family who spoke 0 English really forced us to learn quickly. Although this was challenging at the time, I do think that it really helped improve my ability to speak and learn the language.\r\n\r\nI think that there are many ways this course and program can be improved. I think that the syllabus really needs to be looked at critically. I believe that the professors and some students of the program need to look at the syllabus together, and work to find a way where units that were most challenging or weeks with the most going on (trips, etc.) are facilitated and structured so students have more time to focus on more challenging topics, such as the subjunctive which was virtually skipped over at the end.\r\n\r\nI also think that the timing of program trips needs to be looked at more critically, especially most of the Siena trips after class. The only three trips disclosed to students before the program and on the syllabus were: Rome, Florence, and the beach. I think that first, the beach trip should not have been referred to in the information session at Yale especially as the beach trip, as it involved a trip to the archeological site. I think many students, myself included, actually really enjoyed that visit (probably one of my favorites of the program), however many were frustrated beforehand because it felt sprung on them. It was also only 3 days of class that week because of the Palio, which I think made it really difficult to push through the final couple of weeks of the program, and this likely contributed to a lot of the exhaustion students were feeling. Additionally, there were many trips within Siena that came up even the day of, such as trips to Contrada Museums, the bank, etc. I think these need to be planned more in advance so that students are prepared to engage with them, and can especially plan their studying and travelling accordingly.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking to learn Italian quickly and efficiently. I would not recommend this course to someone looking for a 'gut' language because it requires a lot of effort and accountability, however is definitely worthwhile for anyone willing to put in the effort. The course is designed in a way that students can succeed, and the professors were great. Overall I would recommend this course to students, especially those looking for a great summer abroad experience and learning a new language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was more enjoyable to take the course abroad than at Yale because I was in a different country and it was almost like a vacation ",
            "\u00a0yes; great time for self discovery and growth ",
            "\u00a0YES! Refer to Italian 1 Summer 2018. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely not recommend the course itself. I speak 5 languages fluently and essentially spend all of my free time learning languages, so I have some experience with this and in my opinion this course has many quite obvious and significant issues. The positive was that we were in Siena and it is a gorgeous town to spend a summer; however, the course itself (which I assume is the same when conducted at Yale) is a quite poorly executed. The textbook is terrible. 4 pages out of 5 are skipped entirely during the course. It is a 300 page textbook with literally 26 useful pages (I counted). There are so many issues with the way that the Italian language is taught at Yale that I couldn't write them all in this course review even if I tried. Just to shed a small light on the problem I'll give a minor example: all the vocabulary lists are organized in the alphabetical order of the Italian words, with the corresponding English translation next to each italian word. This means that you cannot quiz yourself using the textbook because you automatically know what letter that the Italian definition will start with since you see that the word above it started with the letter 'C' and the one below also with the letter 'C'.\r\nIt is such a minor thing when considering the 300 pages of stupidity that is that textbook, but it is the small things that make the biggest differences when you are attempting to learn a foreign language.\r\nI want to be clear, I am not ranting to be mean. I am ranting because I am trying to help and I think the Italian department could greatly improve its efficiency if it fixed some of these problems.\r\nInstead of having a textbook that has all of the vocab, grammar, culture, and passages for reading. There should be different books for each of the 4.\r\nThere should be a vocab book, a separate grammar book, a different book for reading, and then culture should be taught by teachers through powerpoint presentations or articles.\r\nThis course was lazily organized and many students suffered because of it. I was lucky because I knew, through experience, how to teach myself Italian while I was in Siena, in spite of this course. But most other students did not, and spent a ridiculous amount of money and 2 months in Italy and came out of the course without the ability to speak the slightest amount of Italian. They also did not have enough vocabulary to be able to read or write coherent passages that did not sound like Google Translate. "
