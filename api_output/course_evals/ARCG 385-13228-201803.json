            "\u00a0I learned a ton about ceramics, mostly in archaeological contexts. I learned about why ceramics are so important, how to analyze them to understand the people who made them, the types of ceramic traditions around the world, and how to make ceramics. It was an amazing course IF you like ceramics. Professor Underhill is incredible and so passionate about the topic, but the readings and assignments definitely get tedious if you're not interested in studying civilizations through their ceramics. ",

            "\u00a0This course served as a comprehensive introduction to the study of handmade ceramics, both in ancient and extant civilizations. It covered a massive breadth of information by providing specific research papers as weekly readings, leading to the synthesis of larger topics such as petrology or ceramic use-life through case studies.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it provided two specific opportunities for hands-on analysis of a focused area. The first focused on a collection of ceramic \"sherds\" from the midwestern Crosno site, which took the form of about 4 or so weeks with half of the class time devoted to concluding information about these sherds in the Peabody museum. This took the form of analyzing thickness, vessel composition, decoration, incisions, and others and comparing them to existing records. The second allowed for the research of one particular area of pottery of the student's choice, such as that of Ancient Greece or an island in Australia, and creating a paper about a specific vessel from the area or region that the student replicated with the generous help of Maishe Dickman. The hands-on portion of this class is where it excels, and I feel like I learned more about physical research than the theoretical topics discussed in the papers. ",
            "\u00a0I had no prior knowledge about archaeology or ceramics prior to taking this course. I learned a great deal about both subjects. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent interdisciplinary introduction to archaeological ceramics! "

            "\u00a0The first assignment (Peabody sherds) was a lot to cover in not very much time, and I didn't feel as though I was knowledgable enough about the topic to make conclusions about my sherds. Some class time spent talking about how to analyze sherds instead of just discussing readings could help with this. Additionally, some help would be appreciated selecting a ceramic tradition for the final project  I felt very overwhelmed for a while since I don't have archaeology experience. Otherwise, though, the final project was a lot of fun, and the pottery sessions with Maishe were a highlight! ",
            "\u00a0the hands on aspects (ie making ceramics) was so fun, the readings however were super dense and difficult to get through ",
            "\u00a0This course is certainly harder for individuals with a weaker background in archaeology and ceramics (myself being one of them) but it makes every effort to be inclusive and by the end of the semester I felt much more confident in my abilities.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the lecture and discussion will seem a bit difficult to parse for those without a genuine interest or large amount of knowledge in the subject. This is due to the class including graduate students and upper-level archaeology students-- in order to better serve them, some discussion topics did go over the heads of some students. The readings also cater more towards people used to reading research on the subject, and some, such as the one about Chane opratoire, did not make any sense to me.\r\n\r\nHowever, everything else about this class is a strength. Professor Underhill and Maishe Dickman are two wonderful people who made me feel far more accommodated than I would have otherwise been. Maishe spent 4 weeks of his time helping the class replicate their pottery using his materials, and then fired it in his oven free of charge. He helped design more technically difficult works and he was awe-inspiring to watch-- he made a vessel upside down on a wheel just for fun! He also invited us to his studio for his holiday sale, and was simply great-- my time making the vessel was my favorite part of the course. He is the closest person I have met to Bob Ross, and I loved every second with him. Professor Underhill was also wonderful, and she made every student of every skill level feel welcome. When she saw the amount of sherds we were analyzing was too much, she cut the number in half, no questions asked. She greeted me walking down the street, handed out cookies on the last day, and quite literally never had a negative thing to say. The strength of this class, no questions asked, lies in its instructors. "

            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student if they have a vested interest in ceramics. This interest could be through art, archaeology, classics, or any other discipline, but you definitely need to be interested in ceramics to enjoy this course. It was an great mix of class time and hands on work, but if you're not interested in the topic, the lab work analyzing sherds and making pottery is not quite enough to make up for the time spent reading about archaeological ceramics, discussing readings, and researching/writing your paper. ",
            "\u00a0if you have an interest in archaeology then take this course! however, i took this class mainly because i enjoy making ceramics and have no prior knowledge about archaeology so it was honestly pretty underwhelming. however it was not hard and the fun parts were very fun! just the readings in general were not particularly engaging to me (but they mightve been if i was into archaeology) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but with a few caveats. If you are not an ARCG/ANTH major, you will find some concepts confusing at first. Some things will go over your head, but you will still leave the class with a greater knowledge in the area than the vast majority of people. You will also likely spend some extra time on the hands-on days than advertised-- potentially an hour to an hour and a half if you want to get all of the data collected. Just plan to maybe work a little longer than advertised. Finally, you will feel a bit confused by some readings, but you should still be able to participate in discussions. Finally, you will spend most of your time working not as hard as other classes, but most of your grade is centered around 2 papers, and you will NEED to start these more than a few days before, or you will have a sad few nights. Other than that, everything about this course is great-- Professor Underhill and Maishe Dickman are wonderful, you will be contributing to actual research (although your conclusions may not line up with your classmates), and you will love the hands-on portions (and get to keep a vessel you help make!). Overall, this is a class worth taking, but worth shopping to see if it clicks.\r\n\r\nIf you are an ARCG/ANTH major with interest in the area, absolutely take this course. ",
