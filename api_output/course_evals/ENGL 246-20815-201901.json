            "\u00a0In this class, I learned how to keep working on my poems throughout the semester. The revision process is long and tedious and it was challenging but rewarding to keep going back to certain poems until getting them right. I learned a lot about patience in the process but also gained motivation to keep working towards the semester long goal: our portfolio. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make my language more concise and deliberate, and to be more attuned to when I was arriving at the heart of what I wanted to say. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper insight into the craft of writing (and reading) poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I developed \"workshopping muscles\" in ENGL 246learning how to comment on my own and other's work in a meaningful way that leads to a greater understanding of the craft, and more coherent pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to write compelling poetry, and about life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the modern/contemporary canon of poetry, about different forms of poetry, and about concrete ways to write stronger poems. I also gained my first experience in a writing workshop which involved giving and receiving peer feedback. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think this course really makes you reflect and engage with yourself, your poetry, and your peers' work. It forces you to think critically about others' work but also your own. I think that in order to do this, though, it would be helpful if we read more poetry each week about the different forms we were writing but also poetry beyond that. ",
            "\u00a0Due to the somewhat unstructured layout, I'm not sure why or how my poetry improved except by practice. That is, it's hard to name specific techniques or skills which I picked up on and consciously integrated. Professor Deming's specific feedback on every poem was helpful though. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course. It really helped me understand the machinery of poetry and improve my craft. The workshop needs to be more organized: each person being workshopped should get the same amount of time. A timer should be used to make sure we don't go over. It's not fair to people who expect to be workshopped to not get as much time--or have to wait to be workshopped until the next course--simply because they go later in the class period. To critique a work of art, you have to take the work seriously. That takes time. Though time might feel like a minor logistical detail, it's actually not, because it can mean slapdash commentary that can't take the complexity of the work into account. To neglect time is disrespectful to the process of critique and to the art that people have brought to the table. ",
            "\u00a0Overall incredibly strong. The only suggestion I'd have would be to maybe hear more from the poets we workshop during the workshop itself, but otherwise a really great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class is a very good size for workshoppingyou get to know you classmates fairly well by reading their work, and talking every week. The class is also open to experimentation and taking risks, which is really helpful for developing your style. \r\n\r\nWeakness: A lot of the course communication is done over email, which every once in a while made it confusing to figure out who was being workshopped in a particular week/what files had or hadn't been uploaded to canvas as examples. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course. The workshop format is incredible--it suits itself perfectly to the class's strengths. Writing one poem each week and receiving feedback on it is a perfect way to learn. Professor Deming is a wonderful moderator, and always gives kind, useful, and intelligent feedback. If I could have changed anything, it would only be that I would have loved to hear Professor Deming lecture a bit more--he always has such great things to say when he does. ",
            "\u00a0I did not feel like the feedback I received from Professor Deming or from the peer workshop was specific enough. We spent a lot of time analyzing our peers' poems, rather than critiquing them. I also struggled with the poem assignments which were not specific prompts, but were general types of poetry. I think the class is good because it forced me to write poetry consistently, but I don't feel like it pushed me enough. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Introduction to Writing Poetry is an amazing class if you want to go back to writing poetry or have never written it before. Professor Deming makes the process of writing accessible and also it's just a fun, chill class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great poetry workshop. You'll learn a lot about the nuts and bolts of language--and I promise, that's how you learn to improve your own work. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Deming was amazing and it was not only a great intro to reading poetry but it also put me in contact with poets and genre's I'd never heard of before, who I've loved reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in developing your poetry and willing to engage in a workshop, I definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Professor Deming is a wonderful poetry professor. He gives feedback that is very kind, intelligent, and useful. He's great at leading discussion, and often makes cool wise statements that feel applicable to life in general. Make sure you go to his office hours! In the class you write basically one poem every week plus a presentation and a couple of papers. The work is very well spaced out so it doesn't feel like a lot. You'll bond with your classmates, and have a great time! ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class unless you are highly self-motivated. It's too easy to not do enough work to make yourself improve as a poet. "
