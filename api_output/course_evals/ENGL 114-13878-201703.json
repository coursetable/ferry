            "\u00a0I improved my writing. I learned how to craft and academic essay in a way that introduces a compelling argument. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of social equality and inequality, from its origins to its limitations in our modern society. I read and learned to analyze difficult but interesting texts such as Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality and Karl Marx's Critique of the Gotha Program. I also learned a great deal about academic writing and improved my writing skills. Overall, I came out of this course with a more nuanced understanding of mass incarceration and social movements such as Black Lives Matter. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course to get a jumpstart on your academic writing with very interesting subject matter. Professor Kreiner is a great professor who is always open to questions and helping you with your writing at all stages. He is also fairly knowledgable in the material that is discussed. However, his grading is pretty harsh. You will write three papers in the class. It is nice that the early papers are worth less than your large research paper because it drives you to improve your writing over the course. Also, two of the three papers are on topics relating to social equality that you get to choose. Overall, I think that this course is challenging yet rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0In society, we tend to glorify the concept of equality and oftentimes, we perceive it as the solution to many of the world's major problems. After taking this course and analyzing the works of Plato, Marx, and various Black Lives Matter activists, I have come to realize that equality has its downfalls. Overall, this course was extremely enlightening and genuinely helped me grow as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to read more difficult material at a college level. Learned how to write longer college level papers as well with tons of help and feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout the course of the semester, I learned how to analyze texts at a college level. I also learned how to use my analyses and observations from the readings and research and form them into a coherent essay. From the readings, I also learned about the difficulties in achieving equality in the social, economic, and political arena. ",
            "\u00a0Coming into this course, I knew my writing was good but that it could be quite a bit better. I realized as soon as I got the first draft of my first essay back that I had much more to learn than I realized. Fortunately, I now feel confident in saying that the quality of my writing has greatly improved during this past semester; I've learned how to draw out my arguments and build logical connections between every small point they contain as opposed to making general conclusions without specific evidence to back them up.

            "\u00a0The readings chosen for this course were incredibly interesting and engaging, so there were so many great topics and subjects to discuss over the seminar table. Professor Kreiner is also a wonderful professor. He gives great feedback on all of your essays and makes class fun and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The readings in this course were fairly interesting. They were fairly substantive and gave interesting arguments on topics relating to modern social inequality. However, I found that most of the literature conveyed radical messages. Professor Kreiner does a relatively decent job at making sure that all perspectives are addressed. However, I think that this could be done better through a more diversified reading list. I, also, liked that in this class there was not the expectation that you knew all the issues from the beginning of the class. Also, Professor Kreiner is very supportive with difficulties in both readings and essays. ",
            "\u00a0The Course Reader was $69 and there were many passages we didn't use and had to print out separately. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that most of the readings are very engaging. Another strength is that the small class size allows everyone to participate in discussion with ease. One weakness of the course is that the organization of the class could be a little better. Another weakness is that there is not enough time dedicated to improve some essays, especially the research paper. Better organization of the class could help future students. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the way this course was structured; starting with Rousseau's \"Origins of Inequality\" helped lay a thorough foundation for studying thinking on equality, and there was a very smooth transition from thinking on equality to modern examples of inequality and how they can be corrected. The inclusion of the film \"13TH\" helped quite a lot as well; one can only read so many essays before they start to blur together, and that documentary helped revitalize my interest in the topics we were addressing at the time.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of in this course is the rather quick turnaround between finishing the second essay and starting the third. It felt as though we hadn't covered much more material, so I didn't initially feel very prepared to begin the third essay. That essay worked out fine in the end, however, so the fact that this is the only weakness I can think of speaks to the high quality of the course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! I loved this section of ENGL114 and it helped me gain a greater understanding of many of the social issues that were happening across the US at the time. Professor Kreiner is a phenomenal professor: he is dedicated and accessible. He makes class fun and enjoyable, and is also wonderful to meet with outside of class to discuss your writing. If you're interested in learning more about social equality/inequality or the recent events in America such as the Black Lives Matter movement and the rise of the Alt-Right, take this class! The readings are thoughtfully chosen and engaging. Overall, this was an awesome and thought-provoking writing seminar! ",
            "\u00a0You should certainly take this course if you want to write better papers on topics of social equality that you are interested in! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Not only is Professor Kreiner an awesome instructor, but the way he guides the class through readings and discussions is extremely thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is the only class I consistently did all the readings for. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The readings are super engaging and relevant in today's society. The discussions in class are always interesting since it brings different viewpoints to light. The class teaches you how to write the essays that you will continue to see in college. Professor Kreiner is kind and well-versed in the topics we talk about in class. ",
            "\u00a0Simply put, this course has changed the way I view the world. It's made me vastly more aware of the existence of all kinds of inequality in today's society, which is the first step towards resolving that inequality. I was well aware that the Black Lives Matter movement existed and was very much in the news, and I regretted not taking the initiative to learn more about it on my own time, but this course gave a wonderful and thorough explanation of the movement's roots, goals, and everything in between.\r\n\r\nSo I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only did it vastly improve my writing, but it also made me keenly aware of present-day examples of extreme social inequality. "
