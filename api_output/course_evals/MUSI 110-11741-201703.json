            "\u00a0This class helped me develop my understanding and appreciation for music. Although I have been studying music since elementary school, that was only limited to practicing, and not in class theory training. This gave me a better understanding of how the music I play works to create the sounds I enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to analyze music in both its harmonic structure and how it is formatted. I also gained a wealth of knowledge on hows I do moose man using and listen to music critically. ",
            "\u00a0Background knowledge on the composition of music and music analysis ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic music theory, including key signatures, major and minor chords, and the compositional process. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class was very engaging and the seminar style made it a lot more interactive and fun than a lecture would have. I like how this class starts from the very basics of music, such as reading notes and counting measures, since it gave us a solid foundation and pointed out a few rules that we wouldn't normally look out for.\r\n\r\nAfter we finished learning all the material in the textbook, I felt that the course lost a lot of its structure. The beginning of the year had a clear routine that we followed, but later topics were harder to get a grasp on. I also wish we did a little ear training, which would have been more helpful in everyday life and recognizing chords. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is laid out very well and I can  see no changes that would make it better. ",
            "\u00a0I like how in this course, if you pay attention in class and do the homework, you can do well and learn a lot. I also liked having special topic days.\r\nI would say that I had a hard time knowing exactly what we needed to know for the final. One of the questions was particularly difficult and I don't remember it being covered in class or on a specific sheet (but maybe that was my own lack of organization!). "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although the course bulletin says that it is meant for students who have no background in music, I think that having a background in music would be extremely helpful, not only to better understand/grasp the material, but also to better enjoy/appreciate the material. This course started out very simple, but it ramped up in difficulty significantly after October break. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would recommend this course to a another student. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if the student already has prior knowledge of how to read music and has enough time to complete the great amount of repetitive homework. The course moves extremely quickly, and I am not sure how one would succeed if they did not already know how to read music upon entering this \"introduction\" course. Otherwise, the course provides an excellent foundation of music theory. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to learn some pretty basic things about music theory. If you put in the time and effort you will learn a lot! The course ramps up about halfway through the semester, but I still enjoyed it a lot. "
