            "\u00a0I improved my skills in listening comprehension and learned about the basics of the law around the world, with an emphasis on legal documentation from Spanish speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to reenforce my Spanish skills. ",
            "\u00a0Expanded knowledge of legal vocabulary/concepts, improved writing and reading comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course provides an in-depth explanation of a lot of legal concepts. I'm really interested in the law, so it was fascinating to learn about concepts the legal precepts behind nationality and citizenship, for example. Skills-wise, there are a lot of short-answers and summaries based on readings, so I think I improved my ability to condense a lot of information into a small space in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about legal systems in Spanish speaking countries and developed my writing ability in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the legal system in Spanish. I didnt learn much vocab though. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a more complete understanding of the varied legal systems of the world, and what fundamentally unites legal theory, in the context of latin american countries in particular. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided both an overview of legal concepts and terminology in Spanish and an examination of constitutional articles from Spanish-speaking countries that exemplified the concepts studied. Through short (20 lines, double-spaced) weekly written assignments and the final 10-page paper, I learned to synthesize arguments in the Spanish language about global legal issues and trends. Aural comprehension skills were also enhanced by watching videos and listening to audio clips in Spanish. Through the presentation, I improved both my ability to communicate to others in Spanish but also my public speaking skills. Overall, this course applies reading, writing, listening, and more importantly, speaking Spanish to the law. ",
            "\u00a0There was a good amount of listening comprehension. Because it was a big seminar (almost lecture), unless you wanted to talk a lot, you didn't have to. I contributed a good amount but still spent most of my time listening to the professor. I thought I would learn a lot more legal jargin but really didn't. ",
            "\u00a0I learned new vocabulary in Spanish, but I probably learned even more about the law. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to understand the basics of Legal Principles in Spanish. We applied them to everyday life and made what could have been very theory based very practical. ",
            "\u00a0I gained confidence in public speaking in another language and a wholistic understanding of the legal system not only in Latin America but in other places of the world. ",

            "\u00a0I learned basic legal principles while also practicing Spanish skills. ",

            "\u00a0You learn a pretty broad overview into a lot of legal topics. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish with particular focus on legal vocabulary and events. It primarily improved my writing skills in Spanish, and less so speaking/reading. ",
            "\u00a0Legal Spanish is a great course that explores interesting topics related to law, human rights, and current events -- and allows you to analyze those topics in Spanish. You develop greater conversational, writing, and legal skills. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I further developed my speech, comprehension, and writing in Spanish. Outside of that, I was given a unique perspective into basic level law concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of how the legal system functions in Spanish speaking countries, and I gained vocabulary relevant to these topics. "

            "\u00a0The course has a heavy emphasis on listening and reading comprehension, however if you're looking to improve speaking there aren't an extraordinary amount of opportunities to do so. It's more like a mini lecture than a seminar, so if that's what you're looking for, than this would be a good class. I felt that, unlike some L5 classes, Professor Carreras did a good job of making everyone feel comfortable in participating, even though the skill gap was very wide (some native speakers, some who hadn't spoken Spanish in a while). ",
            "\u00a0Mercedes Carreras prioritizes student learning and health; so, the class is on the easier side. You will definitely learn things, but do not expect this class to be the one that intellectually challenges you. The class should be a seminar and not a small class. The extra 20ish students hinders the ability to have nice group discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great opportunity to learn in a low stress environment. You really do expand your knowledge of legal concepts and get to test your ability to both learn new things and learn those new things in a new language. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Limited opportunities to improve speaking abilities since the class was a leminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think the main strength of the course is Prof. Carreras! She knows so much about the content, often tweaks the day's lessons to focus on current conversations about a legal issue, and makes sure that students are interested in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: lots of good information presented, relaxed classroom environment, interesting discussions\r\nWeakness: Half of the classes were taken up with student presentations which were not that interesting and difficult to engage with ",
            "\u00a0Should be a seminar! If youre anxious about speaking you can just sit in the back and not learn. Wish we spoke Spanish more! ",
            "\u00a0Very well taught course with reasonable expectations in terms of workload. I think it is a very good way to improve your written spanish, but if you are looking for a course with more emphasis on speaking, legal is not the one. ",
            "\u00a0The courses' strengths included the comprehensive approach to the application of the Spanish language to legal concepts. The course enabled me to read, write, listen to and speak Spanish, and rather than just a rudimentary practice of vocabulary and grammar, the course involved the application of this vital global language to pressing issues in our world. Furthermore, Professor Carreras is fantastic; she is extremely flexible, generous, kind and friendly. The courses' weakness is that there was limited exposure to direct legal text in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- it is a fun easy Spanish class. Mercedes is wonderful and so understanding about whatever is going on. You watch cool videos and exploere interesting topics in a different language. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses -- Because of its large size (Mercedes decided not to turn anyone away), noone had to stay engaged. It was easy to not show up or just not focus and meant that general participation went down ",
            "\u00a0The presentations were the best part of the class.  I wish that previous opportunities for structured student engagement had been available.  I also wish I had more opportunities to develop my spoken spanish ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the integration of real world events with the principles in the class, the assignment structure could be clearer at points, as the syllabus was abandoned early on and a new one was never really sent out. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the homework assignments that really improved my writing skills. Weaknesses include that the class was in such high demand I was afraid I would not get it. ",
            "\u00a0Mess of a class but the professor is a gem ",
            "\u00a0The class was super fun and engaging but I would have benefitted from more conversational Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reasonable workload, kind and engaging professor, interesting discussion of current events in latter part of the semester.\r\nWeaknesses: focus primarily on reading and writing (little speaking practice), class sometimes felt too big to facilitate maximum learning and discussion, deviated from syllabus and sometimes felt disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0More activities to improve oral Spanish skills ",
            "\u00a0strengths: \r\n*the professor is flexible and a pleasure to learn from\r\n*it is true to the level of language (you genuinely should be on a level 5 spanish to succeed)\r\n\r\nweakness: \r\n*there wasn't much connection to the material or depth to it ",
            "\u00a0This class is what everyone says it is: definitely interesting enough, but if you're here you need an L5 class credit and don't want to break your back getting one. I thoroughly enjoyed Mercedes and the class, even with a 9AM slot. ",
            "\u00a0A larger focus on speaking activities would make the course more well-rounded. Currently, however, the course is strong in including contemporary news. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Carreras is truly the most wonderful person, but the class could be smaller as well as have more discussion in order to be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in the sense that it gave opportunity to better speaking, comprehension, and writing in Spanish through a variety of different mediums. However, the course could be improved by making the actual content of the course more cohesive and by tying all the concepts back together before moving on. ",
            "\u00a0This class does a nice job of incorporating current events and news stories, and we had some really interesting discussions about these issues in class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if you're looking to learn about a new topic in Spanish, not necessarily if you're looking to improve your Spanish. It's very much a law class taught in Spanish, so if you're comfortable with that level of instruction, then yes. It was a very lowkey, interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it as a 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, as it is relatively low stress and Mercedes is such a kind person that you should get to know. However, if you are looking to challenge your spanish abilities and significantly improve, I don't know if this is the best class. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to someone who is interested in the subject material and would like to apply the Spanish language to the law and global legal issues. It is an excellent course to fulfill a language requirement in, especially for native Spanish speakers. It is not focused on the study of the language as much as on the law. Yale offers many courses that delve further into the language than Legal Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although your Spanish conversation might now improve ",
            "\u00a0Yes, a lot to learn and a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying law or anyone interested in the legal system. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was a fun way of improving listening skills in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student looking for a reasonable L5 course with interesting subject matter and a light workload. While there wasn't much speaking practice, this course is a good way to continue to expose yourself to Spanish and improve your aural and written skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, low workload so good for those taking many other hard courses ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd recommend! Careful, it's easy to get complacent and not come to class, but for what it's worth, I think you're much better off going to class than risking what is already a very safe class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially for those considering a career in law. At various points this semster, local positions related to translating (etc) were offered to students. For students looking to improve speaking or grammar skills in Spanish, this is not the class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Carreras is a gem, the workload is manageable, and the material is super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a fun course that serves as really good practice to keep up the Spanish language. Outside of that, the content itself is quite interesting and relatable. ",
