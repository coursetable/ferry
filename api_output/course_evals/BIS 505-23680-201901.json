There was absolutely no structure and no proper explanation on the fundamentals of statistics. The instructor just talks about whatever he wants to talk about. He'll start class by asking \"What do you want to know today?\" except HE should be the one telling us what we should know. Absolute waste of my tuition dollars. Labs are also not explained well and I took nothing away from this class. This course needs serious improvement as most of the datasets posted for labs are incorrect or have multiple errors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Simple concepts were explained more clearly in this course than Biostats I \r\n- Textbook in R was conducive for learning in lab\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- No real assessment before the final \r\n- Heavy weighting on the final (50%) \r\n- ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed applying course concepts in lab each week. This was an effective component of the course. I found the pace of the lectures to be too slow and this made me feel less engaged. I think that the course could be taught at a higher speed with more detail. ",

            "\u00a0A waste of tuition dollars. Professor Zelterman is a very nice man, but I am unclear why I am paying thousands of dollars in tuition to teach myself a course. Dr. Zelterman comes to class unprepared and basically rambles for an hour and twenty minutes. He has no idea on important course logistics (e.g. thought we had an extra week of classes when we did not). It was honestly a very poor class and I am embarrassed that this is being offered at an institution like Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was terribly unstructured and did not improve my knowledge of biostatistics. It felt as though we regressed in terms of difficultly and depth compared to biostatistics 1, which was fast-paced, challenging, and enriching. \r\n\r\nThe expected outcome of the course were simply being able to interpret the right situations to use different statistical tests and how to interpret the equations of various regression models. Labs were simply copy and pasting code with a few areas that required actual critical thought. \r\n\r\nIt is a shame that some departments are required to take this course, as it is not nearly up to par with other YSPH classes. I think that students in the past have not spoken up about the quality of this course because it is considered an \"easy Honors\". ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that this class was practical. There were weekly lab report that allowed us to apply our skills in R Studio. The code was often provided which put the focus on interpretation. I learned a lot from the labs. The lectures were a little less beneficial for me - there were no slides, just the professor writing under a projector. Sometimes it felt like the class lacked focus. It was hard to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lab reports are an excellent way to hone in the knowledge since they teach you how to interpret results and present them to the real world. They are also quite fun to do.\r\nWeaknesses: Course is slightly unorganized and laidback, we were supposed to have a final project that never ended up happening, there was a lot of confusion regarding the final too since this was the first year this class offered a final. ",

However, I'm not sure why the students are not very engaged and responsive in class. Also, the labs are a little repetitive. ",

I understand it is important to know the theory behind the statical analysis we perform, but I felt somewhat discouraged by the fact that we did not continue to gain tangible skills (e.g. coding). The lab reports allowed us to code a bit and think critically, and I truly found them to be amazing. As far as theory is concerned, the course did an amazing job at teaching it, but some more applied work would have been welcomed. ",

While the same material is covered more in depth in other courses, this course gives students a more in-depth understanding of these methods. I put a lot of effort into the weekly lab reports and I enjoyed choosing a problem and a dataset to work on for these lab reports. The TFs are incredibly competent and and helpful in office hours. I would suggest that in the future, the teaching team should provide students bigger and more recent datasets. A lot of the datasets for the class are very old and not well configured. I would also suggest giving students a term project where they choose a dataset of their own, form a research question, identify a method, and write a report on it. ",

It could have been helpful to be given access to the textbook prior to the start of the semester to better prepare for the topics covered. ",

Students have so much difficulty trying to figure out how to IMPORT the dataset and some of the datasets do not even make any sense. ",

            "\u00a0The failure of this course can be attributed to the instructor. \r\n\r\n1) Dr. Zelterman did not have his TF's selected until the second week of class. This delayed signing up for labs and finalizing our schedules. \r\n2) In lectures he would often says \"what do you guys want to talk about today?\" and he would often go off on a tangent, finish, and pause, apparently trying to think of what to talk about next. The lack of lesson planning was very evident and created an unproductive and irritating learning environment. \r\n3) Dr. Zelterman intentionally withheld information about a supposed \"Final Project\". He instructed TF's to not answer any questions about it and said that he would only answer questions about it in class. When asked about the assignment, he would respond \"well you should have come to class\" to those who attended regularly. \r\n4) On the last day of class he was supposed to \"collect\" the final project. Instead, he FORGOT THAT IT WAS THE LAST DAY OF CLASS AND NEVER COLLECTED IT. Another example of his lack of commitment to this class. \r\n\r\nUltimately, he was very bitter that the class had a low turn out and employed unfair tactics to try to incentivize attendance. If he wanted people to show up he should have 1) actually prepared a lecture or 2) made attendance mandatory. Instead he tried to manipulate students by withholding information about assignments, while simultaneously punishing students who actually showed up to class by not disclosing assignment information to them either.

His style of teaching may be a bit slow sometimes, but he really wants to make sure that students understand what is going on. I truly believe that he should be teaching biostats 1 as well since it is important to gain foundational knowledge from a good instructor.\r\nThis class helped me understand a lot of concepts that I could not grasp due to the problems surrounding biostats 1 last semester.

He didn't have TF's for the first two weeks of the course, would often open class by asking \"what do you want to learn today?\", and at the end of the semester didn't even know when the last day of classes was. I understand confusion with scheduling and what not, but I think the perceived lack of organization made students also never feel truly settled in the course or its expectations.

I thought that pace of the course was too slow and that I didn't gain as much as I wanted to. I would have liked to be challenged more. In other courses (epidemiology), topics related to biostatistics have come up and we haven't covered them (more about study designs, sampling, power, etc). I think that the curriculum across biostatistics/epidemiology should be more integrated to ensure students are learning what they need to (no gaps in the curriculum) and that courses reinforce topics, but have less overlap.
