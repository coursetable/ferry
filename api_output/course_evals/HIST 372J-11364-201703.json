            "\u00a0I learned how to use newspaper article in historical arguments.\r\nI learned how to better analyse primary sources to make \"different\" historical arguments.\r\nI learned about the struggle of Latin American people for independence.\r\nI learned about the extent to which the United States will go to defend its imperial interests.\r\n\r\nI learned to become a better listener. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a region that I didn't know much about before and about the sometimes infuriatingly ambiguous nature of revolution. ",
            "\u00a0Close analysis of primary sources, research methods, evaluation of arguments ",
            "\u00a0A thorough knowledge of the period and better reflection and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This is such a big question. I learned to think critically about the past, that mainstream historical discourse often serves a particular purpose that demands reexamination. Events are nuanced and as a historian, you need to look past flattened narratives to be able to appreciate all sides. I learned about the deeply complex history of U.S.-Latin American relations that continues to inform foreign policy today. Latin America has a rich and complicated history that deserves further recognition and study - I think everyone should have to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to critically engage with primary and secondary sources regarding the Cold War histories of Latin America. I learned how to parse the State Department/CIA sources from other native sources regarding the revolutions of the 20th century and the forced dichotomy between US interests and South American interests. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a wonderful overview of Latin America during the Cold War. I have left with a good understanding of the politics surrounding many different revolutionary movements. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a working knowledge of revolutions in several countries in Latin America during the second half of the twentieth century  and an understanding of why revolutions succeeded or failed and the criteria we should use to make those assessments. I also learned a ton about the politics of US involvement in Latin America, and the Cold War in general. Really, really useful  I feel like a better citizen and thinker because of it. "

            "\u00a0A lot of reading to get through some weeks, but overall it was really interesting and engaging. Professor Joseph was a great instructor and our class discussions were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredible professor, very well versed, generous with his time. Genuinely cares about his students. Very interesting material too. Course is well structured.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I wish more time had been spent on secondary literature. I feel like I don't really have a sense of the different scholarly debates that exist around the different issues we studied, and instead, we focused very narrowly on primary materials. ",
            "\u00a0This course has fascinating material and great readings and Professor Joseph is a wonderful professor and really allows us to take a nuanced approach to very controversial and complicated material. \r\n\r\nI think the class was a little bit too large this year to accommodate good discussions. Also, some of the units felt too quick. It was great to delve into Nicaragua, and I thought we could have spent more time on Chile. I also wonder if it would be worth including something on Guatemala, which felt like a conspicuous absence. In addition, at the end of the course, the reading got a bit heavy and it was difficult to keep track of it all. ",
            "\u00a0This course is brilliantly designed. The idea of having a couple students present background to the material that often summarizes the key points of the readings is something that should be implemented in every seminar, as it not only frames the discussion, but also emphasizes the takeaways Professor Joseph hopes for us to glean from the material. The journal, while somewhat stressful, was a great way to distribute the weight of the grading, and not induce an inordinate amount of stress around the final paper. Professor Joseph's advice with regard to the final paper made the process straightforward, especially helpful in it being my first undergraduate research paper. \r\n\r\nThere is very little that I'd recommend to improve the course. The couple of group activities we had (analyzing documents etc) were a great way to break up the usual routine, and maybe including a couple more of these activities would be effective. Additionally, maybe providing some readings about countries that we didn't focus on as a point of comparison would be helpful in forming a more complete understanding of regional politics. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Joseph is very knowledgeable and a wonderful teacher. Its cool to primarily engage in primary sources, but I do think I would have benefitted from more secondary sources since I was not so familiar with the histories of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0It was an amazing course, I learned so much and loved the reading. I also liked the distribution of assignments as a long course journal and final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely wish I could have spent more time on individual countries, but I suppose it's the nature of the course that you're surveying the continent. Other than that, deftly structured, excellent curation of readings, rich conversation. ",
            "\u00a0More time for discussion, and more structured history, not just historiography ",
            "\u00a0This course did a wonderful job covering the political aspects of revolutionary Latin America. However, I often felt that we could have learned more about the social aspects of revolutions. Additionally, I wish there was more background about Cuba because of its continued influence on other revolutionary movements. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredible professor who leads a seminar well, takes time to meet with each student, and has an impressive background in the issues. Really great diversity of readings, films, guest speakers, perspectives in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHonestly can't think of many weaknesses. At times there was more reading than I could reasonably keep up with, but that was also because of the schedule I'd taken. Might have been nice to have some more context for what was going on in the broader Cold War at the same time the events we discussed were taking place. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course!! Professor Joseph is so intelligent and leads very engaging discussions. His cares about his students and really loves the material. Interesting material, although a lot some weeks, but the movies were cool and I feel that I have gotten a new perspective on the Cold War and history of Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! What a fantastic way of learning about Latin America. ",
            "\u00a0This course is one of my favorites that I've taken at Yale to date. It is intellectual stimulating and forces you to look at 20th century Latin America in a whole new light, and you'll never be able to see it in the same way again. Even if you do not study politics, history, ER&M, LAST, etc., you should take this class. It covers a part of history that is not often recognized, and is incredibly valuable in order to understand a part of the world that, in the US, is often brushed over during the Cold War. ",
            "\u00a0A must take for anyone remotely interested in Latin America. Definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0This course gives a nuanced look at a very complicated period of history. It of course can only skim the surface, but it does so in a way that still feels productive. I would absolutely recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Please take this course if you can get in. It is a life changing experience that not only opens your eyes but opens your world to the possibilities of how to continue working on some of the issues addressed in the course. One of the BEST courses Yale has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in Latin America, revolutionary thought, non-European theaters of the Cold War and U.S. foreign policy/intervention, take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course. A Yale gem. Rich and complex, excellent readings, so deserving of study, and a wonderful professor incredibly willing to learn and engage along with his students. ",
            "\u00a0UNBELIEVABLE CLASS. Take it if you can!!! ",
            "\u00a0Cool course on a cool subject with a remarkable professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding the Cold War from the perspective of the Global South rather than through East West dynamics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend this class. I came in with little background in history, but Prof. Joseph is thoughtful, kind, knowledgeable, and engaged, and while the readings were really informative they were also rarely intimidating. We read from a wide variety of really interesting sources, and the different countries and revolutions we studied made for really interesting comparisons. I learned a ton from the other students in the class  everyone seemed to want to be there, and I always looked forward to seminar. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale. "
