            "\u00a0It was a great course for grappling with the mechanics of oil painting and composition on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to paint with oil paints. I developed my confidence with a paintbrush in my hand, I learned about basic composition, I learned about /how/ to use paint. I feel like I learned so much about painting!! ",
            "\u00a0Primarily basic oil painting. I learned a lot about still life painting and completing a single painting over a long period of time. ",
            "\u00a0I gathered knowledge of art history and painting technique, as well as style of expression and creativity. I developed skills in patience, dealing with new challenges, and technical ability to mix color and consistency. The insights I've developed are many. I've gathered insight on art appreciation and composition. I've gathered insight on creativity in addressing expectations and rationalizing the acceptance of results. An ideal product is something that we should strive for, but that we shouldn't hang our hat on. We must learn to accept things as they are. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great way to develop my voice as a painter, my skills manipulating paint itself, and my comfort as an artist. Taking the time to just paint for a few hours twice a week was a wonderful way to create space for that growth, and Rob's insights really helped the process along. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about abstract impressionism as well as improving my painting technique. I learned to consider the tension between objects and the relationship between the subject and its placement on the canvas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about painting in a whole new light and I developed my technique and style in a totally different direction. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to paint with oil paint on a wooden surface. ",
            "\u00a0How to thoroughly craft an oil painting ",
            "\u00a0I leaned so much about painting from this course, especially since I had never painted seriously before. We learned how to paint effectively with oil paints and how to construct an artistic composition using color. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to paint with oils and also about different styles of art and a variety of artists. ",
            "\u00a0I started off knowing nothing, so I learned quite a bit. I learned how to manipulate consistencies of paint. I learned how paint moves with different brushes and surfaces, to blend colors, to capture things not just as they are but with forethought of framing and composition, and how to learn from classmates and other painters. Essentially I learned how to paint and how to continue to paint even after the course finished. "

            "\u00a0It is a great studio course although more overview of the logistics and the materials (and how to use the materials) would have been useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great! Rob gives lots of individual instruction and not that much group instruction, which is really helpful. We were all painting to the same prompt but everyone produced such different results and that was totally okay. I love the way that painters of all varieties were encouraged in this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course does not take a lot of effort outside of class. In fact, it is really a hassle to go about getting access to the studio outside of class, so there is zero expectation that people will put outside time into the class. This is great if you want a low-stress class, but sort of hard if you want to continue to pursue painting outside of class. \r\nThe class has an emphasis on modernism and Robert Storr knows as an insane amount. It is a fun class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were attributable to Professor Storr and TA Clare, and the atmosphere of encouraging and delightful curiosity that they created. The day in the gallery was absolutely wonderful and hugely instructive. The time dedicated to exercises early on were necissarily tedious to convey the import of their method, and to force us to actually develop a method. I only wish that there was more time to paint and do critiques, and paint more. I didn't find any perceptible weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0While I very much enjoyed and appreciated the many abstract exercises we did in acrylic paint at the beginning of the course, I wish we had transitioned into oil painting and compositions of greater complexity earlier in the semester. The balance felt a bit off--it kind of felt like we were just getting started by the time the semester was over. ",
            "\u00a0We spent a long time doing very basic exercises at the beginning of the course and I think that period could have been shortened. I was a little disappointed with the number of finished paintings I ended up with. However, I did learn a lot and was inspired to continue doing oil paintings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the way in which the course was directed but also free and the way Rob spoke about art. I didnt think there were any weaknesses other than I wanted to have it more times in the week. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very relaxing and allowed us to learn how to paint according to our own level of experience and dexterity. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course, my favorite for the semester! Strengths: great professor, course dynamic was awesome; Weakness: costs ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses of this course- it was a fantastic learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that it went really slow in the beginning, and we did not start painting with oils until later in the semester. I wish that we had more chances to paint different types of still life paintings and more time with the models. ",
            "\u00a0The amount of time we spent painting was a definite strength as it allowed me to focus on painting and get a lot done without getting too exhausted. I found the full class time went by quick as I was so focused. It took a little while to finally start making compositions, so that could have happened sooner. The critiques were really helpful in moving forward as they were productive and not heavily weighted on the weaknesses of the painter. The addition of a TA to each class helped me get continual support throughout each session. "

            "\u00a0It is a great class to show up to and challenge yourself to meet your own standards. ",
            "\u00a0A must-take course. Basically you just get to go in and paint for 4 hours a week with help and direction and very little outside work. Rob is so kind and helpful and sees the good in most artistic styles, which is lovely... even beginners will come out of this class feeling good about themselves and wanting to pursue art. This is such a great class if you want something easy but incredibly rewarding to add to your schedule. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to people who wanted an art class without stress. I think I would tell painting majors to take the section with Molly instead of with Robert Storr. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is a top course taught by a top instructor at the top art school in the country. You simply cannot do better than Robert Storr as a painting instructor. The discipline that is insisted upon is enormously useful in learning about the practice, the history, and yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I had a lot of fun and I would recommend this class to someone who has never painted before or has little experience because it is designed to introduce you to the basics of oil painting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over any course I have taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Definitely take this course if you have the chance. You will learn a lot about painting and about your trends as an artist. Just beware, the material can be quite pricey. ",
            "\u00a0One of my absolute favorites! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomend this course to someone who is interested in learning how to paint and in art. The opportunity to learn from Professor Storr in particular was an honor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great intro to painting. ",
            "\u00a0Take this whether you are an experienced painter or a novice. I learned quite a bit from knowing nothing and plan to continue painting as I came to really enjoy the little things in the process. The classmates that seemed far more advanced than me went at their own pace and seemed to take away lessons from each composition, even though they were at a higher level. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and looked forward to it every week. "
