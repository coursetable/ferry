It felt really powerful to understand the way that experts are making models like this. I also got the opportunity to use some powerful R code, but I had to work through a lot of it on my on, I am not sure how much of that knowledge will translate to other opportunities and applications.

            "\u00a0Strengths of the course: very flexible and casual, and had lots of different perspectives about global biodiversity. I really liked all of the different topics and guest lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: because of the flexible structure, there was conflicting information about what was required for students. On the first day of class, we were told all we had to do was usually show up to class. Partway through the course, we received an email saying that attendance and participation was part of our grade. We also then had two homework assignments (which were good assignments), which were a little unexpected. I also would have liked a little more R code and statistical topics to discuss methods.\r\n\r\nThe homework assignments were actually really good, and I learned the most from the classes where we had assignments because I went through and had to understand the code and interpret the output. I really liked the homework assignments, and if I were to take the course again I think I would actually prefer a couple more assignments (as long as we knew ahead of time that there would be homework, so we could plan accordingly). \r\n\r\nI wished some of the R coding sessions were a little more rigorous, and a little more structured. I didn't get much out of the R workshops where we were just given the code and told to go through it ourselves. I know that there were varying levels of computer programming experience, so I don't know what a better way would have been, but I think I would have liked a little more instruction and more help going through the code, instead of just running it individually while in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered an important chance to engage with experts in remote sensing and biodiversity change, but sometimes the large groups that were not part of our class made it difficult to get the right kind of learning environment. For example, many of our R workshops were open to the public and had people who were much more ahead of us than the average student in our class. The questions they asked and speed at which they worked made some of us feel confused and like we had little to offer. On the same note, when experts came to speak to the department it was incredible that that was incorporated into our class, but attending the seminar didn't give us a real chance to engage with the speaker beyond being part of the crowd.
