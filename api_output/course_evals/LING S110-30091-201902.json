            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that it is lecture and reading based which makes it easier to understand the lectures because the reading is basically the same thing and if you need more examples, there are examples in the book. Office hours were great, scheduled perfectly. Perhaps a weakness could be that problem sets and language assignments were at times due at the same date. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would because it was fascinating! This course is about language and how we produce and use it, how is that not fascinating? If this student is bilingual I would recommend it more because it makes you think twice about the letters and phrases you unconsciously say. It also makes you pay attention to your surroundings more as you are more attentive to the place of articulation of your tongue in your mouth and the phrases others say with different dialects/accents. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Because this course was highly helpful for anyone interested in linguistics. He will benefit a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a fast-paced introduction class and I learned a lot. "
