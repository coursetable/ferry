            "\u00a0I continued learning Spanish, through speaking, listening, reading and writing. My grammar and vocabulary continued to improve - slowly but surely. ",
            "\u00a0This course was intense and quick, but gave me the skills necessary to use Spanish in real contexts and understand cultures, conversations, and literature that was previously inaccessible. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my speaking, comprehension, and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish to the extent that I feel confident communicating with native Spanish speakers in a variety of settings. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are the professors, the syllabus and textbook, the readings, grammar lessons, and truly almost everything. I don't think I really saw any weaknesses, everything worked well to help deepen and broaden my understanding of Spanish! ",
            "\u00a0This course was engaging and included plenty of information and grammar practice, although I wish we read more Latin American literature and had more time to discuss the culture and traditions surrounding the language. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was how much we spoke out loud in class. Almost every exercise involved talking with partners or in groups which really helped me to feel more comfortable speaking Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0This course placed emphasis on expanding vocabulary while focusing on some new grammatical techniques, which I felt was an effective way to bring students rapidly up to a more advanced level. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course does a great job of reinforcing the core grammar concepts taught through in-class activities and online homework. I think having more opportunities to not only practice our spanish with other students, but other native speakers could enhance our learning experience. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking to increase both your vocabulary and understanding of Spanish grammar. "
