            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of how to use basic tools and machinery in the wood shop. I gained insight into different processes involved in wood sculpture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to operate power tools and critique sculpture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of hands-on skills including all of the woodshop tools (table saw! band saw! planar! belt sander! jigsaw! etc!) as well as willow working and carving. Also, as this was my first art class at Yale I learned a lot about formal (and informal) critiques, and how to be introspective about my own creative work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to comment on other people's art. I also learned how to use a bunch of different tools in the fabrication shop (kind of) but it was trial-and-error so don't expect to develop an expertise unless you really throw yourself into it and ask for a lot of help. ",
            "\u00a0basic woodworking, structure of artistic critique, thinking about sculpture ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great way for me to get comfortable fabricating in the woodshop! also helped build my spatial awareness when making sculptures. ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course. I gained knowledge in many facets of wood sculpture and design. I gained familiarity with a wide variety of tools and equipment and wood sculpture and carpentry techniques. "

            "\u00a0Very engaged teacher and TA. Sometimes it felt like there could have been a little more direction, but other than that I can't think of any weaknesses. Overall a very interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we'd had a big checklist of woodworking techniques to work through throughout the semester, just so we could make sure not to lean on the same old stuff. Very strong support from staff though! ",
            "\u00a0Only weakness was I wish I could have made more projects ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Tubergen and our TA Nic were extremely generous with their time trying to help us accomplish whatever we wanted to create. Also cool workshops. \r\nWeaknesses: Very self-driven, did not look at other artists' work together or discuss different kinds of sculpture or styles of making.\r\n\r\nThe course could have been improved by having two rather than one small introductory assignments (e.g. making a cube) to get us further acquainted with the actual joinery and woodworking. seemed like it devolved into glueing and \"placing\" things on top of other things pretty quickly for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Very strong, liberating and low pressure course. I could have done with a few more of those specialized workshops though. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course could be improved if there were more time spent looking at art and artists who work with wood or just in sculpture more generally. ",
            "\u00a0I have this same complaint with nearly every art class, but I think it should be more rigorous and move more quickly. It is difficult to ask that of an intro-level course, though. It was rigorous considering the background of the students, I'm sure. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could have talked more about the projects before delving into them and had discussions about relevant artists of texts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were in the flexibility and freedom within the projects. While we were given certain topics for each assignment, we could interpret these topics in a very broad sense. This allowed for creativity and independent thinking and expression. \r\n\r\nAlso, learning about to the tools and equipment was really great. \r\n\r\nI do not think this course could be improved in any way. It was really great! "

            "\u00a0Definitely, if you like hands-on skills and don't mind getting covered in sawdust. Definitely would not recommend if you already have a pretty full schedule/won't be able to devote a lot of time outside of class to work on projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- if you have time to put into exploring the woodshop and your opportunities for making things, you will get a lot out of it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! We had a really wonderful TA and Elizabeth is such a dream to get to work with. She thinks about wood in really exciting ways. I would most definitely recommend this course to any other student interested in thinking about and exploring sculpture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was fun and engaging in a unique way. I learned a lot of \"hard\", practical skills as well as more intellectual lessons regarding art making and viewing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone looking to get a better understanding of wood sculpture, I would highly recommend this course. "
