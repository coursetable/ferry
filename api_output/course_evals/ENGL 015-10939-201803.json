            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze texts and situate myself within a larger context of international writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned as much as I could in one semester about South African writing after apartheid, of the complexities of multiple kinds of identities including race, socioeconomic class, and sexuality, in South Africa and its people after apartheid. I learned about how fiction, although not reality, can also portray a truth that non-fiction and the news often cannot portray. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to analyze texts better and how to use research with literary analysis to construct a unique argument in an essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about apartheid in a wonderfully creative way, much better than any history textbook. The selection of books was carefully chosen to ensure a variety of perspectives, both in terms of race (we read from the perspective of English, Afrikaner, and black South Africans) and literature (we read fiction, magical fantasy, and reporting/non fiction) . This course also taught/used deep literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0It's a niche topic with broad relevance and something to be gained by anyone. The in depth understandings of post-colonial literature, South African cultural history, and literary theory that I gained are invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I learned a great deal about South Africa (considering I knew next to nothing at the beginning) and I also felt like I developed my insightful reading and writing skills. We discussed literature that we read in great detail, delving much deeper into these novels than when I read them by myself so it made the class very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was truly able to gain a better global understanding of literature. I think that studying South African literature before, during, and after apartheid allowed me to question a lot of my values as a person, as well as made me view things from an intersectional and non westernized perspective. I also think that this course really helped me to better myself at literary analysis, as well as writing in a clear and concise manner. ",
            "\u00a0Great understanding of the history and impact of Apartheid, and the way literature reflects that history. Continue to develop writing skills, especially over longer word counts than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of apartheid and how social, political, and economic issues shape and are shaped by literature in South Africa. "

            "\u00a0This class was engaging from start to finish. The books were all interesting. There was A LOT of reading, so it was hard to keep up. In addition, the material is very intense (many books deal with issues of violence and rape). I think reducing the number of books we read could improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was in its diversity and multitude of texts, from which we were able to cover many different themes present in the South African canon. This also may have been a weakness--sometimes, there wasn't enough time to go into the novels completely during our discussions. If there was more time to discuss, or less texts read, it may have aided us in our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing and she is very willing to meet with students outside of class. She also takes students' wellbeing into account which is very kind and makes them feel comfortable enough to approach her with questions and to speak up in class. The books are all very good but very emotionally draining. I only wish this class were constructed a bit more like other English classes where we submitted more versions of our essays to receive more consistent feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--engaged, friendly, insightful teacher, good book selection, discussions mostly engaging (when people generally read/enjoyed the book, were amazing!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses--sometimes discussions were dry/dominated by a few people, also could be a little abstract ",
            "\u00a0This course was well-rounded and fascinating. Professor Newell put us on the spot, and the entire class period was discussion. There were times when I felt Professor Newell could have been more forthcoming with her expertise. Her style is rather hands off during discussions, but her comments on essays were thorough and instructive. ",
            "\u00a0The reading workload was a lot as we read almost a novel a week but I found the discussions very engaging and the professor was awesome! ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course was truly amazing, as well as helpful in terms of bettering my writing. I think that this course also forced me to get better at reading to understand quickly. However, I did feel as though sometimes I was forced to read a lot of emotionally tolling material, which may have been uncomfortable, but also allowed me to gain endurance as a reader. ",
            "\u00a0Great breadth of content and really engaging discussions. Some of the reading was a little lengthy, which made it tough to keep up on *some* weeks but overall really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the class looks at history and literature not as two separate things but as working in tandem and this is reflected in the works we read and what we talked about in the seminar. A weakness in my opinion is students in the class all pretty much had the same opinions on things so I felt like a lot of ideas were very repetitive and I didn't learn as much as I could have. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! It was a fantastic way to get exposed to writing that I would not have necessarily pursued on my own time. Steph was an excellent professor and helped guide the class through difficult and intellectually challenging discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this courses to any student. The opportunity to learn about the South African literary canon specifically doesn't often arise, and I think is something everyone should do. Learning about literature that comes from a country where everything is volatile and upside-down because of its past is, I think, very important. As long as the student is engaged, it is an amazing class. The workload in terms of essays isn't much (~three, 4-6 page essays) but we went through a book (often at least 200 pages long) a week, so it was a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would 100% recommend this course to another student because it taught me so much about South Africa and also helped me appreciate how writers write. It was very interesting taking into account the political climate the authors grew up in, their histories, theorists' readings of the texts, and my own literary analysis in constructing an argument and trying to better understand the text. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! ",
            "\u00a0100%, great class with an even better teacher. Was by far the best english class I've taken in my life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, students in any area of study haves something to gain from this course. A fantastic introduction to the Yale English Department. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought it was a very engaging freshman seminar where you can learn a lot about South African writing and the country itself while also getting a great introduction to just writing papers and reading books in college in general. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, mainly because it helped to both better my writing as well as my ability to comprehend literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. great discussion sections along with great instruction in regards to a very important subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its a really interesting seminar that helps introduce you to college level writing and analysis and I think it greatly improved my ability to think critically about texts and draw on many sources when I write. "
