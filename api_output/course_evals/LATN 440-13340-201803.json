            "\u00a0I definitely developed a greater knowledge of and appreciation for Roman friendship and Roman history. You will truly begin to re-evaluate friendships in your own life by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I got much better at actually thinking about what the text means and argues as opposed to simply how it is translated. ",
            "\u00a0This class fused a traditional English class and a language one - learning how to analyze Latin texts as if they were part of a literature or philosophy course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about friendship in the ancient world through letters between Roman authors. Our study of ancient friendship not only revealed the workings of Roman society and politics but also how we may philosophically approach dealing with our own friends today. This course also greatly improved my ability to read Latin straight from the text and to compare the philosophies of ancient authors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to write essays more clearly ",
            "\u00a0I definitely became better at translating Latin through the sheer amount of material we went through, and my vocabulary set increased. I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed reading the Roman authors' views of friendship. Many of them are still relevant and timely, so our discussions were more engaging than I initially expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me improve my Latin translation skills, as well as my ability to read and think critically about ancient texts. ",
            "\u00a0Thinking about Roman friendship ",
            "\u00a0I certainly became more comfortable translating Latin, but the real strength of the course is that I spent all semester thinking about friendship. Its not something we tend to think about very seriously, and I think my thoughts about friendship actually grew and changed because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course allows you to practice Latin translation skills. It also develops essay writing skills and skills for the analysis of literature. "

            "\u00a0Professor Solodow is such a kind soul and a wonderful teacher, but if you do not feel comfortable with your Latin, DON'T TAKE THE COURSE. He moves so fast and if you can't keep up, you will fall behind. Just be sure of your own Latin skills before signing up because there's no turning back halfway through if you need the language credit. ",
            "\u00a0This course is about a super interesting topic. Great readings/authors. I wish we they could've been a bit shorter/fewer, though, so that we could spend more time talking through and translating each one. ",
            "\u00a0More interesting secondary readings and more creative projects. More philosophy would have been good. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the variety of Roman authors (Cicero, Seneca, Horace and Pliny). This course was as much a deep dive into literature as into Latin. We even read from modern authors like Montaigne and Ben Johnson, who complemented our ancient understanding of friendship very well. Professor Solodow was absolutely fantastic. He brought a sense of humor, energy, and passion when engaging with the texts that made every day of class enjoyable.\r\nIn the future, I think that the class may benefit from an instructional workshop on how to write essays drawing from Latin texts. The essays were sometimes difficult to write, but by the end of the course, my writing and analytical abilities greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0No midterm after fall break, it should be before fall break. More guidance on literary translations ",
            "\u00a0I think the amount of material covered was a bit too much, as Professor Solodow removed some assignments and I still felt like I didn't have enough time to get it all done before the next class. We usually ran out of time before we could translate it all in class, so by the end of the semester we would only go over sections we had questions on (and I think this system worked better). My biggest problem was the vocab, because we read from several different authors and each had a different vocab set, so it was hard to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0This class offers a wide variety of authors and texts and is a great class for prospective Classics majors. Professors Solodow really encourages students to think critically about society and relationships in ancient Rome and is extremely knowledgeable and excited about the subject. Sometimes the translation homework and readings were too long to thoroughly discuss the material in class and to really think about each text we translated. ",
            "\u00a0Too much homework but otherwise well organized ",
            "\u00a0I think the main weakness of the course was the amount of time we spent on translation. Because we didn't review much grammar or vocabulary, Professor Solodow ensured that we reviewed the translations of most of the readings in class so that we were all on the same page. However, going over these translations did not actually improve my ability to read Latin, so the time spent could have been better used to discuss the ideas contained in the readings. I thought the readings themselves were well-chosen in that they represented a broad range of views on friendship and contained many interesting ideas; I just wish that more engaging discussions on the readings could have occurred in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course has a lot of translation, so you get a lot of practice. The seminars kind of fall flat because they are mostly just students providing translations. "

        [
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you like Latin and can translate it well. I'm serious. If you only feel okay, I would do an L4 or L3. Roman Friendship is fascinating but not for those only loosely confident in their own Latin abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Prof. Solodow is incredible. He has such great insights and brings humor and kindness into the class. He gives very thorough feedback, too, and is always willing to help with any issues. The course itself is super interesting. Roman friendship is a topic that doesn't really get talked about much in traditional Latin courses, so it was very interesting to study. Take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Depends on their interest level in the material. I would urge them to take a more focused, less survey like class if the topic of friendship did not genuinely interest them. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course to another student. This class allows you to engage with classical authors and a topic of universal importance in a seminar style. Professor Solodow is a master of Latin and literature. It was a pleasure to learn from such a kind and knowledgeable professor. ",
            "\u00a0No, I think the workload was excessive ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for those really wishing to get better at translating, and especially if their vocabulary skills are already strong. Taking this after four years of high school Latin, I found the speed at which we needed to translate difficult, and can pretty confidently say this was the class I spent the most time on. It is an L5 class though, so a pretty difficult workload is somewhat implied. ",
            "\u00a0I would! Professor Solodow is very helpful and knowledgeable, and the material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Good bridge course ",
            "\u00a0I was not a fan of the structure of the class. Much of the benefit could have been derived without the actual seminar. The sessions more or less seemed to simply be the professor checking that the students were doing the translations. "
