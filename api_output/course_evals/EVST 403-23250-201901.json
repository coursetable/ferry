            "\u00a0From this class, I received a greater understanding of the development of East Asian cities over the last 100 plus years. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about East Asian cities, but also their culture and architecture. I was exposed to so many different disciplines besides history and overall it was an amazing learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0A diverse set of histories focusing mainly around Japan, China, and Korea. Useful to learn how to analyze sources, and interpret a wide variety of sources surrounding a subject. Differing interpretations of contested periods of history was emphasized. ",
            "\u00a0Insights - This was an excellent course. At the core, it taught us to question the urban in our interconnected cities and the methods and systems by which this is constructed. Michaels fantastic readings equipped us to understand the nuanced complexity of various different geopolitical situations, contexts, economic forces, and social tensions that drive the formation of East Asian cities. As we moved into the research part of the course, this questioning in turn served as a foundation to construct a personal vision of these forces in a particular East Asian city. Socratic seminars allowed us to question the narratives we create about cities, infrastructure, and the role of governments. Michael was a fantastic, insightful, and devoted mentor through the class. He led us to nuanced insights on participatory politics, the role of migrants, the idea of culture, and what it meant to urbanize or modernize in this part part of the world. \r\n\r\nSkills - Michael was an effective, devoted, funny, engaging, and brilliant shepherd through the course. From the get-go, he took a deep and vested interest in training students to read complex historical docs/arguments efficiently, ranging from readings about the art of reading to in-class discussions on best practices. He never came across as overly pedagogical or antiquated: rather, he lent a fresh perspective to each lesson. Most impactfully, he carefully helped each of us develop complex arguments, teaching us to situate questions in their urban context. His three-pronged research project was one of the most well-executed project Ive encountered at Yale, enabling amateurs at history to gradually level up their skills and combine primary, secondary, and historiographical arguments into a project. Creating our work with his support was an excellent experience. I was in awe of Michaels open-mindedness, ability to grasp what each of us was going for, and his passion for each of our subfields and work. \r\n\r\nKnowledge - Background on urban network theory, transnationality theory, and ways of visualizing and contextualizing cities. History on role of treaty ports, migration, and cultural exports in developing cities. Lots of rich context on oft-overlooked populations including women, modern women, migrants, sex workers, native islander populations, etc. Lots of cool anecdotes and history about the role of media, art, and cultural representation, and how this tied to larger ideas such as the development of a modern public and the relation with developing forms of governance and statehood. Different forms of media  video, images, magazines  lent a texture and immediacy that was surprising and unique. Can we have music, too?! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about city development, migration, and urban planning. The course helped me improve my ability to aggregate information from a wide array of sources and synthesize conclusions from that disparate information. ",
            "\u00a0How to think like a historian ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent class to learn about the nuances of academic writing while serving as an introduction many issues in Eastern Asia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the development of cities, as well as the challenges posed to cities as they experienced modernity and globalization "

            "\u00a0There were honestly no weaknesses for me. There is a good amount of reading, but it wasn't anything that cannot be handled. Professor Thornton is also an amazing teacher and person, making the class extremely enjoyable! ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of ground without ever going in depth. You will leave knowing specific case studies, but not with a complete history of one city as there is a lack of continuity through the course. The readings are all engaging and allow you to approach each theme from different angles. The weeks spent on planning were probably the most informative and gave me the most to think about, but I felt that these should have been followed by readings covering experiences on the street. The class could have benefitted from spending more time on the people, and therefore perhaps more anthropological sources, but Michael generally selected great readings that worked well together without too much overlap. \r\nThe assignments for this course are very open and student-directed. One difficulty is that you pick the area you would like to focus on in the beginning of the course before you have engaged with much material. While it is possible to change the topic of your final paper throughout the course, I felt a little lost at the beginning and struggled finding direction for the first two assignments. ",
            "\u00a0At times in the beginning, the seminar discussions tended toward the unstructured, meaning some important readings would go un-discussed. Perhaps some of the earliest readings, while useful and fundamental to the analysis in the course, were too conceptual to be really appreciated until later on in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Michaels fantastic selection of readings, which were diverse, eye-opening, and really ground you in a range of angles on the discipline. We hopped between social theory, governance, economic studies, war, and back  I loved the balance between readings, discussion, and creative work (essays/project). Each week, I was shocked at the variety and the nuance of articles: no reading ever felt superfluous (in my opinion), or black/white. They created a spectrum from which we began our studies. \r\n\r\nThe interplay between theory < > creating/writing was also very strong. Discussions were launched effectively from the first minutes each class   Michael has a knack for choosing fantastic probing questions, and put SO much effort into reading pre-class discussion posts and pulling out productive kernels. He tried different methods of getting sometimes-reticent students to engage, such as grouping us for 15 minutes at the start. \r\n\r\nHe was critical in inventive and constructive ways as you moved into your essays: he has an ability to distill your key arguments, always asking what are you most interested in? how can you connect the dots between your ideas? how does this tie to __ theory? He doesnt try to redirect you into his own opinions: rather, he seeks to help you become inventive and fruitful in your own. \r\n\r\nThere was a beautiful class visit to the Beinecke, and I so appreciated the effort Michael put into selecting gorgeous, insightful, inventive pieces for viewing, ranging from Olympic materials to gargantuan, ancient, table-sized hand-drawn maps! \r\n\r\nMichael put a lot of effort into hearing different voices. Hed group students for early discussions to try and get quieter voices to speak up, and hed make nods to various folks pre-discussion posts. Michael even launched the semester with a brief roundtable discussion on what it meant to have bias and how to hear different perspectives. \r\n\r\nI think the three best things about the class were the (1) readings/media Michael chose (2) the really fun project and his guidance throughout. The projects were really great. They pushed me to think in ways I was unfamiliar with, and I finally learned to write an historiographical comparison! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I dont honestly feel theres much to complain about. This was one of the most well-structured, focused, and complete classes Ive taken at Yale. I do wish Michael lectured a tiny bit more often, because he has a wealth of knowledge Id have loved to tap into outside of office hours. Even the overview history slides were great. Perhaps there could be one real lecture a semester, on a topic that the present cohort voted on from Michael fields of work / found most interesting. One of my favorite things about being at Yale is learning about the work of experts like Michael  it really instills students with an awe for what is possible and what a career in this might look like! I never plan to go into historical research, yet, a lecture on Michaels book would have helped me grab out some highly-developed insights to apply to my own work in urban theory. I feel like we could learn so much from how *Michael* structures his own research and work, and would have loved to tap in. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I guess many students were reticent to share, detached, or didnt complete all the readings. This wasnt Michaels fault, I figure this is a common challenge. Not sure what to do about it, perhaps as the reputation of the course grows, there will be more, dedicated students next round! Maybe more kinds of media (music?!) would have made it feel like there was something for everyone... even though I already felt this was true! \r\n\r\nFinal small note. Not a big complaint, but Yales library is weak on many Southeast Asian cities. This was unexpected, and I had to turn to online resources of Southeast Asian publications, magazines, cities! Knowing this earlier would have helped my research get off to a more expedient start. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course did a good job orienting students with a wide array of information. I think it could be improved by introducing more thematic structure so students can more easily connect the things we learn. ",
            "\u00a0There was a TON of (often very dense) reading for this class. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar was well facilitated by the professor and readings were interesting. Perhaps more lectures in East Asian history that might be more obscure for those not familiar. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of material is covered in one semester. Maybe focus on less? "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It has been probably one of my favorite classes at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. While the class does generally take a historical approach, it pulls from other disciplines in interesting ways and allows a lot of freedom. You definitely get more out of it the more you put in, as the assignments are super broad. While you will not leave with a complete history of East Asian cities, the format of this class provides you with a dozen different frameworks through which to study cities. ",
            "\u00a0A broad-reaching course that can be a good launching-off point for further research. There is a lot of latitude to fit the class around your own academic interests, so some prior work in the field is probably useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, would absolutely recommend! Take this course for an engaging, multifaceted dive into the history of East Asia. Youll find surprising insights about places youve only heard about in the news. Youll be immersed in the rich contexts and funny anecdotes that have made these cities into the powerhouses they are. Id recommend that you push yourself, actually do the readings (which Michael has selected really well), and ask bold, brave questions. Our world is changing rapidly. How will these cities respond? What do their histories say about the future of global interaction? How are governments and marginal populations evolving? How will urbanism respond? Try your best to prepare your interest areas for your first meeting with Michael. Youll have the chance to dive deep into a subject of your choice. Choose something that you LOVE, and youll be able to throw yourself into it with passion and learn a lot from Michaels guidance. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it provides a window into a really interesting topic that does not get a lot of attention here at Yale. I would also recommend this class because I learned a lot of skills and information that are applicable to a diverse set of topics, even though the scope of the course is rather narrow. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was an amazing introduction to East Asian studies that was rigorous and constantly bringing up new topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the material and the discussions in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class, lots of reading, amazing professor (very knowledgeable) "
