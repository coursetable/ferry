I learned a great deal not only about West African material cultures, but also about European Enlightenment-era discourse, African history, the diverse cultures of the Black Atlantic, and histories of collecting and museums, among many other topics. I was impressed by the breadth and variety of material that Prof. Fromont was able to cover in a single semester. "
