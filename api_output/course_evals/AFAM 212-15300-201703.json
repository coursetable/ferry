            "\u00a0We worked a lot on archival research skills developed through studying Black literature in the Beinecke's holdings.  It was really helpful both to learn about different databases to use for research, and to practice researching a published text through archival holdings. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this amazing class! I learned a lot about how to use the archives and how to incorporate them into research and scholarship. And I also learned so many cool things just from looking at the archives! ",
            "\u00a0A great background in archival research. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of how to do research in archives, kinds of materials that can be found in an archive (Beinecke in particular). Studied work of a lot of great African-American writers. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed students access to Beinecke archives and developed students' skills in bridging archival research and analytical thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the archives we used, and about the act of creating archives and learning through archives. I didn't have a ton of prior experience with African American literature, and this class not only proved a novel way to immerse myself in a new genre, but taught ways of thinking and approaching material that are applicable outside this specific topic. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is so unique because it is hosted right by all of the materials that are of interest to it, and so it really makes you think about the people behind the books you read in other classes.  I think it would be useful for this class to work even more in the archives than it does now, and spend less time on published works, but that's only because of the short amount of time we had in class. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class--it was so fun! Looking at the archives in class was so helpful because we got a chance to explore and learn about what was available! ",
            "\u00a0Students read great texts in the African American literary canon. More archival assignments would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0High reliance on the archive -- does a wonderful job of showcasing all of the cool materials we have at Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0The course offered students a chance to work with archives on a regular basis and helped students develop skills in selecting and incorporating primary sources into critical and analytical arguments. Also, Melissa is such an incredible professor!\r\nThe only weakness was that there wasnt enough time in class to get to everything, which was not really a problem with the class but rather that there was too much amazing material (both in terms of the novels we read and the archives we looked through). ",
            "\u00a0I think that the premise of this course is fantastic; I really hope that Melissa can teach it again, and that other professors will follow her lead and offer classes like this one focusing on different subjects. This was a great way to gain familiarity both with a specific archive and with archives in general. \r\n\r\nOur discussions were definitely most interesting when they were tied to what we were looking at in the archive; the portion of the seminar in which we discussed the texts as separate from the archive (as one would in any other English seminar) generally fell short, and often felt a bit didactic. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the class was definitely independently researching and writing the final paper, and I do think that the class as a whole set me up well for that process. One of our assignments was to use the finding aid to identify something we would like to see in the clippings file, and that ended up being how I picked my focus for the final. I also ended up talking about my subject's relationship to other writers and artists who we studied in the course, in ways I definitely wouldn't have without the work we did throughout the semester. \r\n\r\nI think that more assignments like the clippings file one would be great. During class we generally looked at boxes that Melissa had picked, and often pulled up the finding aid while doing so to see how one would go about finding them. While this did have the benefit of ensuring that the boxes we worked with in class were good ones, I think there's a huge benefit to having to face a finding aid yourself and pick something, and then work with whatever you picked. It makes the process of doing research independently later on less daunting; it would also let certain seminar meetings be more student driven in terms of the material being discussed and the reason for discussing it. It could be done in the same manner as the clippings file assignment, with everyone looking at different boxes on different subjects that they chose on certain days and then sharing their findings. Alternatively, it could be formatted as more of a project, in which a student (or group of students) picked a series of folders, say, that they wanted the whole class to focus on, and perhaps then led the discussion based on a bit of preliminary research. I think this would be a cool format later in the semester especially. \r\n\r\nOne other thought- while we did some secondary reading (Rampersad, for instance), it would have been cool to have focused some time on the archives as the source material for such works: looking, for example, at a passage from Rampersad, and the materials he sites, and thinking about how he arrived at the claims he makes about Hughes. I think that this reverse process would have been both interesting and helpful in preparing for the final paper. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Melissa is great, and the class never ever felt boring or useless, it always felt like a fun exploration into African American history and literature through looking at the stuff that people really held and wrote. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested! I loved looking at all the cool stuff in the archives--I learned so much! And the syllabus is fantastic. Melissa is also so great--she is passionate about what she is teaching and always available to meet if you have questions! I really enjoyed this class and wish I could take it again! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn a lot and get to use an excellent Yale resource. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class! Melissa is fantastic, and has carefully curated the reading list to play to both Beinecke's and her strengths. Good mix of discussion of the texts and diving into the archival materials we have available. Very reasonable workload, though the final paper can sneak up on you. Make sure you meet with Melissa in advance to hone your thinking about it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This class was one of the best Ive taken at Yale. Its so rare to have such extensive exposure to archives in Beinecke while in a seminar discussion with an incredible professor. I would definitely recommend the class, especially if Melissa is teaching it, because she really made it a unique experience. Her knowledge and insights as well as encouragement of students made the class engaging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really great class and a wonderful way to delve into the resources of the Beinecke. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The books/poems/plays we read were all great and every week we looked at archival materials that had to do with whatever we'd read. It was an exciting experience and very different (in a good way) from the other English classes I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great opportunity for anyone looking to become more familiar with archival work, and to have the experience of immersing themselves in a specific collection. The discussions in my section were not the most exciting, but there was a lot of room for independent work (especially in the final project) and the opportunity to spend a portion of every class with some really incredible archival materials was amazing.
