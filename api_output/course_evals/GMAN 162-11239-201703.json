            "\u00a0I came into this course following the L3/L4 intensive in Germany really looking forward to continue my German. However, the class was definitely not designed to cater to language skills development. Many of the students were native speakers and controlled nearly all discussion. Additionally, the class structure seemed to break down about 3 weeks in and we were just give presentations and group projects that took up all our classes. As such, very little information was covered and what was supposed to be a German class became a powerpoint formatting class. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an insight of the social and personal life of the time before the second world war, which I was unaware of before. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course exposes you to a number of the political and cultural themes that defined Germany's transition from the Kaiserreich to the Weimarer Republik. However, the course itself is not an over-arching exploration of the history, so if you don't know much about the history, you might need to read up on it first. However, you do get to look at more of the specifics of the eras ",
            "\u00a0Was a good way to keep up with German, although I expected to learn more about the class topic. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to speak, read, and write german at a proficient level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the history leading up to world war 2 in Germany and the cultural tides through these time periods. Also, i expanded my vocabulary and grammar in the German language. "

            "\u00a0There was some interesting material discussed in class, but overall, the course was pretty disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0The class really needs to adhere to the syllabus. Less focus on presentations and more focus on readings, papers, and in-class discussion ",
            "\u00a0The small size of the course was a strength of this course. But sometimes it seemed that the syllabus was too packed to deal with topics in sufficient depth. ",
            "\u00a0The course makes a good use of a diversity of sources (films, graphic novels, art etc.) but it would definitely be even better if we could read short stories or novels - this would definitely help with german acquisition. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-The course covers an interesting period of history that not many people get to learn about\r\n-It allows you to go in-depth on a certain period of history as opposed to learning broadly about a much longer period\r\n-You get to read some literature about and from the period\r\n-You get to choose the specific area you study for your final project\r\n-Good feedback on essays\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Very disorganized class. Often times it was unclear what assignments were due and when.\r\n-Doesn't really push you as a speaker  didn't feel like my german improved over the course of the semester.\r\n-Especially for a small class, the level of engagement was very low. Students tuned out because our professor didn't hold us to a very high standard. ",
            "\u00a0The class has to be better organized, at times it seemed like no one knew what was going on. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized and gives many opportunities to improve your german level on multiple facets. It also offers an in-depth look at the history and culture of Germany. The course, however, could offer more reading assignments and offer more streamlined ways of building vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0The course was certainly very interesting and looked at a very significant time period which made it fun to learn about. We did have some major adjustments to the original syllabus which made it difficult to know exactly what was due on a given day but what it shook out to in the end was actually nice. "

        [
            "\u00a0Unless there is a major organizational change, I would say no. It's very interesting subject matter, but not designed to facilitate learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student because it deals with some history of Germany which many people are not aware of when they speak about German behaviors. I think that by taking this class, students can understand more clearly how national socialism, as well as the current identity of Germany, evolved. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're fascinated with this period in history, no. The knowledge of the culture of Germany from the late 1800s to before World War II was pretty much the only thing I took out of this class, and it didn't feel very rewarding. Didn't expect this class to be a gut, but it was. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course for experienced students learning german. The course builds your fluency in german and has the additional benefit of teaching german history in an interesting and engaging manner. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. If you have the comprehension of the language to take this class I would do it for sure. "
