The first half of the course was spent understanding the foundational concepts and principles of anthropology while during the second half of the course, we were able to analyze how anthropologists put these principles into practice. For example, we read The Land of Open Graves by Jason de Leon, which is both a book and an ethnography about the migrant crossings along the US-Mexico border.

This class was just a bit too easy at times in terms of what we talked about in class - concepts that could have been much richer and deeper. However, it might fit since it was an introductory class. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: The lecture slides are difficult to follow if not present in class because the professor tells story as she shows pictures on her lecture slides. \r\n\r\nStrengths: Being able to discuss the subject material in smaller groups in section, weekly. ",

Professor was one of the most engaging professors I've had in all of my Yale career and all of her classes were thoroughly enjoyable.\r\nWeakness: I think lecture slides could have been a bit more wordy/informative. Having more key terms/concepts/people highlighted in the presentations would have helped us better prepare for the exams. ",

However, the entire second half of the semester felt like each class was just filling time - more could be done to improve the topics and rigor of assignments, rather than just assigning books that felt as though they were picked at random and promoted a particular simplistic political agenda (ie, anyone who works on Wall St. is evil) rather than anything close to a serious scientific discipline. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, lots of interesting case studies, opportunities to talk with peers, engaging lectures\r\nWeaknesses: Class usually went overtime, which could be improved with better time management. The classroom was also too small to accommodate all of the students, so some students ended up having to sit on the floor for lecture. Perhaps getting a larger classroom or capping the class would allow students to comfortably attend lecture. ",

I wish there was a clear relevance of the concepts and themes from each lecture to each other.  We also got off schedule so the readings did not match the lectures, and the professor did not accomodate, so things got a bit confusing.  \r\n\r\nStrenghts:  This course covers a lot of ground and there is something that will interest everyone.

            "\u00a0The course is very indicative of an intro course. It is very beneficial for people who really don't know anything about anthropology and want to see if it's right for them. The weakness is that sometimes it may mistake intro class for high school class. I don't think discussion is as intense as it could be; even the issues that were open-ended didn't really seem to spark that strong of a conflict in the class or within myself. I   didn't have to utilize my mental agility as much as I  felt that I   should have. ",

On top of that, the readings are not too much to handle, and are oftentimes on interesting ideas.  Lectures are fluid and concepts are explained well by Professor Lombard.  It's a very accessible intro course to anthropology.  If anything could be improved, it would be to engage more with the lengthier texts we read in the second half of the course that were fascinating but felt left out of lectures. ",

Later in the course, the books were a bit much. You can still do well and learn a lot sans the assigned reading, but this isnt a great class to take if youre taking a lot of other reading courses. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course in terms of its content, but necessitated some more incentive in its structure. The readings were interesting, but dense and long enough to make them a daunting task. This, coupled with the absolute separation of the grade from any reading completion/comprehension assessments, made it difficult to find motivation to get through the assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting and interactive, and I think we had good discussions in section.\r\n\r\nI perhaps would not expect as much lecture \r\nparticipation as the class was a little to big for anyone to feel comfortable. That being said, it was still nice that there was lecture participation, and the students that did speak had thoughtful insights. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was a very enjoyable course overall. I decided to Credit/D/Fail the course, but I still went to all of the lectures because they were really interesting! Each one was like a TED talk. Professor Lombard would encourage class discussion and would often incorporate video clips or stories about her own travels to supplement the lecture material. I really liked the majority of the readings because they were often an analysis/ethnography about a unique society/group of people somewhere else in the world. I especially liked the books we read (i.e. The Land of Open Graves by Jason de Leon) because they showed me how anthropologists can combine their several years of research into one work that delves into a variety of topics. I didn't find the homework assignments that interesting or useful - we had to be anthropologists analyzing life at Yale. I understand why the homework relates to the course, but I found the lectures and discussion sections to be a lot more engaging and informative. ",

            "\u00a0The readings were exceptional.  I loved Professor Lombard's teaching style.  However, I wish we would have engaged with the readings a little bit more in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: easy, light workload/reading load, no need to show up to lecture, ethnographic assignments are pretty basic, great 5th class whether or not you're interested in anthropology\r\nWeaknesses: i wish the class was a little more intellectually stimulating - at times it felt like a high school class, feedback on ethnographic assignments could have been better/more helpful.

Also, the assignments for the class are actually really interesting, spark interest, and aren't too long that you don't feel like you're wasting time. I don't have enough good things to say about this class. ",

This class was the greatest class I have ever taken at yale - so much so, i declared a double major in anthropology as a second semester junior because I loved this class so much. ",

Id say that the most amazing thing was how Professor Lombard always showed up to lecture with excitement, enthusiasm, and energy even though sometimes you could see that she probably had had a rough morning due to pregnancy. Really goes to show how much love she has for the subject, which really inserts itself into the students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot about international cultures as well as the everyday culture we are immersed in.  The strange became more familiar and the familiar become strange. This is a course I think everyone at Yale should take to expand their way of thinking and ultimately even interacting with one another. ",
            "\u00a0This course is the biggest gut I've ever taken at Yale - if that's what you're looking for, go for it. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I was hoping to get something different out of this class, which is why I feel disappointed with it. I know it is an introductory course, and I have taken introductory courses in the past, but I was genuinely curious about anthropology as a science and was hoping to take a class that treats it seriously and gives students a sense of what the field is really like. I don't like overly critical negative evals, and I realize that the material may be limited by the introductory nature of the class, but this course honestly was entirely devoid of any level of intellectual rigor or critical thinking. It felt to me like each class was \"this is how another culture does this thing\", which is interesting to learn, but something one could just as easily read on a tourism website or a middle school class. The \"ethnographic assignments\" that make up the sole homework of the course outside of readings similarly seemed incredibly superficial to me and did not actually produce any real knowledge, discovery, or change in my viewpoint. \r\n\r\nAs a minor point, I also was motivated to take this class by the promise in the syllabus to have guest lecturers who would provide insight into potential career paths for anthropology majors outside of academia. Over the entire semester, we only had one guest lecturer, and he was a student who received a fellowship to do academic anthropological research.\r\n\r\nIf you're genuinely curious or interested in anthropology, I would highly recommend trying a more specialized seminar or some other alternative to this class.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they were interested in this field. I originally thought I was, but it was a bit more abstract than I expected and as a result, it was difficult to discern what was actually important. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you are interested in anthropology and learning to think in a different way.  It is interesting enough, and also not difficult enough.  This is not a challenging course, but I think it is worthwhile. ",

But if you have any experience with what's being discussed-- if you're marginalized, if you've engaged with the social sciences before, then It can be easy to revert to using your own prior knowledge in the class too much. Pushback was hardly a thing I   discovered in this class and it can be disheartening when trying to gain never-before-seen perspectives. ",

I myself came in knowing nothing of the field and left feeling knowledgable enough to explain to others about the strengths of anthropology and why it is a useful field.  The class is not a hard class, if you do the readings and study decently well for the exams you'll be fine, and the ethnographic assignments are fun to do.  All around a great class! ",

I would definitely recommend it, especially if you Credit/D/Fail the class because you can enjoy all of the interesting lectures and readings without worrying too much about your grade. I didn't know anything about anthropology before taking this class, but I was intrigued by the subject. I learned so many topics (ex: symbols, rituals, structural violence, power, gender, globalization, etc.) that have changed the way I view the world. The number one thing we learned is to never be \"normative\" - we should never think that something is \"normal\" and compare everything else to this one \"normal\" method. Anthropology is a unique, interdisciplinary subject that combines biology, economics, psychology, linguistics, etc. I definitely feel that I have learned about the variety among human behavior and societies around the globe.
