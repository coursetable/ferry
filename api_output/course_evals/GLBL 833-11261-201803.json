            "\u00a0I developed a nuanced understanding of counterterrorism financing terminology and practices. ",
            "\u00a0A very interesting and niche understanding of the AML/CTF field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about financial warfare, money laundering, and terror financing, and how the US and the global community have confronted these threats.  I learned about the tactical, strategic, and ethical considerations that go into AML-CTF policy. I also learned about the economics of network effects, and quite a bit of historical and technical information about US sanctions policy. Finally, I gained an understanding of different points of view from my diverse group of classmates and from the many experts Professor King brought in to speak to the class. ",
            "\u00a0learned quite about AML and CTF. he takes the immersion approach which i found very helpful. learned a lot from the grad students in my class, the discussions, and the guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0AML CFT trends and incidents. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing including (1) the various methods and means, (2) the tools that have been implemented to combat both, (3) the lexicon used, (4) a historical perspective / evolution, and more. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of the formal financial system and a primer in AML/CTF. I learned about the current state of regulation, the history of the field, and current efforts to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this course without much experience in AML or CTF, I gained a great understanding of the policy issues, bureaucratic efforts, and ongoing threats. ",
            "\u00a0I went from knowing nothing to having a strong understanding of anti money laundering and terror financing policy ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about the language of and strategies used to create and carry out anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing policies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the variety of avenues one can take in laundering money; I gained a better understanding of the way a banking system is intended to work; the course helped me understand international organizations that combat illicit finance and what sorts of actions they are allowed to take. I gained an appreciation for the degree to which insurgents diversify their portfolios. I was especially struck by the more professional money-laundering techniques that focus on being as legally acceptable as possible. "

            "\u00a0I believe that some of the guest speakers did not understand how to communicate clearly and effectively. I'd have prefer Professor King to lead some of the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This course had great readings and fantastic speakers. Despite being held late on a Wednesday light, discussions were always lively. Professor King was kind and engaged. However, it would have been helpful to receive more formal feedback earlier in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: LOVE that he focuses on learning instead of the grade. as long as you put in the work, you will do well. thats what he always says and its comforting because you are learning and then also not scared about getting an A. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the number and quality of guest speakers we were able to interact with. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: guest speakers, having students present and sharing their perspective. Weaknesses: varying level of understanding of the subject matter and some students with AML / CTF experience dominated the questions portions with guest speakers ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting and was presented in an interesting manner.  The guest speakers were fantastic and relevant due to their years of work within the field.\r\nThe only weakness was not in the course but within the subject itself in that it is very dry at times due to the nature of bureaucracy and policy.  But, that can't be helped. ",
            "\u00a0The course did an excellent job grappling with a complex and rapidly evolving field that there are few courses on. The Professor did an excellent job bringing in practitioners and scholars whom we could learn from. My only complaint was that our conversations could veer a bit off topic when there weren't practitioners present. ",
            "\u00a0The course traces the origin and history of AML and CTF from pre-9/11 through the changes caused by 9/11, and analyzes the current challenges raised by new technology and questions whether older strategies will continue to be effective. Professor King also brought a range of interesting and experienced speakers and practitioners to class, which was a real strength of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very focused on the bleeding edge of illicit finance techniques; we were exposed to some current nascent proposals (the central US correspondent bank was particularly striking) and spent a great deal of time on the issues surrounding cryptocurrency. Prof. King made sure to emphasize the possibility of making a contribution to the field of AML-CTF literature; I will bear this in mind with future writing. This approach meant that what insights we developed would be more likely to have immediate relevance in the field and prepare us for work.\r\n\r\nI would have liked more focus on illicit finance by state actors. We typically focused on criminals and insurgents, and what focus there was on states usually revolved around state finance of terrorism more than kleptocracy. Since I was very interested in governance and corruption I would have loved more material on the subject. "

            "\u00a0Yes, 100%. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all interested in sanctions policy, money-laundering, or counter-terrorist financing, this course is a must-take. The access to experts in the field is astonishing, and you learn a tremendous amount. If you (for some reason) are not interested in those things, skip this class; you will talk about nothing else all semester. What you get out of this class depends directly on what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0yes! take it! great overall course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is a great way to learn the fundamentals of AML & CTF and explore the implications of different US and global policies. Leaves students conversant in the necessary technical terms and with exposure to a wide range of applications of what may at first appear to be obscure issues. ",
            "\u00a0yes esp if you want to get an understanding about anti-money laundering. ",
            "\u00a0As with all course, it is dependent on the other student's interest. If a student is interested in the subject matter, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The readings tend to be dense and technical, but once you get into them they're fascinating. Professor King is an incredible person and (even better) knows how to lead a seminar. The guest speakers help connect readings to the real world so that the discussion stays relevant and interesting. \r\n\r\nI decided to take this class mainly because I wanted to learn from Professor King, but I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the material throughout the semester, especially the legal component. I was genuinely excited about my final paper topic, which isn't something I can say for every class. Sometimes it was dry, yes, but I learned a lot. This seminar opened up a whole new field for me and I'm excited to do more with AML/CTF in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  The course is a great way to learn about AML/CTF from an engaging professor and excellent guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0I would to students who want to learn more about this topic- though obviously this field isn't for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in US and international counterterrorism strategies or to anyone interested in money laundering. The course provides excellent coverage of past and current AML and CTF efforts, and enables students to research a particular area of interest in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I took this class because the material is very pertinent to the areas I want to study. More to the point, I was interested in the subject; AML-CTF work holds the promise of solid consequences in a way that much of political science does not. The guest lecturers were good overall and got better as the class went on, honing their subjects more tightly to what the class found relevant.\r\nMore to the point, Prof. King is a delight and a riot. Almost everyone in the class seemed to be genuinely enjoying themselves every lecture. I strongly recommend this course to anyone, especially those interested in business, governance/political science, finance or law. "
