The weaknesses are that the lectures were often not very engaging. However, the Poll Everywhere questions, videos, and guest lecturers helped with this. The professor often read off of the slides and sometimes was a little hard to follow. Additionally, the material taught on the various mental illnesses was very surface level. If one had taken AP Psychology in high school or Intro to Psychology here at Yale, this class would probably be very repetitive and boring. The exams were very straightforward (multiple choice and short answer questions) and non-cumulative which was very nice given the amount of illnesses and etiological paradigms that were covered. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses are the fact that each lecture is formatted in the same way: a disorder, symptoms, potential causes, and treatments.

            "\u00a0Strengths: the overviews of each disorder are very detailed and provide a lot of important information about them. The course also uses a lot of case studies and videos which helps with the general understanding of the disorders. Also, the course made a point of never being judgmental about any of the disorders which was good. Respectful language and attitudes were used throughout.\r\nWeaknesses: I (along with many other students) found it frustrating when Professor Joormann would start a new topic/new set of lecture slides when there were 10 minutes left of class. I would recommend either better pacing or simply ending class early. ",
            "\u00a0Exam's are worth too much of overall grade. Difficult to show true comprehension of material by 2 exams. Textbook is dull. Joormann's lectures are quite interesting albeit lengthy. ",

The professor often read off of the slides and sometimes was a little hard to follow. Additionally, the material taught on the various mental illnesses was very surface level.

The exams were very straightforward (multiple choice and short answer questions) and non-cumulative which was very nice given the amount of illnesses and etiological paradigms that were covered. The TAs and professor are very responsive to questions and meeting to discuss topics outside of class. The lectures were often not very engaging. However, the Poll Everywhere questions, videos, and guest lecturers helped with this. As long as you went to class and took notes and studied a fair amount beforehand, you would do very well in the course. They also curved both exams which was nice. The final paper was also very straightforward and could be done on the movie of our choice. Overall, I liked that the course was easy and straightforward.

The professor herself stresses that you don't have to go to class if you don't want to, and instead you can read the textbook for a more in-depth look at the disorders. However, I found at times that material she stressed on in class was more likely to be on the exam.

            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0yes, i would recommend highly ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Abnormal psychology is so cool!!! ",
            "\u00a0Great Credit/D ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to any student because it covers extremely important topics on mental illness and really helps change perceptions of mental illness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class whether youre interested in psych or not. Its as much of a gut as youll get here... if you show up to lecture and study somewhat for the 2 tests youll be fine. Reading responses each week take 15 minutes max. Great class, lectures are interesting and easy to follow ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think everyone should have a basic understanding of psychological disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provides a good set of knowledge for understanding mental illnesses to educate oneself on the topic for further work in this field and even for students simply interesting in learning about it. ",
            "\u00a0Eh, for the psych major, sure. Otherwise, there are better courses to be taken imo ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it provides useful interesting knowledge and insight surrounding mental disorders ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is an interesting class and not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course could be taken by any student at Yale regardless of their major because it helps one understand the vastness that is mental illness and how it affects so many of our most vulnerable. By having background knowledge in this area we can better understand and sympathize with those struggling with mental illness. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely- the lectures were fun and organized. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was great to take after psychology 110 to learn more about disorders specifically. Since the workload is manageable it does not take away from the amount of time you out toward other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this class to another student. The class is very organized and easy to follow while teaching interesting topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If someone is interested in psychology and mental disorders, this course greatly enhances one's understanding of many different types of mental illness. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in mental illness or even just in psychology, you should take this class. It's incredibly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this lecture if you have little experience with psychology and are looking for a lighter 5th class. Much of the material is either common sense or will be forgotten after the exam. Lectures delivered on what they were supposed to but not much more; they were mostly dry, and overlapped a lot with Intro Psych. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they are at all interested in learning about abnormal behavior. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think abnormal psychology is very relevant to today's society and the mental health movement. The discussion on eating disorders was great for a generation that's growing up with social media. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, light workload but gives you a lot of info about disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Very easy class that covers interesting material, but not super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it if they were interested in learning about the disorders covered in the class in a general way but not if they wanted to focus in depth on a couple. ",
            "\u00a0I must confess: I did not much enjoy this course. As someone coming from a background in the hard sciences I was frustrated by the sometimes hand-wavy and constantly fluctuating diagnostic criteria of clinical psychology. Additionally, I wish more time was devoted to discussing which of the treatments we know work and which treatments are more hopeful Hail Marys. I am unsure, however, if my complaints stem more from nature of psychology or the specifics of this course, so it is difficult to tell if you would share my views. Regardless, the fairly light workload of this course and the *ridiculously easy* (multiple choice!!) exams could provide reason enough to take it. "
