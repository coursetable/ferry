            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course that's very well organized. The only problem I had this year was that both of my coaches had pretty limited availability, so we often had to have coachings 2 days in a row every 2 weeks instead of once a week (which would have been more useful). It would be great if the coaching schedules were a little more regular/standardized so that every group got the same amount of support. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! So wonderful to work in chamber groups and work one on one with faculty then be able to come together and listen and comment on other groups progress. The only weakness was sometimes performance class would go over and it was sometimes difficult to sit and listen to six groups in a row. ",

            "\u00a0Taking this class is something that I don't regret - however, this class is way more than a 0.5 credit should be. Yes you \"only\" have your 2 hours of rehearsal, 1 hour of coaching, and \"bi-weekly\" studio class for 1.5 hours, but beyond that, it's imperative to think about the hours of practice put in for preparation of all these things. While I am personally willing to put in all that time because I enjoy chamber music a lot, this semester was a little disappointing in part because of the coaches assigned to my group. I greatly appreciated their enthusiasm and kind words, but my group and I found ourselves feeling like we didn't improve much from the beginning of the semester until the final concert. It was really disappointing, disheartening, and also de-motivating in this way, and although I understand that the coaches invest a lot of time into their groups, it would be really helpful if the coaches could be more articulate in their feedback and provide advice that can help make things better, rather than trying to fix basic, foundational skills that frankly an undergrad student not majoring in music doesn't have the time for. This is not to say that all of the coaches are unhelpful - my past experiences with some of the other coaches have really been amazing. But this leads me to also express discontent that some groups are able to request certain coaches/repertoire and are given priority, while others are not given the same treatment. This class has probably given me more ups than downs per say, but there have been times where I have felt that this class is unfair and biased at times, and the workload is something one should be aware of before auditioning for this class.
