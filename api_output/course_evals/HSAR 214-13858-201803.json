            "\u00a0How to blend historical and art historical thinking to paint a more complex and comprehensive picture of the colonial Americas. Also how to think in terms of the Americas, not just North America (with an emphasis on New England!). ",
            "\u00a0I learned to appreciate material culture a lot more through this class -- not only to look at \"fine arts\" objects, but also look at the everyday possessions of people, and be able to glean insight as to their lifestyles and values through an examination of the objects. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Cooke's lecture style, hands-on sections in the YUAG, compassionate instructor\r\nWeaknesses: Nothing jumps out to me! ",
            "\u00a0For both the written assignments and the midterm/final, I often felt like I didn't have a clear idea of what was expected or the logic behind grading, which was a little frustrating. I think the course could really benefit from being turned into a seminar with papers instead of exams. "

            "\u00a0Yes, especially if he/she is interested in expanding his/her perspective on the integrated colonial Americas and wishes to use material culture as sources/evidence in addition to textual sources, etc. (for history majors) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly if they are unfamiliar with the YUAG and/or the YUAG study galleries. This class allows for hands-on object examination, something that, while possible, is not often taken advantage of. Much of the course was based on objects in the YUAG collection, meaning that students can engage with objects in a meaningful and more intimate way. ",
            "\u00a0I would only take this course if you already have an strong interest in the subject. Professor Cooke is a lovely person and is clearly passionate about what he does, but the subject is definitely not for everyone, and could be very boring if you find it's not for you. "
