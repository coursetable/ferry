            "\u00a0This was originally supposed to be offered as a full credit course, so expectations with workload were a little unclear. Better clarity with the syllabus and an outline of how long assignments should be expected take would have been helpful (or perhaps just sticking with three assignments in total, where students are provided the freedom to pick and choose, i.e. recording a podcast OR a pitch OR profiling another student).\r\n\r\nThat said I really enjoyed profiling another student! Thought that was a great assignment and a great way to get to know one of my other classmates. I also enjoyed improv, although I know not everyone did.\r\n\r\nStructuring student \"final\" projects probably would have functioned better over the course of the semester instead of backloading into the final day of class (or, at the very least, giving students more notice of what the last day of class might look like -- it was tough to have a 3 hour class during YSPH's reading week). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- I think it's a laid back class, where you get to read some really interest material. The guest speakers were interesting and it was amazing to meet famous and established authors. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- I don't think I learned a lot in this class. I think our generation knows how to use social media already so much, but it would have been helpful to get more writing assignments or know how to analyze a news article and think more critically about it. We should have had the opportunity to write and get feedback on us covering the news a bit. There was also a lot of student participation and time for them to talk, so there was little lecturing from James Hamblin. ",
            "\u00a0Enjoyed, but clearly the first time it was offered. Assignments and lecture goals could be more clear. Once these are ironed out I think it will be an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n+ Non-judgmental, yet engaging environment\r\n+ Learned many practical/tactical tips needed for a career in public health/public health communication\r\n+ Jim provided honest feedback on assignments and was always open to providing mentorship on any projects\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n+ Feedback on assignments came many weeks after the due date ",
            "\u00a0So interesting (including the course readings)! \r\nEvery health professions student should take this course.  I loved being able to think more critically about how to address public health issues through the lens of social media and popular journalism.  I appreciated the way the professor incorporated headlines from the day into his lectures. It encouraged me to be more informed with the news--something every student could take more time to do.  \r\n\r\nStudents would be better served if this class were offered as *full credit.* I would have liked to have more discussion time each week. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course and I feel that it is an important subject to be offered in the public health curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the guests we had. I thought that was a very engaging component. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learning from someone who does health journalism, we had very creative projects\r\nWeaknesses: The final project was a bit unclear. I was also hoping to come out with writing samples that I could submit for job applications. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course should be a full credit instead of a half credit. This change will allow us to spend more time on topics we were unable to explore thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting course to think about current topics and health-related issues in the media, and was a relevant and timely course for thinking about how to most effectively disseminate public health (and other) research and data to the public/different audiences. The timing of the course (Monday 6-7:20pm) was a bit un-ideal, but other than that the course was really interesting and engaging and I enjoyed the different projects throughout the semester. It would have been nice to have smaller tasks to break up the big social media projects (e.g. have your project social media account name/title due, have your first few posts drafted, etc). Overall an interesting course! ",
            "\u00a0Make it a full credit course! It was awesome. ",
            "\u00a0In theory, this is great class and one that this program could really benefit from given that the students need to understand how to translate the information we know in public health to the public in a way that can be easily received - through the media. However, I think this class comes with the assumption that you need to already know all of the social media platforms really well and rather are just practicing different forms of presenting to the media. I think, instead, it needs to start from scratch and establish the pros and cons of the various platforms and present how to go about using each platform effectively. To do all of this, it would be best to make this a full semester class so that the professor can go into detail rather than brushing over everything and not allowing students to fully engage. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a great addition to the course offerings at YSPH. Health communications is an up and coming field, and it is extremely important that YSPH grows the communications aspect of our program. ",
            "\u00a0More discussion. Also, more concrete scope of assignments. Could have one critical question for students to respond to when reading each week's readings as a means to help aid in the depth of discussion. Would prefer  going in deeper on certain topics, versus breadth. \r\n\r\nLoved the speakers that were brought in.  I do think that there is value in having this type of course  offered at YSPH and I imagine some of the kinks will get worked out as this continues to be taught.\r\n\r\n This course and the student experience would benefit if a final project proposal was due and there was a two week time span where all students were required to meet with the instructor. \r\n\r\nI also think that the course could be more inclusive in terms of welcoming spectrum of capacity in social media. For example, his expectations for final project could be more experimental than sustainable. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: an interesting survey of topics in health narratives that added valuable insight to my degree. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the class is better suited to be a full credit and did not go as in depth as I would have liked "

            "\u00a0Engaging lecturer, needs clearer expectations of what he wants from assignments.  Will benefit from using our work as examples in the future. I really appreciated his flexibility and willing to meet students where they were at. Very open door communication policy. Although I think he may have overestimated how ~online~ we are. ",
            "\u00a0Instructor was really engaging. Thank you for not boring us with following the format of more traditional classes. \r\nI appreciated the way the professor pushed us out of our comfort zones at the beginning of class by starting with improv exercises. This made me laugh and helped me to feel more at ease to participate in class. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that Dr. Hamblin really made an effort to encourage the class to engage and participate. I particularly enjoyed how relevant he made the course to current events and issues in public health. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very creative and encouraging. I enjoyed dissecting news topics and talking about current events. He challenges us to think critically about the news we consume and also the style things are written in. \r\nWeaknesses: Wish the final project had been a little more clear. Feedback wasn't always the most timely. ",
            "\u00a0He provides meaningful feedback, which is great for improving your work over the course of the semester. He is also very open to feedback from the students, which allows for him to improve the course as well. I enjoyed some of the guest speakers, although I would have loved to see more diversity. ",
            "\u00a0Great! It was interesting to hear his perspectives and views on this topic and to hear his first-hand experiences (from him and his contacts in the media), and to learn more about health media and narratives. I enjoyed the improv during class and feel that if the course had potentially been at an earlier time in the day and/or in a smaller room that felt more seminar-style than the course would have had a stronger interactive component that Jim was going for. Overall great teaching and course! ",
            "\u00a0Keeping in mind that James was a first time instructor, I think he did the best he could! I think he might work to being more receptive to students in what their comments are and how they are reacting to the class and understand what they want out of the class. He has a wealth of experience but it was no so easy to learn from that or get advice on how to pursue the path he is on. I think he has great ideas and if he had more time in class to go through them, he could be more effective. ",
            "\u00a010 out of 10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0It was clear that this was his first time both teaching, and teaching this course. That said, James was a decent teacher. Strengths: understanding our demands and not asking us to put in too much work outside of the classroom. Weaknesses: Could improve on discussion facilitation skills.  Also, having clearer expectations of assignments. Lastly, pacing of each class. ",

            "\u00a0This is a clever and somewhat innovative/non-traditional course as far as YSPH goes. You'll create assignments that can fuel work for future projects outside of YSPH, especially if you're moving into the health communications world. It was the professor's first year teaching it this year so structure was a little rocky, but I think with kinks sorted out this will be a great class moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0I think James is keen on improving the course, but I'm not sure I would recommend it unless there was a lot of content and formatting change. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. YSPH needs more health media courses -- no idea why this is only half a credit and Bazell's is a full credit. This was lightyears better and more relevant to current communications. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think everyone at YSPH should take a course in public health communication. While the class could use a bit more structure and should be longer than 80 minutes per week, overall I did leave with important tips about how to be a better public health communicator. The workload was very manageable, and th assignments were actually fun to work on and could easily be converted into a real publication, pitch, or project. Great class for a 2nd year elective if you want to learn key skills for your next job but not have to do a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0Fun, engaging, and relevant. The kind of class one hopes to be inspired by in choosing a school like Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I would tell them that it is best to approach it with an open mind and a willingness to participate. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course about the different media sources for health journalism, primarily online. It is not a journalism course. it would be the most beneficial for someone who knows at least the basics of journalism. However, it is not hard to follow if you don't. ",
            "\u00a0A course about news consumption, social media, and health communications \r\n\r\nYes, I would, if there was a little bit more structure. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is extremely important, especially as social media is the way in which many people are receiving their health information. I would strongly encourage this class for individuals interested in public health communication. ",
            "\u00a0It was an interesting course to think about current topics and health-related issues in the media, and was a relevant and timely course for thinking about how to most effectively disseminate public health (and other) research and data to the public/different audiences. The projects allow you to dive into your specific health interests, and are a great way to set yourself up \"in the media\" moving forward in your career. I'd recommend this class as a great way to think critically about how you are and will portray your work in the media. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
