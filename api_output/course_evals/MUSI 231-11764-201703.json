            "\u00a0There is a challenge to working with networked information and we ran into a lot of bugs that slowed the class time down. I think we could have taken a little more advantage of those moments to learn about what challenges were coming into play, but obviously they were at a fairly detailed level so there would only be so much we could absorb. Additionally, I would have liked to do more labs working in Max to get a little more experience. ",
            "\u00a0There were just too many people in this course. Also, this is just the type of course that requires self-motivated involvement. Because in-depth learning of Max isn't required, it's too easy to do very little and get through the class. I don't inherently think that's a bad thing, BUT that means that it's essential for the professor/TFs to weed out people who will not be that engaged. I think if we had split into lab groups more and focused on small groups for the entire semester, the class would have gone much better. Because the group was so large, technological difficulty as well as the difficulties that accompany managing 20 college students with laptops making lots of sound meant that classes could seem somewhat disorganized. I think instilling a strong sense of ensembleand that class is rehearsal, and everyone is expected to stay focused and follow directionswould greatly benefit the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super cool content. Engaging and fun prof + TAs. Weaknesses/Improvements: Technology doesn't always work. Sections earlier in the semester can use a bit more structure. ",
            "\u00a0more Max! ",
            "\u00a0I think just starting on individual projects earlier could allow for more time to develop performances ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to get a more in depth look into max but I believe there is a separate class for that. ",
            "\u00a0The class introduced me to a lot of music I had never thought about before. I found most of the course material to be interesting and I enjoyed engaging with the pieces of music we learned about, but the class was very disorganized. Since the class did not demand a lot of time commitment and there were relatively few assignments, it seemed like most students were not very engaged or motivated. During some classes we spent far too much time troubleshooting with files and hardware that didn't quite work right (although perhaps this is inevitable). I wish there had been some more assignments focused on the creative side of the material, since some of the pieces we worked on felt more like demonstrations of novel new technology rather than performances of musical compositions. I really enjoyed working on our final project because it allowed everyone to apply some of the ideas we learned about earlier in the semester, and to get creative as a group and commit to putting together a (hopefully) compelling performance, but I just wish we could have gotten to that point earlier in the semester. Maybe add a small project partway through the semester that requires each student to come up with an idea for a short piece and perform it during their section? The sample pieces we worked on in groups seemed to serve this purpose, but we didn't have very much time to work on them and actually focus on writing a thoughtful composition. I understand that one strength of the laptop orchestra is its ability to incorporate people who don't have much experiencing practicing on any instruments, but I think the class could benefit from requiring Music 110 (or equivalent) as a prerequisite, to ensure that all the students at least have basic knowledge about pitches, chords, rhythms, and listening. Overall I wish the course had focused more on listening to the compositions themselves rather than just the technologies that make them possible. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It makes you think a lot about music performance from a theoretical standpoint, and is a really fun and unique environment for making music. The workload is totally manageable and Konrad is a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class. It's little work and super interesting. As someone interested in both computer science and music, this enabled me to explore some of the ideas that have been hanging around in the back of my head for a long time. BUT, please only take this class if you're self-motivated and will be dedicated to making cool music as an ensemble. While you won't get in trouble for it, if you mess around and don't care in class, it will negatively impact everyone else's experience. Don't take this as a gut that you won't work for, because everyone works together in the class. There are people who really care about this class and if you plan on not caring that much, taking the class will negatively affect the entire ensemble. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you're interested in music and computers. It is super fun and chill. Konrad is awesome as usual. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in either music or technology it is a fun way to blend the two together. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested in exploring unfamiliar music, and learning about developing new musical technologies. "
