            "\u00a0I entered this class with little knowledge of the subject matter, but left with a much better understanding of the influence, actions, and legacy of the Mughals. It was a fascinating and extremely engaging course. ",

            "\u00a0I have learnt a lot about the different factor that led to inception and decline of the Mughal Empire. This has been a great opportunity for me to step out of my comfort zone and dwell into the history of the Mughal rule which is something that i did not get to zoom in to in the past. "

I also found the lecturer's choice of readings wonderful as they gave a whole new dimension to approaching Mughal History. I felt that the slides could be more engaging "
