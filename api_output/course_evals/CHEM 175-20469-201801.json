            "\u00a0I didn't learn much from this course because the information was too difficult to understand and was not taught well. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me many stress-management skills because it is extremely difficult. As far as actual chemistry skills go, in this course we built more upon the understandings of mechanisms and complex reactions that we began to go into last semester, and we focused in on the study of new functional groups and more complex molecules. We learned about the reaction and stereochemistry of sugars, amino acids, and other biological compounds. Furthermore, at the end of the semester, we dove into some bio-orthoganal chemistry that was very interesting, but also very challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of new reactions in organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned several reactions including many different functional groups. My arrow-pushing intuition got much better, and was exposed to a wide range of chemical synthesis methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned organic chemistry and all the reactions that go with it. The professor also covered some more advanced topics in peptide synthesis and bio-orthogonal chemistry. However, more than just the reactions, I learned how to study for EXTREMELY challenging classes that cover material very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the course was difficult and incredibly trying, it taught me a lot about how to persevere when overwhelmed. There is a ton of information introduced in this class--from electrophilic aromatic substitution to all the different chemical properties of carbonyls, ketones, and carboxylic acid derivatives, I ended up with a reactions list that was about 20+ pages long, along with a binder full of information and random notes I created to help me keep track of everything. I spent maybe 25 hours per week studying and working on this class, and despite all the effort I put in, sometimes it still felt like there was too much information for me to be able to categorize it all. The class is great in that it forces you to learn how to be organized, and some key skills, such as being able to use what you know to plan syntheses and draw mechanisms, are definitely emphasized in the course. You have to learn to think critically, not just intuitively, and as someone who had consistently relied on instinct to do well on exams, it was a good learning experience. Overall, the course did a pretty good job of covering a large amount of material in just a semester, even though it was stressful most of the time. ",

I feel like we learned more applicable reactions and concepts that we can use in chemistry or biology labs. I personally also developed better study habits throughout this course because I felt that we didn't have many relevant and useful practice problems for our quizzes and exams, so I learned how to improve my study habits and what works for me when I don't have many other resources to use.

            "\u00a0Strengths: good lectures\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough accessible office hours, and extra help for a course that needs it ",
            "\u00a0This course was not taught in a way to help the students understand the very difficult material. There was no help from peer tutors or TAs, and the professor did not respond to emails. This class could be improved by changing the format to make it more accessible and having resources available for struggling students. ",
            "\u00a0This course has interesting content, but the organization of it was abysmal. There did not seem to be any communication between TFs, peer tutors, and the professor, and, as a result, I never felt fully prepared going into any exam or quiz. This course could be improved by providing more practice problems, offering review sessions before each midterm, and making sure that everyone is on the same page as to which concepts we need to know. There were times in section where the TFs would give practice problems, but they were infinitely easier or focused on completely different content from the questions on the exams, making it really difficult to do well. ",
            "\u00a0There was no communication between the professor and the TFs . The professor held no review sessions and practically no one could attend her office hour (1) since most of the class had lab on Fridays. Also she never responds to emails. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very poorly structured this semester. Professor Schepartz was extremely disorganized and relied way too much on her notes, which sometimes even confused her. She didnt emphasize any topics during the lectures and expected us to thoroughly understand them for quizzes and exams. Grading on the exams was extremely harsh and didnt reflect on the students understanding of the material, but rather on a rigid key written by Professor Schepartz. The homework assignments didnt make any sensethey were too hard for me to answer based on what was covered in lecture; and the answers were posted on Canvas before the assignment was due. The assignments ended up being so hard and confusing that most students just blindly copied the solutions to avoid frustration. The TAs were also terrible, and didnt keep up in section with the lecture materials. Professor Schepartz didnt send her notes to the peer tutors, who therefore couldnt be very helpful either. As a result, I just felt that I had no resources to actually learn anything from the class. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more opportunity to get questions answered and more practice questions. Also, the class goes very quickly and I felt that some concepts could have been explained more thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Oh my, where do I start? The course has a lot of strengths for sure--Dr. Schepartz's teaching style is organized, and I was really glad to have a lecture-based course rather than a flipped course for Orgo 2. Unlike sophomore orgo, we are assigned psets that reflect select questions on the exams, and we have a lot more opportunities to make up for sub-par grades (four midterms and four quizzes, and you get to drop one of each). I learned a lot about how to study and how to approach chemistry, even though most of what I learned what self-taught and not necessarily information that was passed on from the teaching fellows and Dr. Schepartz. In that regard, one weakness is that the teaching fellows and the professor did not always offer meaningful advice for improvement. I put what some would consider a very considerable amount of time and energy into this course, and when I didn't see improvement in my performance, I tried to reach out only to be rebuffed multiple times by the professor. The teaching fellows were nicer, but still rarely offered advice that made a huge difference. A HUGE weakness is what appears to be the professor's apparent disregard for organic chemistry, both the subject and the course (and possibly its students). It's evident that she loves chemical biology and is talented in that field, but when it comes to orgo, she doesn't bother to update her past practice exams (even though we covered different material from past years, so the exams weren't good reflections of the actual exams), would ignore questions asked by students during lecture, was constantly unavailable during office hours and in general for help, and occasionally would teach us incorrect information. I'm sure her chemical biology course is amazing, but it never seemed like the professor cared much for orgo, and it put a bit of a downer on the course, to say the least. How could the course be improved? I'd love to see someone with more enthusiasm (and more sympathy for the well-being of the course's students) teach the class. I would have also preferred more opportunities to get help--I never visited a peer tutor because I never knew when their hours were, and one teaching fellow held office hours once a week during an inopportune time. ",
            "\u00a0Could be structured better and taught with a greater focus on concepts and not on mechanisms as tools for memorization. Mechanisms should be deducible, and it's that deduction that marks a true knowledge of chemistry. It seemed that too much of the class was memorizing mechanisms in addition to memorizing reactions--not learning the mechanisms.\r\n\r\nAlso the rote memorization of amino acids and sugars is irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the lecture style and the units, but I wish the psets were more representative of the test questions. I think I would have been more comfortable with tests if there were more practice questions but in no way did I feel as though tests were unfair. I loved the bio-orthogonal chemistry unit and wish there were more application aspects of the course to modern-day drug, biochemical (etc) applications. I also wish there was more synthesis between the units taught in class.\r\n\r\nAfter having a flipped classroom and lecture style in this course, I like the lecture style better. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very direct and pertinent to tests. This made the class fair and straightforward. The content was also very interesting, as we explored ramifications of each new reaction we learned. Still, the class could see some improvement with homework, as at times it was impossible not to look up the answer, as the assigned homework problem was completely separate from what we learned in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class's lecture style was a great strength of the course. Professor Schepartz is very knowledgable in the subject and made class very interesting. A weakness of the class is the sections. They do not compliment the course very well as they have little structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small size and engaged professor and TA's make it a better learning experience; took the time to explain the reasons underlying reaction mechanisms and empirical facts regarding them\r\nWeaknesses: memorization heavy, a lot of material that quickly becomes less interesting ",
            "\u00a0This class is very lecture intensive, but if you listen during the lectures, you won't ever have to read the textbook. I do fell this class could do more to emphasize the logic behind reactions and how to predict mechanisms rather than just putting them out there as inevitably, some people will just memorize the reactions and mechanisms rather than actually learning the logic behind them. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures sort of felt very much like the professor was just writing and talking through their notes on the board. It also felt a bit memorization heavy. However, the exams and assignment felt like they fairly covered class material and the speed of the course wasnt too fast. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty disorganized, and no one really knows what's going on. If you have a question about a regrade for example, one TF will refer you to the other, who will refer you to Professor Schepartz, who will.... refer you back to the TFs. The TFs are also picky about different things, so your grade may vary significantly between exams. You also get tested on random reactions that are not covered in the textbook that were covered in class once in five minutes. It seems like none of the teaching staff really care about the students in the course, which is especially notable because the first semester teaching staff were extremely helpful. Sections don't really help unless you go in with questions you want to ask, since the TFs don't prepare for them. That being said, Professor Schepartz is a good lecturer and she handles the complex material quite well. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is the fact that Professor Schepartz is very well-renowned in the STEM community, both at and outside of Yale, and it's a great opportunity to be able to interact with and learn from her. Another strength of the course is that I learned many study habits that I found to be very beneficial in learning the material outside of class and preparing for quizzes and exams; I plan on taking these study habits with me throughout the rest of my academic career. However, I am not a fan of how the class itself was organized at all. I often felt like parts of the lectures weren't very well organized in terms of tying in examples of the material after the concepts were introduced. We never really did any practice problems during class, so I didn't feel like we got enough practice with the concepts and the course wasn't designed in a way that would allow us to cement the concepts in our minds. I often felt like examples also weren't very well emphasized, but they were often on the quizzes and tests, so I felt like we weren't really told how much of our assessments consisted of the main concepts and reactions that we learned and applications of those concepts, and how much consisted of the random, obscure examples that were briefly presented in lecture. I also don't think that we were given relevant practice quizzes and tests to use as part of our studying for any assessment. The practice quizzes and tests from past years that were posted on Canvas often covered either material that we already learned but were not being tested on in that unit, or material that we had not yet learned. Whenever I tried to do these practice problems, I always felt like they weren't helpful because they didn't accurately reflect the types of questions and the composition of the quizzes and exams that we would have. There were also many instances when what Professor Schepartz taught us in class differed from what the textbook said, so many of us were left confused about what was right and what was wrong, which obviously is not helpful for learning the material. A lot of the material was also presented in a confusing way, but the class often moved very quickly so there wasn't time to elaborate on the concepts; I felt like we were often left on our own to figure out the concepts and the material, even when it was very challenging. We also never got our homework back, so we didn't have that as a useful resource for studying. Along with the lack of organization in the material and the lack of relevant and useful study resources, I also felt like there was a great sense of disorganization among the TAs and the peer tutors. The TAs often did not know what we had learned and covered in lecture, or weren't really sure of what Professor Schepartz wanted us to cover in section, so no one really knew what was happening and section was often unhelpful because of this disconnect. The peer tutors often never really knew what we had covered in lecture, and they based their knowledge off of the practice quizzes and exams that were posted, so they really only knew what was on those exams instead of what we actually learned in class and what was actually going to be on our exams. In general, I felt a great sense of disorganization throughout multiple aspects of the course, and it was challenging for me to actually learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was too pedantic and should have some practice problems, which would force us to answer the question and would allow us to better understand the topics being presented. ",
            "\u00a0There isn't much to say here.  It is difficult, but there isn't much that can be done about it.  It crams a years worth of reactions and chemistry facts in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0Very comprehensive course however, the pace was far too fast and each reaction eas not thoroughly covered. Not enough practice problems in class. ",
            "\u00a0It was a tough class, and it was very well organized. The exams were very good. The discussion sections could have been more organized. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting content, real world application of that content, and intellectually challenging concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture style classroom does not promote group work or the practice needed to thrive in the class. Flipped classroom would work better. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: incredibly talented students form friendships and study groups\r\n\r\nWeakness: unnecessarily difficult for this year - likely due to the increase in stem-oriented students. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated having quizzes to practice applying the material in an exam setting, and I am glad that we aware able to drop our worst quiz and exam. I am glad that we followed the textbook very closely in lecture, so that notes could be supplemented or reviewed by reading in the textbook. I found sapling practice problems to be very helpful last semester, and I wish we could have had something like that this semester. The problem set problems were not always relevant and not convenient. Having a few problems to do after each class would help more to reinforce the material directly after it was learned. I would've liked more practices quizzes and tests which were directly relevant to this class, since we had different material on each exam compared to previous years. I would have liked more time on the exams. At some point the time constraint rewards better test takers instead of better chemistry students. The midterm exams were stressful races, trying to write something for each problem without a chance to think things through. I found the final to be much more satisfying, and a better demonstration of my learning, because I had time to think, reason my way through difficult problems, and review my work critically. I think that discussion sections could have been more structured. Often we had to remind the TAs what Alanna had told us to go over, because they did not pa attention or attend lecture. We were given too much time to ask questions which often devolved into unproductive discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is the lecture format. Professor Schepartz is a great lecturer. While at times she can go pretty fast, she usually does a solid job of explaining the concepts and how they relate to other things we learned/ will learn. The major weakness of this course was the peer tutor system. Compared to the peer tutoring of first semester organic chemistry, the peer tutoring this system was rather lacking. The grading and workload of this course felt fair and reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Wish the psets were more like the tests, ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strengths of this course were related to the instruction, specifically the passionate and clear lectures delivered by Dr. Schepartz and the accessible and informative section and review sessions led by the TFs Jon and Kevin. Dr. Schepartz lectures very quickly and it was a big transition from our first semester with Tim Newhouse (who taught in a flipped classroom style), but once you got used to the transition I thought the class was very effective. I very much appreciated how Dr. Schepartz went out of her way to incorporate narrative historical context into the beginning of many of her lectures, as these anecdotes provided me of a sense of the field of chemistry and inspired me to consider pursuing a future career in science. Dr. Schepartz's quick lecturing style was difficult to keep up with at times, but in all cases I found that my own difficulty with the course was derived from my own course-load and committments that conflicted with studying rather than any fault on her part. Of my peers who disliked Dr. Schepartz's class, I generally felt like their complaints were grounded in comparison to first semester with Dr. Tim Newhouse, which I'm not sure is a fair comparison given the different styles of flipped versus regular classroom. Granted, this course might have benefited from some of the extra study hall hours that first semester had available, and it might have been nice to receive feedback on psets on a regular basis, but overall I felt like all my troubles associated with class were my own doing. Moreover, the generous ability to drop one quiz and one exam helps students (myself included) feel as though not every assessment is the ultimate determination of our futures, as is easy to feel like in a premed-heavy class. My strongest recommendation for this course is specifically for if it is taught again immediately subsequent to Dr. Tim Newhouse's first semester organic chemistry--it would be helpful to emphasize at the beginning of the course to NOT expect a similar experience, and that success 2nd semester highly depends on studying from lecture notes rather than the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely test-heavy, and sometimes it felt like, especially with test difficulty that went beyond the level of lecture, putting in a lot of time and effort didn't feel like it was paying off in results. This class felt almost a little like \"brilliance\" was an important part of succeeding. The homework was really difficult to learn from because, unless we took the initiative ourself, problems were never gone over in class and the psets were for the most part never returned. While the subject material was quite interesting, and I appreciated how closely we followed the book, so that we could go back and bolster our notes from lecture, overall it was taught at such a fast pace that keeping up was a real struggle. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that it was composed of freshmen so all of us had no idea what we were doing. There were a lot of weaknesses in the course. There was a clear disconnect between the professor and TAs and this showed in section as well as the exam grading. This was disappointing because we were expected to do things we hadn't been taught because that's what the TAs expected. ",

            "\u00a0A strength of this course was that it was taught lecture style, instead of flipped, because the course content would have been very difficult to understand by just reading the textbook. However, this course had many weaknesses. For example, Professor Schepartz was rarely available for help, unresponsive to emails, and did not facilitate student resources whatsoever. The peer tutors were not qualified to help with the material she covered, and often did not even know what we were covering because the course schedule and practice tests were not reflective of what we were tested on.

My initial response would be no, but in hindsight (of course I haven't received my final grade yet, so we'll see how I feel about this course after that's revealed), I learned a TON. The course really forces you to know the material until you could teach it to someone who's never seen orgo before, and I even though I'm nowhere near perfect (or probably even mediocre in the class--it's a competitive course), I definitely have a deeper, richer understanding of orgo now than before I entered the course. I learned a lot about how to move on from and adapt to disappointment and how to organize my learning in a way that helps and makes sense to me. So in that regard, I would recommend the course to someone who's willing and ready to be challenged. Of course, I didn't have the strongest chemistry background, and admittedly, I'm not a talented chemist, so someone who's taken orgo and is very good at chemistry will likely not face the difficulties I had. The class is disorganized, Dr. Schepartz isn't exactly the best facilitator of student learning, but the course offers a space and a challenge that allows you to learn a lot about yourself and how to improve your thinking process.

            "\u00a0For all students, organic chemistry is a way to approach formulaic learning though a holistic and conceptual edge. I would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Better taught than sophomore orgo! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course was very interesting and made me think in entirely new ways about problems. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to someone who does not need to take it. However, for a first-year with the option to take this course instead of sophomore organic chemistry I think this course is the way to go. ",
            "\u00a0Most take this course as a requirement for majors, pre-med, or future chemistry. Not the most interesting or widely useful class outside of that purpose. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class as it gives a good overview of Organic Chemistry II subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Although I enjoyed the course in a way because I liked the chemistry, I would not recommend it to others unless it is required. However, I do believe that first year chemistry is worth it because it bypasses potentially less interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0If you're choosing between this and the regular organic chemistry class, consider what you want to get out of the class.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking to learn a lot about organic chemistry, then this is the course for you. It goes more in depth than the other class does, and the overall atmosphere of the class is more intellectual, since everyone in it is good at chemistry. \r\n\r\nIf you simply want to coast by and get a good grade, then the other organic chemistry class is probably better for you. From what I've heard, the curve is easier, and you won't have to cover the more difficult reactions that's covered in this class. ",
            "\u00a0As the course is organized and formatted right now, no I would not recommend this course to another student unless they already have a strong grasp on the material and don't need any help or guidance through the material. The level of disorganization in the course really hindered my abilities to learn and understand the material, as well as to feel prepared for the assessments that we had throughout the semester. Quite frankly, there was never a day when I looked forward to going to this class, and I never really enjoyed the class or the material presented, which is a shame because I find organic chemistry to be really interesting. I think that if the course made a lot of changes to fix all of the weaknesses that I outlined above, I would recommend the course to another student; however, as the class is formatted now, I would not recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to learn a lot of reactions and reagents, and learn about many mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students majoring in MCDB or chemical engineering because it is helpful to skip general chemistry in order to start the required classes in the major.  Try to take a lighter course load with it though because it requires a good amount of time spent studying and reviewing the material. ",
            "\u00a0It is a challenging but great course. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to most other students, given its teaching style and fast pace. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in chemistry, this is the class for you! Organic chemistry is important in so many different research fields. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. The skills learned and content are relevant in everyday life (to some extent) and overall it's interesting. However, I would not recommend if the class is being offered with Dr. Schepartz. Her classroom set-up did not set students up for success. ",
            "\u00a0No- if required, sophomore organic chemistry just makes sense. Easier and closer to MCAR (if youre Pre-med) ",
            "\u00a0There's no other way to learn organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0If you took Orgo 1 you're already in too deep.  Go all in, I think its worth it even though Orgo 2 is so much harder. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I found second semester orgo to be a lot more clear and straightforward than first semester orgo, and professor Schepartz and the teaching team do an excellent job teaching the material. It was definitely a step up in terms of work, but I found a grasp of the concepts in this class to be more rewarding as well. Furthermore, the first-year only nature of the course made it enjoyable, and a great environment to learn in. Put in the work, and this class will be a blast. Probably my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course, it will take much more time than Orgo I, but you'll need to take this anyway for Pre-med or your major. Orgo II is a pretty time-consuming class if you want to learn the content well but it feels great when you're done ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class is exemplary for how a lecture-style organic chemistry course should be taught. Dr. Schepartz lectures with passion and clarity, and although you cover a lot of content if you can balance diligence and curiosity with a dose of grit and awareness that the grade might not always not numerically reflect your learning, then you'll do great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to someone who has had background in organic chemistry in high school and/or someone who has a lot of free time in their schedule to put in the hours and hours it takes to keep up with this class. It's definitely challenging, and it often feels like a losing battle. I feel like after going through it once, only now do I have the grounding to go back and do well in the class, were I to take it a second time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you need it for premed requirements or a major. Other than that, I don't know if taking this class with this teacher is worth it because the struggles that come as a result of her teaching style and lack of communication is not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. Requires a very particular type of thinking which depends a lot on intuition and past experience. If you don't have that, then the class will be very difficult to do well in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Schepartz is amazing and will instill in you a love for organic chemistry. Its amazing how much Ive learned in only one semester. ",
            "\u00a0No. If you want to take organic chemistry and learn about reactions, take regular organic chemistry. The class taught under Professor Schepartz will teach you information, but is poorly taught and does not facilitate student learning. You will have a bad experience with the class if she teaches it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you need to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student with a passion for organic chemistry. While fascinating, this course requires a high level of intense and constant engagement with the material, so a passion for chemistry is necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in chemistry. It can be a lot of work but in the end it is rewarding and I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for only Chemistry major students as well as Pre-med track as necessary "
