            "\u00a0I learned SO much about how to listen to music, talk about music, and appreciate music. I knew almost nothing going in and I feel like I can really engage about music now. I listen better and can also discuss the historical contexts of the music ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great overview of music history from the Classical Period forward and I learned so much about how to discuss music and analyze it ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach listening to music with an ear toward its context in history and broad movements and themes over time with genre. ",
            "\u00a0Active music listening skills; how history interacts with music ",
            "\u00a0This has been a really fun and surprisingly educational class. \r\nFor a sub-intro level course it really expanded my musical repertoire. ",
            "\u00a0listening strategies for various styles of music from the baroque to modern eras ",
            "\u00a0Marissa was fabulous and MADE this course what it was. She helped me to listen and find meaning in what I heard such that I could track, auditorily, changes and patterns in music through western art music history. "

            "\u00a0This class is very well-organized and makes students work very consistently to learn the material, which is wonderful. I really have no complaints except that I think it would be a better experience if there were fewer people who knew essentially everything going in -- I occasionally felt behind on technical terms despite my best efforts to keep up because there were so many serious musicians in the class. Other than that, I have no complaints! And Marissa is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was great in a seminar style, I think that it could be improved with maybe less essays or the essay guidelines should be better explained because I think it was a little confusing to decide exactly what to write and to understand what was expected. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very flexible and can be taught in a hundred ways depending on what your instructor wants to focus on, but it's just a very comfortable and accepting environment for students of all levels of musicianship. I can think of no real weaknesses aside from that sometimes it felt very memorization-based, but the work was never overwhelming and listening to music as work was always fun. ",
            "\u00a0Assessments can be a bit too focused on memorization ",
            "\u00a0The amount of time distributed between subjects was pretty disproportionate. We would spend a lot of time on composers and pieces that weren't very important and weren't tested, and then would glance over more significant things. We also spent a ton of time on modernism which just is not music. If I were a chef and I gave you a turd on a plate that I told you was \"modern food\" you would tell me that that isn't food. Sure it could be eaten, but it shouldn't be, isn't very often, and certainly isn't written about it text books. ",
            "\u00a0Marissa was engaging and made the material increadibly interesting and accesible to music novice. The textbook online was fabulous in its use of tech to help you learn material! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, ESPECIALLY if you know nothing about music. I would say this ranks in my top few life-changing courses at Yale (I am a senior AND a humanities major). I was nervous about not having a strong background, but the consistency and accessibility of the assignments makes it totally possible to learn and succeed in this class regardless. I also think it's fabulous that this class is no longer a lecture and now is taught in small sections; it is well facilitated for individual engagement and learning. Marissa is also amazing but I don't think she's teaching in the future (if she is, TAKE IT WITH MARISSA!). ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to someone else, it was a lot of fun and definitely my favorite class this semester. ",
            "\u00a0I wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone who even remotely enjoys music. I have a much better understanding of the institutions that have shaped the musical canon we know today and have a better understanding of what I'm hearing when I hear music in my everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great HU credit for STEM majors. ",
            "\u00a0This is definitely a good course to take, not nearly as easy as everyone promised me it would be, but I enjoyed the things I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely with Marissa! "
