            "\u00a0I developed an appreciation for thinking about the \"nonhuman\" as a way of considering works of literature. This was not a concept I'd previously thought about. ",
            "\u00a0Honed skills of critical analysis, applying theoretical concepts to readings, and treating readings of many genres with the same level of attention and consideration. "

            "\u00a0In some ways, the syllabus was a great strength of the course in that the texts were interesting. On the other hand, I did not feel like the readings between weeks were connected enough that I felt like there was continuity through the semester until the end when we were working on our final papers and had to compare at least two texts. I also would have liked to have had a fewer total number of readings and had more than a week on each text. There were a couple readings where I did not get to the very end because they were relatively long books. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths included the wonderful readings and the challenging discussions. Really engaging class! I think that a little more time could have been spent on introductions at the beginning, because by the end, there were still some students who I didn't really know. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well paced and very well structured.  It was a good idea to begin with a couple of weeks of professor led classes so as to orient students to the material and discussion flow of the course, then handing classes off to students to lead based on their close readings of the book for the week was a great way to get everyone engaged and familiar with the material.

            "\u00a0Great class! It's a senior seminar, so be prepared to engage in depth with the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone in the English major looking to expand their reading material, or anyone outside the major interested in questions of personhood and the roles humans and the nonhuman play in each other's worlds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, any course with Professor Dimock is an opportunity worth taking. "
