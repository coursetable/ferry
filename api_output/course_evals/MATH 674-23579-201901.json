            "\u00a0I learned a lot of big theorems/techniques in combinatorics, ranging from graph-y problems to set system-y problems (lots of those) to geometry-y problems, and everything in between. It was kind of a wonderful hodge-podge that still managed to be surprisingly coherent. ",
            "\u00a0The course really emphasizes proof strategies and techniques over results. We touched on linear algebra, entropy, linear programming, and probabilistic methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about combinatorics. A special emphasis was placed on extremal (usually, \"biggest\") families of subsets of a given (finite) set which satisfy certain conditions. ",
            "\u00a0Many interesting topics and techniques in extremal combinatorics: probabilistic method, using entropy in combinatorics, linear algebra applications, families of sets, graph problems... ",
            "\u00a0I developed a deep understanding of the most extreme cases of different combinatorial and graph-related structures, with an emphasis on theorems and modern research. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a hands-on survey of many branches of extremal combinatorics. ",
            "\u00a0Too much knowledge ",
            "\u00a0This course is basically a survey course.  Each week or so centers on a different proof technique and each lecture is a bunch of neat applications of that technique.  There isn't any driving goal or culminating result of the course, just a string of cool concepts and beautiful proofs. "

            "\u00a0Lectures are great, assignments are interesting, topics well-selected, final project appropriate. As one area for improvement: some of the pset questions were open-ended, which was sometimes hard to force yourself to fully engage with on a tight time budget during the semester. I wonder if there's some way to incentivize exploration more, like having groups of students discuss their results after? Extra credit? ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging, and the professor (Pat) is very approachable. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very interesting and covered a great selection of topics and the psets were very fun. i really liked the format of choosing which problems to work on. ",
            "\u00a0Could be more organized; I felt like we learned a scattering of topics, and while everything was interesting, it didn't feel like it built toward something by the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Pat is lots of fun as a teacher.  I think, though, that he had a hard time figuring out how to run a grad class (since this was his first time), which was a bit disappointing.  Part of the problem was that the students were almost all undergrads.  The material was interesting, but the pace was too slow.  I also think that Pat often skipped the wrong kinds of details: he would spend a long time explaining a fairly straightforward point, then he would omit a shifting proof because he didn't feel like doing it.  I also wish that Pat had covered a wider range of topics (we spent about half of the semester on intersecting set families, but we never talked about things like the Erdos-Gizburg-Ziv Theorem).  Problem sets were generally interesting and always reasonable. ",

            "\u00a0I would most certainly recommend this course to another student. The problem sets are long but there aren't many of them, and Pat's lectures are SUPER engaging, SUPER clear, SUPER interesting and will enrich your mathematical understanding of, I don't know, probably everything. Combinatorics is pretty accessible and the techniques don't require a lot of past courses, so it's pretty ideal. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend any class with Pat.\r\nAs for extremal combo in particular, it is very different from (say) Algebraic Topology, in that it doesn't build up a central machinery, but instead examines many distinct problems individually. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0yes absolutely! it was a very fun and relaxed advanced math course that (i think) is accessible to many students! It is also very cool to see how a number of techniques from different fields come into play in combinatorics. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fun class if you want to learn about some topics in extremal combinatorics.  Pat's lectures are engaging and almost always clear.  For someone looking for a hard-core graduate-level research-geared combinatorics course, this would be a bit disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  Extremal combinatorics is fascinating and Pat is great. "
