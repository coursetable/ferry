            "\u00a0I learned how to write LaTeX in MATLAB and re-learned some stuff I had forgotten from undergrad, like how to solve linear ODEs and how to write a for loop in MATLAB. ",
            "\u00a01) a better appreciation for nonlinear DE's and the amazing behaviors that can result from them\r\n2) a very clear picture of stochastic processes (diffusion, etc)\r\n3) deepened my appreciation for the ear as a physical device. The ear is totally amazing. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: biological content is cool / interesting\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n* terribly taught. Nobody is going to pay attention to you writing calculus on the board for one and a half hours. \r\n* pronumerals are often used without explanation, such that I spend an entire class wondering what mu is.\r\n* equations from the course notes are often referred to in the homework without referencing which set of notes and which page. Homework shouldn't be a treasure hunt.\r\n* homework frequently contained errors. Get your act together\r\n* homework uploaded to portal far too late. One week is not enough for a final project. One assignment was uploaded less than two days before the due date.\r\nImprovements:\r\n* think about the concepts that you are trying to teach. Nobody gains anything by watching you work through the calculus for an hour. What is the take home message? We benefit much more from an in depth discussion of what Fokker-Planck implies than from watching you struggle to derive it. ",
            "\u00a0Really fun course, no real improvements I could suggest. \r\n\r\nMaybe give extra solved example questions to help students build intuition on how to approach different problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very clear presentation of mathematical methods and their application, although could have been more in depth at times.\r\nWeakness: lack of cohesive flow to the course. Switching back and forth between Prof. Howard and Prof. Emonet disrupted the flow. Would have been better if each of them had had his own self-contained half. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, the course presents most students with a new perspective on biological systems, and emphasizes thinking of a physical or mathematical theory to describe phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Most certainly not. It's a waste of time. I didn't learn anything more than a few biological novelties / curiosities that would be better appreciated by spending a single evening browsing wikipedia and watching a couple of review lectures from undergraduate mathematics. ",
