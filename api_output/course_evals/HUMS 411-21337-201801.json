            "\u00a0This class is unlike any other at Yale. You get the unique opportunity to truly understand what you value most. Every week, we discuss a different tradition, and I learned so much about the various beliefs that shape peoples vision of a life worth living. I had never previously thought about any of this before. Its also an incredible experience that you share with phenomenal classmates as the staff does an amazing job of selecting its class. ",
            "\u00a0This class opened my mind to numerous traditions that have shaped, and continue to shape, billions of people around the world. ",
            "\u00a0I came into the course with little understanding of the value of religion. I left with a much better understanding of its value and important place in today's world. I learnt a lot about analyzing religious and other traditions from my classmates, who each had their own perspective to add to discussions and who were constantly contributing nuanced insights. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the Abrahamic religious traditions and several other secular or religious ideologies practiced around the world. By reflecting upon my own beliefs and comparing them to the practices we studied, I was better able to identify what qualities in life are most valuable to me. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a unique, Yale-exclusive opportunity to evaluate what you want from your life and what you believe currently in a structured manner. The curriculum was great from my perspective -- I don't know too much about religious studies, so I don't know what may have been missing. I learned a lot about various philosophical and religious traditions, including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, humanism, Buddhism, and utilitarianism. \r\n\r\nWe wrote a lot, so that would be the most concrete skill we practiced and learned. The other skill that's a bit tougher to explain is that we learned the vocabulary to discuss life goals and personal morality. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course helped me strengthen my already existing belief system about the world. Also, I learned a lot about the visions of a life worth living espoused by other major religions and philosophic traditions. ",
            "\u00a0- Thinking about what the life worth living in the framework of the tripartite structure \r\n- Having different traditions - religious and otherwise - in mind when thinking about the life worth living. \r\n- Thinking about the life worth living from a secular perspective \r\n- Thinking about our version of the life worth living by identifying what's worth wanting in life. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me to question everything, and it also taught me what kinds of questions to ask, or how to ask good questions. This is a class that will impact the way I interact with and think about the world. ",
            "\u00a0To listen to others, learn about their lives, read texts charitably, be open to the possibility that one's mind can change. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing. It provides a context for viewing traditions charitably and in detail. The retreat is life-changing, and the class changed the way I see the world. "

            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to the traditions it explores, though because each only receives a week's worth of attention, readings and discussions about each tradition sometimes feels a bit rushed and superficial. ",
            "\u00a0When prefrosh are in the process of deciding to go to Yale or not, I feel as if they are sold a lot of promises about what classes will be like: high quality discussions in class and the formation of deep friendships amongst other things. In my experience, most classes at Yale have been good if not great. However, I had yet to stumble upon \"the promised class\" until this semester. That class is Life Worth Living. If you feel like the learning environment you expected never materialized, this is the class for you.\r\n\r\nSpecifically the course's greatest strength (in my opinion) is its instructors. The instructors are very good at creating an environment in which students form bonds and become close. This is crucial in developing discussion sections that are willing to participate in personal and vulnerable reflection.\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses to note. ",
            "\u00a0The professors and students who choose to teach and take this class are amazing. While I did not do all of the readings, the samples I did read were engaging and insightful. I really enjoyed the twice-a-week seminars. The primary area in which the course could improve is in its lectures. Two of our lecturers cancelled last-minute, which made our exploration of those particular traditions much less in-depth. In future years, I think the program should have back-up plans in case this happens again. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n - unique experience\r\n - good curriculum\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n - a test might have been good to make sure that we developed strong understandings of all the material ",
            "\u00a0The course is basically an overview of a number of different traditions. I think the course is really strong in its development of a theoretical framework that it then applies to the different traditions. The course struggles a bit with the homogeneity of its teaching staff, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Comprehensive \r\n- Great professors \r\n- Engaging \r\n- Great students to learn from and with. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- Not a lot of emphasis on secular thought on the life worth living \r\n- The representative/speaker of the week session should come before the class discussion \r\n- One week is not enough for every tradition. It should be expanded to a week and a half or make the course more thematic i.e. tackling one theme of the life worth living from the perspectives of different traditions as opposed to separating them in different traditions. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class. There are two seminars and then 1 big lecture with all the sections each week. In section we would discuss the readings and then in lecture we would meet someone who actually practiced whatever religion/philosophy we read about that week. Obviously you can't go super in depth with a practice by spending only one week on it, but it's a good survey of different world views. I would say maybe we didn't have the most exciting conversations, but what I got out of it was learning about all the different approaches, breaking down/analyzing a tradition, and most importantly thinking about what I actually wanted from life, which I think is bigger than having super exciting conversations in class. \r\nThere were a LOT of readings some weeks and it was such a waste that we were required to print all of them. I understand the value of having the readings in front of you, but we often focused on one or two out of the several, and I printed out hundreds of pages of readings. Carl Sagan would want us to protect our planet!! ",
            "\u00a0Is there a way to change the structure from exploring different traditions or religions to doing so with different themes of life eg money, food, sexuality, death, education etc? We don't go quite in depth enough for each tradition and some articles are far better than others. I also wonder why most of the texts selected by the theme are written strictly by white men, instead of having a more diverse pool of writers? It doesn't seem like many of the works, except JSM or Nietzsche, are that fundamental anyway. ",
            "\u00a0In most academic settings, survey classes are somewhat clinical in the way they dissect and poke different traditions. Life Worth Living views each tradition charitably, viewing each tradition through the eyes of someone who actually lives it. The one weakness is that it's so spiritual and meaningful that I often forgot it was a class and was graded. "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE BEFORE YOU GRADUATE. Seriously. This is a must take course at Yale  do it for the intellectually stimulating conversations, the phenomenal classmates, the incredible weekly guest lectures, and professors who truly care about their students. I have never had the opportunity to really confront and define what I believe in before, and this class offered me an opportunity to really solidify what I truly value in life. Its unlike any other course at Yale, and it was one of my absolute favorites in my four years. I will cherish the time our class had together for so many years to come. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about themselves and/or the people around them. ",
            "\u00a0When prefrosh are in the process of deciding to go to Yale or not, I feel as if they are sold a lot of promises about what classes will be like: high quality discussions in class and the formation of deep friendships amongst other things.

If you feel like the learning environment you expected never materialized, this is the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students, particularly to seniors soon to leave Yale. The course is refreshing and relaxed, and it helped me better soak in my final semester of college. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It's a wonderful opportunity to think more about your goals and principles in a structured environment with compassionate students and professors. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, I think this is a solid course to take if you're looking to do some self-exploration and learn more about other faith and philosophical traditions. Also, you get pretty close with the people in your section which is lovely. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is one of the classes that every student should take before graduating from Yale (Prefarably early in their college career). It will allow them to make decisions in college in a more structured and organized way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes. Please take it, but you have to take it seriously and taking this class will make you want to take it seriously. There's a lot of readings and you have to do at least some of it to write the almost weekly reading responses, but I think you will want to do all of them. I really found this class spiritually fulfilling and very reassuring. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a class like no other. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY this is the best class I've taken at Yale hands down. It is life-changing (especially the retreat, I'm not the person to do retreats but DO IT). Everyone at Yale should take this class because it will make you a better and happier person (and not in the Psych and the Good Life way but the real way) "
