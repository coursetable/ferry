I learned a lot about the finite-sample and asymptotic properties of commonly-used estimators, such as the maximum likelihood estimate, method of moments estimates, and Bayes estimates, as well as the settings in which each is appropriate.  I also strengthened my understanding of the theory of hypothesis testing, and am glad to have learned about the distributions of various test statistics in detail.  I am also grateful to have studied ANOVA and regression in great detail; these are topics that are typically discussed in several statistics courses, but the theoretical underpinnings of these concepts are very important for any aspiring statistician to understand and I believe that Professor Barron's explanations of them were excellent.\r\n\r\nI believe that what I am most grateful for is Professor Barron's thorough explanations of how many of estimators we studied are derived and what distributions they follow.  In studying these derivations I got a lot of practice with using Taylor series arguments, asymptotic arguments, and the basic definitions of the normal, t, F, and chi-square distributions.  I believe that understanding these derivations is essential for further study of statistical theory, and this class provides a very solid foundation for doing so. ",

Statistical analysis is a very useful technique and I feel there should be more real-world examples and reinforcement into using these techniques on different data sets. The latter half of the course was fantastic, yet I feel it was rushed as so much time was spent on early homeworks that were very theoretical. I feel that the lectures could have been more structured. Most lectures felt like a random walk through Professor Barron's mind. There was no clear narrative in any lecture that I attended and I felt very lost and confused after class. It took a lot of reading and rereading the course textbook before I could decipher any notes taken from class. I feel that if Professor Barron could improve this course by starting with concrete examples from the textbook before moving into deeper material. However, I feel the lectures may have been too short to do this. ",
            "\u00a0good combination of material covered and depth of instruction. helpful that Dr. Barron called on random students, people seemed to like that or at least stay more engaged. biggest complaint is handwriting on the board was very small/all over the place, so it was very hard to read, even in the front.

            "\u00a0I think that the course should skip Minitab and just use R.  I don't think anyone taking statistics at this level will really do data analysis in Minitab in the end, and I think most people taking this course will do data analysis in their careers.  People who aren't that serious about statistics won't take this course.\r\n\r\nI sometimes found lectures hard to follow.  I wasn't always clear about the relationship between the book and the lectures.\r\n\r\nI did not like the book.  What it proved and what it just took for granted seemed almost random.  Sometimes the most important points were treated as almost parenthetical in the book or buried in example explanations.  I liked the book Winston Lin used for probability last semester much better, although I realize that it doesn't cover statistics per se.  I found its writing much clearer. ",

The motivation for each statistical concept that we studied was carefully explained, so that it was never unclear why certain estimators or methods were important.  Homework was helpful for reinforcing the concepts we discussed in lecture and was graded quickly.  The TAs were exceptional and had a very thorough understanding of the material.  The textbook we used is also excellent and will surely be a helpful reference in the future.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am unable to think of any at this time.  Perhaps adding an extra (optional) challenge problem or two to the homework assignments could be fun! ",

The homework assignments were very long and tedious as they asked far too many questions on the same somewhat simple topics. This lead to frustration for everyone as it was easy to understand what was going on yet one had to write out tens of pages of solutions to get credit for the homework. The homework grades did not reflect the amount of work necessary to complete each one. I am not annoyed about the grades I received but about the number of marks awarded to each question. As I mentioned earlier, some of these questions took pages to write a complete solution yet, were only worth 3 marks. If these questions lacked sufficient rigour to be marked out of 3 then why were such long solutions necessary. ",

(Linear Models, which S&DS master's students are allowed to use to satisfy the stat requirement, is an excellent and fundamental course, but it doesn't cover certain topics, e.g. maximum likelihood estimation or sufficiency, like 242/542 does.) Other than for such people, judging from admittedly brief lookovers at Jay Emerson or Joe Chang's intro stat classes, those cover as much statistics as I think you'll realistically need. ",

It is essential to anyone considering graduate-level study of statistics, and is also a worthwhile course for mathematics and applied mathematics majors.  Many graduate students in statistics may have taken a course like these previously during their undergraduate studies, but I think revisiting the material a second time is highly beneficial. ",
