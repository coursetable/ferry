            "\u00a0My writing skills improved incredibly after taking this class, and I learned what it was like to participate in a seminar classroom setting. This was an experience that I never had while in high school so it was extremely valuable for me. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved dramatically, as well as my ability to read and understand dense academic texts. I learned about the border and its history but more importantly, I deepened my understanding of what it means to be Mexican or American. Very engaging course ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about writing, critical reading, and the US-Mexico border. I was all very fascinating and was a very good learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0MY writing definitely improved in this course. It was a lot of work, but you get out what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a very good introduction, for first-year students, to learn the writing expected at Yale. The structure of writing and strengths of arguments/claims are well covered in this class. Im addition, the class is great to learn about the process of writing a research paper. The instructor also does a great job of staying relevant to the topic of the class, which helped me learn many things about the US-Mexico border and social, political, and economic interactions related to it. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I was able to explore the different issues affecting the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands that I had not considered previously. This class provided an introduction to the study of racial minorities and gave me valuable insight into the humanities. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the readings that the instructor chose for us because almost every single one was extremely engaging. Everyday we spoke as a class about the readings but I would also like to see some more presentations about class topics (something that we started later in the semester) because these activities generate a lot of great discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how we were given a strict deadline for rough drafts before the final paper. Those initial teacher comments were very helpful in improving my writing. The amount of reading is adequate. The amount of writing in the course was perfect too, enough to practice and improve but not overwhelming. I know its difficult to discuss a text in 75 minutes, but I would have enjoyed deeper discussions of the readings, rather than broad overviews. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it really does improve your writing. I think everyone in the class grew a lot as a writer and is now more prepared for Yale writing assignments. The weakness of this course is that it is a lot of work. Be ready for a lot of readings and constant writing. It is all worth it in the end though! ",
            "\u00a0Its writing intensive. Thats it. Theres a lot of room for discussion, which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0The class stays relatively interesting throughout the year, but the class revolves heavily around discussion in class. If the class is quiet then the class becomes stale and boring at times. "

            "\u00a0Yes! You will learn so much and if you are truly interested in this topic, then you will look forward to every single class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very insightful readings on the history and relationships of the U.S. Mexico border. Also a great way to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wanted to improve their writing and didn't mind a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another student looking for feedback on his or her writing. This course helps break the mold for kids who are used to writing five-paragraph essays in high school. Its a good introduction to college writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course made me grow a lot as a writer and is one of the few classes at Yale that really delves into the issue of US-Mexico border relations and history. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student if they are interested in gaining an introduction to the topic of Chicano studies. "
