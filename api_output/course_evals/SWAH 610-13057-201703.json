Then I finally realized that through repetition and learning from written exercises and grammar, that I was actually developing a structure of understanding.  I still have a great deal of difficulty understanding my professors in class.  They speak quickly, and I am not easily able to understand what words they are saying, even though I have learned the words.  In other words, I cannot readily distinguish their words in speech. "

My only complaint is that often we are required to respond in learning assessments to very small photocopied photographs in which it is almost impossible for me to identify the subject and action of the photograph to guess what idea it represents so that I can respond with the appropriate Swahili answer.
