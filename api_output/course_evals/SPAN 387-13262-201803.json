            "\u00a0I gained a much deeper understanding of Borges as an author and of his writing. It also helped me learn how to write longer papers/essays. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the impact of the legendary writer Jorge Luis Borges on the world of literature, especially in South America and Europe. We learned about the incredibly unique genre and structure of his stories and their impacts on the way people think about literature. "

            "\u00a0Dry but super super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the syllabus was both very manageable and interesting, with a good blend of critical essays and secondary authors. One logistical point: about 1/3 of all of the readings on Canvas--including the professor's own essays--were in languages not required for the class (Spanish, Italian, French) and it was often a hassle to track down translated versions.  \r\n\r\nI think the class would be better if there was more opportunity for discussion, or alternately if the lecture section had more of a clear and coherent historical or literary contextualization. (Often, I think the minimal discussion made it seem like people in the class hadn't done the reading, which was not true.) I'd never studied Latin American literature and or history, and would have liked a bit more of a thorough background. ",
            "\u00a0It is taught very well and is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It was well structured for learning, and the mix of fiction and nonfiction readings presented made for some interesting lectures. However, student participation was generally restricted to 3-minute presentations (given daily) despite the small size of the class. "
