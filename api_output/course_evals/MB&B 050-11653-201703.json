            "\u00a0I learnt how to write a grant as well as many important hallmarks of cancer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a whole lot about the cellular mechanisms behind cancer while still reviewing the basics of Biology. Gained valuable skills on interpreting and analyzing research papers and writing my own grant proposal. This whole class is strucutured to prepare me to apply for research in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to effectively read a scientific paper, and I learned about each major area of cancer research. This class was excellent in that it takes you through the history of cancer; you begin reading older papers and work your way up to more recent research. With this structure, the material is more interesting and it makes you appreciate the long history of cancer research. The most important skill I gained in this course was learning how to write a grant proposal. As a future scientist, this is an extraordinarily important skill that I was very happy to attain. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about cancer biology that I did not know before. I also developed my abilities to read and interpret scientific papers (even poorly written ones!). I also learned a lot about being a science/STEM student. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount of cancer biology over the course of the semester; I never imagined that I would learn so much in such a short amount of time. I learned so many things relating to biological processes in normal human cells, as well as changes that lead to cancer cells. I have always been interested in cancer, and this course just increased my interest and fascination every single day. I also learned many valuable skills that I will use throughout my academic career at Yale; I learned how to critically read scientific research papers, apply knowledge of various topics to understand a new concept, and write a research grant proposal. All of these skills will be very useful to me, since I am on the pre-med track, will major in science, and continue to take STEM classes throughout my time at Yale. This class taught me so much and I wouldn't trade any of the knowledge or skills that I developed over the course of this semester for anything. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding of cancer biology and learned how to read scientific papers and write a grant proposal. ",
            "\u00a0I learned as much as a person can learn in a semester about cancer at a biological and molecular level. I learned to reason my way through causes of cancer and possible cures and experiments that could lead to a cure. Also, I learned how to write a grant. ",
            "\u00a0learning to read biomedical research and clinical papers, also Sandy teaches you how to write a grant! He also talks a lot about MD/phD if that sounds remotely interesting ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the mechanisms of cancer while reinforcing general biology concepts. It also prepared me to read scientific papers and write in a scientific manner. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed the skills of critical, scientific thinking, reading a primary research paper, writing a research grant proposal, and I gained a lot of knowledge on cancer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply my knowledge in a different context and how to read really challenging scientific papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about cancer biology, the history of cancer, and developed a mechanistic understanding of many cancer pathways. ",

            "\u00a0I loved this course and the professor's engagement, as well as how much he cared about his students. I think the only thing that could be improved is for the final paper, there should be a more clear and descriptive document outlining what is expected and how to write the paper, since the example papers varied so much, students became a bit confused as to what the grant should look like. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-organized and structured. Even for a student like me who has a very poor Biology background, I can easily catch up and understand what the professor was saying. The professor ensures that all the students understand the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course. It is difficult, but 100% worth the time and effort. The biggest strength of this course is the professor, Dr. Chang. He is an amazing professor and engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0This course is nearly perfect. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a phenomenal job in presenting a variety of topics that are very prevalent and important in cancer biology. I loved how the course was able to connect a lot of the topics presented in a fluid way so that we could easily put a lot of our knowledge together and see how everything was connected, rather than learning everything in disjointed pieces. I also love the integration of scientific research papers throughout the course; I think it was very helpful to have to read a paper and do a problem set each week, because it not only helped to solidify the material learned in class, but it also developed our skills of being able to read major scientific research papers. If there is one thing that could be improved, I think that it would be helpful to have a lecture at the beginning of the course giving an overview of important biological concepts and terminology so that all students would have a similar level of understanding going into the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Sandy Chang is great and really takes the effort to get to know each and every one of his students. You get a great introduction to cancer biology and have the opportunity to read and analyze scientific literature. The course is well-organized and you will learn a lot! Only weakness is probably the fact that the class can be fast-paced and a little difficult in the beginning for those who have not had a ton of exposure to biology. ",
            "\u00a0It is a very difficult course if a student has not taken a more advanced course in biology, but overall, I see nothing but strengths for this course. It was entertaining, interesting, and the small environment made it really easy to work together. ",
            "\u00a0good course ",
            "\u00a0This course does an excellent job of providing an overview of cancer and some of the many ways it develops and attacks within the body. It challenges students with reading scientific papers and balances lectures with class discussion. It was a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I only see strengths. This was a very fun course with an amazing teacher. This course wasn't about memorizing information; it was about really understanding the material and being able to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was excellent. Some strengths include the emphasis on learning how to read papers, the engagement of Dean Chang with his students, and the overall structure of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Course was well-structured to teach the different hallmarks of cancer. Dean Chang was an excellent instructor and helped clarify confusing things in office hours.\r\nWeaknesses: The scientific literature can be really dense and hard to understand if you are not comfortable/familiar with the molecular biology lab techniques.

            "\u00a0great course for those interested in cancer! honestly my favorite course my first semester by far. not for people who don't have a foundation in biology; he talks about a lot about the core biology behind cancer mechanisms. sandy also is really receptive to meals and just talking about life, so he really makes the course great. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. The material is interesting and is presented in such a way that it requires you to think in different ways. The course could seem challenging, but it is extremely rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely helpful, highly informative, and incredibly interesting freshman seminar. I highly recommend it to any first-year interested in cancer, research, or a future in medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is interesting and relevant to everyone because cancer is so extensive and touches everyone in some way. Dean Chang is a great professor and lectures are in-depth and well prepared. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Although this course was challenging, I enjoyed it very much. Dr. Chang is an amazing teacher and knows the material very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are at all interested in science of cancer, this class will be one of the best classes you take at Yale. I thoroughly enjoyed every single class period. ",
