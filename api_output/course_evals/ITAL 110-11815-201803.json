            "\u00a0Speaking, writing, understanding basic italian. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a really good grasp of beginner Italian, from verbs to nouns and basic sentence structure. ",
            "\u00a0It was only the first semester, so I obviously don't know a ton yet. However, the things we have covered so far I feel comfortable writing and speaking about because everything was integrated as we went along. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic Italian grammar: nouns, adjectives, and verbs in the present tense, passato prossimo, trapassato prossimo, and imperfect tenses. I learned basic conversational skills and about Italian customs and culture. ",
            "\u00a0Became somewhat conversational in Italian and developed my general communication skills. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Italian comprehension and speaking skills ",
            "\u00a0I applied the basic grammar rules and vocabulary of Italian in writing compositions, developed my conversational skills, and learned about Italian culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of the Italian. ",
            "\u00a0Basic Italian grammar (nouns, verb tenses, types of pronouns, direct and indirect object pronouns, interrogatives, etc.) and vocabulary. Gained experience in writing compositions (temas) and speaking through in-class conversations and a final presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of Italian! "

        [
            "\u00a0Great teacher, some standardization of tests and quizzes across the L1 classes might be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the conversation activities and temi were very helpful. I also liked the format of having quizzes before the tests. However, I think that we sometimes used too many worksheets. ",
            "\u00a0I thought I learned a lot from the speaking and other activities we did in class. Also, I thought that the time put into the class was very effective for learning. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introductory course. There is a good mix between learning grammar through exercises and speaking out loud. The Italian department is wonderful, so you learn a lot without it being too intimidating- they do a great job of making the learning enjoyable. The only thing that I didn't like was the online workbook exercises. ",
            "\u00a0The course is quite easy, and I think it could be improved by adding more oral elements. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- immersive \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- moves very fast ",
            "\u00a0I loved that the course was very engaging, and speaking Italian during class made me feel more comfortable with the vocabulary and grammar. The weekly writing assignments were helpful, and I'm tremendously grateful for my professor's feedback. ",
            "\u00a0My strength was my ability to understand the grammar and combining all grammar together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the course meets every day, so it is easy to retain the material learned and review, not a lot of homework, frequent assessments (sounds bad, but less material per test/quiz). Weaknesses: Sometimes we wouldn't spend enough time on difficult concepts and too much time on easy concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Italian 110 is not overly demanding, which I appreciated very much. I obtained a great foundation to a new language. No weaknesses. "

Italy is a beautiful country with incredible culture and the language is fairly easy to learn, especially if you have experience in another romance language. It is a fun class, and although it meets every day, it isn't too much work or overwhelming in any way. You definitely get out of it what you put into it. ",

            "\u00a0Italian is a beautiful language, and I would recommend anyone to take it for its own sake, not because it is (supposedly) easy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you'd like to take a modern foreign language that is beautiful to speak and not overly demanding. "
