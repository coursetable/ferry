            "\u00a0I did not develop a single skill beyond learning how many ways I could be driven to stress and tears by a class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to self study for a class. No knowledge that I gained from this course was through lecture, but rather through Khan Academy and other online sources. My confidence in math has deteriorated completely. Having gotten a 5 in AP Calculus AB, taught at a math learning center, scored a 6 on the SL Math IB test, and gotten a 790 on SAT math, I can confidently say that this is the worst course I have ever taken in my life. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me more about how to take complicated integrals, polar and parametric functions, and volumes. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a somewhat better understanding of integral calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of independent learning since the math department doesnt hire competent instructors. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to see the fundamentals of calculus, which I had seen before, in a newer, more complex way with the introduction of concepts such as series and polar curves. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The problems sets are helpful for putting the material in the videos and the textbook in practice, but the order that some of the concepts were taught did not seem logical to me. There are a lot of opportunities for course-specific help (office hours, peer-tutors, review sessions), but the process of getting a tutor was difficult for me. ",
            "\u00a0Dont make grad students teach this class. Just dont. Or if you do, make sure theyre VETTED and actually can TEACH! Also, the flipped classroom format DOESNT WORK. Nobody likes it, nobody can learn from it, and everyone says the same thing in these evaluations every year. But yall dont even read these, do you? ",
            "\u00a0The professor was not very good at explaining things in an organized way ",
            "\u00a0I believe that Yale should choose professors that can speak English fluently and seamlessly to explain concepts in more than one way. I think that Yale should standardize this course so that professors across Math 115 classes are handing out the same materials and teaching concepts in similar ways. And most importantly, I think Yale should choose professors that seek to teach the Math 115 concepts in lecture, not display their own math expertise through proofs and random math facts that are not at all pertinent to our learning. ",
            "\u00a0All of the sections were taught very differently (i.e. some had powerpoints, guided notes) and I think that the students learned the material to varying degrees of proficiency because of that. I know it's impossible to have each section be identical, but I think the course would be greatly improved if there were more uniformity across all sections. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Peer tutors. Maybe that there was some more theoretical discussion of the principals. Can't really think of one. Possibly that it is a small class setting but this proves to be a weakness. I guess the problem sets were helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Each section of the course is taught by different instructors with extremely varying teaching goals, methods, and engagement. Although the instructors meet to discuss course goals outside of class, instructors can teach whatever they want whatever way they want, regardless of if it is effective or not. One section may have an experienced instructor who genuinely cares about teaching and effectively conveying the material in an interesting, or at least relevant manner. However, for most sections this was not the case. Most sections received a second or third year grad student who has never taught a course in his or her life before, and did not have guidance or any framework/idea of how to effectively do so. The newer instructors were destined to fail, evidently having little resources or instruction of how to actually teach a class. This skewed the entire fairness of the class, rendering students in some sections prepared for the exams and others helplessly scrambling to self-teach core principals of the course. Also, the exams were graded harshly, offering very little partial credit. There was a question that not a single person in my section got correct on an exam, and instead of questioning the relevance of the question or the effectiveness of the instructor in teaching that principal, the fact that everyone got the question wrong was ignored. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by hiring instructors that provide concrete examples and are able to explain what theyre doing rather than just writing equations on the board. ",
            "\u00a0If a student in the class is struggling, their success is relies on the ability of the instructor to provide clear and helpful learning material (does not refer to extra help and resources, as students have the same access to those things). In my experience, not all the professors of this course have the same ability to provide such instruction. "

        [
            "\u00a0Not particularly, unless you need the course or have a strong background in the topics covered in this course, because it is not geared towards students who have little to no experience. ",
            "\u00a0Dear god, no. If you can avoid taking this class, dont take it. But unfortunately, its a required prerequisite for many majors, so you get to keep being terrible and dont acrually have to change anything because enrollment wont change year to year. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. The only reason people take this course is because they have to. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to my greatest enemy. If a strong math student has a background in anything less than Calculus BC, then Math 115 is not the course for them (despite supposedly being the equivalent to BC). I took Calculus AB in high school, scored a 5 on the AP test, and could not understand a lick of Math 115 material through lecture. Eventually I realized that I would have to teach myself ALL of the material since my professor could not answer my questions coherently, could not teach the material that would be covered on our tests, and would laugh when we received poor grades on our midterms. If you are looking to take Math 115 as your final math course, or to fulfill a QR, here is a word of advice: don't. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it's required for one's major or you want to use it to fulfill a QR requirement. Your success is not defined by what section you are in, but some sections are much better than others and will better prepare you for midterms and finals. ",
            "\u00a0No. Unless there were drastic changes in the instruction and structure of the class, definitely not. ",
            "\u00a0Not unless they are a stem major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student only if it is a requirement for their major. "
