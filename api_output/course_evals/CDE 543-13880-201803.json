            "\u00a0Strengths: Spending time in class is very enjoyable. The work that we do while in class is insightful and relevant. Debbie makes class discussion great. \r\nWeaknesses: Literally any and all work that we did outside of the classroom. There is SO MUCH to do every week. If you even get slightly behind get ready to get buried. Most of the work done outside of class feels like busy work which makes it so hard to want to keep up with. The final is also ridiculous. The final is a tiny thesis disguised as a group project. Get ready to spend about 30+ hours working on the final. \r\n\r\nHonestly, unless you have TONS of free time and are will to put up with busy work don't take this course. It seems like an easy course but it is anything but. ",
            "\u00a0Really high learning value and I got to think critically about things I had always wanted to learn about but either didn't know how to go about it, or didn't have time to do it independently. But it was a lot of work -- probably close to twice as much work compared to the classes I took last semester. It was nice having lots of different assignments, but the caveat was that we didn't know how to do a lot of the assignments (systems thinking, for example), and it would have been more meaningful (and less stressful/frustrating towards the end) if we had a semester-long project through which we engaged with that type of analysis to be more grounded in principles of holistic evaluation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course. It helped establish a basic understanding of nutrients and infectious diseases, while also encouraging me to think critically about big questions and dilemmas in global nutrition. \r\n\r\nMy suggestions:\r\n-Because the assignments were different each module, it was hard to keep track of deadlines and new assignments. I would have preferred a more consistent format throughout the semester.\r\n-It was great to read books and discuss them, but there needs to be some assignment tied to a book if it is assigned. I spent hours reading My Ishmael but know others only read the book description on Amazon, but there was no accountability.\r\n-The final project actually ended up going okay for my group, but I think students were so worried at first because the instructions were overwhelming. There needs to be shorter, clearer instructions/rubrics, and more training on the IRDs/causal loop diagram/etc. process. More examples from previous years might have been helpful, too. ",

            "\u00a0Overall, this is a great course which tackles the issues of food and nutrition globally from a number of angles - individual nutrients and the conditions caused by deficiencies, the sustainability of the food system, and, finally, the links between nutrition and infectious diseases.  The strengths of this course are its breadth and the care that Dr Humphries puts into the selection of material to read and then to teach.  Dr Humphries teaches this class to think critically about what can be known about food and nutrition and about the workings of the food system.  The assessment in this course is carefully chosen to allow students to try new forms of writing/thinking - assessing an article, doing a book review, answering a question using statistical data, and then a causal loop diagram.  The weakness (if you can call it that) is that this class does take consistent work throughout the week, in addition to the extra assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the overall material of the course, and certain sections in particular. I also generally appreciated our in-class discussion. This was much more a seminar-type class than I had anticipated, but the discussions were usually interesting. I liked the handouts that included data from a number of related studies, as well as the overall variety of the class structure and material. \r\n\r\nThe major weaknesses of this class were actually tied to its strengths. Sometimes the discussions could go off-topic, or one student or perspective dominate the conversation. While the variety kept things fresh and engaging, sometimes it made the workload difficult to predict. The final project, for example, was so much work and so expansive, especially when compared to the midterm. The final would have been better if spread out more over the semester and integrated in with some of the smaller, weekly assignments. The regions could have been narrowed down to fewer countries as well. Lastly, I was initially really excited that one of our assignments was to read a fictional book, because I think it is great to incorporate different sources of ideas into the curriculum. Unfortunately, I really felt that My Ismael was poorly done, which kept me from engaging fully with some of the more interesting points. "

            "\u00a0I found it refreshing how much we were challenged to be skeptics, although it definitely left us a little bitter and angsty about the food system situation. Are we doomed? Yeah, probably. ",

In this course, she is teaching her students to think critically about the food system as well as giving us the baseline knowledge to understand the issues with the food system.  She is teaching her students to question - the food system in general, as well as the application of certain scientific methods to food and nutrition problems - and she does an excellent job of it. ",
            "\u00a0She was always very engaged with the class, even when we were discussing things in small groups. She kept things moving and provided structure in our discussions. She kept things interesting by varying the assignment types and class style. "

Also, if you like food, it's always important to know what exactly you like (food isn't just what you eat, but a whole, often invisible, system). ",
