            "\u00a0Really interesting stuff about quantum mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0In 441, you learn a LOT. Most of the class time is spent learning about various approximation methods: perturbation theory (both time independent and time dependent), the WKB approximation, and the variational principle. Some time is spent learning scattering and addition of angular momentum, and Skiba sprinkles in some topics of interest through the course. This semester, we learned a bit of quantum computing, some path integral formulation, and applications of symmetries in QM. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the logical continuation of PHYS 440; after learning the basics of quantum mechanics, this class teaches you how to apply the basic postulates through various approximation schemes. It covers basically the second half of Griffith's textbook. From Griffith's, we covered the addition of angular momenta, time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory, the variational principle, the WKB approximation, and scattering. In addition, Professor Skiba delivered lectures on symmetries and group theory, quantum computing, and the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of miscellaneous tools for doing various Quantum problems. Not as linear or focused as the first semester, but definitely learned a lot about the kind of techniques used in theoretical quantum mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0We learned, in order: angular momentum addition, symmetry stuff, perturbation theory, the variational principle, quantum computing, time-dependent perturbation theory, the WKB approximation, and scattering. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped develop more of an intuition for quantum mechanics and how it can be used to approach realistic physical problems. ",
            "\u00a0This is a stock second-term course in quantum mechanics. I gained a range of tools for estimating and computing quantum phenomena and comfort with using them. ",
            "\u00a0I gained better insight into the interpretation of quantum mechanics, and the use of several central approximation methods used to evaluate more complex systems. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a number of methods for approximating solutions to systems that couldn't be solved analytically. We also learned a number of interesting side topics, like symmetries, path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, and some quantum computing. Overall, a very engaging and fulfilling course that fills out your quantum skills beyond the easily solvable harmonic oscillator, square well, and hydrogen atom. ",
            "\u00a0This course built upon 440 incredibly well, giving us a sense of what actual calculations can be accomplished with the basics of quantum mechanics. I learned several techniques which I think are applicable to a lot of experiment which is where my focus is. ",
            "\u00a0We learned several approximation methods for use in quantum mechanics as well as a bit about quantum computing and scattering effects. ",
            "\u00a0We learned practical approximation methods in quantum mechanics, including the WKB approximation, the variational principle, and both time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory. Also, we made a quick foray into quantum computing and the path integral formulation. Further, we studied 3-dimensional scattering. ",
            "\u00a0A basic understanding of how to use the mathematics of quantum mechanics to solve real-world problems. How to use a series of approximations: perturbation theory, the variational method, the WKB approximation. Also details about 3D quantum scattering, quantum computing, and spin. "

            "\u00a0I wish it met more times a week. There's so much stuff we could have covered but didn't get to. I know a lot of it gets taught in a graduate treatment, but still. Wish we spent more time with path integrals. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Skiba is one of the best lecturers in the department, and he makes the class a great experience. I appreciate the topics chosen for the semester, as well as the stuff we learned that was not tested on, namely quantum computing, symmetries, and path integrals. It was great to learn those things casually and not stress about being tested on them. The psets are very fair, not tedious, and very good for practicing the material that's on the exams. Prof. Skiba's explanations are lucid, and I have zero complaints about the class! ",
            "\u00a0This class is great! Griffiths is an amazing textbook to learn from: it makes everything clear and concise, it looks good, and has great worked examples. Professor Skiba makes the material entertaining and accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Skiba is very good, material was very well presented and textbook was good. Sometimes at the beginning of a topic I didn't know why we were doing it though, I think an outline of the method and when it's useful would have been good before we dived into the math. ",
            "\u00a0I wish Skiba would give more of the whats the motivation, why is this important, how is it used answers at the start of lecture before going into derivations. ",
            "\u00a0Skiba is a super cool guy and is really nice, but sometimes his lectures are a little difficult to follow. The math in quantum mechanics isn't too bad, but it can get pretty messy and I would resort to reading the book instead of listening to lecture when the math got too messy. ",
            "\u00a0idk who is going to be teaching this class in future semesters, but Skiba and Griffiths (that is to say, everything) are the strengths of this class. There is so much good feedback as well as good, fun, exciting content covered in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Skiba is the best, and class is generally engaging. I actually wish that the problem sets were more challenging and more like the questions seen on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I am biased towards mathematics, but this course struck me as occasionally lacking in theory. Some amount of this will always be necessary -- mathematics is in physics a set of tools to use -- but a few times the course made strange theoretical omissions. Professor Skiba did not introduce the tensor product at the beginning of the term when doing addition of angular momentum. I thought this was a conscious decision and would remain, but tensor products were introduced (somewhat) formally later in the course! I cannot with authority assess the needs or demands of a course for physics majors, as 441 almost exclusively is, but I know I would have appreciated a presentation of the material more oriented towards theory, and which was comfortable using advanced mathematical tools more freely, as graduate courses in the sciences often do. Students benefit from seeing the theory mentioned.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could tell, 441 achieves its intended aims extremely well. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well structured, and used Griffiths which is an excellent text. If desired, the assignments could have been more challenging. I felt the psets were extremely easy and the exams somewhat harder, so the psets could be made a little harder. ",
            "\u00a0This may be no fault of Professor Skiba, especially because he is a theorist and quantum mechanics is a very theoretical subject, but I felt as though I did not come to understand the physical intuition behind much of the material that we learned. Lectures can of course only go so far, and Griffiths prefers to use mathematical explanations as opposed to physical ones. As someone who does not grasp mathematical concepts quickly and who is a visual learner, this was difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course thoroughly covered a broad number of important topics. I have no complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are great, and the problem sets are representative of what we learned in class. The final and midterm exams are fair, although they are only a couple questions (3 for the midterm, 5 for the final), so there is a lot riding on how well you can do 8 questions. I think that this class tries to teach us too many topics, and the topics we study usually aren't related to each other, making it hard to get a good flow in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-taught, good textbook, challenging but not impossible homework assignments\r\nWeaknesses: disproportionately high emphasis placed on exams over classwork, which leads to a lot of stress around midterms/finals period and emphasizes only a couple of performance markers rather than hard work over the course of the semester "

            "\u00a0Yes, for sure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're considering this, you're either an intensive physics major, so you have no choice, or you're not intensive and you do have a choice. I think 441 is a GREAT complement to the material in 440. I feel just by virtue of spending another semester with Skiba learning quantum, my knowledge of the material from 440 was strengthened a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing! I'd recommend this class only if Professor Skiba is teaching it and he's using Griffiths. If you're using Shankar's quantum textbook in the future, then good luck, you're gonna need it. If you enjoyed 440, then this class is for you. It's much easier than 440 is because it deals with more of the approximations used rather than the physics, so it tends to be more of a math class. But if you're using Shankar's horrible textbook, I'd recommend picking up a copy of Griffith's to actually learn from. Shankar's book is depressingly ugly and is nearly impossible to read. It also doesn't provide the clearest explanation or the best-worked examples, so it's hard to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you're deciding between the b.s. intensive and the normal one, don't let this class discourage you, it's awesome and super fun. One of my favorite of the core physics. ",
            "\u00a0Almost all students in this class are intensive physics majors. I took it as a normal physics major because quantum I kicked me in the face and I wanted to know I could work hard and do better in quantum II for pride. Turns out, quantum II also kicked me in the face. Its very hard if youre not so hot at pure math. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Especially if Prof. Skiba is teaching it, because there is truly no professor at Yale like him. The material of the course is interesting and engaging, and I'd recommend this course even to non-physics majors looking for a physics course. To a large extent it stands independently of 440. It does, naturally reference concepts from 440, but with a minimal amount of effort, it can be taken independently too. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend this course with skiba! Dude was super cool and would always make jokes during class. That said, skiba would sometimes be a little difficult to follow during lecture, especially when the math started to get messy (which happens a lot in quantum mechanics). The psets are deceptively chill compared to the difficulty of the material we were learning. So it was possible to do well on all the psets and still feel like you didn't really know any of the material. That made studying for the midterm and final and brutal process, cause I basically had to learn all the material again. Really cool class though, and the material is really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even for non-majors, taking a quantum class will grow your brain! ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken 440, definitely take this course (especially if Professor Skiba is teaching!!!). This half of the sequence covers more practical uses of QM (a lot of approximation techniques), and you'll come out with a better idea of how to approach a much wider variety of QM problems. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course for anyone with a bit of experience in quantum mechanics.\r\n\r\nI especially recommend this course for any mathematics majors seeking to fulfill a science requirement. It is a more exciting course than 410 or 440, and comfort with linear algebra can easily allow students to skip the prerequisite with a bit of background reading. \r\n\r\nProfessor Skiba is a wonderful and energetic lecturer. Take any course he is teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone curious about quantum mechanics, particularly if taught by Professor Skiba. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend it. We had Prof. Skiba, who is excellent all around. He is very dedicated to making sure that his students learn -- he invites questions and always takes them seriously. The material is engaging, often profound, and complements first semester quantum beautifully. Most of the core material is taken from Griffiths, which makes it accessible, and certain side topics (symmetries, quantum computing) are presented without being the main focus of the course. It was excellent. One of my favorite physics courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who has taken its counterpart Physics 440. ",
            "\u00a0If you are studying physics, take it, because this class gives you the tools to actually use quantum mechanics in practice (in comparison to 440, which is more the theory behind QM). If you aren't a physics major, you probably shouldn't take this class, unless you are really interested in QM and it might come in handy for your career down the road. ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken 440 and you're interested as to how the arcane looking theory actually applies to real-world situations (not everything is a harmonic oscillator or a hydrogen atom), then yes 441 is for you. As with its predecessor, this course moves incredibly quickly through a lot of material, but Skiba manages to guide his students through it in a manageable way. The portions which students are responsible for at test-time are not only well-covered in lecture, but are thoroughly presented in the textbook, which is excellent. Be warned, though, a lot of your grade is dependent on your exam performance. Additionally, the material is far from easy, so expect to puzzle a bit over a few of the topics (if not most of them). I managed to survive alright as a non-major without the physics prerequisites, though I wouldn't exactly recommend skipping those, in retrospect. Overall, I think this class is probably much easier for physics or math majors, but it's not impossible without that background and can be quite interesting to boot. ",
            "\u00a0The Quantum Mechanics sequence has been my favorite so far in physics. In the second half you really get to apply the things we've been learning which previously may have seemed overly abstract. Even if you aren't a physics major, I would recommend taking at least the first half if not both courses if you have the prerequisites. This is especially true if they are taught by professor Skiba. ",
            "\u00a0Phys 441, though a continuation of Phys 440, is quite different from its predecessor. While 440 was exciting because it delved into the world of quantum mechanics and new concepts, 441 was more repitition and applying what was learned in 440 to different scenarios in quantum mechanics. It's more mathy (as in the brute algebra type math) and problem sets are more time-consuming than before. That being said, it's still an excellent class for those interested in quantum chemistry/physics as you cover some very useful applications such as perturbation theory, scattering, WKB, and angular momentum.
