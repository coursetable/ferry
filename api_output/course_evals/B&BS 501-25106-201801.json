Many of the examples used (i.e. The Tuskegee experiments) are historical and already well-known so  I didn't really learn anything new. I think we would get more out of this course if it were small-group discussion-based and focused on ethical issues and considerations we are likely to face as graduate students. Have us work through more relevant potential \"grey area\" ethical questions instead of giving us examples of historical violations of ethics. "
