            "\u00a0immense amount of new knowledge overall on approaching syntheses and reactivity ",
            "\u00a0This class drilled synthesis into my bones and then some. The whole class is spent developing the skill of synthesis with regards to advanced natural products. In addition to synthesis, the class also enables one to develop a deeper understanding of organic chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Devising synthetic routes ",
            "\u00a0Gained great insight into synthesis and synthetic planning as well as various important reactions and mechanisms. ",
            "\u00a0I have really learned how to approach a synthesis retrosynthetically. In the beginning of the semester and up through the first exam I was not very good at it, but by the end of the semester I was able to do the problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think through organic synthesis and retrosynthesis, and I was made aware of organic chemistry transformations I had not previously encountered ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about new reactions and mechanisms, and general strategies in retro analysis. ",

            "\u00a0problem sets could be a little more evenly spread out, but awesome course anyways ",
            "\u00a0The midterm was far too hard (highest score in the class was 80% even with generous partial credit), necessitating a substantial curve. This could be improved by making a fair test of the student's knowledge. In addition, the class is too fast paced for good learning to occur. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the class is the professor, Professor Herzon, who is able to boil down the very difficult material into a more understandable digest. In addition to his good lecturing ability, he spends time listening to the students and incorporating feedback into the class, making some adjustments that overall improved the class. The biggest weakness with the class is the slow turnaround when it comes to feedback, meaning that it can be difficult to know how a student is doing and changes that they may need to make. ",
            "\u00a0This course is the best I've ever taken ",

            "\u00a0It was a lot of material thrown at us at once, which made it very hard to succeed. It was overwhelming. I thought having the final be take home was actually very useful and allowed me to think through my answers clearly. ",

            "\u00a0The course gave us opportunities to see a myriad of reactions, but the applicability of the reactions was a bit limited. Some of them applied only in very specific conditions; this made it seem a bit pointless to learn them, because there weren't any places to utilize them. ",
            "\u00a0Midterm was incredibly hard. Liked the takehome exam at the end. Liked the extended problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were very useful as they force you to look at complex problems during the semester, something which I'm usually not very good at. Plus, Seth is simply a very good lecturer.\r\n\r\nAt first the speed was a bit too high, and I feel a lot of students were struggling with that. Seth took note, but after it was a little bit too slow sometimes. Right in between would be perfect. ",
            "\u00a0We learn so much in this course and I think they are all valuable resources for our studies. But because of the sheer amount of information we are given we dont have the chance to apply everything in problem sets or exams on our own. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student with a caveat. The class is overwhelming on some level with the amount of material that students are expected to learn. In addition, the class is dedicated to a very narrow goal, and while it does an excellent job, this can be an issue if you are not sure that natural product synthesis is something that you have a deep passion and interest for. The workload is not too bad with the amount of problem sets, but they tend to take a while and the exams can be difficult. ",
