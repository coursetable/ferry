            "\u00a0The class was well-structured to help us on our mission to become better writers. The guidance and feedback I received helped me throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my analytical skills, also throughout the course I became more confident in my contributions and in my writing ",
            "\u00a0I found that the course has helped me appreciate grotesque literature in a new light while also allowing me to develop critical literary skills that will be necessary in the future. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think it may be partially specific to this class topic, but some of the reading materials were difficult to read or understand thoroughly. However, they were all interesting and provided different viewpoints on the Grotesque. ",
            "\u00a0Some reading very difficult to engage with, however environment of class was very nice and relaxed which made contributions easier ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the courses only weakness was that it could have used more short novels in developing the idea of the grotesque. I think that a novel will provide the space to explore the grotesque in more detail. Otherwise, I loved the course. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I very much enjoyed this course. The readings were engaging and crossed a multitude of eras, subjects, and disciplines. The final project gave every student the opportunity to engage with what we had learned and use our creativity to create something grotesque which we could now analyze to find the origin of the grotesque in that piece. You need not be familiar with famous pieces of grotesque literature or even have a firm preconceived notion of what the grotesque is to take this course. Its structure is conducive to learning how the grotesque is created in art and literature and how to create it yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to someone looking to improve their writing skills. While the class requires a fairly constant, if not intense, engagement, it pays off. The grading can be tough, but that is a 114-wide policy rather than an instructor-specific policy. ",
            "\u00a0A niche course so depends on the person, although definitely helped to improve my writing skills ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is wonderfully taught and engaging. A must take if you are interested in the creepy undescribable things that go bump in the night. "
