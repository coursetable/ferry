            "\u00a0I read North African French poetry for the first time. I learned how to find connections between our readings and other famous French poems ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me exposure to a poetic tradition rarely covered by academia in general. I so enjoyed learning about the literary expressions of Maghreb identity, and developed a new appreciation for how the French language can be unpacked and played with alongside Arabic. Learning how to find meaning in these new linguistic expressions was an exciting new insight I made through this course. ",
            "\u00a0The focus of the course was exploring the contribution of different artists to poetic recount in post-colonial Maghreb. We learnt how to approach and analyse a diverse range of poetry styles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read and write about poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to appreciate poetry, particularly within a specific context. Prof. Connolly was amazing at helping us think critically about poetry in ways that were accessible to me even without a poetry background. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great reading list, great professor, small class that encourages discussion\r\nWeaknesses: environmental impact of printing too many handouts ",
            "\u00a0A strength is Thomas Connolly. He is incredibly insightful, thoughtful, and creative with how he thinks about language. Other strengths include the breadth of the syllabus and how far across the Maghreb region it managed to stretch. I struggle to think of weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very well done - it was well organized, the assignments were very engaging and the class dynamic was challenging but approachable. I learnt a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good structure for a long seminar, divided into a lecture, a presentation, and discussion. Sometimes the discussions were not sufficiently guided when we were split into pairs. ",
            "\u00a0The readings, the discussions, the presentations, the handouts, all excellent. I also loved the few afternoon lectures I managed to make. My one criticism was the weekly student presentations, which I felt used a lot of valuable course time. "

            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Connolly is the best and this is incredible literature ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you are a speaker of French and have even a slight interest in the Maghreb, this course is designed for you. Seeing how the French poetic tradition can move in light of the Arabic and Maghreb one is an exciting new way to probe language. This course also does not demand too much time outside of 2 papers, 1 in-class presentation, and very manageable weekly readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I thought the course was very well done - it was well organized, the assignments were very engaging and the class dynamic was challenging but approachable. I learnt a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolument! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a fascinating introduction to North African French poetry. You don't need prior knowledge of the topic, but your french should be strong. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It opened my eyes to poetry in a totally new way, and it was fun to be in and work for. "
