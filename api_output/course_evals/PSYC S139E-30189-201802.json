            "\u00a0Learned so much about animal life ",
            "\u00a0I learned an amazing amount of concepts in cognitive science and psychology through the lens of animals and babies. Although I didn't really think I would enjoy this class as much with the content, I was amazed about how captivating the content was. Essentially, this course is like an introduction to cognitive science learned through what animals and babies can (and can't) tell us about human cognition. It really was a wonderfully designed and taught class, all due to Professor Wynn. I also learned a lot of practical skills about reading and analyzing physiology and scientific papers an reviews, as many were required readings for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about current Phychological topics. A great introduction to the field of psychology. ",
            "\u00a0A fascinating overview of what makes human babies unique compared to other species as well as what makes human babies so similar to other species. We discussed what impact evolution might have had on the differing cognitive capabilities we observe. Obviously, the course did not cover any particular species besides humans in great detail, yet it lays a great foundation for how to think about interspecies differences and how research on other animals can forward our understanding of ourselves.

            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course are the way it is designed and Professor Wynn. The practice problems were also very useful in preparation for the tests. I think that the lectures on social preference and social learning could be redone to be slightly more clear, as it seemed as if Professor Wynn wanted us to know a little more about those topics than what was necessarily evident from the lectures. Otherwise, the course is awesome, and I really wouldn't change much. I really appreciated the final lecture that wrapped everything up from the whole semester and made an argument about what is uniquely human. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the filmed lectures which are extremely helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Though it is difficult to stay engaged with online lectures, the biweekly sessions were very engaging and managed to keep us on track and interested. A very solid class on the whole. "

            "\u00a0Yes class has 2 exams and really interesting material ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Essentially, the course is learning about major topics in cognitive science and psychology taught through the lens of babies and animals. As someone who has taken two psychology courses in the past, this seems like a really great way to get an in depth look into the field. It seems like a good alternative or complement to the Introduction to Cognitive Science course if you have considered that or enjoyed that. The class essentially covers major topics in cognition such as object permanence, numerical cognition, language, roots of sociality and morality, social preferences and learning, attraction, etc. Each topic is essentially split into what studies and research has been done about the topic, half with animals and half with human babies. I learned so much about babies and animals; it is crazy! By the end of the course, you will come away with a very detailed look into what exactly makes the human species so unique and different from other species, even though we are actually remarkably similar to other animals in many, many ways. I was captivated with material from the very first lecture, and everyone else seemed to love the course as well. The workload is not terribly difficult. During the summer, we had to watch the lectures, post discussion questions, and then show up for the online discussion section. There were many papers and videos that we also had to watch in preparation for the midterm and final. At least for the summer, Professor Wynn gave us practice problems that were similar to the test questions, which were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend as the topic is both interesting and the knowledge valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class. Though there were many readings, the concepts taught were fairly universal and easy to grasp if you understood the big picture. The topics and experiments we covered were extremely interesting. There is certainly some overlap with intro to devpsych so the course may be easier if you have taken that first. "
