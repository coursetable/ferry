            "\u00a0I learned how to do linguistic fieldwork through experience. These are extremely valuable skills for conducting virtually any sort of linguistics research, and I feel a lot more confident in my abilities as a researcher after taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned skills in field elicitation, and also how to tailor elicitations to get at a specific topic of interest. ",
            "\u00a0I learned\r\n- to view and annotate recordings in Praat\r\n- to document a language with the aid of a consultant\r\n- to work with a consultant\r\n- about available sources for doing field work\r\n- the importance of keeping notes organized "

            "\u00a0There were to parts to the course. In the first part, we conducted elicitation with no prior knowledge of the language to try to uncover as much as we could. In the second part, we were allowed to read anything we wanted about the language, and each student chose a topic in which to conduct an independent research project with our native speaker as a resource. I would have liked to begin the second part sooner, as I was able to start a very interesting research project that I would like to continue, except that now I no longer have access to a native speaker from whom to elicit judgements. But this timing issue was due to unforeseen complications relating to scheduling and logistics and not due to the planning of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course was sort of free-form, but I think that's the nature of a field methods class. At times I think I would've liked some more structure, though, and also some more discussion of issues that come up in the field (ethics etc) which we didn't get around to. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very much 'hands on', which is great. "

        [
            "\u00a0Field methods is a rite of passage in the path to becoming a professional linguist. I would encourage all students interested in linguistics research to take this course at some point. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think field methods is a really great course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\nTaking this course can be very useful, even though one might not be intending to do do fieldwork. The course provides an extremely good exercise in figuring out the phonology, morphology and syntax of a language. The course is also helpful for learning how to work with a consultant, keeping good notes and sharing information with others.\r\n    Overall: highly recommended. "
