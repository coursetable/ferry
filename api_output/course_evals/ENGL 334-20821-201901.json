            "\u00a0I think I definitely learned a lot of the literature theories behind postcolonial literature which deepened my understandings of various texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about literary theoretical frameworks in conversation with texts on a much higher level than ever before. The focus of the class on Southern African fictions was super rewarding, as it put texts in conversation with each other in more productive ways. ",
            "\u00a0I became better at understanding theory and applying it to literature, something that I've always struggled with.  I also became more critical about methodology and thought much more deeply about the ideology inherent in the practice of close reading.  I learned about world systems/world literature theory and thought deeply about its relationship with postcolonial theory, as well as the distinctions between national and local literatures. ",
            "\u00a0THIS WAS THE BEST CLASS IVE TAKEN AT THIS SCHOOL. I learned how to critically think about literature in a more worldly fashion and using actual theory as opposed to just pulling ideas out of my ass. Brilliant selections, brilliant discussion!! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to but literature into conversation with theory more directly in this class. I also knew very little about what world literature was before this class, and I think the course provided a good introduction to this growing field in literature ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me so much about literary theory, especially postcolonial, gender, poststructural, and posthuman. I had a lot of insights reading the texts and participating in class discussion, which I found super engaging. Gained skills in comparative reading, critical reading, and in generating theory from text. ",
            "\u00a0Omg where do I start. Through literature, world systems theory, postcolonial theory and literary theory, we learned sooo much ",
            "\u00a0I picked up a different way of reading literature, as well as discovered entirely new areas of literature that I have previously not encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to more African literature, and I read a lot of postcolonial theory for the first time. The theory presented me with an entirely new way of analyzing literature that I hadn't been exposed to before in my English classes that are organized around close reading. ",
            "\u00a0I gained many insights into broader theories about the circulation and formation of postcolonial literatures in the world system. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I engaged with very difficult postcolonial theory, which was extremely helpful to further my experience with postcolonial literature. I learned how to read texts in the framework of these theories, but also how to understand texts as they stand alone. I engaged with very difficult texts and class discussion was also so enlightening. I learned about the state of world literature theory, deconstructing the way the world thinks about global networks of literature and power. I've read some of the most phenomenal books I've ever read. They taught me about their space in history, as testimony, as art, and as expressions of different subjective experiences. "

            "\u00a0I think a brief synopsis of what the theory articles, quite literally, were saying would be helpful--sometimes I felt a bit lost in the weeds with certain theorists. That being said, I enjoyed pairing the theorists with literary works in a way that I thought illuminated both. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing! Discussions were so natural and never-ending. I also liked the flexibility of the paper assignments. The only two things that I would change are 1) more time discussing the literature rather than the theory 2) more black South African authors in the South Africa section ",
            "\u00a0It was a phenomenal course. Please take this or any class Steph offers. My intellectual course has been constantly shifted by her and this course.\r\nI can think of no weaknesses for the course, except that sometimes 19 people felt like a lot in seminar, since everyone had so many productive comments to make. ",
            "\u00a0Steph was a definite strength of the course.  She was an enormously kind and generous professor and wonderful at facilitating our class discussions.  I really appreciated how attentive she was to making sure everyone had a chance to speak and to shifting the direction to include students who may be feeling somewhat lost.  This class also challenged me to think harder about the assumptions I make about the practice of reading than any other English class I've taken (as an English major).  I think every English major should take a class with Steph because of how deeply close reading is ingrained in the department here, and it's crucial that we are pushed to think harder about how and why we use close reading and what sorts of biases inhere in its use.  I can't really think of particular weaknesses of the course, but I would say that I think one reason why I enjoyed it so much was the level of engagement everyone in the class brought to the seminar table.  Our discussions were always warm and lively as a result, and I don't know how much of that can be attributed to the sheer luck that we clicked so well. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: it was scary that the final was 60% of our grade and I think participation should be worth more\r\nStrengths: literally everything else please dont change anything else about this course it was my favorite class ive ever taken at this school and ive taken a lot of good classes ",
            "\u00a0I think that there was often too much reading material for the class, which meant that we didnt get enough time to talk about both the theory and the novel for the week. Im the future, it might be worth considering teaching theory and lit separately. Maybe, one week of theory, and one week of literature, in succession. I think this would also prevent the theory from determining exactly what we discuss about the novel, which would be good. \r\n\r\nI also think the conversation dynamics could be improved in this course. While we had very interesting and engaging discussions, it often felt as if we werent speaking to each other in the class. Each of us would come up with something we wanted to say, and then speak directly to Steph, instead of talking to other people in the class. This may just be a function of class size, Im not sure. But I think figuring out a way to foster more engaging and dynamic seminar conversations would be a great improvement ",
            "\u00a0This class was full of strengths. Perhaps the only weakness was finding the right order/balance between discussing text and theory, but I still think Steph did a great job of asking for feedback on that throughout the course and altering class structure in response. ",
            "\u00a0No weakness ",
            "\u00a0Steph is such a wonderful and caring teacher. She's really passionate about the subject and guides discussion well. The syllabus is incredible. Each week we read one book paired with one theoretical text. It's a lot of reading (start early on Satanic Verses), but I enjoyed all of the books so it didn't feel tedious/boring. The theory was dense at times and you may need to reread them several times to understand it. But in retrospect they were very useful in helping me address some of the broader questions I had about literature. One seminar section per week honestly wasn't enough time to address an entire book. Our discussion tended to focus on the various themes Steph/people in the class were interested in, and it generally also brought up more questions than answered them. We also talked more about wider themes and connection to theory than a close reading of the text. I found this very rewarding as it's a very different approach to English classes I've taken before. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is that Professor Newell chooses the readings very carefully. The theory articles are almost all classics that are helpful for thinking about the material not only in this course, but also other English/Political Science/History classes at Yale.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that Professor Newell assigns much more reading than other English professors at Yale. It's basically a book & theory article a week, which can be up to 400-600 pages or so. The problem with this I found was that students didn't always end up finishing the readings, which meant people were on different pages during class discussion (and we also always struggled to discuss whole books in our short once-a-week seminar). I think the class could be improved by breaking the readings down over a couple weeks. This would require cutting some books from the syllabus, but we could talk about each book in a more in-depth way. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it is extremely challenging in the best way possible, and that you can see how literature interacts with world systems theory and political spaces. The weakness is that theres a lot of reading, but you know what youre getting into when you take the class so its not terrible. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are its carefully thought out syllabus with the texts and theory chosen. Class discussion was one of the most rewarding parts of my week. To improve this class, I would have students spend more time on theory, maybe allotting a body of theory per two weeks so it can be engaged with comparatively and thoroughly. Sometimes I felt like I didn't get a chance to feel through the theory. Besides that I have no other recommendations for change. \r\n\r\nThe biggest strength of this class, though, is Professor Newell. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I was exposed to what felt like another world of writers and was introduced to some lit theory in an accessible way. Steph is really energetic, thoughtful and clearly enjoys teaching, which made class discussions engaging ",
            "\u00a0100% if you have any interest in post-colonialism! ",
            "\u00a0Could not recommend this course or Steph Newell as a professor more highly. Take anything she teaches!!!!! This is my second class with her and I have learned so so much from her. The texts are excellent but brutal, so prepared to be overwhelmed at points with the heaviness of it. This class is intellectually very difficult I was a bit out of my depth at moments in the literary theory, even as a junior year English major with a small theory background. But I think that challenge made it a great course. . I have never thought more critically in a class about what literature does, how it interacts with the reader and the world, the problems of empathy in a post-colonial framework, the debate over close reading as methodology, or, the elusive question of \"how newness enters the world.\" ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  Steph is an amazing professor who will challenge you to think about books and the process of reading in a way that will illuminate the assumptions that you might take for granted in another English class.  The books themselves are difficult but very interesting, carefully selected, and well paired with selections of theory.  It's important material, and it's worth doing with Steph. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE! THIS! CLaSS! literally if you have any interest in postcolonial literature take this class 100% I know it says that its a high workload but you dont resent it and its so fun - start the papers early and Steph will 100% help you out on them - dont be afraid to take big theoretical risks/leaps its truly deeply worth it !!!!!! if youre considering this class at all, please take it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. We read great books, and had very interesting conversations ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, to any fellow Human Rights Scholar or literary enthusiast, to any student looking for a course taught by a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes crucial info from the literature that one can only get thru reading them. The literature has all the answers and secrets of the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is such a gem in the English department. It also felt that the course wasn't limited to literature alone, as we discussed wider themes in relation to post-colonialism, gender, inequality, etc. You not only read some amazing books in postcolonial lit, but also many important theoretical texts in postcolonial studies. The class discussions were generally really good, and I always came away wanting to talk more about our readings. ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking for a class that will allow you to read postcolonial theory and literature itself, this class is perfect for you! Professor Newell is a wonderful teacher. Discussions are fairly loosely organized though, so it's important to do the reading  and have a lot of activation energy to pursue your own ideas for the midterm and final. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!! I loved it and thought that the group was one of the smartest I have encountered at Yale. Steph really made me reconsider my ideas and beliefs and she encourages a very collaborative class atmosphere, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0I already have recommended this course to so many people. While the material is difficult and a background in postcolonial literature is helpful, the class is approachable for anyone who has an interest. I ardently believe that the material is SO important for all students despite their interests. I have come to understand and work through ideas about global and local power structures, capitalism, the politics of language, and so many more topics crucial to understand as a human being in the world. All students should take this class and I wish they could. "
