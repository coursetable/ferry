            "\u00a0Read hundreds pages of materials of an unfamiliar field within two days and generalize the key points of each chapter. \r\nI have basic knowledge of anthropology and it's methodology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some branches of anthropology, both traditional and heated topic in today's anthropology academia. I learned the way anthropologists look at individuals, nature, society and culture, and what ethnographic encounter means both for anthropologists and the local community(research participant). I learned about things more than theories, methodologies, and experiences, developed a more critical but also humanistic perspective when trying to know, understand, and interpret some phenomenon. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced group discussion skills, reading skills, and learned many interesting concepts about cultures. ",
            "\u00a0From reading all different and engaging articles for each class, I get a chance to have a general understanding of what the subject Anthropology is and how interesting it can be. \r\n\r\nAnd from completing the essays I got to learn about ethnographic encounters and anthropology as reciprocity, and theres an opportunity for me to delve deeper into these discourses. ",
            "\u00a0My skimming and reading skills have improved through the course due to the heavy reading (which I still enjoyed quite a lot).\r\nI have also come to learn about cultures in different groups (which may sound a bit of a cliche), and more importantly, realising the issue of representation in academic writings which could then extend to the news in our daily lives and learn to see through an issue with a broader scope.\r\nIt is interesting to see how we thought our societies had evolved so much through time, however, there could still be some traditional thoughts that are still rooted in the field of anthropology (as well as in some parts of the world) such as the dominance of male over female in writing ethnographic pieces and the lower recognition of native writers/ writers from less prestigious institutions. \r\nThis course has also sparked our intellectual curiosity towards anthropology.

            "\u00a0The course format is seminar, which is really a comfortable and convenient way to communicate and interact with classmates and teacher. Also, I read a lot of interesting and inspiring ethnographic work, which I enjoyed and learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0strength: welcoming class environment, encouraging students to engage\r\nimprovement: maybe design a bit more activities instead of lecturing? ",
            "\u00a0The most dominant part of the class is the teacher Amys teaching method. For the first class she told us to squat because thats the way how anthropologists used to conduct their fieldwork, which is unexpected but quite appealing to a green-hand in anthropology like me. At the same time Amy chose to set readings and reading responses for each class in order to help preview the next class and have deeper understanding about it so that we could develop our discussion in class, which really works for me and is very effective in delivering the knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere is no weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is conducted in a small class format so that everyone could express their opinions more freely and comfortably, unlike the larger class in my other course. The smaller class size helped us to develop a closer relationship with the instructor in my opinion.\r\nThe course also allowed us to read through loads of readings within a short time: it was quite challenging to catch up in the beginning, but it then has helped in boosting our skimming skills.\r\nI also appreciate the large room of freedom that we could have in our essays (especially the mid-term essay).\r\nWish the course was a bit longer so that we could be exposed to more types of literature in anthropology.

            "\u00a0I will strongly recommend this course to other students, since I benefit a lot from it and I not only learned more about anthropology and ways to look at the world, but also know more about my self and true interest. The course did influence my choice of future path. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great introductory course since it introduces students many interesting anthropology books. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any of my friends who are interested in anthropology, because its a great introduction to anthropology and each class is quite engaging. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not because the course is not good. It is because, after learning the course, I found myself not into this kind of subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student since this course does not simply broaden our horizons via allowing us to read about various cultures, but also helped us in realising how the fundamental assumptions in our societies came from and work (to give an example, how we arrange things in left and right) and how we simply take whatever we read and see as the \"truth\", without considering the problem of representation.
