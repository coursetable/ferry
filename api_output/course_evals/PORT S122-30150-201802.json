            "\u00a0I think the course built on itself well. We began to move very fast at one point which was due to the short amount of time we had but I think all the different ways we learned - many written exercises, compositions, watching movies and videos, and of course being in Rio de Janeiro - made it manageable and conducive to actually retaining material. ",
            "\u00a0The class only had strengths. It was constantly engaging for students and made learning another language fun. ",

            "\u00a0The strength was how interactive the course was. The weakness was how much was covered in such little time. "

            "\u00a0Yes, without a doubt if they want to start to gain knowledge of another language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student who wishes to learn a second romance language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It is an amazing course that teaches you another language as well as the culture of a group of people who speak it. There is so much more than just language taught in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was excellently taught by the professor. "
