            "\u00a0Acting technique and vocabulary--tools I will use throughout my life as an actor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this course! The first half of this course was way more technical (and at times confusing) but by the end of the course main ideas solidified in my head. Some of these included: the importance of listening in acting, being ready to throw and receive meaningful \"balls\" on stage, being mindful and aware of the way your body moves and breathes, how to most efficiently understand plays, and simply how to play :). ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge, skills and insights in the multiple disciplines that I studied in my classes, which had a common denominator based on the foundation that Evan established at the first Master Class on Day one of classes. Evan taught me/us how to first establish the \"world\" around the character by researching the given circumstances from the text. From that foundation, we are able to learn the history, recent history, current givens and future possibilities for the character and the characters' relationships. Each course built upon this theory: In Text, we learned to mine the text in order to carefully extract the givens. Because of Text class, I will never read a play in the same way and I will be able to explore my character and all of the characters to a depth of understanding that I hope will earn me \"the right to play the character\"; In Improv, I learned games that animated my body and impulses in ways that I could not imagine and therefore was probably not accessing previously in my work and learning the archetypes was a revelation, both personally and professionally, however the principles taught in \"Acting is the color Purple\" lecture were immediately tested when I was cast in \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf\". I went on a true journey to reach purple for this character and credit this teaching in helping me get there; In Movement, I learned a movement language based on the Laban technique and as a result, I was able to access the way that my character moves, based on the given circumstances; In Voice, I found my Voice! --I learned things about the anatomy of voice that resulted in increased awareness of my breathing and when I tended to stop breathing, as well as places in my body where I held stress; In Acting Technique and Scene Study, I was able to, with each session, zero in closer to what I want in the scene and what I want overall; I was able to lean toward what was \"hotter\" for the character; and among the million takeaways from both Acting Technique and Scene Study, I will always focus on the balls that I am throwing with every single line/moment and throw balls that my scene partner can feel. I will always think about what I want them to feel as I throw the ball to them. ",

            "\u00a0It's very intense, but I found that I strength instead of a weakness. Perhaps more integration amongst groups is a weakness, but I really thought this course was absolutely perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Although I would agree with some people in that parts of this course are unorganized and hard to follow, I would say this is one of the strengths of the program. Due to this, I had to always be on my feet and ready to adapt. It goes without saying that the faculty were all so incredible and I am so lucky to have been able to work with them. Overall, there aren't any weaknesses that I can come up with. The one thing that I saw hinder people's experiences during the acting program was when they received scene partners that made them feel uncomfortable. I guess its impossible to avoid difficult scene partners in acting, so I understand if this is an unavoidable problem. It just sucks that people feel like they can't come to the teacher if they feel emotionally uncomfortable with their partner because that is not the \"professional\" thing to do. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-Small class size;\r\n-Overall class divided into even smaller groups of 10 - 15, which lends to very personal teaching and development; \r\n-All of the classes aligned to one theory/foundation/technique --\"Given Circumstances\";\r\n-Having TA's for each or most of the instructors - also that the TA's are students currently in the Yale School of Drama; \r\n-Great, qualified, trained, Professors; \r\n-Access to the illustrious resources at Yale!\r\n-Excellent Technique that served as the foundation of the course!\r\n-The opportunity to earn academic credits, as opposed to a certificate or continuing education credit\r\n-Vigorous and rigorous; Challenging; Intellectually stimulating\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/How could it be improved:\r\nHmm, I'm not sure that I found any weaknesses in the program but, here are a few thoughts on how I believe it can be improved --\r\n-Give students access to the syllabi prior to the start of class so that they have an idea of what they will be studying/learning as well as an idea of the scheduled courses. I did not know what classes I'd be taking until the first day of school.\r\n-Give students an idea of what the first day would be like. Because I had no frame of reference, I thought the orientation was going to be a general overview, lasting perhaps an hour or so and then I would have the rest of the afternoon to orient myself, get my student ID, etc.\r\n-Either, have the classes located closer together or allow about 5 additional minutes or so between classes so that students can have time to use the restroom, etc. Overall, the distance itself is not the issue as I loved all of the walking that was involved. Just needed more time for personal use.\r\n- Finally, I'd like to suggest having a Counselor of sorts on hand for students to go to for help for unexpected life events. I would never have thought of this had I not had a tragic event happen during the course of my time at YSS. However, if this can benefit a future group, that alone is why I am suggesting this. ...I found out during the last week of class that my boss took his own life. The Executive Director at my job called me last Tuesday evening (7/31) with the news. I was shocked and devastated and leaned on my family over the phone that evening for support. I decided to stay and soldier through the remaining days. Frankly, it was difficult. I found myself in a dichotomy of sorts. Elated that I had accomplished many goals and nearing the end of the program and also mourning my boss of nearly two years and wondering what on earth was really going on with him. I was struggling at times. If there was a counselor available, I would have gone to that person. I needed some help.  (Note: I am doing well now. Back home and rested and allowing those stages of grief to process through. I have returned to work and sharing with co-workers and my boss's wife as we all try to navigate through this shocking tragedy, while moving forward)\r\n- One final note: On the first day of class, I was unable to get my student ID because it was placed \"on hold\" until my bill was paid in full. I completely understood, however, it would have been helpful to have known in advance that I could not pick up my ID until the balance was paid. I'd had a previous conversation  where I explained that, due to a bank transaction, the remainder of my balance due would become available about two to three days after the start of the program. Was told that everything would be fine. Nonetheless, Thank You for understanding the delay and working with me!! ",
            "\u00a0It's an excellent course, however, I think it could be improved if all sections got to know each other better, rather than working with the same people all the time. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seriously interested in pursuing acting professionally. The instruction is priceless. ",
            "\u00a0I would more than happily recommend this course to another student! I loved how this program delivered a conservatory experience, while still having academic/writing components in text and other classes. I love this course also because it creates an experience where the actors can really form intense trust in one another allowing for the best work to be made in the studio. I'd say both as an actor and as a person, I have become better overall by the end of this program. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. My overall goal in applying for the Conservatory was to establish a firm foundation in my actor training. I've taken stand alone courses through the years but never felt I had a \"beginning\". This program gave me a solid foundation to build upon and that is only one of the reasons why I highly recommend it. Thank you YSS! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The teachers were super engaged and helpful. We got really specific feedback that helped us improve. Also, the course was very well organized. "
