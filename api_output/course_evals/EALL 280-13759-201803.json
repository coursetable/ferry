            "\u00a0Great introduction to Film: beginner-friendly as advertised. Learned about the generic constituents of the martial arts meta-genre as well as the nuances of national constituents: samurai, wuxia, and kungfu films. Also learned about how martial arts related to movements such as postmodernism. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of all things martial arts film related. This course will allow you to watch basically any martial arts movie and think critically about its history, the themes it chooses to discuss, and how conscious of previous martial arts films it is. ",
            "\u00a0There was SO much information packed into this course. I learned a LOT about martial arts and Chinese and Japanese culture/history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about a genre of film that I knew pretty little about, or had mostly seen spoofed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about East Asian Martial Arts Cinema and by extension a fair amount about East Asian more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot about various forms of martial arts films, from samurai to wuxianto kungfu. It is a strong introductory film course that teaches you about the concept of genre and film analysis. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course had a wonderful selection of films that together formed a highly coherent narrative. A lot of credit must go to Professor Gerow, who pulled together seemingly disparate elements (gender, body, etc.) into a course on martial arts film. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting, engaging, films are fantastic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/a ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Too many films. It was hard to keep up with the weekend watchlist when we already had class four days a week. I understand the logic behind having films to watch over the weekend, but it was a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course. Professor Gerow's lectures were incredibly informative and engaging and all of the films on the syllabus were very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the film selections from this course, and the material was very interesting. Professor Gerow is also a great lecturer and fantastic at narrations. There are a lot of readings, but if you manage to find the time to complete, it is very rewarding. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a great class to take even outside of a major (film, east asian studies). ",
            "\u00a0This course is awesome, incredible, the coolest! I think that this course is a unique treat and anyone at all interested in film, East Asia, or martial arts ought to take it. Professor Gerow is a fantastic lecturer. The course covers a LOT and basically all of it is enjoyable. It is a serious time commitment though - the class essentially meets every single day, so be prepared to NOT take a gut. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really committed to learning more about East Asian martial arts film and East Asian culture/history, then you should definitely take this course. Prof. Gerow is a great lecturer, and I had a great TA. If you've never taken a film course or if you're a film major but aren't totally committed to this particular subject, I'd honestly recommend taking this Cr/D/Fail. There's so much cool information and great movies that you'll be exposed to, but the time commitment and workload are pretty overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Gerow is great lecturer, very direct and includes fun facts as well as clips to keep things interesting while maintaining a thematically coherent presentation. Also, almost every single film was fun to watch, which is rare of the film department. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class to any student with even a passing interest in East Asia or martial arts cinema. Professor Gerow is a great lecturer who really cares about the material. Every single movie had something of value and some of them were truly incredible. The class is a fair amount of work just because of how many movies you are expected to watch (at least two a week, sometimes three), but the assignments are interesting and very fair. My group had a great time with the creative project in which we had to come up with our own martial arts narrative. This is easily one of my favorite classes that I've taken at Yale. "
