            "\u00a0Overall, this course provided a fascinating semester engaging with the unique history of the press and politics. I was able to explore this intersection in depth and understand how each shape the other. ",
            "\u00a0I had a lot of great conversations ",
            "\u00a0I didn't learn a lot of hard skills, but this course was very interesting. We read a lot of good books, but overall not a super hard course. Learning is only if you want to do it yourself. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great overview into the general arc of political journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Not much really. I was able to better appreciate how the media is influenced by politicians and vice versa in a negotiation of sorts. I also appreciated the different case studies and real life applications that Derek through at us. However, there is a lot of rehashing that goes on. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the close relationship between the media and the government, and the influence of media appearance on public policy. I discovered more about the motives and agendas of large media corporations. We evaluated major political figures and their media strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to assess the validity of news sources and the media's impact on politics. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was a bit disorganized and disconnected from the actual works we read, and the assignments seemed to have little to do with the course reading. However, Representative Slap was a fascinating practitioner and brought a lot of unique examples from his background that helped keep the course interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting topics, but perhaps a structure organized around themes and theory would help ground learning ",
            "\u00a0The class is interesting and full of smart kids, but sometimes the discussion goes stale or sounds similar. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are fairly interesting and encourage students to think about journalism in new ways. The instructor is very friendly, understanding, and deeply values student input, and adds a lot of stories from personal experience as well. However, the material seemed redundant over time, and I think the course could be improved by varying the reading and discussion material throughout the semester. The class sessions felt like a semester-long discussion of the same few concepts, and I think the course could be improved by better defining the discussion themes of each class and by including more diverse reading material throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly response papers were useful at first but given that Derek actually never handed back a few of mine and stopped giving insightful feedback, I'm not sure how useful it was. I did think the SWOT analysis and the Presentation on an example of journalism impacting public policy were particularly interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Slap is a very fair professor and has a lot of knowledge to instill in us, and I appreciated his openness throughout the course, so he was definitely a strength of it. We had robust conversations during the course, however, it felt like some people dominated the conversation and Professor Slap might have been able to mitigate that a little more. Though, there was a lot to learn from the readings and about journalism in general from Professor Slap. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the readings are outdated--either from the late 1900s or early 2000s. Because media has vastly shifted over the course of 20 or even 10 years, these readings tend not to be insightful or valuable when discussing today's media age. In class, we mainly discuss current political issues and the current media landscape making these readings not conducive to class discussion.\r\nHaving only two hours per week, if the instructor does not have a clear plan of what to do that class, it is easy to drift off-topic and not be as productive as one would like.\r\nThis course is strong in that there is never a shortage of discussion topics with the current political climate. Many issues we discuss in class are extremely relevant and will resurface in other classes or work. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed discussing readings and current events with my peers in class. However, the readings became slightly repetitive and some of the information learned seemed intuitive. "

            "\u00a0Yes, while the course was disorganized and a bit chaotic at times, Representative Slap brought a number of interesting experiences and examples as a practitioner in both the media and politics. There work is pretty limited, the readings were interesting, and Representative Slap really worked to build an engaging class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It's a fun course but the lessons are a lot more abstract than in most courses. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for those interested in politics and/or journalism. It's not the most challenging or demanding, but it's a good opportunity to learn with someone who presents different expertise than the typical Yale academic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is looking for a relatively chill fifth class or a course with lighter workload. ",
            "\u00a0Meh. Definitely not the best but nowhere near the worst. It's ultimately a practical, fairly fun, sometimes interesting gut. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wishes to study journalism. I would recommend this course to someone who has interest in the role of media in politics. This course focused more on the journalistic aspect than the public policy aspect so if you are more interested in direct policy-making and politics, I would look at other classes. This class evaluated many prominent political figures rather than political issues so one should keep that in mind before signing up for this course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for aspiring journalists and political junkies. The workload is reasonable, but to truly succeed you need to previously have at the very least a loose understanding  of the American press history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the lectures, discussions, and readings were clear. "
