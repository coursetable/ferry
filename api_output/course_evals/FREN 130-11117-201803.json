            "\u00a0My listening, speaking, reading ,and writing skills improved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I have really polished and refined my ability to communicate in basic french, as well as learned about French film and literature culture. I also learned idiomatic phrases that are actually used by French people, as well as refined my ability to speak french ",
            "\u00a0I cannot begin to list the plethora of knowledge, skills, insights, and more that I developed by taking this course. Regarding knowledge, my vocabulary of the french language expanded and I learned much about the french culture. Via skills, my composition and listening skills both increased immensely after them both many times throughout the semester. The insights I gained include how to be a college student, which Madame Koizim was supremely helpful with teaching, and also the best studying and test taking strategies. I also gained insight as to how to be more involved in the french community at Yale and was thus able to attend films put on by the french film club and other events such as a french karaoke night and french table meals where the attendees were able to share knowledge with each other which was one of the best groups of experiences for me all year. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that my French language abilities have improved greatly, specifically in listening, reading, and writing. The readings and films also gave some insight into French culture. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course loving the French language.  I emerged loving it more.  Not only that:  I fell in love with the study of a language, to the point where I may be addicted to studying MORE languages at Yale--despite the fact that I am not likely to encounter another Madame Kozim. \r\n\r\nFor me, the biggest challenge of this course was written French.  (The opposite was true for others).  Mme. Kozim taught us that French is a language of precision .  To be a good French speaker requires a kind of elegance and fineness of grammar that I could not have acquired,even if I'd spent six months living in Paris.  \r\n\r\nFor me, personally, there was another interesting benefit of studying with Mme. Kozim.  Early in the semester she identified a learning difference--on the basis of my quiz results--that nobody had ever detected before.  She is a master teacher, and a fine observer of her students. \r\n\r\nThe entire class is conducted in French.  As I rode my bike to class, in the morning, I found myself thinking in French.  That's a great feeling.  I got it from French 130. "

            "\u00a0It is intense, but once you get used to it it's doable. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super organized to the day, and even to the second. Madame Koizim is by far the most organized professor I have met at Yale. She has the best examples and ways of explaining things and I always knew what was expected of me\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While few come to mind, I do think one thing would be helpful, albeit not completely necessary. It would be helpful when talking to students to emphasize the most critical parts of the grade, and emphasize really really hard that absences are not really allowed. I guess not totally necessary since languages shouldn't be about grades, anyways. ",
            "\u00a0My main strengths include using everything that I have learned when I practice and posing many questions to make connections between the material so that I might apply it in more ways than taught in class. My weaknesses include being able to incorporate the information learned in class into my speaking at a quick pace and also trying to use more than I have been taught in my writings. I could improve these two by practicing more and being more succinct, respectively. ",
            "\u00a0This course did improve my French abilities a lot. Additionally, the readings and films were entertaining.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways in which this course couls be improved. There was little accountability for homework, meaning that it was easy to not do homework for a day and fall behind with little motive to catch back up. Also, I feel that this course could have worked on speaking more. We were tested on speaking ability in exams, despite having almost no practice in-class. ",
            "\u00a0None ",
            "\u00a0Some students might feel reluctant to take an intensive course that meets so early in the morning.  I can't think of any better way to begin the day than with Ruth Koizim.  She's a hugely demanding instructor, of course, but she makes the study of French so entertaining you may barely notice .  Unfailingly generous, inventive, not simply funny but sometimes downright outrageously so, she is above all devoted to her students in a way I had never experienced in any other course.  She doesn't simply instruct in the language.  She acts it out.  In another lifetime, Ruth Koizim might have been an actress or a dancer.  As it is, her students are the fortunate beneficiaries of her talent.  I am sorry there is only one more class I can take with Madame Koizim.  I will most certainly be taking it.  \r\n\r\nSome of the things I loved about the course :  the choice of readings, and the wonderful time we spent discussing Truffaut, the regular interaction among students, each of whom came to feel like an integral part of our Fr. 130 community, Madame Kozim's perfect rendition of a BAD french speaker....Truthfully, I cannot think of a single way this class could be improved.

            "\u00a0Yes. It will improve your French a lot. The books and movies are great. ",
            "\u00a01000000% yes. Take this course with Madame Koizim. She is the most dedicated language professor I have had at Yale. The aim of F130 is to refine the basics of French, in addition to adding some subtle nuances of the language. It's not a course for the lighthearted and definitely has the work of 2 credits, but it all serves a purpose. Every assignment felt like it was helping me advance my overall french knowledge, and not just busy work. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! After having taken 3 years of high school french, I found this class to be very quick-paced, by which I mean that I learned the amount of grammar and other information that I would have taken one whole year in high school to learn. This being said though, I would not have traded the hard work that it required for anything because I learned so much. Also, the multitude of opportunities that are available to practice french on campus, as well as the satisfaction of being able to immerse oneself in such a beautiful and complex country and its culture make learning the language really worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course does improve French language abilities greatly. Furthermore, I would recommend Madame Koizim highly as a French professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, without qualification, to any student who truly wants to become a better speaker and reader of French. "
