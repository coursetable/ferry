            "\u00a0good course...professor is good but goes a little fast in lecture and brushes over advanced concepts ",
            "\u00a0The course attempts to teach a very large number of concepts and ways to evaluate evidence, and the foundations of writing a systematic review.\r\nAs a consequence of the breadth of the topic, there are a lot of materials available to read, and a lot of concepts to discuss during lectures.\r\nI wish that the slides for the course had more explanations on them or perhaps notes attached to each slide so that one could go back to the powerpoints a week later and review the material. It is very hard to take notes in a class like this (it takes all my mental power to just focus on what the professor is saying), so oftentimes I found myself wishing for an opportunity to review a video of the class or some notes summarizing the concepts in the powerpoint.\r\nThere are also several discussions on statistical methods which went over my head and the head of our classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course. My suggestions:\r\nReduce the number of readings to required 1-3 papers per session/no more. These papers should be discussed in lab or in the lecture. I was not always able to determine how the papers connected, and once the coursework got heavy, slacked off on the reading.\r\nI think it would be helpful to have a dummy assignment on revman early in the course so that we know how to use the program properly. I had trouble importing charts/references/ other issues at the end of the course that was unnerving. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class. I learned a lot of new things, and I learned about familiar concepts with more depth.\r\nStrengths: I liked the style of the class with lecture on Tuesdays and discussion on Thursdays. It helped to be able to ask questions and hear other people's questions. I also liked that Shiyi used a lot of different examples when illustrating concepts in his course. I also appreciated that he sought our feedback halfway through the course, and he worked hard to make it better.\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been helpful to see more examples of the concepts from class applied to observational studies. My review focused on observational studies and I realized at the end I had a lot of questions because the concepts we discussed were almost always used in the context of RCTs (this was especially true for the different kinds of bias). Even though I knew the concepts were applicable to observational studies, it wasn't always clear how. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt very fractured. Much of the time there seemed to be a disconnect between what we were learning in class and what we were being asked to do in assignments. Systematic reviews have a very particular format and procedure, and lectures left many logistical things unclear. Although the experience of doing a systematic review (in what felt like trial by fire) was an important and valuable one, there is probably a better way to integrate the lecture material with the skill-based learning of the final project.\r\n\r\nSome other ways to improve the course include 1) moving the timeline up. It seemed like most of the semester was just forming a question and doing the protocol. While these are important and take a great deal of time, they don't leave a lot of time for the rest of the project. 2) more lectures by Kate Nyhan, earlier in the semester. Kate's lectures were the most helpful ones of the semester, and I think that having her talk about systematic searching earlier in the semester would help move the timeline up. 3) reconfigure discussion sections. It was difficult to stay engaged in discussions when topics varied so widely. Sorting students into groups of 4 based on type of review (intervention, screening, etc.) and general topic (cancer prevention, heart disease, etc.) would force students to be more engaged and would allow them to get more targeted feedback if the groups met each week during discussion. 4) review the use of RevMan before the protocol assignment, requiring use of RevMan, is due...

            "\u00a0I found the topic of this course essential for all public health professionals, though it was not made explicit based on the course title or description. I appreciated the content of the course and the many skills that I learned throughout and found Dr. Wang to be kind in providing feedback in assignments and in one-on-one engagement with students. I was also grateful for the many ways in which he attempted to make the course more interactive, bringing in Kate Nyhan to instruct us on important literature review skills and dedicating class time to critical assessment of published articles.\r\n\r\nI think the course could have been structured with the goals more clearly in mind. I was disappointed by the lack of explicit expectations related to the completion of assignments and found this to be a significant limitation of the course. I also was frustrated by the way in which topics related to assignments were covered after the assignments were due. Moreover, the readings were often repetitive and unrelated to the class topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy recommendations for improving this important course are:\r\n\r\n1) I wish that the course syllabus provided clearer expectations and guidelines for class assignments. I felt like I completed assignments with no guidance on what was the assignment was expected to look like or cover. Given the breadth and variety of systematic reviews, it would be nice to provide some standards.\r\n\r\n2) I think the course should be restructured to follow the process of conducting a systematic review. As such, the first classes should cover what a systematic review entails and how to develop a protocol. The following classes should cover developing literature search terms and conducting the search. The remainder of the class should then cover how to review articles for quality and bias, how to navigate Revman, and how to conduct meta-analysis.\r\n\r\n3) I also thought that the readings could be cut in half without sacrificing the quality of the learning experience. Many articles were redundant or unrelated to the class topic.\r\n\r\n4) Finally, more small-group work in class would have made it more engaging. Perhaps creating small groups who are working on similar questions or topics that could gather together to review articles and discuss challenges would have cut down on the silence that often came in asking questions that were irrelevant to some students and not others. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! I think meta-analysis is a very important research methodology, and this course taught us this method in a conducive way. By the end of the semester, we all could come up with a paper of our interests. I like the discussion class on Thursday too. We could go through almost everybody's project and help each other evaluate the papers we have. ",
            "\u00a0One of the kindest and best professors, but\r\nClass wasnt all that informative. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Wang is a great instructor. He's always willing to answer questions and truly wants us to get the most from this class. He builds up the knowledge that we need to have to write our reviews appropriately and paces everything well. I especially enjoyed the opportunity to discuss student's articles to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. ",

I also liked that he brought a good sense of humor to all of our class meetings. ",

At times I found it difficult to stay engaged with his teaching style, which tends feel like a lecture, although he does try to facilitate discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Wang is clearly a passionate and enthusiastic instructor and I appreciate that he took the time to assess the class mid-way through and sought student feedback. I found my one-on-one sessions with him to be helpful and appreciate the breadth of the skills that he was trying to teach to us.\r\n\r\nI wish that Dr. Wang had provided clearer feedback on what was required in the assignments. It is clear that we were not strictly conducting a systematic review and so I wish I had known prior to the assignment what Dr. Wang was looking for. I also would have appreciated a firmer deadline for submission as I felt that materials were covered in class after submission that would have been useful to review beforehand. ",

The class could have been called \"Writing Systematic Reviews\" - \"Intro to Evidence Based Health\" makes the class sound more integrative and case-based.

If systematic reviews are important for your career; however, this class is likely to be valuable to you! ",

I would especially recommend this class to students who are interested in translational research and implementation science, because you will learn a lot of unique content and gain practical skills by taking this class.
