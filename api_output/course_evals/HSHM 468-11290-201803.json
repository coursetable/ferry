            "\u00a0Very interesting overview of historical perception of bodies/fetuses/life/women. Reading/discussion topics range from abortion in 1300s-1800s Europe (broad!) to artificial intelligence in modern times (super broad!). A wonderful first (or 2nd! or 8th!) history class for any student in any major. The final project is super flexible in a way that allows you to pick a topic you will (hopefully) love. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to study as well as contextualize the study of sex and sexuality from preindustrial to 20th century time periods. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me better unpack dense readings and further explore details of social constructs. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the historical perspective for many modern debates over defining sex/gender, generation, and life. ",
            "\u00a0History of theories of generation, issues of reproduction (including abortion), sexuality, and artificial life. Mostly focused on Western cultures, but had one class focused on Japan, and the final project could deal with a different area of the world "

            "\u00a0This course stated that no prior knowledge was necessary for this course, but it would have been helpful to have a little bit of a background in thinkers (such as Aristotle) that emerge throughout the course ",
            "\u00a0Classes were mostly student run and encouraged discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the material of this class is fascinating, and I really enjoyed the discussions and most of the readings for the semester. including a few movies in the reading list as also great. I also really enjoyed our trips to the medical historical library, and my only suggestion for those classes would be to spend a bit more time looking at the documents! For the class overall, I think the things that could be improved are the format of the presentations and some slight tweaking of the reading list week to week. For the presentations, sometimes Ivano tended to interrupt a lot, which meant that the presenter didn't end up finishing. Other weeks, we were in the medical historical library and therefore people had much less time to present and there was less discussion, and other weeks nobody presented at all. Perhaps putting presentations only in classes where there isn't another activity planned and more discussion with Ivano in planning the presentation would help to ensure that subjects Ivano wants to discuss are discussed without running out of time. The reading list could perhaps be improved slightly by balancing the amount of reading week to week- one week had a three hour movie and 150 pages of reading, while others had only a 2 hour movie or 90 pages of reading. Overall though this was a great class and these changes are small! "

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if you're at all interested in women's rights, perception of life/death, science, medicine, and/or gaining literacy in discussions of history. Take a good look at the syllabus to better understand the breadth of topics (particularly the second half/the last four weeks)the material covered is really interesting and broad, and the threads placed in the first half of the class continue through the entire second half. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Dal Prete does a great job making sense of the Western world and its treatment of women and sex centuries ago. He's also really excited about the material and makes coming to class very enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was really eye opening and I believe helped me become a better historian. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in the material, then definitely! Its a decent amount of reading but the class was flexible in letting you pick when to write reading responses (4 2-3 page responses in the semester), and Ivano is very committed to the course! "
