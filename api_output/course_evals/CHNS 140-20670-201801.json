            "\u00a0My knowledge of and ability to communicate in Chinese increased greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Vocabulary, grammar, and speaking and listening skills all improved. ",
            "\u00a0I developed better speaking, listening, writing, and reading skills in this course. I also learned a lot about Chinese culture and the differences between Western and Chinese culture. Besides that, we also covered the differences between formal and colloquial Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I made large improvements on my Chinese speaking style, grammar usage, and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I really worked on improving my Chinese this term, particularly my writing and reading. The Chinese teachers are also increidble, I really loved working with them. They care a lot about your Chinese development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned even more about the Chinese language and culture, with an emphasis on speaking. ",
            "\u00a0This class will take a take a lot of time out of your day but your Chinese will improve significantly. The teachers a very caring and honestly pretty funny, which makes going to class every day enjoyable. Highly recommended if you're committed to spending a significant amount of time learning Chinese even after this class is finished. If you're merely taking this to fulfill your language requirement, I recommend you look for an easier/less time-consuming language. ",
            "\u00a0really improved my chinese skills, especially speaking ",
            "\u00a0In Chinese 140, I learned intermediate Chinese grammar and vocabulary and improved my speaking and listening skills. I also learned about Chinese culture through the textbook chapters thats topics included travel, food, and holidays. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese writing, speaking, and listening skills have vastly improved. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Regular feedback and work aimed specifically at building necessary skills. Daily classes.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Lack of information concerning overall grade throughout term. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well planned out and structured. I think that it takes more time than it should at the end of the semester because of all the assignments that pile up in the end (oral tests, final projects, final tests, etc.). The listening, reading comp, and grammar quizzes online on Quia were really ambiguous. I often found that questions just couldn't be answered with certainty even if I understand every word of the passage. That is something that could be improved for future years. Answers to those questions should be explicitly mentioned in the passage and not something the student infers. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are wonderful. The speed is acceptable. More work on the patterns would be appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Good for speaking and listening skills, occasionally moves too quickly ",
            "\u00a0This is a very intense course, but that makes it a lot easier to improve Chinese skills. I can't think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I still feel that Oral Exams do not test so much speaking skill as they do memorization of certain information. I also hope there can be more listening practice exercises for student preparation in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I think the workload in the course is incredibly high and it's not all very constructive. There are many quizzes, but not all the quizzes are conducive to learning a different aspect of the Chinese word. I don't think the quizzes where we see pinyin written and have to write the characters are that helpful. I feel the same way about this part of the exam. ",
            "\u00a0It is every day, which means that although you get constant practice, the workload can also be overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Everyday classes maximized my progress. ",
            "\u00a0The video project doesn't really help and takes time. I think what they should do is conduct a live interview in class. Students shouldn't be required to only ask questions. They should be required to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0As with many language courses, you learn as much in Chinese as you are willing to learn. If you don't do practice, class will turn out to be very challenging and frustrating. One weakness of the course is that it moves too fast, and it is very hard for students to prepare for weekly presentations and daily quizzes given their already busy schedules. ",
            "\u00a0I still wish the final project was less video oriented, and that the oral tests were less memorization oriented! "

            "\u00a0Yes. You learn a lot about the language and culture and the faculty are fabulous. It is a lot of work and while you are enrolled, your academic experience revolves around it, so make sure you are invested. Also make sure you are prepared to put in the work, otherwise you will get very little out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want to learn Chinese, this is the way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Your speaking and listening will improve greatly. ",

            "\u00a0Yep! An excellent course if you want to further your Chinese reading and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I might recommend it, but I think it's very hard to take a language course (especially one as work heavy as Chines) at Yale. They meet daily and expect a lot from you. I would only recommend it to someone incredibly incredibly committed to learning Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they are set on learning Chinese of if this is the last class they need to fulfill the language requirement; the workload and the language itself are very hard. ",

            "\u00a0Yes but only if you're willing to put in hours for it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are really serious about learning Chinese. If you are at all apprehensive, or feel like your attention will be directed in multiple directions throughout the semester, this course may not be a good fit because it is so demanding. ",
