            "\u00a0I have taken classes that focus on political theories of nonviolence, but never classes that explored two theorists in particular depth.  The fact of being able to do extended analyses of King and Gandhi allowed in-depth examination of two specific thinkers in a way that many classes might ignore in favor of comparing several at once. ",

            "\u00a0In-depth inquiry into the theory of nonviolence. Truly loved it. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the theory and practice of non-violence in Gandhi and King, Gandhi's satyagraha campaigns, and King's non-violent direct action campaigns during the Civil Rights Movement. Specific focus was on how King translated Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence to the context of US racial inequality, as well as the philosophical, political strategic and political tactic elements of Gandhi's and King's non-violence.

            "\u00a0This class focused on how the political philosophy of nonviolent direct action, evolved from its history of practiced nonviolent protest through the Indian Independence Movement Gandhi led, and the Civil Rights Movement that King was a leader within. I really enjoyed the amount of primary texts that we read from Gandhi and King, through speech transcripts, journal articles, and excerpts from their philosophical literature and that of contemporary critics.

            "\u00a0Professor Mantena has deep interest in and broad expertise in her field, and is able to give lectures that effectively illustrate the readings.  This benefit can be expanded upon by including participation in lectures, even as participation is included in sections.  The course could also benefit from incorporating a greater degree of contemporary analysis and political commentary, even as it might in some cases be a deviation from what other Political Philosophy classes at Yale do. ",

            "\u00a0Many of the readings from the second half of the course were hardly touched, in lectures, sections, or exams. This was frustrating when I allocated lots of time to understanding these readings, but it was rewarding. Sections were great. (If possible, try to get Nica as your TF!) ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are rather dry and it's hard to focus your attention during lectures. Sections are very helpful, but the TA's focus was often quite different from the focus of Prof's lectures. ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course are its excellent professor (Prof. Mantena) and TAs (especially Nica Siegel) in addition to its clear structure of the material. A weakness of this course is that the lecture format does not allow students to ask the professor questions during class, but discussion sections make up for this. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this class was our engaging facilitated discussion sections. My teaching fellow, Matt Shafer, gave us the creative freedom to question the rhetorical strategies Gandhi and King used to formulate their narratives, and also provided different small group activities that changed how we learned and worked with the material on a weekly basis. One improvement of this class could be doing more large writing assignments outside of class, as I feel like one of the most important assignments that applied my learning was the 5 page essay we did near the end of the course, and I felt more invested in it than weekly reflections. ",

Take this class, and actually make an effort to learn from it! It's fairly easy to keep up but don't let it just pass you by, and you won't regret it. ",
