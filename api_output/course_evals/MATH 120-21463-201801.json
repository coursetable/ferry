            "\u00a0The greatest weakness of this course was certainly its structure. Way too many topics were covered and I believe that students had little time to dissect the entire material in such a small amount of time. The level of teaching offered by the various instructors  was very unbalanced and its a shame that students can not select themselves the instructor that they want instead of being randomly paired up with a professor. I felt like the homework did not prepare me well enough for the tests and hope that in the future the psets will be changed so that they better represent the exercises that are found in tests. Finally, even though it can be argued that we had enough practice for exam stile questions provided by the course's director, they were most of the times miles harder than the ones found in the actual tests and did not include any kind of explanation on the solutions.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Great content, if taught properly. All the resources are available for students to succeed (review sessions, lots of peer tutors, office hours, etc.)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough focus on conceptual understand of the material. Testing on concepts was present but very surface level. I want to delve more into the theory behind the math we learn.\r\nAlso, heavy weighting on the tests makes taking those stressful. "
