            "\u00a0This course helped me develop a deeper understanding of the Italian language. During this course I was able to garner an understanding for a majority of verb tenses as well as develop an understanding of a great deal of words/phrases. ",
            "\u00a0(Answers to 110 apply) ",
            "\u00a0They did a great job of teaching me Italian.  I learned a lot very quickly. ",
            "\u00a0This course continued to develop my understanding of Italian at a faster pace and with slightly more complex grammar and vocabulary than the introductory course. This course elevated my ability to speak, comprehend, and write Italian to a comfortable point. Towards the end of the course, I felt confident in engaging in casual conversation with Italian speakers. I was also comfortable with reading and writing long passages of Italian. There was also an increase in the inclusion of Italian culture and history in the course as it functioned to provide practice for comprehension. "

            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was the fast pace at which it was taught, forcing a great deal of attention to the content. Perhaps a weakness of the course may have been a lack of clear connection between topics. While this may have been a little difficult to accomplish, I think some more dedication to demonstrating in what cases, for example, different verb tenses are used/how they relate, it could have facilitated the structure of the course. ",
            "\u00a0(answers to 110 apply) ",
            "\u00a0This course had many great ways to practice what we learned. There were plenty of in-class exercises that we spent much of class time completing and going over in good detail. Out of class, our professors gave us meaningful assignments like essays and reading comprehension. These were essential to fortifying our grasp of the material. The professors' presentations were always interactive as they made sure to include student participation. Questions were always given time and answered thoroughly. Furthermore, both professors had great, lively personalities, which made it easy to feel engaged in class. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This course does a very good job at providing some of the higher level knowledge that essentially gets an individual to a good understanding of what is being said. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0This course does a phenomenal job of building upon the foundation set by the introductory course. Consequently, there is a smooth transition to the more complex vocabulary and grammatical concepts presented throughout this course. The professors frequently make themselves available for help if you ever feel confused or just need clarification. Furthermore, the professors give ample time to solidify your comprehension of the knowledge through exercises and assignments. The workload is very manageable and you can talk to the professors if you ever feel overwhelmed. "
