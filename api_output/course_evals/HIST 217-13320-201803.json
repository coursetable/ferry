            "\u00a0I developed a sense of scholarship in the field of Roman history and also an awareness of how to read texts according to the political contexts in which they were produced - e.g. archaeological digs prompted by political agendas of Italian leaders. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a in depth overview of the The Roman Republic with a good mix of literary and material evidence and secondary scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about ancient Rome and how historians think. More than just learning the facts of history, this course provided much on the methods of deducing history from a variety of sources. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides an overview of the Roman Republic, from its legendary founding to the fall of the Republic. I had absolutely no knowledge of the Roman Republic before taking this course. I left with a clear idea of how the Republic evolved and what forces led to its demise. Highly recommend this class to anyone with a limited knowledge of Roman history who is looking to expand their horizons. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding the principles by which historical evidence (literary sources, archeological sources, etc) should be judged and evaluated, how we should reconstruct the past based on fragmentary and sparse evidence, and how to interpret various textual sources. Also, how to write historical papers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much more in-depth, a educated understanding of early Roman history. This class was integral in helping me separate the fact, from fiction, in the development of Rome. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course does an excellent job covering material and has a rigorous reading list. However, most of the primary sources - especially in the second half of the course - were never brought into discussion, so doing the reading wasn't really rewarded. The powerpoints' focus on military history is a bit challenging (a lot of slides just show towns or troop movements, and Prof. Gerardin didn't always explain why these were even depicted). The general lectures' focus on great men, without incursions into new social history kinds of discoveries, was uninteresting. You can see this in the fact that only 2 women enrolled in the class this semester. Also, the length requirement of the final paper (originally 4,500 words, reduced to 10-15 pp) was really unprecedented in an intro lecture course. \r\n\r\nMy main issue with the class was the boring instruction, but I know this has not been an issue with the course when Prof. Johnston was teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the lecture format. I greatly enjoyed learning the history of the Roman Republic from an instructor as opposed to just reading a book. One improvement for the course would be to have two midterms and a final as opposed to just one midterm and a final. I felt that there was quite a gap between our first examination (a week before fall break) and the final ( a week into December). ",
            "\u00a0This course's lectures are very informative and thorough. Professor Gerardin gives a very clear overview of the history of the Roman Republic. The section was excellent -- CJ is extremely knowledgeable, and you'll have very substantive, rigorous discussions that truly help you understand the source material. I would suggest 1) allowing drafts of papers to be read; I have found that writing a paper using ancient sources is a bit different from writing a paper that uses more modern sources, and 2) shortening the length of the lectures. I'm not sure if this is possible, but most history lectures are 50 minutes, and I find it difficult to stay engaged for 1 hour and 20 minutes without missing some things. ",
            "\u00a0I found an hour and fifteen minute lecture to be too long, especially on Thursday with a section afterwards. I would either advocate for a M/W/F lecture schedule with three fifty minute blocks or instituting a break during lecture or something. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well facilitated and taught, and section was always helpful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course if Prof. Gerardin is teaching. I know the course had a great reputation when it was taught by the previous professor, but this semester it was essentially a waste of a Yale credit. The powerpoints would teach you, but sitting through class is not worth it - take something else! ",
            "\u00a0I reccomend this class to anyone with interest in ancient history ",
            "\u00a0i would definitely recommend this course to another student. This was my first history class at Yale and I am not a humanities major and I still found this class very rewarding and fair. The lecture format was great for learning the material which was also enjoyable in itself. I gained a much greater appreciation for the work historians must do to combine several sources of knowledge in order to arrive at the correct narrative of the events of the past. The primary source readings are illuminating and the secondary scholarship provided many unique perspectives on Roman history. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course. If you love Roman history, this will be a blast for you; if you know absolutely nothing about Roman history (like I did) this will be a very enlightening experience. Plus, it makes each lecture way more interesting and suspenseful. You never know what's going to happen next. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended introductory survey of the Roman Republic. If you've ever been curious about how and why Rome has continued to influence Western culture, this is your best bet. Along with surveying the major political, social, and economic developments of the Republican period, the course provides insight into how theories and interpretations of the past have evolved over time. \r\n\r\nIt's a suitable class for those who don't know anything about history, but there are plenty of opportunities for in-depth engagement. No knowledge of classics necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they have any interest whatsoever in Rome, or history "
