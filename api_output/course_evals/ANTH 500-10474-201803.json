            "\u00a0I gained familiarity with the history of anthropology; there was a lot of material to read, but it was good to be able to trace major developments in the field since the late 1800s. ",
            "\u00a0By reading the original classic texts, I developed a better understanding of the disciplines history and various writing styles. Our class discussions allowed critically examine the anthropologists theoretical and methodological frameworks, and think how they could relate to our own research ideas. This class helped to improve my ability to analyze and discuss voluminous ethnographic texts. ",
            "\u00a0In ANTH500, I became more deeply aware of the questions posed and the problems tackled in late 19th century - mid 20th century anthropological inquiry. This knowledge has helped me consider my own work more critically and contextually. "

            "\u00a0The course design and readings were excellent, although one wishes that selections of really large texts could have been made available, at least retrospectively. This would not have contradicted one of the course's stated goals of learning how to work with large unwieldy texts. The reading guides prepared by William Kelly, in particular, with contributions by Erik Harms and Doug Rogers are truly valuable. The two-page response exercise was also largely fruitful. \r\n\r\nThe discussion-oriented nature of these classes, however, did not work for this course. One hopes that the class will mature over time, but presently 'contributions' by some students were often empty, vague and even vainglorious. Many hours in class were unproductive and even wasteful, and greatly soured my experience of this course and of the department. I was very disappointed by the pugnacious and pretentious nature of several of my co-students and I wish the instructor was more proactive in guiding the classroom at the many points where discussions verged on the absurd and the self-congratulatory. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is in engagment with the original texts. This seminar could profit from more structured class discussions which we should work on together as a group of students sharing a learning space. ",
            "\u00a0As a class, we engaged deeply with the texts, but I would have enjoyed a more explicit lecture-style conversation in the beginning of each class to talk about the relationships among and between the theorists we were reading--how they engaged with one another and the historical questions they were engaging with in their times. I wanted more of the history of anthropological theory in addition to the textual analysis. Discussion of these political, transatlantic, and interpersonal relationships was provided in Kelly's reading guide, but I would have liked to have discussed the details explicitly as a class. "

            "\u00a0This course is required for the first year PhD students, but, hypothetically, I would certainly recommend it to everyone interested in anthropology and its history. ",
