The majority of the course time was spent studying the behavior of metals with brief insights into ceramics and polymers. Through mostly self-study because lectures tended to be unclear, I learned the fundamentals of mechanical properties, behavior, diffusion, failure, and more. ",

            "\u00a0If a syllabus was posted online about the specific material we were going to learn throughout the semester, it would've helped to be able to know specifically what to study for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty bad. Pset due dates and questions seemed to be improvised last minute. Lectures were organized, but the professor had confusing explanations. The class lectures were not focused or clear or particularly relevant to the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it's very all-encompassing and wide-reaching. There's much to be taught, but those things are disparate and often times unintuitive and stem from empirical facts. Spending more time connecting ideas and making sure they're understood before moving on would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: absolutely nothing apart from some insights Jan gives about his research\r\nWeaknesses: Boring lectures. Jan's teaching style is messy and confusing. He stutters and mumbles a lot and can not utter coherent sentences.\r\nLecture slides are messy and not very helpful unless you take notes of every single thing Jan says. Sometimes the slides are just a bunch of pictures with few words or literally PICTURES of the board !\r\nNo clear feedback, no homework solutions, no exam solutions. Absolutely nothing. The class is not that hard itself so you can kind of read the book and learn by yourself but don't rely on other things. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: can be taken by anyone (no specific knowledge required); provides a great insight into everything about materials for those who are curious.\r\nWeaknesses: 1. could have been organized better 2. does not really provide any hard/fundamental knowledge ",

            "\u00a0Would have helped to facilitate learning if the answers keys to problem sets and exams had ever been released. A practice exam or something of that format also would have been useful. It was frustrating for many students that these were not made available. ",
            "\u00a0For those with a genuine interest in materials science, this course provides a great introductory survey of relevant topics even if it requires self-study. The textbook is very well-written, though it doesn't always cover the subject matter we discuss in class. That said, homework problems are either quantitative and from the textbook or qualitative and discussed in lecture, so the course material never feels like a surprise. Professor Jan is super kind, funny, and genuinely enjoys the material, though his lectures and explanations always leave much to be desired. Unfortunately, the language barrier is a problem as he often struggles to pick the right words to clearly explain topics in English. The discussion section would sometimes be very helpful and otherwise not at all. The biggest drawback from this course is that NO grades are uploaded to canvas, problem sets are returned erratically, and no clarity about a student's performance in the class is present. ",
            "\u00a0The psets aren't really super representative of the exams, or what we are expected to know, which was a little confusing. But if the purpose of them was to do a bit of an exposure to the math behind all of the important concepts without really wanting to focus energy on memorizing things and whatnot, then it accomplished its purpose. The lectures weren't the most clear sometimes when it came to the more complicated derivations and things like that, and even the TAs couldn't clarify sometimes, so if there would be a way to teach some of that stuff more clearly then that would be helpful. Having some pset questions that resembled things we would see on exams, or just the things that the course was focused on making sure we understood would be helpful. The sections with TAs were really helpful for keying in on things and going more in depth, and the textbook was also a really solid resource, so that was all good. ",
            "\u00a0I did NOT like the partnered homework. I thought it hurt my grade and reduced the amount I learned. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the material itself was very interesting and Prof. Schroers is very nice and funny. However, the course was a little disorganized and some of the lectures were a little hard to follow even if you paid attention closely. ",
            "\u00a0Jan does an amazing job explaining the material, though at times it can feel slow. ",
            "\u00a0the level of explanation during lecture could be improved upon. ",
            "\u00a0I like the problem sets I thought they were a great difficulty level and covered all the useful applications that we needed to know. I would have preferred more application examples during lecture. It would also be great if there was a more professional looking and comprehensive online guide to G-curves for phase diagrams that was pretty confusing and the book nor the lectures were easy to learn from. ",
            "\u00a0The lector didn't really know what he was doing. Judging by the expertise of the teaching fellows, though, I think the issue isn't with the course. ",
            "\u00a0Terrible lectures, psets aren't too hard, pretty boring. ",
            "\u00a0There was no effort put into the course in any way.  There is no attempt to make the class impressionable in any way.  This course needs a more structured syllabus.  I say that despite the fact that there was no syllabus in the first place.  The only strength of this course is its relative ease, which is still undermined by the fact that I never really knew what I needed to know because there was no clarity on that subject. "

For students that are comfortable with chemistry at the AP level or higher, this class will be very reasonable. Don't set expectations too high. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought it was fun, and the concepts were really cool and enlightening - one of those classes that makes you see the world differently because you understand one of the layers you usually take for granted. It also wasn't too much work, and the lectures were pretty good (though some may disagree with me). Was a relatively laid back class I would say, which is always refreshing to find at Yale. I looked forward to lectures and section every week. ",

            "\u00a0Not really. Unless the lector gets better. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, you have to take it. Lectures were the most unengaging of my entire life. Be prepared to learn the material on your own. The material itself is pretty interesting so that's nice, but the lectures are pretty unproductive. Jan just lectures off slides he finds off the internet, don't expect to get anything from lecture. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you need a mechanical engineering gut elective.  UNDER ANY UNDER CIRCUMSTANCE NO.  This class is not interesting, the course is taught poorly, and it is a horrible waste of your time. "
