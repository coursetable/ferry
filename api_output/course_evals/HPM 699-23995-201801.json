It was great to be able to go out to dinner with several of the speakers - I would have liked to be able to attend more.\r\n\r\nColloquium was also scheduled on Thursdays, the same day as SOM Closing Bells.

The quality would be much better if I had taken time to write it immediately after a particularly inspiring talk, rather than during exam period. Also, this is minor, but it's unfortunate that the class time conflicts with Closing Bell, which is a nice opportunity for HCM and MBA students to socialize. ",
