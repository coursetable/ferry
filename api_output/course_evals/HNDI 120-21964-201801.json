            "\u00a0Really awesome class. Great group of students and teachers. Very interactive and fun to learn such a foreign (to me) language ",
            "\u00a0Basic hindi grammar concepts and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0More than anything we seemed to expand and refine our ability to use verbs effectively in this class. This essentially filled in the holes and improved our understanding of the material from HNDI 110. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basic Hindi, now feel comfortable with reading and writing and survival speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I have gained a solid understanding of Hindi grammar, and basic vocabulary. "

            "\u00a0Great course. More conversation section though ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that it is very chill, no judgment, made friends with the entire class. Weakness is not enough speaking opportunity and sometimes class is disorganized. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a relaxed environment for a language course, and the instructors focus on and get to know each student, and really do care more about each student's progress than comparative assessment. You end up building a nice class community by the end of the year as well which is super nice. But this course is extremely disorganized and sometimes it seems as though there's not that much communication between the two instructors so that we end up doing the same exercises 3 times in one week or doing completely unrelated things different days of the week. This semester, we spent a LOT of time, almost 100% of the time, on review of concepts from last semester and really did not advance much in material past what we had already learned by the end of last semester. I think students could be held to a higher standard and we could cover much much more material in one year than we ended up covering. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me good exposure to Hindi grammar, but it could've done a better job with vocabulary and speech skill. I would recommend reading more texts in Hindi, as well as more conversation. "

            "\u00a0Most definitely recommend ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, if you need a language or have been wanting to learn Hindi. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is much better than the first semester in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0It's a chill language credit, which is hard to find, so if you want that then take this class. That's exactly what you'll get -- I came into this class really wanting to learn Hindi, and while I of course know more Hindi now than I did coming in, this class covered much less than what I expected to, and much less than other language classes. If your goal is to really learn a language and you're deciding between Hindi and another language, then another class that's better organized would probably be more worth your time. But this is a really fun class and it's the one way to learn Hindi at Yale so :-) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. That being said, this course though informative was not super engaging. "
