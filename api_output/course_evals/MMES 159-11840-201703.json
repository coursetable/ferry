            "\u00a0This was a fairly practical class. Conversational Hebrew goes through different units that deal with daily life in Israel. While you do things like learn to read a recipe or buy an apartment, you learn specialized vocabulary and modern slang. It's exceedingly helpful and usually very fun. This is a serious L5 class, though, so don't expect to do much grammar work. If you don't remember conjugations or commands or anything like that  be prepared to struggle. There's also a fairly sizable oral portion of the class, between section and homework and quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great understanding of conversational hebrew. I learned how to speak about important topics that I had previously wished to be able to speak about in hebrew. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really helpful in teaching Hebrew that is actually useful to daily life. I find that to be very rare in college language classes, and I loved that aspect of it. ",
            "\u00a0Conversational hebrew ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Hebrew.  Greatly improved my listening comprehension as well as my ability to navigate Hebrew websites. ",
            "\u00a0I significantly improved my Hebrew speaking skills in this course. The multitude of ways we practiced speaking, from videos to audio recordings was very helpful. "

        [
            "\u00a0Shiri is a terrific professor. I felt like she understood the methodology behind teaching, and was able to keep it fun and fresh. She tends to mix up class a lot with videos, conversation, games, even a cooking class or two. That said, the homework load is nothing to scoff at. It's pretty writing-intensive and really forces you to work on your comprehension. ",
            "\u00a0The class did a great job of teaching a lot of hebrew in a small period of time. That being said, in order for such progress to be made, there was a pretty decent amount of homework. ",
            "\u00a0I think the best part was the course's relevance--engaging with Israeli pop culture, learning how to use the Internet in Hebrew, learning actually useful ways to speak Hebrew. I think that there should be more clarity at the beginning of the semester about what the course will entail, because there were definitely people in the class who were unprepared and thus made us learn less because they slowed down the pace of the class. ",
            "\u00a0There was great inclusion of multi media but sometimes the class would get off topic ",
            "\u00a0Shiri is great, and I really improved my Hebrew a lot.  Coming into the course, the students were all at very different levels of Hebrew ability and she did a great job tailoring the class/assignments to each person's prior level to make sure the more advanced students weren't held back and the less advanced students weren't overwhelmed.  The only possible weakness is that we had a lot of homework, but the homework was definitely beneficial towards my learning. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a key strength was the various ways we practiced our language skills and the different ways we were assessed. Having real-world applications was very useful, and made me feel like we were learning skills I know I can and would apply. "

        [
            "\u00a0It's probably the best L5 Hebrew class offered at Yale, so you might as well. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who's taken Hebrew but wants to know how to actually use it. It's a fun class and very low-key (although it's not necessarily an easy class), but really worthwhile. Shiri is great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone trying to learn hebrew. If not, then  I wouldn't ",
            "\u00a0Great class, but a huge workload. Much more work required than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is willing to put in a bit of work to make great improvements in their ability to use Hebrew for everyday tasks. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course! Professor Goren really strives to help every student improve their Hebrew skills and I really learned a lot of valuable and applicable skills. "
