            "\u00a0I have a better foundational understanding of critical theory, its histories, and the genealogy of disciplines within american academia. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of insight on the self-reflexive anxieties of theory. Where is the separation of \"theoretical\" work and \"political\" work, if any? Who is theory for? How does the language and tone of the theoretical work influence its meaning or message? -- Taking this class made me more aware of the political stakes of academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I got a great overview of the major movements and texts in contemporary critical theory ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: I received a solid introduction to the various critical theories discussed in the course. I will be able to draw from the material discussed in this course for my future research. I will return to the authors discussed in class to continue to explore those theories that interest me.\r\nSkills: The professors did an excellent job of training me as an academic and not just as a student. I have a better sense of how to define my research interests and of how to plan projects that contribute substantially to the advancement of my field. I also became a clearer and more focused thinker as a result of taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0Familiarity with a broad array of theoretical schools and methodologies; the ability to discuss and analyze theoretical schools; comfort with a broad vocabulary of critical theory. ",
            "\u00a0- learned to pick out the main argument in a theoretical text\r\n- learned to be brave in my reading and to not give up when the material gets difficult ",
            "\u00a0I now feel far more able to tackle complex critical texts, to understand and discuss various critical arguments and enjoyed being exposed to different kinds of work which gave an insight into the practices and writing of many scholars. I have gained a knowledge of the history of some key critical concepts and their relevance in other fields and how different critical keywords have been used and discussed up to some very recent work. It has also assisted me in articulating complex ideas. "

            "\u00a0I wish the material were easier to understand, but that's of no fault to the course, and just a requirement on my end to learn more and read wider. ",
            "\u00a0The class had a great reading list and structure. I liked how the format was predictable, with every meeting opening on free discussion of \"thoughts on the week's reading.\" While such an open ended question can be really stressful to answer, I thought that it was still good to have that opportunity to think of what to say and how to articulate thoughts I had in that setting. Then, the word clouds on the board were also extremely helpful for those of us looking to expand our theory vocabulary. Papers were also satisfying: one fixed assignment, one free. \r\nOne thing that could be improved was the direction of the weekly comments. I am not sure I made any good contributions, and I am not sure if others did either. I read some, the ones that were up when I wrote my comment, but I did not often go back and read the thread later. I may have missed out on an important opportunity to learn and develop, but attending class, hearing comments, making comments, and writing papers seemed to be the most helpful. Perhaps this was not the class that could improve but myself: I wish I could have made writing and reading the online blurbs a more useful task for myself. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it would have been helpful if the professors had devoted a week just to discussing deconstruction. Since deconstruction appears in several of the course readings, it would have been useful to discuss deconstruction in its own right before moving on to other authors who have been influenced by it. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was excellent (good range and depth) and there was enough flexibility to pursue some individual interests. Class discussion was always very lively and was a good balance between understanding the texts and engaging in specific critiques and arguments about the texts. The students' contributions were always very good and the professors did a great job of guiding discussion and pushing it in new directions. The keyword assignment was a nice opportunity to do a different sort of more pointed intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- the class had good breadth in terms of time period\r\n- the class provided a useful breakdown of very difficult ideas\r\n\r\nAreas for Improvement:\r\n- too many assignments (weekly posts, midterm, final paper, attending talks and asking questions, collective bibliography, attendance and participation)\r\n- not enough clarity about assignments ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the range of material, the way that it is taught (which was great) and the way that the material brings to bear on central issues of critical theory. The fact that we were invited to challenge the work was very helpful. However, the volume of material on some weeks and its difficulty also meant that I sometimes wished there was slightly less since some of the chapters and essays were written in such a way that it required close reading, and re-reading, for me to get something from it.

            "\u00a0Incredible course, I learned so much. I have gained skills and intellectual insights that will inform the rest of my academic career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I already have recommended the course, in the sense that I gushed about it to many people. Not sure when the course will be held again, and with the same professors, so perhaps recommending is just rubbing my awesome experience in others' faces. ",
            "\u00a0yes, would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is an excellent course. I especially appreciated the ways in which the professors integrated professional scholarly development into their teaching. I came away not only with greater knowledge, but also with a better sense of who I am as an academic and how I might contribute to the advancement of my field. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. An excellent introduction to lots of different schools of theory, and a very good environment for open discussion and debate, thanks to the professors' discussion style. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ayesha and Marta were the best people to introduce me to theory. They did a great job. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student since it exposed me to so many different approaches and writers whose work I wish to explore further, as well as helping me understand many arguments made using these scholars from my own field. It was really challenging and really forced me to think in ways that were new for me, and I think that was really valuable. "
