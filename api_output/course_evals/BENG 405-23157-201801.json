            "\u00a0a systems based approach to thinking about how to solve health issues in the developing world. It exposes you to R&D for health technologies designed for the developing world. You also get a sense of what the process of designing, testing, implementing and funding a project is like. ",

The midterm project was feasible, but the final project was kind of a stretch, especially for people who don't have extensive BME/engineering backgrounds. ",

Picking random groups for the first project made it a lot more difficult than it should have been - some people worked a lot harder than others, and everyone lost points if one person messed up. Grading was unnecessarily harsh - points were taken off for things that weren't stated in the question, and a disproportionate amount of points were taken off for small errors. ",

I thought the hands on heart monitors we made were very cool and I felt much more involved and I wished we could have done more of that throughout the course! "

I didn't learn much beyond the first couple of weeks, the grading was unnecessarily harsh, and many of the classes (especially guest speakers) were less engaging than they could have been. The projects were interesting, but we were put in random groups for the first project and that wasn't fun, to say the least. That being said, the workload is pretty light. ",
