            "\u00a0I understand the central themes and arguments of a text I never would have read fully or understood on my own. It made me think more deeply and consciously about how I lead my life. ",
            "\u00a0You get a thorough introduction to the early work of Martin Heidegger Being and Time, through the interpretation of Professor Hagglund (which is a great interpretation). No tricks, just philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a feel for the language of Heidegger (Prof. Hagglund likened learning Heidegger to learning a language). I also left the course with a good grasp on the content of Heidegger's arguments in Being and Time. And I learned a lot about the way philosophy is practiced in academia through the scholar visits throughout the semester. ",

            "\u00a0This course introduced me to the basic concepts in Being and Time and to the overall project of Heidegger during the mid 1920s. I also learned how to do a de re reading of texts that identifies what an author has committed herself to even if she does not explicitly express it. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were fascinating and engaging. But I would have liked to connect the lectures to the text more often; I think it would have helped me learn Heidegger's \"language\" more quickly and efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Hagglund has a great knowledge of Heidegger and does a wonderful job translating him into very understandable terms. The course also does a great job by providing supplementary articles that will bolster your understanding. Another great part of the course is Prof Hagglund is definitely willing to meet outside of class to help your understanding. Because this course was a Franke seminar, it was a phenomenal experience to hear from some of the greatest thinkers today (Carman, Pippin, Brandom, and Crowell) who were all willing to engage on these issues for many hours. The negative aspects of this course are surely hear though. For one, this class is a lecture not a seminar. Hagglund likes to lecture and although questions are more than welcome, this is not the typical seminar experience. Also there could be more efforts to facilitate student discussion and engagement. It would be nice to give brief introductions on who we are and also to have more chances to write before the final paper, which is the only assignment in this course (yes your whole grade hinges upon a final 15 page paper). Also Hagglund can be a bit stubborn on his interpretation of the text (and philosophy in general), which completely disregards late Heidegger. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course gave a very compelling account of Heidegger and Prof. Hagglund is fantastic. I did feel a much greater familiarity with the \"language\" of Heidegger after the course. One way the course could be improved is that Prof. Hagglund could be a little clearer on the time commitment -- I was surprised by the two-hour dinners, following one-and-a-half-hour public lectures, following two-hour seminars, that cropped up toward the end of the semester. I also didn't always feel the \"extra sessions\" (often scheduled at the last minute) were completely necessary, and, given the time commitment required for a Franke Seminar, I probably would have preferred if they hadn't been added to the calendar. But this is a small weakness -- overall, I thought the class was very strong! ",
            "\u00a0Small seminar size allowed real attention to detail and questions. ALthough it was a seminar, it was taught as a lecture which meant discussion and debate was mostly lacking; however, this turned out to be useful as the level of thought was such that Hagglund's commentary was often more important for understanding than seminar-type discussion. One weakness was that because the entire grade of the course rested in one final essay, there was a lack of feedback about writing about Heidegger, and some difficulty in really getting to know the expectations for the class. However, in terms of the content, the class was incredibly engaging and really brought Heidegger to life. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt change a thing. The guest lecturers were excellent, too. ",
            "\u00a0The class began with a series of very strong lectures by Professor Hagglund that clearly  helped to explicate Heidegger's dense text. We did not close read \"Being and Time\" in class as much as I would like, but after lecture I always found myself able to go back and understand earlier chapters that had previously sounded like nonsense. The usual format of Hagglund's class, two classes per week, might better facilitate varied and nuanced understandings of particular sections of the book, but the one class a week format did make for several excellent seminar discussions. The class was also brilliant as a Franke seminar -- it was incredible to sit in class with four famous philosophy professors, hear their public lectures, and eat dinner with them. Debating Heidegger late into the night over dinner is definitely a defining moment of my Yale career. The class also included several film screenings, which were all a joy, even if we didn't spend as much time as I would like discussing each one. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies in the richness of the material and in Professor Hgglund's ability to convey that richness to his students. The only way the course might be improved is to provide a bit more guidance earlier in the semester with the final paper, which is worth 80% of the final grade. This way, the paper will be less daunting and of better quality because students will have been forced to think about it for at least a month or two before it is due. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture format of this course was one of its major strengths. As a seminar, this class would, I think, have been a disaster, insofar as none of us came into it with the knowledge or skills necessary to read and advance interpretations of Being and Time. Hearing Professor Hagglund's own interpretation of the work was helpful in this regard, not only because it picks up on many different sections of the work, but also because it allowed me to develop a framework by which I could assess other philosopher's interpretations. By the same light, the opportunity to hear other renowned Heidegger scholars present their own interpretations during the Franke lectures and dinners was insightful insofar as it revealed where the major arguments over Being and Time are. \r\n\r\nMy main criticism of the class is that it didn't sustain the pace that it set at the beginning. Professor Hagglund's lectures on the division two of Being and Time grew to be a bit repetitive. That they became such is not completely his fault, insofar as Heidegger himself is repetitive in division two, but I would have wished for the pace of the course to have been a bit more balanced. Covering several concepts that we hardly mentioned in the first half of the course such as spatiality, for example, could have alleviated some of the tedium. I also would have wished at the end of the course for an understanding of where Heidegger goes in his thought from Being and Time. While Being and Time is for Professor Hagglund the definite account of Heidegger's contribution to philosophy, it was not such for Heidegger. Covering late Heidegger in detail would be way beyond the scope of the class, of course, but a few comments on why Heidegger changes his thought would have been appreciated. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in theorizing about how you lead your life in a totally new way. The reading can be arduous, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, but if you understand the negatives. If you want to learn about Being and Time, this is a great way to do it with someone that is an expert on it. That said, you have to accept that this will not be an interactive seminar and also the lack of opportunities to write and own these ideas before the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to read all of Being and Time (it is long, dense, and poorly written), or just immerse yourself in Heidegger's fantastic arguments for a semester, definitely take the class. Prof. Hagglund is an extremely compelling and charismatic communicator of Heidegger, and he really brings the philosophy to life. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend for students looking to get an incredible in-depth idea of Being and Time and deeply engage with ontology and a phenomenological approach to questions of being. WOuld not recommend to beginners in philosophy who do not have a bit of sense of the intellectual history of German philosophy and have experience with in depth philosophical reading , writing and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Hagglund will change the way you think. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to any other student. Professor Hagglund has convinced me that \"Being and Time\" offers insight into our lives and our world that should be known by as many people as possible. Hagglund's explanations of the text are also incomparable. For a philosophy student, the class especially helps as a solid foundation in metaphysics or epistemology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are a philosophy nut or somebody who likes to wade through complex ontological arguments. If not, then maybe consider a different a class. It's a lot of work, and the reading is often slow. However, Hgglund's teaching is phenomenal and many points of confusion or difficulty are clarified during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0With some reservations, I would recommend this course to another student. While Professor Hagglund's manner of explicating Heidegger doesn't demand foreknowledge of philosophy prior to Being and Time, having some knowledge of it is helpful to understand the stakes of Heidegger's argument. That being said, someone who is already committed to philosophy may find the class frustrated, insofar as it is not exegetical or based in close reading. Professor Hagglund is not interested in dwelling over specific ambiguities in the text but rather seeks to convey a general understanding of what is at stake in Heidegger's notions of death, authenticity, and so forth. So long as one is comfortable with this de re manner of analysis, Professor Hagglund's course is excellent and does a superb job of making Being and Time accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you really want to read the book bit haven't had the chance to. Since it is a hard book to read, it would be helpful to listen to the professor's explanations. However, this 18-people \"seminar\" is taught more like a lecture, since there is very little discussion, and the professor does not seem interested in even learning people's names. The guest lecturers are really knowledgeable. "
