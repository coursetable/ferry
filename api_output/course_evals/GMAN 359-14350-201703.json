            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I gained an understanding of the complicated relationship of law and literature. There exists an complicated duality between the two, wherein there exist laws of literature and simultaneously the literature of the law, which this course elucidated thoroughly. Consequently, class featured an ample mix of legal and literary discussion that provided me with an indispensable analytical lens. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a relatively robust introductory understanding of the field of law and literature, though the course did not venture--in our discussions, at least--into current problems in the field. Rather, we focused more on case-by-case applications of various law and literature lenses to literary and legal works. The real value of the course was in developing this way of thinking, and in my view this was ultimately much more valuable than, say, a survey of the current state of the literature on this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ways that law and literature can be viewed similarly. I learned different conceptions of justice and of the trial system. I learned about how similar theater and law are. ",
            "\u00a0We discussed the relationship between law and literature, the understanding of law as literature, and different representations of the law (and the evolution of those representations) in literature. "

            "\u00a0The structure of seminar was incredibly effective. Professor Trstedt would provide an overview of the week's works and some questions or thoughts to help lead discussion, and the remainder of the seminar was largely student-driven discussion with appropriate and insightful input and feedback from the professor. I thoroughly enjoyed the structure of the course and class, as well as the selection of readings and resulting discussions. I also really appreciated the small class size (6 of us including the professor), because it made for a simultaneously relaxed but engaging environment and I felt like there was never a shortage of topics to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I can think of few weaknesses. I did think that some of the optional readings would have seriously improved the class discussion if made mandatory; many times, the content of the optional readings so improved my understanding of the mandatory text that they were all I could think about during discussion. I think the care and depth with which the syllabus was constructed was a real strength. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are very interesting and varied, spanning different media and different forms of literature. The seminar was fun and engaging, although that will change depending on the makeup of the class. Some of the readings were very abstract and dry, but those tended to be the optional ones anyway. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. Readings were interesting, relevant, and clearly built upon one another. Class discussions were engaging and productive. Professor Truestedt always made herself available, allowed us ample freedom to explore whatever most interested us in essays and presentations, and ran lively discussions, lecturing where appropriate. "

            "\u00a0This course is absolutely vital to anyone interested in legal or literary studies. Law and literature have such an important but complex dynamic, and this course explicates its intricacies in a consistently engaging and fascinating manner. The reading list encompasses a plethora of different types of works, such that there's definitely something for everyone in this class. Professor Trstedt was incredibly accommodating, ensuring that class was tailored so that we all got the most out of it that we could, offering to alter the syllabus to spend more time on a certain author or incorporate something we had not previously discussed. Overall, this class and the professor were nothing short of fantastic, and I would recommend it without reservation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely--as long as you're really interested in both law and literature. I suppose that otherwise it could get repetitive. But that's probably true of any seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely; if you're interested at all in law in the abstract, this class is great. It touches on so many different aspects of law, and we usually had enough time to dig in deeper and really talk about them. The workload is relatively light, and the material is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you're interested in literature that deals with legal questions. Readings are always interesting and very manageable. Not too much writing at all. Professor Truestedt is wonderful. And lots of Kafka. What more could you want? "
