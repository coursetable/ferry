            "\u00a0I learned that I do not want to major in MCDB ",
            "\u00a0Massive biological literacy. I feel very confident going into MCDB research after taking this course. Very much recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The fundamental basics of developmental biology: body axes formation, limb development, muscle development. Growth in model organisms such as the zebrafish and fly. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course I developed a higher level of understanding for the developmental concepts touched upon in this course. I especially enjoyed learning about the embryonic patterning mechanisms such as those found in somitogenesis and the stem cell portion of the course. The first third of the course was a brief review of the embryonic developmental biology we learned in the intro biology sequence and a subsequent comprehensive look deeper into these topics. I learned a little about the history and future directions of this science as well. "

            "\u00a0I wish Professor Kankel's slides were easier to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures can be long and convoluted, but the information all seems to be quite relevant. Midterms are fair. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course is the weekly quizzes which make sure you keep on top of the material. In the beginning, I found the quizzes pretty tough because it is hard to know what to focus your studies on as there is only one question on the quiz. The key really is to study everything in great detail. There are no short cuts. Perhaps it would be better if there are more questions on the quiz so that if you don't know the answer to the one question asked you will have other questions where you can show your knowledge of the material. A weakness for me personally was that the slides were not posted before class. It is really helpful for me to take my notes on the lecture slides, so that was a challenge for me adjusting my note taking style. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: -Many course concepts are extremely interesting, so although the course does take a lot of effort, it feels worth it. \r\n\r\n-The structure of three non-cumulative exams rather than midterms and a final really works well, as there is a great bulk of information.\r\n\r\n-I liked having the different professors, as I felt like it was exciting to hear from experts in certain fields. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: -Memorizing transcription factors often felt convoluted as they were simply combinations of letters and numbers. I would have much preferred an emphasis on a few solid pathways (what inhibits what, how is this different from in other processes), rather than being given for example four transcription factors in early heart development that had little context. \r\n\r\n-Some of the material was very hard to visualize, although I understand that some of the material was just difficult/conceptual in nature, so it was hard to teach at a level undergraduates like us could understand. For example, the clock/wavefront concept was very difficult to follow but perhaps there is no specific better way to teach this\r\n\r\n-Some of the small lecture bits felt scattered. For example, in vasculogenesis, there were a number of small examples that were meant to show the diversity of vasculogenesis, but they felt a bit too superficially taught. (e.g. ureteric bud, zebrafish cardinal vein) \r\n\r\n-Professor Kankel's websites are difficult to use. I would have much preferred lecture slides like Professor Holley's. \r\n\r\n-I wish there was more time spent on Professor Van Wolfswinkel's specialities! A lot was packed into the last three lectures, but they were very interesting (germ line formation, sex specification, regeneration) \r\n\r\n-I didn't feel like there was much personal engagement within the class. There wasn't much professor/student or student/student dialogue. People just came in, took notes, and left, each week. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is how great the professors are and how willing they are to help you learn, especially if you are passionate about the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - interesting material and not too stressful compared to some other MCDB cores \r\n\r\nWeakness - being taught by 3 different teachers with different styles of lecturing and expectations can make the studying a bit chaotic ",
            "\u00a0I think the teaching staff and TA are the primary strengths of this course. It is well organized and informative. The tests and quizzes are mostly fair, although I feel like the instructors are looking for oddly specific wording and will subtract points from the assignment if those vocabulary terms are not explicitly used. I also think that Professor van Wolfswinkel could have used another lecture period to convey her knowledge because three lectures seemed very rushed for her purposes. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a good class if you like biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. An excellent elective for MCDB majors. ",
            "\u00a0As you the read the title of the course, if you are not gripped by an all-consuming fascination - don't take this class, and take another MCDB core instead. Generally not super interesting, not terribly difficult but graded very particularly, overall kind of boring. The material is somewhat useful and not meaningless, but this just doesn't seem like the best way to learn it. There are very few people who I would recommend this class to over another MCDB core. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an MCDB major looking for a core class, this is a great option. The class size is small which is unique for most MCDB classes. There are weekly quizzes which require a lot of studying but they help you keep up with the material. Besides the weekly quizzes there are 3 exams that count for 25% each. There are no psets or homework assignments. The material is interesting and it is cool getting to learn from 3 professors who are lecturing on their topic of expertise and research areas. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you find concepts in developmental biology interesting (limb development, body axes specification, sex specification of germ line cells) . There is a lot of work to keep up with the weekly quizzes, but I think it's a rewarding class in that many of the concepts are very dynamic and visual. Luckily, the larger testing format is three non-cumulative midterms. The beginning of the course is a bit tough, when you go through a lot of preliminary setting up of transcription factors and morphogen gradients. For example, I didn't feel like understanding how transcription factors were spaced throughout a drosophila egg was very interesting, but it took a lot of time to get those pathways memorized. One of the issues in the class is that some topics are gone into too much detail for no reason, and it feels like bulk memorization. \r\n\r\nThis is by means not an \"easier\" biology class. I have yet to take cell, which is notorious for it's workload, but just understand you will also have to work for a good grade here. Professor Holley, Kankel, and Van Wolfswinkel are all experts in their fields, so you will get some interesting stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, with the stipulation that it may not be easy to obtain an \"A\" grade due to the small class size and high median performance on assignments. I thoroughly enjoyed the course and feel like I learned and internalized a significant amount of information. The workload and assignments are fair, and the teaching staff does a reasonably good job of preparing students for the exams. "
