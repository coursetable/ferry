            "\u00a0This class helped me to get a better idea of what an environmental manager (which is a very broad term) may do. It also reminded me that managers will often need to make decisions without incomplete information, which is both okay and usually expected. The class taught me to think more critically about other researchers' findings, even if they are published in accredited journals. ",
            "\u00a0An appreciation for the lack of true ecosystem boundaries, the human element of field research and reporting, and a very basic grasp of the underlying principles to keep in mind when managing ecosystems.\r\nRedfield's Ratio! ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of biogeochemical cycling and the inherent challenges of modeling them on a large-scale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about nutrient cycling, ecosystem as a framing device, budgeting, rapid and voluminous primary literature research, and dynamic management. I also had the great insight of the provisional nature of scientific information. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of ecosystem services, how to evaluate certain sources of information, how to create nutrient budgets, and how to work with a system that may not have data available. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to many of the basic concepts of ecology that are fundamental to the environmental sciences. As someone who took a lot of biology and chemistry but never took a formal ecology course this knowledge was crucial. Mark also did a great job putting this knowledge into context; both its scientific context (whether a particular idea was contested or bullet-proof) and its social context (e.g. this famous scientist is super charismatic so everyone accepted his idea even though there are equally valid competing theories out there). ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that provides you with very valuable real-world example and experience for wildlife and landscape/ ecosystems management and restoration. It shows you how to think of all the possible ways an environmental project could go terribly terribly wrong, but also the many unique, creative ways that environmental management can be approached! Overall, this course really shows you how to connect all the dots in ecosystems to understand all the variables and moving parts and how they interact and impact each other, as well as understanding how humans and modern society fit into this ecological network. ",
            "\u00a0I feel I gained an important perspective to ecosystem and water system management. The projects and critiques helped me analyze secondary/primary sources and literature much better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about ecosystem management from a system-level perspective. In particular, I learned about the importance of nutrient cycling through a system, and the project helped me practice reading the primary literature and summarizing it in a meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the factors and relationships within ecosystems and how to evaluate them. ",
            "\u00a0Basic ecology and ecosystems functioning principles ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about global carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus flows as well as how to study fluxes within a discrete system. I learned about trees, trophies systems, and ecosystems generally. My ability to comprehend scientific papers increased, as well as my ability to understand the insights and limitations of a given paper. I feel more comfortable handling data as a result of the final project. "

            "\u00a0I think the knowledge, skills, and insights gained in this class aligned fairly well with my expectations. Although, I think it would have been nice to have talked a little more specifically about how the skills and knowledge could have been applied to specific jobs or organizations that specialize in ecosystem functions or services. I think having a section on field work may have also have been helpful, even in Dr. Duguid's class will be covering that pretty extensively in her class in the spring. Getting some information on it would still have been nice, especially if some students want to get a taste of it to help them decide if they should take Dr. Duguid's class or not. ",
            "\u00a0If I had been able to put more into this class, I would have gotten more out of it. I think it met my expectations and in any ways that it didn't, were my fault. ",
            "\u00a0The class knowledge aligned with my expectations and I was able to further dive into some nutrient cycling topics that I was looking to learn more about. I also appreciated the insight into learning about biodiversity and organism controls. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't have too many expectations going in. I guess I expected a more hands on, detailed approach, rather than the primarily theoretical frameworks we were exposed to. This, however, was totally fine by me, as I believe it will set me up for future hands on activities and courses. I'm happy to have the theoretical and analytical knowledge to help create a more complex and strong paradigm when it comes to approaching ecosystem management. ",
            "\u00a0It was not necessarily what I was expecting to learn out of this course, but I am very glad that I did learn those things. ",
            "\u00a0Exceeded my expectation, particularly because of how well Mark contextualized the information he provided us. ",
            "\u00a0The knowledge I gained from this class exceeded my expectations. I thought was just going to be a kind of basic ecology course, but the things I learned in this class will actually be very useful and relevant for my future work as a conservationist / ecological manager. The group-projects that you work on throughout the semester are especially valuable, as the final product we created (with the guidance and feedback of Prof. Bradford and the class TA) was very nearly worthy (if not completely ready) for presentation to real-world clients (e.g. a city council, a private landowner, a university, a federal nature preserve, etc.) looking to improve/ restore/ manage an ecosystem. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well. ",
            "\u00a0They were similar to what I expected of this course. The only difference is I expected the readings to tie into lecture more, but that aspect wasnt different from many other courses Ive taken. ",
            "\u00a0Very well ",
            "\u00a0I didn't have specific expectations, since it was a required class, and I felt very well prepared to continue on with the concentration after taking this class. "

            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of information on ecosystems, and I liked the discussions about the dissolving of the divide between humans and these ecosystems. In class we talked about whether completing our element budgets for a real client would have been beneficial. I can see the benefit in that, but I can also see where it would have been a lot more stressful, particularly for students who are coming into the class with little to no ecology/environmental management experience.\r\nI think it would also have been better if the professor had posted the slides at least a few days before the lecture, so that students could print out the slides if they wanted to in order to take notes on them. ",
            "\u00a0I love Mark's rapport with the course, and his general excitability for the course material. It's infectious. He also seems to have a fantastic grasp on the literature which is very helpful, and often cites his colleagues as well as his own work, which helps me feel like I'm getting the full F&ES faculty experience.\r\n\r\nMore climate change please ",
            "\u00a0The course provided strong fundamentals of cycling without going into too much unnecessary detail. The semester long project was challenging, but Mark and Eli provided great feedback to allow our group to gain comprehension about our ecosystem. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were engaging, as were the discussions. I really enjoyed the sessions where we researched and critiqued the primary literature, as well as the section that had us assess the comment and comment-comment on the role of mycorrhizae in the carbon cycle. \r\n\r\nI couldn't identify any glaring weaknesses. I occasionally struggled with navigating the course on Canvas; it could be really helpful to have class dates and topics next to the module listings. For example: \r\n\r\nClass 8 | Sep 26 | Bottom up regulation\r\n\r\nClass 9 | Oct 1 | Experimental design ",
            "\u00a0The project and discussion modules in the course were a great way to keep students engaged throughout the course. I think assigning students a project to work on throughout the semester challenged us, but also allowed us to come out of the class at the end knowing that we had accomplished something, which is great. Improvements for the project especially would just to be outline (in Phase 1 particularly) what this project is and work with students to help them grasp it during class time. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength of the course was the class project, which had multiple iterations: a midterm report, a final report, a presentation, and a final paper. This allowed us to dig really deep into one topic in a way that was super rewarding.\r\n\r\nThe course did occasionally skim over concepts that were a little tough to understand -- this didn't bother me so much because I wasn't expecting to come out of this course with an exhaustive knowledge of every ecological concept, but I know it was a little frustrating for some people. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength has to be Mark. He clearly explains complicated material in a way that left me, with little chemistry and ecology training, feeling confident in my ability to apply this information in the future. Only improvement I could think of is actually to replace the readings with problem sets. This might be a controversial suggestion in the eyes of my peers, but I do wish I had some more practice applying the information we learned. As great as the project was, I would have appreciated a little more work. ",
            "\u00a0-More in-class problems\r\n-Include optional field trips\r\n-Keep projects! ",
            "\u00a0This courses strength by far was Mark, who tried to keep the topics engaging with his personality and humor. Marks knowledge also greatly added to the course, as well as the projects and assignments he assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments and in-class exercise help to facilitate learning and reinforce principles learned through reading and lectures. Lectures were tedious at times and contained too much information without relief through visuals and examples. ",
            "\u00a0The paper critiques and exercises/projects were a useful way to put the course content into practice. The video recorded lectures were also helpful. I found the lectures well organized with a good sequential logic. The slides were very logical and had a lot of information. "

            "\u00a0The professor is easy to talk to, so if you have questions, don't be afraid to ask him for help. You'll also be doing a lot of research on your element budget, so be sure to pick a system you enjoy reading about. ",
            "\u00a0Have a good idea of an ecosystem that interests you that you would like to work extensively with. This way you will have a good idea for a semester long project. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Do the reading, plan a lot of time in for problem solving with your budgets. ",
            "\u00a0Try to engage as much as you can with your project and teammates. Ask Mark and Eli questions and sign up for their office hours when you are confused - they are very helpful! ",
            "\u00a0Really pick a course project that you're excited about, because you will be working on it for a while! ",
            "\u00a0Participate in discussion during class and work well with your group on the project because it is most of your grade. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE IT. Mark is a fantastic instructor and I learned about ecosystem management in such a unique way because of taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Pick a project that you are truly interested in because you will spend a lot of time on it. Most of the coursework is for the project. ",
            "\u00a0This class is geared to help you after F&ES and I think that shouldnt go underappreciated. Take this class with the foresight of how it will help you. ",
            "\u00a0Can be tedious at times but you do walk away with a lot of new knowledge ",
            "\u00a0This was the best class I have taken so far at F&ES. I learned a ton of material that feels very foundational for my studies and work. The level of intellectual engagement is high, but the content and underlying concepts are spelled out clearly enough. The course progresses in a logical and sequential manner. The work that is required (paper critiques, projects) does require a lot of intellectual engagement, so don't be deceived by the fact that there aren't assignments every week. Definitely take advantage of the supplementary readings (textbook chapters) and TA help if you don't understand something. "
