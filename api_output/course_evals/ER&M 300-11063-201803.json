            "\u00a0The seminar was probably one of the most concrete, hands-on classes I've taken as a major in a social sciences field.  Professor Tran's iteration of the class involved a collaborative class project in which we arranged a common exhibit showcasing activism by students of color at Yale since the 1960s.  In addition to discussions in class over the material and its implications for both the methodology and substance of doing ethnic studies and related work (Hint: Your work is always in some way related to ethnic studies and other fields that use critical theory because they're always more all-encompassing than people give them credit for.  Middle-class white men are equally as relevant to ethnic studies as working-class women of color.), we were able to do archival research, which I had never had an opportunity to do before and now has planted some new ideas for what kinds of thesis work I can do in senior year. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how about the founding of ethnic studies, which I had no prior knowledge of. I appreciate that. In addition, I learned how different theories I had been learning in past ER&M course were related and could serve as larger frameworks to analyze global phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Tran makes this an incredibly engaging course. Throughout the semester we held classes in different cultural houses relevant to that week's course material. This was perhaps my favourite part about the course considering how simultaneously enriching and humbling our discussions were within the context of the histories and realities of different cultural groups present on campus. The class focuses quite strongly on student activism on college campuses and the consequences of its successes and failures that have helped form what constitutes ethnic studies and its interdisciplinary nature today. I 100% recommend this course, whether or not you are an ER&M major. It truly changes your perspective not only on student activism but really on your role as an intellectual on any college campus in the present moment. Our final project was a semester-long project involving archival research on six decades of activism on Yale's campus, finally culminating in both an online and physical showcase/exhibition. ",
            "\u00a0The two biggest themes of the course were the interconnectedness of different forms of oppression and our position as students to be activists and encouraging us to become more involved in activism. The course opens with Ferguson's \"We Demand\", a manual for the student activist. The final project forced me to make extensive use of the archives in Sterling and the Cultural Centers, the first time I had had to do so, and it was a great, albeit difficult and sometimes tedious, experience! The course is also an amazing space to get to know the other ER&M majors in your cohort better. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really fantastic course that provides insight on racialization, highlighting immigration history, past and contemporary racisms and student of color activism on college campuses alongside the intersection between race and gender, sexuality and class. ",
            "\u00a0The approach of ethnic studies, the history of the field. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Much of the class came as in-depth discussion of the materials as well as their applicability to lived reality, and this generated much of the substance of what we learned.  The other major element of the course was the assembly of the collaborative class exhibit, which rounded out the curriculum very well.  I also appreciated the dispersion of other assignments across the semester, allowing for a more even workload, which at Yale is rare.\r\n\r\nBe warned, however, that the workload can be relatively intense due less to its volume and more to its pace.  This was more true at the beginning and middle of the semester and tends to become more manageable closer to the end.  As well, our visits to the cultural houses are a fantastic component of the course that I recommend keeping and actually deepening.  I remember that the archives of the cultural houses proved to be some of the most useful when assembling the class exhibit, so explaining the historical resources that the cultural houses have to offer could do them more justice and help with similar projects in future sessions of the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I thought some of the assignments were not very well thought-through. For example, we had a position paper assignment, and the potential topics ranged from huge topics like prison abolition to more specific topics like creation of an ethnic studies distributional requirement-- yet the expectations for the two kinds of essays in terms of making an original argument were the same. I have no idea how one could make an original argument for prison abolition in a 4 page essay, because the topic has already been widely written about. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because of its themes and the variety of assignments we had to do in order to apply the knowledge we had been covering in readings and discussion. It was great to see how an ethnic studies framework could be applied to a variety of fields. Professor Tran was great as well. Although I wish that the collaborative art exhibit had been better made more clear sooner, I do not believe that the course had any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is its requirement that you immerse yourself in the archival research process, equipping you with an undeniably essential skill-set. The other was definitely the weekly relocation of our learning space in different cultural houses. \r\n\r\nOther than that, throughout the semester you produce 4 conceptually varied short papers- an analytical piece, a participant-observation piece, a position piece and an exhibition reflection. I'd definitely consider this a strength because aside from being well spaced out (in terms of the deadline) and relatively short, writing was never the same for two papers-- each assignment ensured you were approaching your writing in a novel, interesting way. Basically, it never got boring! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the syllabus was chosen really well such that our readings each week were all coherent to a specific theme and were just really interesting, but I felt the most important strength to be how the collaborative nature of the final project allowed us to get to the other ER&M majors around us better and pushed us to be activists. ",
            "\u00a0Since this course is effectively co-taught by semester, the syllabus is really well thought-out. ",
            "\u00a0The materials were well planned and organized. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is a required class for ER&M majors, so I recommend this class in that respect to the relevant people, but I also highly recommend it on its own merits as a genuinely fascinating and in-depth seminar that makes clear how all-encompassing the histories and narratives of the oppressed can be.  It will of course be difficult for non-ER&M majors to be admitted to the course since priority is given to ER&M majors, so I recommend taking as many ER&M courses as possible and necessary regardless of major because (a) it is a fantastic program with wonderful professors and (b) giving more weight to the program might necessitate giving it more resources and *ahem* department status where it can control its own affairs. ",
            "\u00a0If you are an er&m major, take it and enjoy it! You'll get to know a community of other er&m majors and learn about really interesting and relevant topics that make you rethink the role of ethnic studies, student activism, universities, etc -- and you will read foundational texts in ethnic studies that you've probably been meaning to get to. If you're not an er&m major, know that many of the people in the class are required to take the class, so I think the level of engagement is a little lower than other classrooms-- it was not most people's priority class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because of its themes and the variety of assignments we had to do in order to apply the knowledge we had been covering in readings and discussion. It was great to see how an ethnic studies framework could be applied to a variety of fields. Professor Tran was great as well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I mean of course it's required for ER&M majors and is incredible course to synthesize your other courses and meet other majors, but we had three non-ER&M students in the class and I thought they brought a lot of valuable outside information to our class as well as questioning our assumptions about our information. ",
            "\u00a0yes  !! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Eye opening ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wishes to educate themselves on the important topic of race in the US today. ",
            "\u00a0Comparative Ethnic Studies is a highlight in my Yale College experience. The readings are foundational for any ethnic studies scholars, and they are powerful, influential, and important. Each author challenged us to re-evaluate and to contest traditional histories, structures, and systems of power. The discussions were thought-provoking and interesting and I wish they would have go on for longer. The final project involves a class exhibit on student of color activism throughout the decades. The project enriched the classroom experience by bonding all of the students in the class and by allowing us to use the knowledge from the readings in the real world. I loved this class and all the students in it who made it one of the best classes at Yale. Professor Tran is an amazing professor who guided us through our journey in honoring the student of colors activists that paved our way during the anniversary of the Ethnicity, Race, and Migration Program. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good for not only ER&M majors but also other students who engage with any kind of social activities or who are interested in any kind of social issues in the US. "
