            "\u00a0This course was good for increasing my background knowledge of lived religious experience in Early Modern Europe. I also read a lot of John Calvin's writings for my essay which helped fill in a big gap in my primary source knowledge. "

            "\u00a0Professor Eire is the ultimate strength of the course. You will not meet a nicer person, who knows even half of what this man has learned in his field. Moreover, it is a fun class to take. 2 hours will go by without your having been bored once (not every time, but at least sometimes, which is an incredible testament to Professor Eire's treatment of the material and the engagement of the students in the course). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Carlos Eire, as always. Having a mix of graduate and undergraduate students made the course very interesting. The secondary literature and its emphasis was a cool approach.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Could feel unstructured at times, but overall was great. "
