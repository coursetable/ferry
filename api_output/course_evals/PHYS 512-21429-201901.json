Time and time again I have realized that I fail to grasp what's going on with statistical mechanics.  When presented a problem I will have very little idea of how to answer it, but once I'm presented with the solution it's not hard to understand. ",

            "\u00a0I think the class was taught well.  It was well organized and covered a lot of material without going too fast.  The biggest weakness of the class in my opinion is that it was taught at too high of a level for me, but I think that I would have done better in the undergrad version of the class. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Covers many fundamental derivations that are important for a good understanding of statistical mechanics\r\n- Online notes are great when they're posted\r\n- Did a good job of emphasizing what components of the course were important\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I don't think Kardar is a good book for this; I think Pathria or a more comprehensive text would be more useful.\r\n- The course in terms of problem sets could do with an increased density. There was at least one problem for every topic discussed, but having multiple problems that are only slight variations, and making it explicit how these problems relate to each other (something not always obvious to someone attempting a problem for the first time) would further develop our appreciation for the nuances between them, making problem sets more productive. I suppose you could also ",
