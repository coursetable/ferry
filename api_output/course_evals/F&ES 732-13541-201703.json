This included analytical skills related to probability in hydrologic calculations, field skills in streamflow measurement, and qualitative skills related to stream classification. I also found it valuable that the class progressed in such a way that these skills built successively on each other. "

            "\u00a0The knowledge skills and insights aligned quite well with my expectations. The hydrologic component was a bit more emphasized than I was anticipating. However, the depth and detail of the geomorphic knowledge and skills exceeded my expectations. I did hope that there would be some computer modeling in the class, but after speaking with the professor at the beginning of the class, I confirmed this was not the case. He did provide opportunity to include such skill learning as an extra component of the final project. I wonder if it might be valuable to reduce some of the focus on hydrology since this is covered in other courses, and provide some more time for fundamentals of modeling, since this is a skill that employers often look for.

            "\u00a0I believe the strengths of the class lie in the real world applicability of the material. The lessons were taught in such a way that students were constantly being reminded of how the skills could be used in an actual stream assessment or restoration project. The only weakness of the class I can think of is too much focus on hydrology, since this may have been covered in other classes at FES. "
