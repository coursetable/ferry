            "\u00a0The insight gained (or really a reminder) was to trust my experience and if a course seems terribly organized, don't stick it out after shopping period. ",
            "\u00a0After going into this class knowing absolutely no german, I can now speak and write simple german, as well as read and understand fairly complex text and speech. ",

            "\u00a0The strength was the interest all of the students in our section had in learning German. There was a great attitude and a willingness to persevere with a poorly designed and rather poorly executed course. \r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were many. 1) A canned curriculum that did not provide the appropriate or necessary support for students to meet the learning objectives. The homework is online and is often not connected closely to the textbook with which it is supposed to be paired. 2) There is very little grammar practice or opportunity to do so with the materials provided. 3) The requirement to have online \"pen pals\" with German high school students and the time this takes is ridiculous. There is little gain and a lot of wasted effort. 4) The general pattern of the course results in tests after six days of (not great) instruction. This is remarkable given most students do not seem to understand the (grad-student) instructor's directions during class. I can't imagine what the grades on tests are. 5) Other \"extras\" in the course are not appropriate to the level at which we are working. For instance, there was a worksheet to fill out for a video we watched in class. While only a few of us even understood the questions being asked, none of us knew the vocabulary necessary to complete the worksheet. The video was in no way tied to the curriculum. 6) While the instructor seemed interested in teaching, she clearly had no experience doing so and did not have the ability to alter her routine (which seemed to have been entirely dictated to her) or offer alternative approaches to the material to improve students' learning. 7) The final project required far more time spent on non-core learning objectives than reasonable. If 50% of the time is spent setting up basic shots, finding costumes, coordinating schedules, etc. what is the point? If the goal is to tie the material from the semester together, there are far more efficient, effective, and appropriate ways of doing so. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had had more time between exams.  The course moved very quickly, and I didn't always feel like I had enough time to memorize all that I needed to for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course offers a great way to learn German. However, it is structured in a way that certain important grammer is left to the students to work out on their own time in the homework. For me, it is surprising. I think it will be great if the adviser could go over these grammatical issues during the class time. "

            "\u00a0I am still very interested in learning the German language, but I absolutely would not recommend this course in its current form. I do not believe it is designed or executed well. I also think for this amount of money, we should have instructors with some experience or aptitude for teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Whether or not you should take this class really depends on what you want to get out of it. It is a perfectly fine course if you're just looking for a language credit. It's also, maybe unexpectedly, a great fifth class. There is really not much work at all; in fact, I think there should have been more. You'd probably do better to take intensive German if you want to get a solid foundation in the language in all four areas (reading, writing, speaking, and listening). There's just too much busywork and a lot of time-wasting that goes on in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  It accomplished what it claimed to.  I am now proficient in german at a very basic level. ",
