            "\u00a0This course has given me a clear idea of how the history of Japanese cinema unfolded from its earliest days to the late 1950s. Many topics in the course offered broader insights into Japanese culture and history beyond film. I have acquired the basic skills of close analysis of film as well. "

            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is how comprehensive it is. Within the space of one semester it provides a lot of knowledge in a very systematic and well-rounded way. What can be called the course's weakness is partly the result of this same approach: the workload can be quite overwhelming, especially the long double screenings. It seems one can't have one without the other, so I would say it was justified. "

            "\u00a0Yes. This is a fundamental course in the humanities that functions as a survey of a wide range of theoretical questions while also covering a large chronological span. Narrowly-focused courses dedicated to specific themes have their advantages, but a course like this one gives you extensive knowledge and broadens your horizons tremendously, especially if you don't know much about East Asia and/or film to begin with.
