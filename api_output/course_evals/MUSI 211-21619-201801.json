            "\u00a0an overview of harmonic/compositional techniques through a series of musical examples ",
            "\u00a0Learned about special chords such as the Neapolitan and Augmented Sixth, learned about equal division of the octave and hexatonic/octagonal scales. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about active harmony and began to explore areas of equal division of the octave and hextonicism/octatonicism. I was exposed to new areas of music and came to understand music that I already knew in a new light. I learned better how to interpret a piece in a variety of ways. ",
            "\u00a0New harmonies, sonata form, different scales. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze Western music and incorporate some of the compositional features into my own compositions. ",

            "\u00a0Daily homework in the form of discussion posts felt a bit like a chore. I would have preferred more hands on exercises or composition assignments ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, good material, but can be a bit dry. Not sure how it can be improved as music theory is often just stuff you have to practice applying and memorizing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the areas that it explores, namely, for me, hexatonicism and octatonicism, so especially the end of the course. The weakness, in my opinion, was the pace: there were times when I felt that the class stalled because we were doing the same thing for weeks at a time. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging content and low workload is great, and the projects give each student a chance to apply their learning. It is unfortunately easy to get away with not doing the daily assignments in class discussion ",
            "\u00a0I think this course addressed a wide variety of information! My one thing is that I wish there was more practice with the different chords/techniques using worksheets! Because a lot of the information was only addressed through identification and analysis, I tended to have trouble constructing them myself. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, it taught what it had to teach. However, I never felt engaged by the material, nor did I feel a connection to other aspects of music. I didn't feel that the class fit itself into the progressive narrative of music very well at all -- it just felt like learning about chords and examples of where they're used. "

            "\u00a0Dry if youre not already familiar with/passionate about classical music, but definitely helpful for performers. ",
            "\u00a0If a student wishes to major in music, this course is obviously a prerequisite. I was doing this course along with lessons for credit, and I feel that it was a great option given my situation. I do feel that my engagement with music theory so far has been beneficial to my growth as a musician more generally. That said, I do feel that the pace of the class can be very slow at times, and I think that perhaps an additional series of subjects covered or a more diverse structure woud be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- interesting content and projects. ",

            "\u00a0I mean, it gave me a good groundwork on which to lay extended music theory, so in that sense I would recommend it. However, I really don't think that it was a PHENOMENAL class -- "
