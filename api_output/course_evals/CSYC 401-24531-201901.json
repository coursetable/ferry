            "\u00a0I developed an appreciation for the material qualities of books.  More broadly, I developed a genuine excitement about printed books and art that I never expected I would have before taking Professor Rose's (outstanding) class!  Finally, I also learned to realize this interest/excitement through our JE press. ",
            "\u00a0The history and practice of printing, and how to make beautiful paper goods from broadsides to books! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the press that I have lived over for years, as well as an appreciation for the art of printmaking and letterpress. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to letterpress print, a skill that is difficult to access and learn in the digital media age where most of the equipment is so rare to find, much less be able to use. As a graphic designer, learning the history and traditional methods of graphic design was particularly fascinating and useful too. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about type and the history of printing. I have a huge newfound respect for what printing really meant historically, and the art it has become today! ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH in this class! I gained skills in typesetting, printing, and design, but even more importantly I gained innumerable insights into the history of how books have been made. I have a better understanding of the sheer amount of work that has gone into keeping printed and written material alive over the centuries, and the beauty of the printed word. "

            "\u00a0Professor Rose's course is outstanding.  I developed a genuine excitement about printed books and art that I never expected I would have before taking this class.  The course truly broadened my interests and equipped me with an artistic outlet I'd never felt before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were our work in the printing press and Professor Rose. The guest lectures were nice but sometimes felt like they could use a little more structure (or a stronger-developed theme?) as they all kind of blended together. ",
            "\u00a0The course made good use of Yale resources, with trips to many libraries and collections. It also allowed for creative projects and promoted camaraderie among the students. The only main weakness is that the cost of the projects are not necessarily communicated, meaning that someone may not know that you are intended to buy your own materials for most projects. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course was Professor Richard Rose, who is so incredibly kind and supportive, so generous with his time and dedicated to the craft of printing. His enthusiasm for the art was contagious, and he made sure to include us in the printing community by doing things like inviting us to the wazygoose. The biggest weakness was the scheduling difficulties: students can't access the press without one of the press managers letting them in,  making it difficult to do work. Also, the assignments were very skewed on the back end: we had few things to do in the beginning, making all the assignment pile on in the second half of the semester, when other classes' workloads were at their maximum too. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the amount of time distributed per project was a little disproportionate - 4 weeks for coasters and 2 weeks for a whole book. But I understand that Professor Rose was trying to ease us into printing in the beginning, and the book was tons of fun so there was no harm done. Perhaps class 2 times a week would allow for some in-class printing time? I think the whole class became close and built camaraderie in the last two weeks when we were all in the press working on books - it would be nice to start that earlier in class! ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. Professor Rose is so kind and wonderful, and he designs the projects very thoughtfully. The one thing I might change is that I'd have liked the projects to be spaced out slightly differently. It would be nice if we could have done the broadsides much earlier (right after the coasters) so that we could have had more time to work on the final project. "

The course truly broadened my interests and equipped me with an artistic outlet I'd never felt before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's such a unique opportunity to learn a skill you may never learn anywhere else, and you come away with work you'll be really proud of at the end of the term. Just make sure you have time to devote to it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially for seniors. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, you need to take this class. Frankly, AoPW was my favorite class at Yale. I wish I could print forever. ",
            "\u00a0YES DEFINITELY! You will learn how to letterpress print, a skill that is difficult to access and learn in the digital media age where most of the equipment is so rare to find, much less be able to use.

            "\u00a0Yes!!! This is such a wonderful course. Don't take it unless you care about it a lot and are willing to pour your heart and soul into it--but if you are, this is the perfect course for you. Professor Rose is one of the kindest men you will ever meet. He is always available to help you, and he genuinely cares about each and every one of his students. He is an absolute gem, and cares so much about what he does. When I grow up I want to be him. You'll learn so much about the art of the printed word and the book, and you'll gain a lot of appreciation for the amount of work and careful thought that has gone into spreading literature and knowledge! Plus you get to work on really cool old machines. "
