            "\u00a0Gosh where do I even start? Prof Hansen makes you read the works of historians from all around the world. Herodotus, Polybius, Siam Qian, Al-Tabari. Then you start reading the works of great modern minds like- Marx or Weber. Finally, she ends the course with a final project where you get to pick any history book given that that book is not terribly Westcentric. So, if you have always complained about how you never got to read Chinese or Islamic history, hop on. \r\nAlso, your writing will get much much much better after taking this course. Prof Hansen attacks your writing mercilessly and even though it breaks your heart when you get your graded-assignments back, it helps so much in the long run. She will tell you what she wants right away, no beating around the bush in this class.\r\nFinally, this class will improve your public speaking skills by a huge margin thanks to the tons of in class debate and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage college reading assignments and how to write a college essay. This was my first exposure to a college history and writing class. ",
            "\u00a0My writing improved immensely; I am much more cognizant of how to avoid passive voice and other simple but effective writing rules. My public speaking skills also got a lot better through practice and through Professor Hansen's advice. My understanding of history has also expanded as the subject now has life and fluidity to it in a way I had not found in prior classes. ",
            "\u00a0The class definitely made me far less confident about my writing and speaking abilities. THIS IS A VERY GOOD THING! I learned how to write much more clearly and effectively (I have been completely won over by Prof. Hansen's impassioned skepticism of the passive voice). ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my writing and reading skills. I also learned to really enjoy history: it is nothing like high school! ",
            "\u00a0I developed tremendous skills in analyzing primary sources, discussing history, and knowing how to read alot/ navigate challenging courses at yale that demand alot of reading. Additionally I really improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing has definitely improved a significant amount along with my ability to analyze and understand historical texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more clearly (and with less passive voice), I learned about old historians like Herodotus, Polybius, and Sima Qian that I didn't know anything about before, I learned about post-modernist history and stuff like that. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped my writing (made it much tighter). The classical historians were presented in a very engaging way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned better essay writing in general as well as analyzing texts. Also learned lots of history and how to write about historians. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of classical world history that goes beyond the typical western-centric approach. At the end of the course we have a social theory unit that puts Marx and Weber in conversation, which was by far the most difficult part of the course. This class also massively improves writing skills because of Professor Hansen's quick and actually helpful feedback (no bs with her). She'll tell you what's wrong with your paper plain and simple, which makes the correction process much much easier. "

            "\u00a0Strength: The design of the course and Prof Hansen. She is a gem.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt like the pace of the class got a little slow after the Thanksgiving break. Also, Prof Hansen is a little bit eccentric. I absolutely loved that eccentricity but I wouldn't blame you if you don't. ",
            "\u00a0This course assigned a lot of reading and work. I liked how it was based on reading about historians and historical methods. I was lost when we started reading Weber and Marx, to me they did not seem like the historians we had been reading earlier in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class were the books we read and how we would have discussions that would directly tie into our papers. This process really helped me figure out my writing by talking through ideas first. I also overall appreciated the pace of the class as we never dwelled too long on anything, but I wish we had spent more time discussing Marx and Weber. It could be improved perhaps with more focused discussions occasionally. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are easily the teacher (she is very knowledgeable) and the fact that it is a seminar. Much of the things that I have taken away from the class are from the great discussion we had. ",
            "\u00a0I think the top strengths of many are: it's broad coverage of material, the fact that much of the course is setting you up for success in future Yale humanities classes, teaching lessons about handling difficult primary sources, pushing the students to become better writers. The only thing I really disliked about the course was the reading, In defense of History. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is very interesting and the course comes together very well. I like how we were able to encapsulate texts from a variety of locations and time periods. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: not that stressful of a class, good feedback on writing, nice because it's a first-year seminar, Professor Hansen is pretty easy to talk to/approachable, good class to ease you into Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: reading can be a bit long, though it's ok if you don't finish all of it (Professor Hansen will actually teach you how to read a book without reading the whole thing), kind of random time period (old stuff), Classtime can sometimes not be that productive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very detailed feedback and expectations, plenty of constructive criticism, strong focus on speaking as well as writing, interesting material (international perspective), comparative analysis\r\nWeaknesses: some materials were a bit rushed ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: felt very engaged with the material. Weaknesses: very grammar heavy ",
            "\u00a0I really disliked the social theory part of the course, mainly because I felt like it didn't fit in with the rest of the curriculum. It was extremely different and poorly taught. The assignment, likewise, was not particularly helpful or insightful. Either getting rid of this part of the syllabus, or completely changing the approach would make this class much more valuable, but overall, the majority of the class and classwork proved engaging, interesting, and academically helpful.

            "\u00a0YES! This was my favorite class last semester and I am not even a humanities major! Prof Hansen put a lot of time and effort designing this class and the syllabus is a masterpiece. I enjoyed all the historians we read about and those in class debates were fascinating. \r\nThe best part of the class is how Prof Hansen grades paper. She is totally merciless about all your writing errors. She will detect every single tiny error and point it out to you. I remember turning in 5 page long paper and after all her comments, it became 15 pages long and I almost cried. The grading works out just fine at the end of the year so don't worry about it at all. But your writing will get significantly better. Same thing will happen to your public speaking. I'll be fair to her though, she is not as harsh grading speeches as she is while grading papers. \r\nProf Hansen is a little bit eccentric and I will not blame you if you don't like that. But, definitely shop the class. At first I thought I don't like it but towards the end, I absolutely loved it. Also, she is very kind and will get out of her way to help you out. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put up with the large amounts of reading, then yes I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, especially for a first year who is looking to improve their speaking and writing skills in a growth oriented environment. ",
            "\u00a0If you haven't had your writing seriously scrutinized before, this class is a good start. Take this class as a first-year. I think it will definitely come in handy. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course. I recommend this course to students who a) are interested in history but more importantly b) want to improve their writing and are willing to put in the work, especially after receiving constructive feedback. You will become a much better writer and student... you just have to be willing to put in some work. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY- especially incoming first years. I think this course sets you up for success in future humanities classes and offers you a connection with a really amazing professor who can be a good resource going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to major in history. As a STEM major, I felt somewhat out of my element at times, but nonetheless it did a great job improve my writing and comprehension skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. I think it's a very manageable introduction to history/classwork at Yale. Professor Hansen is on your side; she'll explain things to you and is super understanding about deadlines/falling behind on things. She holds you to a reasonable standard. You get to read some interesting texts that you probably won't encounter otherwise, and you do so with a class of first-years (a huge plus - take first-year seminars!). It felt like the right difficulty level, whereas taking English/history seminars with upperclassmen can sometimes be intimidating. So if you like history, I'd take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any students looking to improve their academic writing (especially helpful for students considering a history major, but it still develops valuable skills for any major). ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who's interested in history or anyone's who's interested in becoming a clearer writer while also getting some history out of the experience. Professor Hansen makes you cut the fluff and refine the good stuff in your writing. She also (very clearly) tells you what sucks in your writing, which I found extremely valuable. I appreciate her very much for her honest and accurate feedback. She puts a lot of effort in reading your work and helping you improve, which most professors could easily not do. "
