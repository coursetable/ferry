            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of Arabic grammar and learned how to read aloud unsyllabic Arabic text in formal Arabic. I also learned how to summarize and present information I learned from reading news articles. ",
            "\u00a0In this course we discussed modern political issues in the Arab world and studied \"The Journey of Ibn Fattouma.\" We learned new vocabulary related to the news and also read older pieces wth traditional Arabic phrases. ",
            "\u00a0Some knowledge of relevant vocabulary, translation and writing skills in Arabic. ",
            "\u00a0Mastery of the Arabic language. "

            "\u00a0The level of work is one of the best features of this class  it is just enough to learn productively but not be overwhelmed by the material. Professor Aziz is also a strong suit for this class; he is more than kind and understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides good speaking and reading practice. We practiced reading traditional Arabic a lot. However, the course did not have much structure. I would find it more helpful if the course was based around learning specific vocabulary. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to have taken away from the semester. I also was not sure how a lot of the vocabulary was relevant to modern speaking and reading. Many are not frequently spoken by people in the Arab world today, and it was unclear why we were learning them. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main weaknesses of this course is the lack of transparency around grading. There are grade boundaries listed but there is a paucity of graded material and no explanation and no feedback for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the readings and assignments this semester. The weekly readings and news presentations  improved my reading skills.  Additionally, I enjoyed  reading the Journey of Ibn Fattouma and writing about it for the midterm. I wish we could have done more to improve our speaking skills. I liked the addition of videos to the syllabus; however, it would be better to watch the videos in class, go through them more closely and ask people to research the topics to enhance class discussions.

            "\u00a0If you test into L5 Arabic, take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are at the L5 level for Arabic and want to continue having some practice, but I wouldn't rely on this class to advance your Arabic skills much. If this is the only engagement with the language that you have for the semester, your language skills will not improve much and you might lose some of your language skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they needed the course as a requirement. It is probably the best of the available options although there are very few options in this department. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend "
