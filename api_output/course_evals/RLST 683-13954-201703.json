            "\u00a0This amazing course provides a fascinating glimpse into the complex relationship between Judaism and Christianity in the late antiquities. The course exposed me to the world of Rabbinic literature, which turned out to be particularly interesting, and to complex questions about the delicate movement between religions, and the way in which the Jews understood and responded to the nascent Christian religion. ",
            "\u00a0A sampling of texts from Rabbinic literature related to Jewish-Christian interactions, as well as a brief survey of the intructor's writings and other major scholars in the field on this topic. ",
            "\u00a0I developed critical knowledge about the composition and formation of the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmud. I also learned about points of interreligious interaction in early Jewish sources. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I learned about the relationship between early Jews and Christians, as well as the perception of Jesus amongst the redactors and writers of the Talmud. This is a subject I had no knowledge of prior to the course. I have completed this semester with insight into these interactions and relationships which has informed my understanding of the other courses I took this semester. I built a more nuanced picture of early Judaism, Christianity, and the relation between these two groups than I ever could have pictured before entering the course. I gained tools in comparative religion, and in the analysis of Talmudic passages. (This course also sparked deeper questioning of themes central to my course of study as well as new questions I hope to explore during my upcoming years at University). "

            "\u00a0I can not think of any weaknesses. The course offers an intellectual challenge and arouses great interest; It offers a great combination of close reading of Rabbinic texts, theoretical research and historical background. ",
            "\u00a0The second half of the course was devoted to the professor's arguments in her book as well as two articles she has written. The first part of the class focused on a small selection of texts and major scholarly views on Jewish-Christian interactions based on these texts. These materials were also largely covered in the professor's book, and the class discussions largely focused on reading the texts, analyzing them, and referring to the readings.\r\n\r\nThe course could be improved by increasing the number of texts and readings, asking students to prepare the texts at home, and spending class time discussing many more theories of how to read the texts.\r\n\r\nSome issues in the course seem to be attributable to the administrative management. The professor appears to have been told that she is required to assign written exams, including a midterm, which is not true of my graduate school experience here. Additionally, it appears that this course was supposed to have been taught in the spring, and only last minute did the professor learn she was teaching this course in the fall. This may account for why we didn't accomplish the entire syllabus, and why some of the units and readings were changed as we went along. ",
            "\u00a0Michal has an amazing teaching style. She is engaging and fun. I wish the class required a prerequisite knowledge of Rabbinics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Thorough and nuanced discussion and presentation of material \r\n-Learning how to think about comparing religions \r\n-Learning from a pioneer in this field \r\n-Studying original texts \r\n-Approachability of lecturer\r\n-Charismatic lecturer \r\n-Studying material from manuscripts \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-I would have enjoyed if the part of the course on the legal comparisons between early Christians and Jews was larger -- it was of particular interest to me. \r\n-I would have enjoyed one class at the end of our semester devoted to how these early interactions relate to the relationship between Jews and Christians today. \r\n-Better communication about the first class of the semester. At the Divinity School, we were told that this class didn't start until the Monday after it actually began. "

            "\u00a0Of course! This is one of the most fascinating courses I have taken so far. The course exposed me to a new world of knowledge that proved fascinating and broad-minded. Beyond the intellectual challenge offered by the course, it is of great importance in understanding the complex dialogue between Judaism and Christianity, making it relevant and important for understanding the history of the mutual representations of Jews and Christians. ",
            "\u00a0I would suggest this course to a student who has familiarity already with rabbinic literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for all of the reasons mentioned above. Aside from the skills and knowledge I have gained, it was a pleasure having Professor Bar-Asher Siegal as a lecturer. She is an incredible speaker and finds ways to discuss extremely complex topics in an accessible manner (while still showing the details of their complexity). This was one of the courses that I couldn't stop thinking/talking about throughout my semester - even outside of class. I have spoken to countless Jews, Christians, and Muslims about this course and I am yet to encounter someone who isn't fascinated by the topics and the materials we have studied. I have met many students at the Divinity School who believe that understanding this is critical to understanding the context in which Christianity developed. "
