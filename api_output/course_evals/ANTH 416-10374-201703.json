            "\u00a0I had no experience in anthropology or economics coming into this course, so there was definitely a steep learning curve. However, I feel like for my chosen career it is so important to have read Marx, Polanyi, and Hart, and also grapple with the cultural and moral beliefs that influence the level of criminalization of certain economic practices. I think I really learned how to question my basic assumptions of morality and illegality through the case studies we read, and even my understanding of money itself. ",
            "\u00a0Critical analysis of anthropological and other social theory texts. Engaging and discussing with a variety topics and using the anthropological lens to bring new insights into the discussion around what makes/defines economies \"illicit\". "

        [
            "\u00a0I think if you have absolutely no background in the subject matter, the readings can be daunting and confusing. It took me a few weeks to understand what I was supposed to be getting out of the readings. I wish more time had been spent at the beginning of the semester giving us a foundational framework to approach future readings (theory, basics of economies, key terms, etc.) However, I really enjoyed the open discussion, which helped give me an idea of how my classmates were approaching the subject matter, although sometimes I felt that people were just talking to talk, rather than contributing meaningfully to the discussion. It was helpful having a PhD student in the class with a background in anthropology because he really asked very insightful questions and made enlightening comments that helped me to frame the readings and course material. In this regard, I wish Professor Erami had played a larger role in guiding discussion because sometimes I felt we went completely off topic and she wasn't sure how to bring us back. ",
            "\u00a0This was an extremely interesting course! There is a very big variety of topics that cater to a wide range of interests. I think spending an additional week or so towards the beginning of the semester going through the theoretical texts on money, capitalism and the economy, then proceeding to look at case studies would be a way to strengthen the structure.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to social science and humanities majors, as well as anyone interested in the topics covered. There is a quite a high reading load as it is a seminar based on discussion. However, the texts are diverse and link together in ways that make for a very fun and productive discussion. "
