            "\u00a0This course offered strong insight into various perspectives on law using three frameworks: philosophical debates over the nature of law, Western conceptions of divine law, and U.S. constitutional law case samples.  The three units allowed for an overall interdisciplinary approach to answering the large question at the center of the course: does law hold an inherent relationship with morality? ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ongoing debate between legal positivists natural law theorists. Additionally, I learned about major cases in American First Amendment jurisprudence. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the three-unit structure surveyed very diverse academic fields.  Since each student in the seminar came from a different background (some EP&E, others RLST), this method allowed for shared insights.  We all had strengths and weaknesses and the breadth of this course helped the class cover any patches in particular that I was missing.  The class was 6 KIDS, which seemed intimidating at first, but you learn to love it and become very involved in discussions.  Prof. Forsyth is a fabulous professor, combining both practical knowledge and pedagogical insight to create a thoughtful, intellectual seminar environment.  He encouraged respectful debate and always valued opinions, helping us realize the insight in our sometimes-confusing statements.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some students (not really myself) may be put-off by the small class size.  It meant that you really needed to be prepared on readings and discussions every week, or everyone would notice.  This helped me work hard.  At times, unfortunately, the conversation would be dominated by one voice in the class since we all had different backgrounds, but Prof. Forsyth was always aware and tried to balance things as much as he could.  The final essay is incredibly time-consuming yet rewarding.  It makes sense, though, given the lack of written assignments up until exam period. ",
            "\u00a0This course was among the best seminars I have taken at Yale because discussions were truly thought-provoking. The reading load was optimal for student engagement; it was not overwhelming and, as a result, allowed students to engage closely with various texts. I do not have any suggestions for how the course could be improved. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, given a few conditions.  You need to be comfortable in a small classroom and you need to be ready to complete all the readings.  The workload is never terrible, but it's consistent and requires discipline.  You also need to be ready to not have background depth on every topic we cover.  The broad three-unit structure means that no single student will be an authority on all topics.  This was enjoyable for me but others may find it frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in religious jurisprudence in the United States. The course readings are perfect for facilitating discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Its super interesting content and I highly recommend taking it. "
