            "\u00a0Unfortunately this class did not add much if you have taken most FES energy classes or worked in the sector before school. I did enjoy some of the deeper dives on certain policies but the course was such a broad overview of many different topics that didn't efficiently take advantage of the immense experience of the professor or guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0It was fascinating to receive such an insiders view of the Obama Administration's energy policy. ",
            "\u00a0I came in with very little knowledge of current energy policy and left feeling as though I have a strong foundation from which to work from. The speakers and Dan are all leaders in energy policy, so more than most classes, the material felt current and up to date. ",
            "\u00a0Writing concise memo's\r\nKnowledge of an array of energy topics\r\nFirst hand insights from senior ex White House officials ",
            "\u00a0I'm really interested in policy, so perhaps my review would be more biased. The class was really interesting though and improved I think as Dan moved further along during the semester. The guest speakers were excellent and really brought a broad range of perspectives. ",

            "\u00a0History of U.S. and global environmental policy. What has worked and why.. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about energy policy and climate policy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about so many parts of the energy sector (and GHG policy) from so many perspectives that it's difficult to distill them into a single paragraph. However, I think that was the value of the course: exposure to the myriad energy/climate policy issues and the regulatory tools we have to address them. ",

            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of federal energy policymaking in the US. It was interesting to take a class from a true practitioner. I also enjoyed the weekly guest speakers and felt that they contributed a lot to the overall class experience. ",

            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of the energy policy space in the US. It gave a good background on the historical evolution of US energy policy as well as went into detail on Obama-era policies. \r\n\r\nI also developed better memo writing skills through the written assignments and the feedback on the memos was really helpful.

            "\u00a0Largely in line with what I wanted to learn. I would say that some of the assignments didn't really line up with the practical, real-world structure of the class - they felt very hypothetical in nature and largely just exercises in memo writing rather than creative policymaking. ",

            "\u00a0The class should really narrow its focus so it can dive deeper into more topics rather than skim the surface on many. I would have also appreciated a quantitative component, even just learning how to do a cost benefit analysis or learn about the regulatory impact analysis for federal regulations. This would have helped my understanding of how to assess policies and is more realistic in how policies are actually made. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the guest speakers and creative assignment formats. Weakness is the lecture style which started off as a bit unengaging but it seemed to improve throughout the semester, with more student discussions worked into the slides. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and topics covered were great, but to be honest, the lectures were really difficult to get through. It was clear that everyone that spoke to us was a practitioner and not an educator - which isn't always a bad thing - but really made for quite dry class periods. If I'm going to be honest, once you got past the impressive resumes of the speakers, everything else was a bit of a let-down. I also felt as though there was a lack of diversity amongst the speakers. Everyone who spoke felt very much like an insider, with little critique from outside voices who might be affected by energy policy at the community-level. I know this is a bit of a shift in what the intention of the class is, but I do find it hard to believe that only one person of color could be brought in, and that no one from outside the Beltway was given a platform to speak. \r\n\r\nI also think this course likely should do away with the memo writing exercises and instead provide students an opportunity to really dive deep on an area of energy policy that applies to their work. ",
            "\u00a0Dan used a lot of power point, which is fine, but some of the later presentations were just more interesting in terms of how they were formatted. Thinking about which decks were the best received and told a story as opposed to just gave information I think would be helpful.\r\n\r\nThe alternative classes were also pretty helpful (i.e. the cabinet meeting). I had worked in politics, so the impact on me might not have been as much but I think it would be cool for others to have more of those experiences.\r\n\r\nA little more guided feedback on the memos could be helpful too. ",
            "\u00a0It would have helped to have a little more introductory material for the subjects covered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the professor teaching from his experience and giving insight into the political process of environmental policy. \r\n\r\nThe class wasn't quite as strong when it relied on powerpoints. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the guest lecturers, the in-class exercises, and the outstanding syllabus Professor Utech assembled, which is like a brain-trust on energy policy. \r\n\r\nThe weakness was in Professor Utech's lecturing style. The students were very interested in the course topic, but unfortunately the lecture style stymied discussion and the professor oftentimes missed student questions. \r\n\r\nI believe we would have learned more if the professor discussed the topics, rather than reading from a pre-written lecture. He has a wealth of knowledge and experience, but unfortunately, the execution was lacking. Also, the class ppt slides were extremely text-heavy. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated having Dan introduce us to a topic each week, then hearing from someone currently working in that space for the second class meeting. I found that extremely effective for prepping us for an in-depth lecture/conversation with the guest lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0The incorporation of speakers and the variety in their topics was outstanding. The lecture portion was sometimes dry and often a repetition of the reading material but I enjoyed in nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers added great, diverse perspectives and excellent expertise. Dan was not a strong lecturer, but he improved through out the course and overall I enjoyed his lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The speakers were the highlight. Normal lectures were difficult to sit through due to the monotone and monotonous nature of the presentations ",
            "\u00a0Guest speakers were great.\r\n\r\nLectures were better towards the end, but still need to be more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class structure with guest speakers and also thought the assignments and readings were very good. I thought it might have been better to structure the class with less lecture and more classroom discussion. I really enjoyed the classes where we broke into groups. ",
            "\u00a0Less text on slides. :) ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the guest speaker portion of this class and thought it was incredibly useful to hear real perspectives. As I said, I think the assignments were very useful as well. ",

            "\u00a0Take this course if you'd like to learn more about energy/climate change in a more substantive way. If you're not new to energy you may learn a little less but the insights from Dan and other ex white house officials makes this course worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0It's a really good broad overview of policy, with excellent speakers. I'd say don't take it if you aren't interested in policy or energy. If you check one of those boxes, you should learn about this space. ",
