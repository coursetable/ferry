            "\u00a0Professor Nicholson was so great at connecting Shakespeare to events going on today and explaining why it might be relevant--or why it might not be important at all. I really appreciated this perspective in her lectures (which were always so well prepared!!!). ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read Shakespeare's plays and developed an appreciation for his language.  I also learned various strategies that are useful for thinking about and analyzing Shakespeare's plays as well as about other works of literature, and I became better at constructing/organizing papers using those strategies. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a comprehensive knowledge of Shakespearean comedy, both the form of it and a breadth of the plays themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I became more comfortable with Shakespeare's language, and more comfortable with taking risks when interpreting/responding to Shakespeare (instead of feeling like my response always had to be \"Shakespeare is the best\"). ",
            "\u00a0Turned me from neutral about Shakespeare to a Shakespeare lover! ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skills at close reading, crafting a creative argument, and academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot of close reading skills, a much deeper understanding of Shakespeare than I had toward the beginning of the  course, and an ability to write papers that were very grounded in the texts that we read. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT about the early modern period by taking this course, more so than in the other Shakespeare course that I've taken here at Yale. Professor Nicholson also illuminated new, interesting ways of approaching a text that I had never thought of before, and that led to surprising connections between past and present, literature and philosophy, and other subjects. I would say more than anything this class pushed me to expand the way I think about literature. ",
            "\u00a0Analytical writing skills, close reading ",
            "\u00a0I became a much, much stronger writer. Through the lectures, I gained a stronger command of language and therefore an ability to articulate ideas and concepts that I had had trouble explaining before. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic--so good that the discussion sections, although pedagogically well-intended, did little to enhance the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think that having a final paper and a final exam is kind of a lot. It might not be worth it to keep the course as a WR course if you want to keep the final exam! ",
            "\u00a0I didn't really think there were any weaknesses with the course -- it was well organized, well run, the lectures were always extremely interesting, and the reading was never overwhelming.  I also liked having three papers where slightly more advanced thinking was required for each one and we were moved through the process of doing a revision a draft to think about how to strengthen our arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class could have benefitted from two sections a week--there wasn't a ton of time to discuss an entire play in one session a week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class reads a play a week, which I like because it keeps the pace fresh, and provides a good supplement to histories & tragedies, which are more often the subject of classes in the ENGL department. It's also a pre-1800 for anyone still on the old major requirements. \r\nWeaknesses: Oh boy where do I start. This class is primarily Professor Nicholson's (very modern) interpretations of the texts-- she talks a lot about gender norms and identities, ultra-feminist interpretations, and so on, all of which are definitely interesting but likely not what Shakespeare actually intended. While this was kind of interesting at first, I found it really frustrating as the class went on. I'd signed up for the course as an introduction to comedies & romances, many of which I'd never read before. Instead, lectures were mostly just an in-depth and seemingly random assortment of Professor Nicholson's interpretations of the text. (For example: in Twelfth Night, Viola is actually a man (or intersex) all along! TBH probably not what our pal Will S. thought though.) Very rarely did we talk about how the play would have been read in its original time or context, which I found frustrating. On top of that, Professor Nicholson decided to throw terms from the lectures onto the final exam, which was frustrating because her terms were all (again) seemingly random words that were important in *her* interpretations and not necessarily the original text. If she wants to make sure we all come to lecture, she should just have TAs take attendance-- it's easier and gets the job done. She should also let us know how to make up if we have to miss a lecture (got stuck traveling but couldn't get the notes...) ",
            "\u00a0Catherine Nicholson is an incredibly engaging lecturer whose talks always opened my eyes to new ways of looking at the plays we'd read. For example, when reading Twelfth Night I paid a lot of attention to the ways in which Shakespeare pointed out the performativity of gender; Professor Nicholson's lecture pointed out the ways in which the play was also commenting on the performativity of class. It was mind-opening to listen to these lectures, and section then provided a supportive space to discuss responses to the plays that we didn't get to discuss in lectures. The essay prompts were always thought-provoking and well-crafted, and I learned a lot from writing the essays. My one complaint: I don't think that the final exam helped my learning at all. Some of the passages felt like ones intended to trick me (and I attended all of the lectures, save one when I was sick). I wish that this course had some type of more thematic final assignment that asked us to look across the plays and the topics that we had discussed. For example, thinking about time as it relates to the pastoral, idle/idol, and the \"whirligig of time\"/ festival time across plays. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nicholson is excellent; she is very passionate about the material, frames arguments in ways that made me think about Shakespeare in totally new ways, and is engaged with the students. The midterm was cancelled which I think was a good thing-- for me, writing the papers was the best part of the class and the biggest learning experience for me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures very engaging and shed light on new aspects of the plays, supplementary texts like Cesaire provide good counterparts to Shakespeare; weaknesses: not enough opportunities to write and improve writing ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought the course was fantastic. The only moderate weakness was the difficulty of the final exam-- I personally found that it required a level of preparation unrealistically high compared to the overall workload/difficulty of the course. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class--the lectures are fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Nicholson's lectures are always so cohesive and put together. Professor Nicholson was so great at connecting Shakespeare to events going on today and explaining why it might be relevant--or why it might not be important at all. I really appreciated this perspective in her lectures. The workload during finals is kind of a lot--there's a final paper and a final exam. But overall probably the best Shakespeare class I could have hoped for. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student!  Before I took this class, I couldn't imagine anyone taking a class on Shakespeare for any reason other than to fulfill requirements.  But having taken it I'm happy to say that I would recommend this class even to someone who just wants to have a fun semester thinking about some of Shakespeare's most entertaining plays in ways that allow those plays to become more expansive and wonderful than they would ever have imagined.  Honestly, after taking this class, I almost feel like Shakespeare is underrated -- his name is so well known that people don't seem to really read his writing anymore, but his plays are so rich and beautiful and raise questions about gender, imperialism, race, queerness, friendship, love, and sin that are perennially relevant and perennially interesting.  Plus, Prof. Nicholson is an incredible lecturer and all-around incredible person who's very open about office hours and super smart -- this class was amazing and is definitely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I think you should have some kind of basic interest in Shakespeare before you take this course, since it's a lot of reading--don't take it just because you feel obligated to read Shakespeare. That said, if you are interested, then ABSOLUTELY 100% take this course!! Every lecture was fascinating and helped me look at Shakespeare in a new way, even if I had read/performed the play before. ",
            "\u00a0At the end of the day, take it if you want to learn about Professor Nicholson's personal (highly modern & liberal) interpretations of the text and then spit them back out for an exam. For any English major who's more interested in actually learning about the text and developing their own interpretative and close reading abilities, it's not worth your time. PLEASE consider carefully whether having someone else's ideas pushed at you twice a week is really how you want to spend a semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course!  I took it Credit/D, but I also think it's a fantastic class to take for a letter grade.  Workload is just a play each week, plus three papers, and two exams.  The lectures are phenomenally interesting, and Cathy Nicholson is great!  Lecture attendance is not mandatory but I'd strongly recommend it, because the exams will intentionally include concept IDs that you wouldn't really know if you weren't at lectures.  And do the readings, because plays are short, and you'll enjoy them!  The exams also have quote IDs, but they're super straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, absolutely. Put some thought into the essays, and you'll really get a lot out of them. Go to lecture--Professor Nicholson is an engaging speaker, so you won't regret it, and you'll learn more about the plays that way. I kind of had doubts about a lecture based English course (I love English seminars), but this course convinced me that they can be done well. We got more in depth into topics than the winding road of a seminar discussion usually would let us, and we get to hear what an incredibly insightful expert who has read these plays over and over thinks--that's incredibly rewarding. Plus you get the seminar feel in section. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Nicholson is wonderful and it's definitely worth studying Shakespeare in college. I loved this class and learned a ton. It's also really not worth it unless you consistently go to class and read all of the plays. The plays themselves are both wonderful and problematic, and the perspective I have on them from taking this course is one I never would have had from simply reading them myself. This is one of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to almost anybody. If you are not willing to take a couple hours every week to actually read the plays, then don't take this course, as Professor Nicholson's fabulous lectures will be wasted on you. This is not a fifth course, but a solid core course for any schedule. There are a few short papers, a midterm and a final, none of which are difficult if you read the plays and attend lectures regularly. Shakespeare's works are, of course, fascinating even when they are not particularly well-written, and Professor Nicholson really makes them come to life and feel relevant to us in modern times. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely! So far it's been my favorite course at Yale. Compelling, thought-provoking, and really transformed my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This was such a great class. Professor Nicholson is an incredible lecturer. Her lectures delved deeply into each play and yet also reached so far beyond the plays themselvesI learned an immense amount about Shakespeare, but also about the history of the English language, the history of theater, and lots of other interesting topics. This is easily one of the best classes I've taken in the English department, certainly the best lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Take it even if you think Shakespeare is the unfunniest, least romantic thing ever. You wont regret it. Catherine Nicholson is amazing. "
