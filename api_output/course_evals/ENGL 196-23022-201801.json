I really enjoyed the lectures, which incorporated a lot of recognizable, popular media to make the course more engaging and understandable. The readings were diverse and exposed me to a lot of important scholarship applicable beyond media studies. ",

            "\u00a0I found the class fascinating, but I think it should be taught seminar-style. I would have been even more engaged if it had been taught in small groups. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the topics were slightly confusing with the many layers to everything being discussed. The topics were very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- very interesting, cool prof\r\nweaknesses- a little far-fetched sometimes, lots of readings ",
            "\u00a0Especially towards the beginning of the course, it was sometimes hard to grasp the broader themes - to understand how certain texts fit into the larger discipline. \r\n\r\nHowever, the individual texts on the syllabus were very interesting, and Professor Williams is a very dynamic lecturer who always made interesting connections between the texts and drew them back in to their context. ",
            "\u00a0I think the readings for this course should be a bit less dense or a preface of the reading should be given before it is read. On top of this, if for all section meetings, there was a discussion question sent out prior to, it would be easier to engage. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings and videos! Lecture content was great. I felt like I was acquiring all sorts of intriguing knowledge during every class.\r\nWeaknesses: wasn't a fan of all the theory texts ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is just too broad to actually be that useful. Some of the readings are pretty interesting though, and Professor Williams does have real enthusiasm for the material. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures and readings. Could have used more instruction to help unpack difficult readings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Williams is an incredible lecturer. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), this means you almost shouldn't do the readings because a) they're often very dense and theory heavy and b) Professor Williams will explain them in a way that is both understandable and exciting the next day. I was lucky enough to also have Prof. Williams as my section leader, which I think really increased my enjoyment of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: diversity of course reading in terms of form\r\nWeakness: general inaccessibility of readings, not clarified by lecture ",
            "\u00a0Be careful in choosing your TA section, it might change your opinion of the course to the worst, as the teacher is simply fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured very well, progressing from word to image to machine and then finally system. I liked that the sources we engaged with came from a variety of backgrounds and forms and helped to illustrate the course themes. The assignments were interesting and grading was very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Had a lot of similar course materials to Professor William's other seminars so I found myself repeating readings. Also, the Mulvey reading is in Film 150, another required course for the major, so everyone taking the course for credit within the major would've presumably repeated that reading. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class if they want a writing credit that is not extremely overbearing, but does want something that keeps their brain working. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very fun course, learned a lot about a lot of stuff, you can easily get by without doing the readings. Go to class, pay attention and take notes, you won't have to do any reading. The exams are very straightforward and not hard at all. You will enjoy this course. Also, as a WR credit, I wrote less than 10 pages throughout the semester. This class is a diamond in the rough. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course covers a lot of interesting topics and makes you look deeper at most media. ",

I think it would be a good complement for any humanities student, or even a STEM student (Computer Science especially) who's interested in how technology influences communication and art. ",

            "\u00a0I was so resentful about being forced to take this class for my major that I checked out of it immediately. That being said, if its not required for you, Id skip it. The class is too broad to be all that useful I think, although some of the readings are pretty interesting. ",
            "\u00a0prof williams is great. really knowledgeable on a lot of subjects, you learn a lot of cool things that are relevant to your life in this course. its an easy writing credit. i would definitely recommend ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Great course, especially as an introduction to BIG IDEAS. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. This is a great course with knowledge that is relevant to all of us. Lectures are engaging, readings are interesting and assessments are very fair, sometimes even enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes  its a really great view into the world of media, but its more theoretical, so we examine many texts that are more difficult to unravel. Sections were really helpful to seeing the way that different themes of word, image and system coalesce. ",
            "\u00a0This course got me thinking a lot, so if you're into thinking about the world and hypotheticals, this si the class for you. ",
