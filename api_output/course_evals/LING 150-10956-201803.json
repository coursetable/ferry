            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Old English words, Old English grammar, conventions of Old English poetry, and how to gloss! ",
            "\u00a0This class offers a comprehensive introduction to Old English. The basics of the language are learned as well as some cultural details. Gain ability to sight translate, parse, and analyze passages in Old English. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of Old English grammar and some vocabulary. There was a major focus on translation, and at then end of the course, we got to read and analyze some poetry. I definitely felt like I learned enough grammar to feel confident in doing translations, and there were some interesting nuances to the poetry that I really enjoyed. Also some fun forays into linguistics! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read Old English, and how the grammar and structure of Old English was used in literary works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned old English grammar and a lot of vocabulary. I also learned to analyse prose and poetry in old English. ",
            "\u00a0So this course basically teaches you how to sight-read Old English which is actually more difficult than you think. In order to fully grasp what the text is saying, you have to understand what the different prefixes and suffixes mean instead of just trying to sound it out and connect it to a modern English word. That's not to say it's impossible; you just need to pay attention to detail. "

            "\u00a0The course is fantastic for a lot of reasons. Primarily is Prof. Thornbury. She's incredibly sharp, she wrote the class textbook (which she gives out for free!), and she includes a lot of extra credit on all the quizzes and exams. She's really helpful and available. She took a lot of us from zero to a burgeoning appreciation for Old English. I have few qualms about the class. The workload is incredibly manageable and the grading is very fair. But looking back at the last few weeks of the semester, I found that the translations of the longer texts were kind of tedious and a step up in difficulty compared to other translations. I think it would be better perhaps to cut down from translating the Wife's Lament, Alfred's Preface, and the Wanderer to perhaps just two of these, and spending more time refining our translations and talking about their literary merit. Prof. Thornbury offers a second semester course on Old English, but this is a graduate level course. I don't know how feasible an undergraduate counterpart course could be, but that could be a great option perhaps for spending more time appreciating and reading texts! ",
            "\u00a0This class was taught fabulously! High marks to Professor Thornbury for keeping the seminar engaging. Class structure was we would come in having prepared a passage and done a reading on the grammar topic we were learning that week and would go around and translate the readings bit by bit with some breaks to clarify topic. One improvement that I think would have helped greatly would be to actually give a mini-lecture on the grammar topic that would be covered in translation the next class so that not all of the learning of grammar and such was done outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course and its textbook were very well-constructed and organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to spend a little more time doing literary analysis and a little less time doing translations in class, but other than that, all good! ",
            "\u00a0This class was small and it was easy to clarify any questions I had about the language. Also the professor made sure to appeal to both English and Linguistics majors with the content of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Spending a bit more time on poetry would be helpful. I felt like I didnt have the time to fully grasp how it works. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well put together. The textbook is outlined for a gradual introduction from simpler to harder concepts so that you never feel too overwhelmed. The only thing I wish we had had more time for was reading epic pieces like Beowulf, but the pieces we do read are awesome in and of themselves. "

            "\u00a0Yeah absolutely! A fun HU credit, without a bunch of readings, the homework is fun, and if you like learning languages, this will definitely scratch that itch without the commitment of starting a 1.5 credit L1 or L2 class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was a joy to come to class. Professor Thornbury kept the class interesting as well as gave each student the individual attention necessary for them to improve. Not a high workload and graded very generously, but you definitely learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor is wonderful and the material helps you to think about modern English and its grammar in surprising and constructive new ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of my favorite classes I have taken. Discussions were both informative and surprisingly humorous the Anglo-Saxons were an unexpectedly witty people! The workload isn't too difficult, but I still feel like I learned a lot during the course of the semester. Take if you're interested in linguistics or just eager to learn some fun things about the history of the English language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its super interesting and an opportunity youll not have elsewhere ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. It fits into my major, but it can be an interesting humanities credit for anyone. Learning about the roots of English is often overlooked, but it definitely changed my perspective on English as it is now. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The class was well-paced, so I always felt challenged but never overwhelmed, and the texts were a lot of fun to read. Professor Thornbury is wonderful and created a really warm, funny, intellectual classroom environment. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend, if you're interested in learning Old English or if you're just interested in learning a dead language. It's all the fun of language-learning without the social pressure of having to speak to people in the language. If you've ever taken Latin or Ancient Greek, the process is more or less similar. Except with Old English you get to see and understand the direct roots of your own language! ",
            "\u00a0Oh, definitely for goodness sake take this course. Professor Thornbury took over the course this year, and she has been absolutely amazing. Her knowledge of Old English and the medieval period makes it feel like you're actually learning something about the language besides grammar. You'll build a lot of character in this class and learn about the epic battles between warriors and snails. "
