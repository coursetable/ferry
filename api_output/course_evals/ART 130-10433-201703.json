            "\u00a0I learned a lot through Molly not just about technique but about art. She helped me develop as a person and pushed my outside my comfort zone. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about modern and abstract art and a new way to think about it and create it ",
            "\u00a0self portraiture, color mixing ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course because of the freedom given to the professor and what she and the TF managed to do with that. I can't point to one thing because this class so thoroughly challenge not just the way I thought about art but the way I thought. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about making art in so many new ways. Because Molly's classes and assignments were so open ended, I was often given a concept to work with, but was free to interpret this however I liked in the context of my work. This combination of guided thought and absolute freedom stretched my brain in directions it hadn't gone before. At my high school, I wasn't taught to look at art in such a personal, emotional way. We were supposed to paint what we saw in front of us, most of the time. In this course, my art became an extension of my mental state  what I was thinking and feeling. I experimented with abstraction, which is something I've always wanted to do, but never really had the opportunity to try. All the while, this semester, I was coming up with all these new ideas. It was like someone unplugged something that had been stopped up in my brain. I think part of that was really Molly's teaching, and part of it was being in a new, really creative environment. I'm not sure, but it really made me think. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to paint faster and better. Learned a lot about theory too which is great because it doesn't happen often. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I liked this course because it allows a lot of freedom and creativity but I also wish that we had learned more basic painting technique. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: self-driven curriculum, you can paint what you want, throughout the course every student drives their own work.  flexible and fun.  \r\nweaknesses: non art majors may need a bit more of a push.  some students may expect a more classic intro course. ",
            "\u00a0Breadth of exploration was both a strength and a weakness. It challenged us to explore but sometimes we lacked focus. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that this course was so freeform and up to the interpretation and whim of the students. Molly had so much to teach us, but was also incredibly responsive to our interests, needs, and emotional states. She was reactive, always adjusting or completely changing our class plan and assignments based on what she perceived to be the right thing for that moment. Most of the time, I loved this. It was freeing, and allowed me to do so many things with my work that I wouldn't have otherwise been able to tap into. Other times, though, it felt a bit too directionless. Sometimes I felt that readings (particularly that video of that scientist woman? I forget her name) weren't beneficial and felt to tangential. Some assignments felt so last minute that I felt maybe there was a better thing we could be using our time to do. Overall, though, Molly's spur of the moment style opened many more doors than it closed. ",
            "\u00a0the class is absolutely fantastic.  Molly is awesome. Her feedback is awesome. The readings were awesome. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. This is one of those classes that completely changes how you view not just art but yourself as a person and an artist. ",
            "\u00a0This course with Molly was an incredible opportunity to develop a personal relationship with painting and a unique individual vocabulary with materials, while also grounding you in the lineage of historical painterly development. However it was just that, an opportunity, and it required you to actively take advantage of Molly's genius and time and to buy into her at times slightly off-putting unconventionality. If you take her seriously and allow yourself to enjoy the lack of structure, the vague instructions and the undefined methods of assessment, seeing in them a freedom to focus just on creating art, then this class will be the best you've taken at Yale. If you crave structure and want to learn to paint very realistic still lives, take this course with a different teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with some caution. I think this class is great for students who have a base of painting and might want to take their work in a different direction. But for students looking for a straight and narrow painting class, this is certainly not the one to take. ",
            "\u00a0would definitely recommend painting basics with molly if you want to think about painting in a more conceptual and challenging way.  not a type A painting class - very free form and self-driven.  but very fun class environment and molly is the real deal.  she has smart things to say.  definitely take! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I would recommend for non-majors and art majors alike as it explored a different way to think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Everyone should want to be challenged in the ways that this course did. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're the kind of person who is alright with being very self directed, and if you're into freeform style teaching. It worked really well for me, but I think that's a personal preference that doesn't always sit well with others. This course will only push you if you're willing to push yourself, if that makes sense. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, gives you the opportunity to work on your style, eye and painting in general while learning about theory as well. "
