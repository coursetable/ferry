            "\u00a0My French vocabulary increased, and I feel more confident in reading complex fiction and non-fiction texts. I also feel that my grasp on more complex grammatical structures increased. ",
            "\u00a0This class improved my French, and in particular my spoken French, immensely. The vocabulary and texts covered provide great cultural background and are also useful for everyday French. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my grammar and reading comprehension, writing, and speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0Brushed up on grammar, learned new vocab ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me improve my writing and speaking in French. My grammar and vocabulary are so much better ",
            "\u00a0This course focuses mostly on analyzing French literature & films, along with learning French grammar.\r\nYou work a lot on your oral, close-reading, and essay writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0French grammar, vocabulary, writing, speaking ",
            "\u00a0I furthered my knowledge and comfort with the French "

            "\u00a0Our class was unusually large, which I felt at times made it more difficult to focus on various students' (including myself) issues with grammar. However, I do think that having a larger section improved discussion, since my French class last semester was unusually small and discussions were a bit quiet. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course overall. I would've perhaps liked more emphasis on creative speaking rather than grammar exercises etc., but the latter are definitely necessary. However, there were an extraordinary number of evaluations (in different forms) for one semester, making it somewhat easy to get sick of. Your French will get much better, no doubt whatsoever about that. ",
            "\u00a0This course is rigorous but the intensity allows for rapid progress. The oral exams felt a little false due to the format of a 8 or 10 minute presentation during which the professor says very little and you speak continuously - this could perhaps be improved to be more conversational ",
            "\u00a0The material of this course helped me improved my French. The grammar was very well taught and the readings very appropriate for the class' overall level. ",
            "\u00a0This class consistently got out 5-10 minutes late. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I greatly enjoyed the books and films studied\r\nWeaknesses - more contact time would be good. would prefer it if it was 1.5 credits ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - improvement of writing and oral skills\r\nWeakness - too many grammar exercises. Review of texts in class felt a bit unstimulating ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the highly structured nature of the course as well as the literature we analyzed. I would have appreciated greater emphasis on conversation between members of the section. ",
            "\u00a0Its strength is the open classroom discussions which are very lively, but that is also its weakness as sometimes they can veer off track with some material being covered extensively while other material is skimmed over. "

            "\u00a0I would. However, I don't really agree with the way the French program here works, as I find the intense focus on workbooks to be useless when it comes to practical (and verbal) implementation of grammatical structures and new vocabulary. Though the writing practice did improve my writing, I don't feel as though my command of verbal french improved at all, and in fact feel like I have backslid since high school. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely take this course with Mme. Schneider, or another French native - my personal opinion is you gain a lot fluency- and accent-wise just from the exposure. Mme. Schneider is an excellent teacher and highly energetic, perhaps too much so on some days for us poor students. Be prepared to work a lot and I wouldn't bother taking this course Credit-D, as without the grade motivation you probably wouldn't learn much. Be prepared to be tested/essay-ed within an inch of your lives. Once (if) you survive, though, you'll come out MUCH better at French. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - your French improves immensely ",
            "\u00a0I do recommend taking L5 French but not with Professor Schneider. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Wonderful ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to become near fluent in French ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you wish to take higher level French courses and/or major in French. Not sure if it's a class you should take just for fun though. ",
            "\u00a0For intensive French practice, yes! ",
            "\u00a0It's not for the faint of heart, but yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the teacher is amazing and demanding int he best way possible and the material is very interesting. "
