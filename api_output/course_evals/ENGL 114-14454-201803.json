            "\u00a0In this course I had the chance to read fascinating texts about nostalgia and memory, engage in thought-provoking discussion every class, and tangibly improved on my skills and abilities as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0I believe I got a good basis on how to write good papers in college. Additionally, I learned so much about nostalgia and memory. This course created an insightful learning environment in which nostalgia could be evaluated and further talked about, which made this course pretty great. ",
            "\u00a0I became accustomed with how to write college-level papers and my writing and organizational skills got better. I was able to pinpoint my writing weaknesses and grow throughout the class. In addition, I learned how to do college-level academic research and how to read academic papers. I learned about the many facets of nostalgia and memory and how they can be applied to various settings, such as personal, political, generational, and more. ",
            "\u00a0This course, above all else, teaches students how to think very critically about several ideas interacting simultaneously. Anna emphasizes the intersections between all the different texts we read and all the different kinds of memory. As a result, students learn to create and structure highly-complex arguments. This class is thus a great introduction to college writing and thinking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about how nostalgia shapes our everyday life and form of thinking. I also learned how to become a better writer and write my thoughts in a more concise fashion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to structure arguments more effectively and back up my writing with reasoning and counterclaims. I enjoyed exploring nostalgia and the many ways that people interpret it, and the course was the first time I had ever dived into reading academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to polish my writing skills and organize my ideas better. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of different levels of nostalgia & concepts surrounding nostalgia ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compose more thoughtful and precise essays. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to research for and write a well-organized essay, and I learned how to make a concise thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Learning to properly structure an argument and understanding my faults in writing. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class include the small size, as I was able to regularly meet with the instructor to talk through essays, or whatever else I had questions about from the class. I've received the most comprehensive feedback on my writing I've ever received while in this course, and looking back became a much better writer who is set up to succeed in future academic contexts at Yale. A weakness if that occasionally we weren't able to discuss all of our readings in class, but that is hard to avoid do to the benefit of reading many different essays to gain diverse perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course included a great system for peer workshops and corrections. Additionally, Anna provided great feedback on all of my drafts and final papers. The class was a tight-knit group that made the experience very fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course were that sometimes I felt like we had to rush through our discussions on readings because we had two to cover in one day. Additionally, I felt like the reading course load could be overwhelming sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were very interesting and generally engaging. Readings (for the most part) were fascinating. Anna also gave very detailed feedback on every draft we turned in, which was key for my growth as a writer. She was also open to meeting with us outside of office hours and helped us when we needed ideas. I wish the class had more activities that focused explicitly on argumentative writing and how to construct an argument since it was only indirectly addressed during the class. ",
            "\u00a0Anna has designed a very interesting class that constantly pushes the way in which you think about memory (and thus thinking). I think that the papers build on each other to help students really grow as writers. The class also has a lot of freedom in regard to discussions, papers, and the final project. Anna is excellent at communicating tricky concepts that show up in the course and guiding class discussions in a really meaningful direction. As for improving the course, I sometimes felt that the quantity of readings prevented us from diving into the intricacies and inner-workings of one text (such as Proust). I also think that the expectations for each essay need to be explained more fully and that the peer workshop for our papers needs to be shifted (maybe the peers help the student to address some of Anna's comments). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the check-in meetings that Anna asks students to attend in order to see how a paper is coming along and the peer review sessions after a draft was turned in. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course did a good job with providing feedback for us to grow as writers. I found that I improved steadily with every essay. I also really enjoyed the discussions we had in class. However, I thought that some of the prompts were very confusing, and we sometimes do not get to all the readings in class because we run out of time. ",
            "\u00a0The specificity of the comments made by the teacher to improve the writing in the essays was really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - interesting and engaging \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - disorganized ",
            "\u00a0This course was a low-pressure environment with good instruction about how to write an essay. The worksheets and in class workshops were very useful to me, and I also liked all the feedback on essays. Personally, I would have done better with a more structured discussion. It also would have been better for me if we did more of a variety of activities other than in class discussions about writings -- the day we went outside for a tour was a good change of scenery! ",

            "\u00a0Yes!! No matter your previous writing background prior to coming to Yale, I would say english 114 is a must if you want to develop a strong foundation for future writing endeavors. The workload can at times be substantial (I spent an average of 12 hours a week on this course outside of seminar), but is very intellectually and personally rewarding! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to any student at Yale. Anna was an amazing professor and person all around. This course was interesting and engaging throughout the entire semester. The workload was not that overwhelming and if you were overwhelmed, Anna was very helpful in helping you to figure out the best course of action. All around this was a great class that I really enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the class. I did not think that I would be interested in taking a class about nostalgia but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not realize that there were so many different aspects of nostalgia and memory. Class discussions were interesting and the work was a nice transition to college-level writing. Anna also gives very detailed feedback that is very helpful. While the course does not explicitly focus on argumentative writing, you will nevertheless emerge from the course as a better writer and reader with ample knowledge on nostalgia and how it functions in the world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - this was my favorite class of my first semester. It really pushes you to change your thinking and to think about arguments and ideas in their full complexities, drawing out all of their implications. Though it is difficult, I think that the payoff is incredible and I was always excited to go to class. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course. Anna is an excellent professor and the material you learn about is incredibly interesting. The workload isn't too bad and Anna provides a lot of feedback to help your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Anna is so nice and engaging. She clearly has a passion for the texts she teaches, and I improved a great deal from seeing the way she analyzed text. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Nostalgia is an extremely fun and personal topic to explore. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because it is useful in learning how to write a good essay, and it especially helped me to add better structure and organization to my writing. However, the student should be prepared to speak a lot in class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's very interesting and really helped me understand how to write better "
