            "\u00a0Analysis of foundational writings in Greco-Roman and western political philosophy, as well as a broad synthesis of some of the earliest literary distillations thereof. Insights developed included the distinctive and often divergent political ideologies of Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero, as well as more-broadly of classical Greece and Republican Rome. "

            "\u00a0Heartily. The course is a broad overview of foundational texts and ideas in Western political philosophy. It is as valuable to the student of political theory as it is to the student of intellectual history. The breadth of the course, however, did not preclude multiple inroads to be made into detailed and difficult portions of texts and history. Further, the course is quite unique for its emphasis on historically-contextualized readings of Plato and Aristotle's political writings. "
