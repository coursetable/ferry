            "\u00a0A better understanding of modern nanophotonics starting from Maxwell's equations. Terms and concepts typically not covered in E&M courses were extensively covered, with some emphasis on computational methods. ",
            "\u00a0I re-learned how to solve eigenproblems and learned how to solve generalized eigenvalue problems. I learned how to use Green's functions to solve Maxwell's equations. I learned symmetry and reciprocity and the mathematical foundations of both. I learned the variational principles and its mathematical foundations. Generally, my linear algebra skills improved. I learned the inner workings of and practiced using a variety of electromagnetic simulation software. This provided a new toolkit for me to use in the future and led to a deeper understanding of how Maxwell's equations work, how approximations change their solutions, and when certain approximations are valid. I also gained some insight into decomposing functions into proper bases. ",
            "\u00a0Novel approaches to EM problems and various computational tools. "

            "\u00a0I liked the clarity in the topics presented, with sufficient emphasis on derivations and assumptions underlying various equations and results. While many courses/textbooks on E&M present the \"traditional\" electromagnetics with larger emphasis on electrostatics, this course indeed felt like an \"orthogonal basis\" in that results were derived in the frequency domain. Also, references to original papers were helpful for me to better complement the lectures (which were inevitably shortened due to time constraints)..\r\nTo further improve this course, the overall structure could be more coherent - although we have covered various topics, they felt somewhat compartmentalized and disconnected (for example, there wasn't much mention of reciprocity/equivalence principles in subsequent topics, and LDOS was defined but not referred to after). To render the course more structured, the computational aspects could be introduced side-by-side to further illustrate how these concepts are interlinked and used in computing various quantities of interest  (though to give Prof. Miller credit, he has admitted to this, which will hopefully make future courses more coherent). ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was excellent in every way. I think the only thing that could be improved is a faster turnaround on grading, but it practically didn't matter since Dr. Miller was willing to take the time to explain anything you didn't fully understand in detail if you were confused by a problem. Also, the course would need a TA for fast turnaround. ",
            "\u00a0The material of this course is close to real research and useful, but this also makes it difficult to get sufficient practices on topics taught. "

            "\u00a0If you are sick of/ proficient with the typical Jackson E&M-based course and want a more modern counterpart whose tools include computational/numerical techniques, or interested in how Maxwell's equations manifest itself as a pillar on which diverse nanoscale phenomena can be intuitively explained, I strongly recommend this course. (don't be discouraged by the name of \"math methods\" in its title - a more descriptive  title could be simply \"modern E&M and nanophotonics with emphasis on computation\") ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course improves mathematical skills, particularly in linear algebra, and understanding of Maxwell's equations. It also teaches students how to develop and use a toolkit of software to solve Maxwell's equations for different types of modern optics problems. "
