            "\u00a0I improved vastly on my ability to listen to native Spanish speakers, to read and write in Spanish (especially with medical terminology), and became a bit faster at speaking in Spanish. Outside of Spanish, I also learned quite a lot of different medical terminologies, different diseases, and patient care. ",

            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and interesting and allowed me to improve my writing, reading, and listening skills in Spanish. It could be improved by incorporating more small-group discussion during class. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of spanish in the medical professions. Something that would make the class more fun/interesting is having a biweekly lesson where we would learn about a pathology by trying to \"diagnose\" a patient ",
            "\u00a0The atmosphere of the classroom was fantastic. It allowed me to speak comfortably and learn in a judgement-free environment. The homework is fair and interesting. Everything about this class is fantastic. ",

            "\u00a0Having two writing assignments a week helped me to vastly improve my ability to read and to write quickly in Spanish, and listening to all the videos in class with subtitles helped me to train my ear for listening in Spanish.\r\n\r\nOne thing to be improved on is just knowing the lecture topic beforehand so that I could print out lecture notes if need be, but this was usually not a problem. ",
            "\u00a0I see many strengths, such as the consistent writing homeworks, the open-ended final essay topic, and the well-thought our PowerPoint lectures. While I didnt get a chance to speak very much in class, I recognize that with a larger class, its difficult to get a lot of participation in. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the only weakness of this course is that is was a 9am and that could have curbed participation. However, the strength of this course was Profesora Carreras who had enough energy to get the class involved in the early morning! "
