She facilitated discussion well during sections and had plenty of insights to add to help students think further about the text and Biblical interpretation. Emilie was also an efficient grader of assignments and had all work back promptly.\r\nAs Emilie continues to grow as a teacher, I would encourage her to consider drawing more voices into class discussion by occasionally calling on people in section. Doing so would create a more robust conversation. ",

He made himself very much available for the students and cared about what they learned and what they thought. Sections always felt very short because of well everybody was engaged and thanks to the thought-provoking questions he was asking.\r\nIt is quite impressive how fast the mid-term, exegesis paper and final exam were graded. Comments were also very helpful. ",
