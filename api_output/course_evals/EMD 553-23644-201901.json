The numbers were off and it made it difficult when going back to study. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: 8:30 AM class is brutal, I also think that more group work (possibly during lab?) might improve understanding; a lot of the math was glossed over, which I would have liked to have see, but I get that time is limited\r\nStrengths: interesting material, Prof. Cohen is good, I like the half lecture/half lab structure ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Cohen is great, super sharp, very enthusiastic, and the material is good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been very helpful to have some solution sets to homework to try to model future work off of. Though the TAs were great and provided commentary, I was still left wondering if I had answered questions optimally and found it hard to prepare for exams for that reason. ",

            "\u00a0This was a considerably difficult course, but I felt like I learned a ton. As someone with no prior modeling exposure, there was an initial learning curve. However, I felt that I could apply principles in this class to the material more and more as time went on. The weekly homeworks are great to keep you engaged, and the grading system encourages you to learn rather than to aim for the highest score possible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class covers a multitude of microbial diseases in terms of the modeling procedures. \r\n\r\nWeakness: There is just too much homework per week to the point where I just want to get through it instead of working through each question. The labs are helpful but having less homework would be good (sometimes, it just seemed like busy work instead of actually learning anything). ",

            "\u00a0A ton of weekly hr that requires a deep deep understanding of the material. I would not mind if the grading was more attempt due to the difficulty, but grading on correctness is unfair. That said, I LEARNED A TON this class. This is one of the few classes where I am proud of my knowledge and work even though my grade might not be the highest. This is truly a PhD level course with the expectations and the workload but I am better for it. Would recommend, but not for the faint of heart. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting.  However, every week we would get 12-15 pages of homework, which would take a ridiculous amount of time to complete.  You would think that as the topics got more complicated, the number of questions would decrease, but unfortunately, that is far from true.  Each week, the topics would get harder, and so would the homework questions, but the amount of questions would remain the same. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting course that taught me a lot about infectious disease modeling. The weekly homework assignments, although sometimes long and somewhat repetitive, are helpful for reinforcing concepts learned in class. The course becomes more conceptual after the midterm, which made it somewhat difficult to know how to prepare for the final exam. The lack of answer keys for the homework could be frustrating at times if you wanted to review on your own, however the TAs and professor were very helpful and available for questions. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assignments were very long, and I feel like we didn't focus on the more difficult problems in the \"lab\" time. The lab time was additionally confusing--I don't really think it was necessary and would have benefited more from the lecture material being spread out over two class sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Great course -- incredibly helpful setup having homework reinforce the lecture material. Sometimes things felt disjointed discussing the homework one week after it was done; is it perhaps possible to discuss challenging questions from the homework the day it is due rather than one week later?\r\n\r\nI also felt that there was not much discussion about the course readings. The readings on canvas did not match up between canvas/course syllabus/homeworks/lectures. It felt difficult to devote time to the readings as such.\r\n\r\nThe paper reviews were excellent assignments, and I felt very prepared to interpret and critique the models. ",
            "\u00a0The content was presented in a highly understandable way. The homework and the labs while good in theory, were incredibly long and repetitive. felt more like busy work than something that was actively helping us understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting topics and taught well overall. I think sometimes he talked about things that we needed prior knowledge about (like some 2nd years had taken classes about some of the topics) but he never examined us on those higher order topics so that was nice. It was hard to use some of the homeworks to study because they are structured in a way that is made for R and not really explaining concepts we should be getting. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class and I found that it advanced my understanding of infectious disease transmission and my ability to critically read and understand academic papers. Learning about the theoretical dynamics of what we observe in practice enhanced my education and I hope to use the skills and concepts I learned in the future! My only critique would be that answer keys for homeworks and practice questions would have been appreciated, especially for questions that involved actual calculations on exams and not just theoretical frameworks like we saw on the homework ",
            "\u00a0The homeworks/labs were extremely helpful in learning the material and thinking critical about the topics, however they were fairly challenging each week. Being the homework during classroom lab sessions, having office hours, and encouraging collaboration to solve the hw problems was beneficial is obtaining an overall understanding of the questions asked. The two review papers presented an opportunity to use what we had learned to evaluate a real model, however I would have also appreciated some more practice examples from that weeks lectures to better understand the concept since we did have a lab assignment due that week. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this course. I learned a lot and each day in lecture was useful. However, the homeworks can be unnecessarily long. I'd recommend cutting those back a few pages, especially when we need to turn in physical copies and printing it not free. ",

The weekly homeworks were definitely way too long though (often 10-15 pages). Many of the questions seemed very repetitive and almost too straightforward to really be a question. ",
            "\u00a0This is a course that is packed full of material, which makes it challenging but also interesting. I think a decent amount of course material could be excised to create a more focused and enjoyable course without sacrificing anything of value. "

I think sometimes the pacing of the class was a bit off, in that he spent a long time on fairly simple concepts, while he moved quickly through more complex concepts. This was especially true at the end of the course when it felt like we rushed through some material without an opportunity to really learn it in detail or work through it on a homework set ",

When I met with him during office hours (twice) he came off as impatient, frustrated, and overworked. In this way he was definitely a negative outlier among the professors I've had at YSPH. I would recommend students meet with the Teaching Fellows instead. "
