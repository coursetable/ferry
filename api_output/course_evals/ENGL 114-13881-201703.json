            "\u00a0This course was mainly geared towards academic writing. We worked on our use of rhetorical strategies and development of arguments. Since we focused on cities in class, we read a good amount of academic pieces on cities. This helped us to understand how cities are written about, how we can write about them, and especially how to put our work in conversation with that of other scholars. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to understand look at cities and people through more than just one, narrow perspective, which has opened my mind up and helped me understand people better. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a more scholarly essay. I know how to write with a more hypotactic structure and how to develop my points more clearly. I also feel that I understand more of simply what a scholarly essay is, and exposure to many essays has been enriching by itself. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analytically read and discuss academic texts and how to write the college essay by building a persuasive argument. ",
            "\u00a0I think my writing improved a fair amount. I learned a lot about structure and rooting my ideas in direct evidence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write scholarly essays and present my argument in a logical fashion. ",
            "\u00a0Most importantly, I learned how to write essays at the college level. 114 helped reorient me to the process of brainstorming, researching, planning, writing, and revising, and I feel much more prepared to tackle long, research-based, argumentative essays. I learned how to research and use an online reference manager, and I'm much more aware of how I like to handle big research projects. I got a more in-depth look into how arguments work, how they're structured, and how to make a good one myself. In regards to cities, Modern Metropolis really opened up my view on the issues that are facing cities today  inequality, gentrification, housing, and more  and I realized that it's an area that I may want to explore a little more. Obviously that's not going to be true for everyone, but I think this class is worth taking if you're at all interested in cities. ",
            "\u00a0I transitioned from common high school writing format to that of a college level. I learned how to build an argument rather than list examples and learned techniques that strengthen my analysis. "

            "\u00a0Because this was an English 114 course, it was focused on writing. You will have to read and write a lot, and this will make you better at both. I found the course especially good for developing our research skills as well. We did talk about cities a lot, but if you're looking for an urban planning course, you shouldn't expect this course to be that. I think one weakness was the lack of one-on-one time with the professor for talking about our own writing, but this is due to the course structure which is the similar for all English 114 courses. If you want to get much better at writing, make sure to meet with the teacher separately during office hours, because in class your critique will be mostly peer-based. ",
            "\u00a0Always engaging. You have to want to have an open mind about cities if you want it to have a true effect on you, or else you won't enjoy the class. It is enjoyable for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The research paper was very good and the process for writing it will be helpful in the future. The first two essays, though, had a frustrating schedule. The first draft always felt rushed - we often had just a weekend to write a majority of the paper, which felt like too little time to me. Especially since we often had several more weeks to move from a draft to a final (a process that I think deserves less time compared to the draft). As such, I think the scheduling of the course could be revised to ensure a more constant workload, instead of an oscillating amount. ",
            "\u00a0English 114 overall does a good job of teaching a student how to write a strong essay, but it is a very fast-paced class that requires a decent amount of work for each class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course does a good job of improving writing skills under a specific theme which I really enjoyed. I think more class time spent directly looking at one's own writing would be very beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Lots of material covered\r\n- Interesting topics\r\n- Insightful discussions about such topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Course seemed to move very fast\r\n- Workload was a bit high (essay and readings due the same day)\r\n- Would have benefited the course to stay on the same topic for a bit longer ",
            "\u00a0English 114 is really well-designed, and if you can find a section that focuses on a topic you like (and can get in), I wholeheartedly recommend it. It really helped reorient me to college-level writing, and I like that the three essays progress in length, in effect guiding you to Essay 3, which is the longest one (it's the research-based argumentative essay). Each professor can choose what they want to do for Essay 4 and Pam chose to have us do a creative nonfiction piece, which wasn't bad but I felt like it wasn't nearly as helpful for improving my writing, especially because it ended up very rushed towards the end and since it was the only essay for which we didn't do a peer edit/revision. I think the readings that Pam chose, especially for the first two and a half units, are phenomenal, and really taught me a lot about the city, and I like that the class discussions about these topics are fairly laid back (since the course, after all, is an English course instead of an urban studies course). English 114 is known to be a lot of work, but I think it's definitely manageable and if you procrastinate just the right amount. Pam also gives incredibly detailed comments and really cares about you as a writer. She also cares about you as a person and is always open to having conversation, although there were a few times when she tried to impose her view of the reading or of the topic and make it very clear that she didn't agree with you.

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to improve your writing and you are genuinely interested in the issues surrounding cities! ",
            "\u00a0Engaging and gives you new perspectives on cities and culture and people within the cities. ",
            "\u00a0I suppose it is a good writing credit if the section topic appeals to the student, though. However, it was more work than I was expecting and I think I would perhaps dissuade a STEM student from taking the course for this reason - for, I don't see how much I'll be able to apply what I've learned in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, while I wouldn't say I enjoyed everything about it, it was very helpful and I learned a lot. I think it is especially a good class to take your first year at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want to improve their academic writing. I think this course is a good introduction to college writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you are serious about learning how to write better and are interested in the topic. Otherwise the course will be a monkey on your back. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I came into this class liking cities and liking transit, but I came out with such a broader view of the issues that cities face today, like race and income inequality, gentrification, public spaces, housing, and more, and how all of those issues are interrelated. The New York field trip was great to not only get to know some of our classmates better but to see some of the phenomenon we discussed in class in action, plus round-trip tickets were covered. In short, if you have any interest in cities, take this class  you'll learn a lot in addition to improving your writing skills. On a more general note, not everyone needs 114 to be fair, I'd have probably done fine without it  but if you can find a 114 section that matches one of your interests, then I think it's a great way to have class discussions about your topic in a more relaxed atmosphere while also sharpening your writing skills. (Especially if the topic isn't something that Yale has much of in other departments!) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wants to improve their writing and strengthen it to a college level. "
