            "\u00a0By taking this course, I had a weekly reminder to put everything into perspective. A reminder to sit down and think about what really matters in life and in our existence. The readings for each week were fascinating and provided me with delicious food for thought and profound insight. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into myself, really. Insight into how to bridge the gap between different religions. ",
            "\u00a0We gained fundamental knowledge about Buddhism and considered its intersection between atheism and theism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Buddhist ideas, atheist beliefs, and the questions religions aim to address. I ",
            "\u00a0History and introduction to Buddhism, consideration of the plausibility behind enlightenment and reincarnation, exploration of atheist arguments, mindfulness and meditation practices. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I developed a broader understanding of a variety of religious and philosophical traditions, as well as a better understanding of my own thoughts and opinions regarding religion, spirituality, morality, and a number of other topics. ",
            "\u00a0The course led us to reflect on the assumptions underlying our beliefs (whether a religious conviction or a form of knowledge). What began earlier in the semester as discrete moments of epistemic interrogation coalesced later into a new framework for asking the big questions in lifea framework which challenges the nature of assumptions in the first place. \r\n\r\nIn this way, the course introduced and contextualized Buddhism outside Western and Judeo-Christian classifications and categories. Rather than a creed or ideology, Buddhism is presented as a commitment to a certain kind of awareness, transforming how I look at the world and my place in it. \r\n\r\nOverall, the course forced me to think critically about how we gain insights from the same data (i.e. the same phenomenological markers that make up our existence), and how we might develop from those insights an ethic of being and acting in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my writing, critical thinking, and discussion skills through weekly intellectual journal entries and discussions (including leading one) as well as the two papers. I also spent a lot of time introspecting about religion, purpose, atheism, Buddhism and how it all fits together. ",

            "\u00a0An in depth look into the debate between Atheists and theists in the Abrahamic religions, as well as an unparalleled insight into Buddhist philosophy, beliefs and practices. Moreover, this course stuck with me beyond the classroom, and helped me gain a better understanding of how I want to live my life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings are interesting, discussion is student led, there's plenty of freedom for personal expression and creativity in assignments, and professor Kim is a brilliant and kind soul.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Hwansoo Kim!\r\n\r\nNo weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0I was surprised the seminar went so well with so many students. Professor Kim handled the organization well and delivered lectures of appropriate lengths. ",
            "\u00a0The class had really interesting topics of discussion. I found professor Kim to give great lectures and really force us to grapple with hard questions in life. The curriculum and readings were very engaging. However, I think the student presentations could be made a little more brief. 15 mins was probably enough for us to discuss the main questions of the readings. The class was also too large for a seminar. Next time there should either be two sections, or enrollment should be capped. This felt like a lecture at times, which wasn't the intended format of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Reflecting back on the course, I felt many of the small details that Professor Kim implemented greatly contributed to student engagement. For example, he had two students lead discussion each week with a presentation, brought in guest speakers for us to question and told some pretty crazy stories about his life! These might not seem like a big deal, but they really did add a lot of flavor to a long seminar period each Monday afternoon. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of the course is the positive, lively classroom environment Professor Kim facilitates, where different perspectives and questions are welcomed. \r\n\r\nThe guest lectures were also insightful and illuminating, especially Stephen Batchelors. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the weakness of the course are the moments where we branch of into small groups during student-led discussions. The discussions were strongest when kept to a big round-table. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Professor Kim clearly cares a lot about his students\r\n- I found the material both interesting and personally relevant\r\n- The course was very well organized and it was clear what was due when\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- We often ran out of time and had to rush at the end of class\r\n- At some points, the material felt a little repetitive ",
            "\u00a0very interesting texts and an engaging professor, the topic is highly relevant today and there aren't a lot of courses on east asian religions/thought like buddhism and confucianism. pretty big for a seminar and I hope it's going to be smaller in the future because the size limited the scope of the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course is highly conducive to learning through discussion. Prof Kim begins with a lecture that is very informative, and then proceeds to a student-led discussion based on the week's assigned readings. The 2-hours once a week meeting schedule of the course is perfect for this kind of in-depth debate and discussion. The format and content of the course are ideal as well. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Kim is a wonderful teacher. I will definitely take another one of his classes. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended! This class is a weekly reminder to think of what really matters in life and in our existence. It has value beyond an intellectual level. ",
            "\u00a0YES PLEASE TAKE ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY--Professor Kim is extremely thoughtful and super nice and encourages interdisciplinary work!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Without a doubt. One of my favorite courses Ive taken at Yale. The readings are relevant and interesting; towards the second half of the course, there is a shift towards meditation. Doing the readings almost became a meditation in itself. Its a pretty great feeling to have assigned readings that are about how to improve your health and betterment. I looked forward to this class, and its readings, every week. ",
            "\u00a0If you are truly interested in Buddhist/atheist philosophy or religious studies in general, take this class. I found it to fundamentally change my worldview and the way I pursue happiness, and challenge other notions I had taken for granted. My view of myself changed and I was able to engage with both theistic and atheistic viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0YES! One of my favorite classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course! Its an eye-opening look into Buddhism taught by a great professor. Take advantage of getting to know Professor Kimhe is incredibly knowledgable and very kind! ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED this class (speaking as someone who dreaded having to take a second Hu!). It was interesting, made me introspect, and was not a lot of work (weekly journal entries aka reading responses, two 8-page papers and leading one class discussion). Professor Kim really cares about engaging his students so he's very available to meet outside of class, read over drafts, etc. While officially, topics were given for the midterm and final papers, he gave us a lot of flexibility - some people chose their own topics, some decided to write one 15-page paper instead, and some even decided to do alternate project forms (e.g. a documentary, artwork). Plus, he says outright that grading is not something that you need to worry about as long as you are engaged. ",
            "\u00a0An amazing class, helps put into perspective many relevant questions on humanity, religion, faith, morality, meditation, and enlightenment. ",
            "\u00a0would definitely recommend if you're interested in east asian and/or religious studies, you might even change your mind on a couple issues you thought were nonnegotiable. ",
            "\u00a0YES\r\nIt was easily my favorite course of the semester and the effect it had on me was truly profound. This is one of the courses you hear about that will 'change the way you look at things', except that it actually will. "
