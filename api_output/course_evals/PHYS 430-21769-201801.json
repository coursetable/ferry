            "\u00a0Good first E and M class after intro physics. Electrostatics, magnetostatics, electrodynamics, relativity, E and M waves ",
            "\u00a0I got a good understanding of electromagnetism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned E&M in more depth than from the intro class. ",
            "\u00a0You end up with a working knowledge of electricity and magnetism by taking this course. I say \"working\" because I still don't know what a magnet is, but other people in the class learned this better than I. Maybe you've taken the intro sequence already and you're wondering why you're taking more E&M. That's just because there's more stuff to learn (there's always more!). If you want to learn such things as Laplace's equation + existence theorems + PDEs, the D- and H-fields, polarization and magnetization, and relativistic E&M (honestly really cool), you will get something out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel more confident with my EM knowledge and found the sections covered at the end to be very interesting and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the fundamentals of E&M. Used a lot of multi-variable calculus knowledge, and covered a wide range of material. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the beginnings of field theory and improved my multivariable calc skills! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bunch of electricity and magnetism + some basic relativity. This is an interesting course because a lot of it is review, but the material that wasn't review turned out to be reasonably nontrivial for me, and we went in-depth into most of it. ",
            "\u00a0Reviewed fundamentals of multi. calc, worked from basic E&M to more complex formulation and then new ideas. I felt this class did a particularly good job adhering to mathematical rigor in the material; that helped me deeply to both understand and strengthen my math. "

        [
            "\u00a0I liked the reverse classroom, I thought a bit too much time was spent each class reviewing the previous class's material ",
            "\u00a0Material corresponded to the textbook very well, and the material is very interesting. However, the flipped class room style served no real purpose, so it was just reading the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the flipped classroom! ",
            "\u00a0While I think flipped classroom works well in theory, I think in practice it's rubbish. I need to see something twice to begin to internalize it. If my first exposure is the textbook, I'm overwhelmed. I don't know what to focus on, what's important, how to visualize or connect the topics. The point of a lecture is to give you that first introduction to a topic so that you can go look at the book with purpose. Thus I would vote for a more traditional E&M lecture. However, I do understand the value of the clicker questions. Its important to check your understandings and be confronted with your misunderstandings. I think that a formal section lead by the TF would be good for this purpose. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. You do a lot of drawing since the class focuses on conceptual understanding, which is effective. It's one thing to do derivations (the math in E&M is definitely the grody-est of the physics courses), and the drawing part can be clarifying and complements it well. 2. The flipped classroom. The clicker questions are again focused on conceptual knowledge, so it's a fast way to check in and see what you're understanding.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The flipped classroom. Beyond the clicker questions, the ppt format of reviewing a derivation isn't effective. It's too fast to write things down and comprehend the derivations, so things just sort of whirl by. Secondly, if you don't do the reading (a sad fate that befell me in the second half of the course), the lecture can be confusing, and the clicker questions even more so. ",
            "\u00a0I personally do not like the flipped classroom setup. It generally ended up being the professor pointing to equations on the screen and going over just a handful of equations in class. Also, the psets were the same length as youd expect for a regular lecture class which sometimes made it difficult to catch up on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0This was a flipped classroom, which I generally do not enjoy. There were plenty of resources given for the material i.e. lectures, video lectures, and the textbook so it was not hard to catch up in class. The material covered a ton of material, but it was still somewhat manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the flipped classroom that DeMille runs. He has this method nailed down. My only suggestion would be to increase the pace of class by a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed to miss showing the impacts or insights the theories were learning could have, making the course less inspiring. The workload and problem sets were fair. ",
            "\u00a0Quite frankly, I didn't find the content covered in this class to be very interesting. Compared to Quantum and Thermo, the subject of E&M is a lot more pedestrian and probably content you've seen before. This class dives more in-depth into E&M, but the in-depth treatment basically consists of more mathematical detail rather than more interesting physical intuition. I did enjoy the relativity section, however, as that was something I haven't been exposed to much before. I also wish we'd spent more time on Chapter 7 -- I find that pretty interesting and new but we didn't cover it in much detail. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom was a significant weakness of this course; the rigor of the course provided for an excellent opportunity to learn electrodynamics in considerable depth, but the volume and disconnect between the materials from class and the reading and lectures left little room for catching up if students were not one-hundred percent on top of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think the flipped classroom was a huge benefit to me--it really clicks with my learning style. I know others may not enjoy it as much, but for what its worth this has been the class format I have most enjoyed at Yale in physics. "

            "\u00a0If you are majoring in physics, it's a requirement and that's all you need to know. If you are not majoring in physics, but a related science, it is important material that you should learn, so just bite the bullet and take it. \r\nThe text book is a joy to read and even though the material is a little bland at the beginning, it gets very interesting near the end (Chapter 7 onwards). Having said that, as it gets more interesting, it gets more difficult and as is traditional in the physics department, too much is packed into one semester and justice is not done to the later chapters.\r\nThis year it was a semi flipped classroom. Prof. DeMille gave the class the option to revert to a traditional class both at the beginning and midway through the semester but both times students voted to keep it flipped. One learns better usually when one spends a great deal of time reading and teaching oneself before going to class but what this means is that you spend twice as much time on one course than normal and it can make for a very difficult semester. So make sure you have a light schedule when you take this class.  \r\nProfessor DeMille is very clear and helpful and his classes are never boring. I definitely recommend taking it him. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any physics major, but then again, they have to take it. E&M is very dense and non-intuitive, but prof. DeMille does his best to make the course interesting. Unfortunately, the class moves so fast (we cover almost the entirety of Griffiths) that there isn't a lot of time to explore the more interesting electromagnetic physical phenomenon, but overall it's not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it for the major but its probably the least interesting class of the bunch. I would actually recommend taking this before Quantum. If you have the math (Multi/vector calc and Diff Eq) I would actually recommend taking this Freshman year because it will be a very relient and interesting application of that math. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a physics major, you should probably take this class because it's one of the foundational courses and ties into nearly every field of physics. It is a lot of work, because it's a semi-flipped classroom and you have to do the readings to be prepared for class. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt really recommend this class unless youre in the major. Its taught flipped classroom but not in a way thats particularly engaging for students. A bit too much time is spent going over intro material, and the most interesting content in the course (relativistic EM, radiation) is squeezed in the very end. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a major requirement for the intensive physics track so I would take it for that reason. I think it is fairly interesting so possibly take if you have a strong interest in physics/E&M. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly! It is a fun class to take even if you don't need toa lot of cool math. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you have to take it. There are other physics courses that are more interesting and more applicable. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class if you have to take it for the physics major, but not otherwise. While I think PHYS 420 and PHYS 440 are interesting material that's worth learning even if you're a math major, CS major, etc with an interest in physics, I think PHYS 430's material is much more skippable. The workload is pretty light -- I was able to do the problem sets just night before -- and since the exams are open book you can succeed even without knowing all the material off the top of your head before the exam. While it's not a total gut, don't expect it to consume too much of your time.\r\n\r\nAlso, shout out to Prof. DeMille: while I didn't personally attend class as much as I should have, it was very clear to me that Prof. DeMille cares an incredible amount about student learning. He answers questions very thoroughly and offers multiple makeup lectures and exam times in order to make sure every student can attend at least one. All professors should look to Prof. DeMille as a shining example of dedication to undergraduate teaching. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course but would caution that the flipped classroom setup coupled with the rigor of the material will mean a considerably greater time commitment to the course than other physics classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a great class. I found it informative, interesting, not overly stressful, and a reasonable amount of work. I would recommend it to anyone interested in electromagnetisim. "
