            "\u00a0One of the many strengths of this class was the involvement it encouraged with the Beinicke Library's archives, which included a guided tour with one of the librarians. Especially for a subject like Modern Poetry, Yale's resources are absurdly valuable, and I thought Professor Glaser did a wonderful job incorporating those into the class. \r\n\r\nI encountered many modern poets who I'd never read before, and got to have fulfilling and interesting conversations about Eliot, Stein, and Pound. ",
            "\u00a0This course functions as a survey of Modern Poetry. This means that while some of the poets and poems on the syllabus were familiar to me  and to the rest of class  others I came to for the first time. Modern Poetry is very difficult, though incredibly important in understanding the trajectory of poetry in the 20th century. I gained not only a greater familiarity with the poetry of 1900-1960, but I developed tools to read this poetry. Professor Glaser likes to pay attention to meter, diction and syntax, and while sometimes we missed the larger themes, I appreciated having this kind of attention in a Yale seminar, because so few professors here actually know this stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of Modern Poetry. I learned a lot about the content and got better at analyzing texts more generally. ",
            "\u00a0My knowledge of meter certainly improved, for my previous exposure to meter was largely restricted to iambic pentameter. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great syllabus. Whether or not you're an English major, these poets are worth reading. Every week had a great line-up. Throughout the semester, there was good variety. The only unfortunate part--as is true with most survey courses that meet once a week--was that there was so much material that it just hard to even discuss a large portion of it. But the weekly reading responses were a good way to engage more with the material that interested you that week, and if you post early enough, Professor Glaser might respond to it online or address it in class. These also helped me craft my thoughts into a more coherent, cohesive presentation, which eventually helped me decide what to focus on for the final paper. \r\n\r\nThe poetry in this course reminded me what was important and foundational in poetry, not only by exemplifying it with great verse, but also by showing how the modernist poet breaks away from these conventions, like meter, rhyme, and prosody (the latter being Professor Glaser's area of expertise). \r\n\r\nThe weekly readings include not only poetry, but poetics (primary source material that helps explain a poet's process, method, influences, etc.), which were insightful. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of how to approach modern poetry on its own terms, and an appreciation for it ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course. Such wonderful material, such rich and unexpected discussions of it. Shame that it was at 9:25 in the morning, but there's also something about that time of day that makes seminars a little more honest, like everyone is too sleepy to put on airs. "

            "\u00a0I thought the assignments along the way were especially good: the setup of the reading responses felt more natural and useful than they did in other classes, the archive assignment was truly a great experience, and the creative parody assignment was a delight. I wish it met twice a week: sometimes, it felt that there was too much to discuss properly in two hours, and I do wish we could have had time to read even more. ",
            "\u00a0The course could include more readings that give us a sense of poetry in the period. The secondary readings (usually essays by the poets themselves) were helpful in understanding the poems, but less helpful in grasping the trends and the genre of modernism. In the future I think including texts, or frankly even giving brief lectures for the first ~30 minutes of class could go a long way toward contextualizing both historically and intellectually the significance of the poets. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly writing assignments were good preparation for class and for the final paper since it forced us to make solid observations about the text. It also made sure we engaged with all the poets and not just a handful of favorites. I liked it when we were asked to talk about our blog posts and when discussion flowed from there. I think it would have helped to get a little bit more feedback on those. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the range of authors covered. I thought the inclusion of secondary sources was helpful, and reading a few more critical essays might have been even better. The secondary sources we did read provided a helpful starting point for thinking about the poetry. ",
            "\u00a0The challenge is that there is so much material to cover and so little time. What you get out of the class discussion is also highly dependent on the responses and engagement of classmates, but since the fifteen-person seminar is made up of juniors and seniors, many of whom major in English or literature, the level of discussion is high and stimulating. \r\n\r\nThe course drastically improved once Professor Glaser started giving us an indication of poems or themes (etc) that we should focus on in particular each week, since this helped direct our reading in a way that translated positively to the classroom. He was also prepared to discuss these things, and thus had more to say in response to students' comments, which helped facilitate the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0It was excellent! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the material and the discussion. I loved the archive and imitation assignments, but the course could have used one short analysis paper leading up to the final project so we could have gotten a sense of Professor Glaser's expectations for analytical writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you enjoy poetry at all, or modernity, this is a great class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Glaser is one of the few faculty members in the English department who can really teach technical close-readings and explain things like meter and scansion. Take this class, of course, for the poets, but also take it because you'll become a better reader. The weekly readings are manageable, with one 500 word blog post each week. The final paper is shorter than most English classes but was pretty fun to write, and Glaser gives you pretty free reign in terms of picking a subject. The discussions are fairly lackluster, especially when the class strays from the text or nobody understood the reading (Marianne Moore, why do you exist?). You know what you're getting with a course called Modern Poetry, and my customer satisfaction was 8/10. Nothing flashy, no big truths about life, but if you want to learn the nitty gritty of modern poetry, this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, English major or not. Modern poetry is so interesting and Glaser is extremely knowledgeable about the subject. The reading list is superb, and the assignments (an archive study, an imitation, and a final paper) are actually kind of fun. Overall, a wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Modern Poetry is an opportunity to engage with some difficult but highly rewarding poets with the help of Professor Glaser and the input of class discussions. There were many times when class made me appreciate a poem that I had found opaque on my own. ",
            "\u00a0Because this was my first poetry class at Yale, I cannot compare this class to others. That being said, I loved this class and would recommend it to anyone with any remote interest in literature or a desire to learn how to think more deeply about things generally. Take this course!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The syllabus alone makes this course worth taking. Everyone should read these authors, because they are the big (and/or important) names of modern poetry. They are not all-encompassing, of course, but they cover a lot of bases. \r\n\r\nThe weekly reading is sizable, but quite enjoyable and varied. You have to write ten reading responses of 300 words over the course of the semester, which actually are not that long, and it's not too difficult to find something that interests you enough to expand on for that length. They were a good way for me to think about and engage more deeply with the text without writing a full essay. \r\n\r\nThe writing assignments are also varied: a Beinecke archive study, where you find something interesting (basically anything slightly related to the material we study--there are tons of options), take pictures of it, write a two-page report on your findings, then give a five-minute presentation to the class. The next assignment is a poetic imitation and explanation of your process, for which the guidelines are also very loose. If you put in thought and effort and make that evident, you're fine. Finally, there's the fifteen-page final paper, which requires a fair amount of time and research/sources, but honestly is a great way to synthesize what you've learned and delve deeper into your interests. \r\n\r\nThe one difficulty is that these assignments aren't due until the second half of the semester and the first two are graded with check minus/check/check plus, so you don't ever know your grade for the semester until it's over. All in all, though, it's worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. The syllabus is great, and for the most part, Professor Glaser was an able seminar leader. It might have been useful to know in advance which poems we would focus on in class. The only other thing that somewhat bothered me was how imbalanced the reading load was from week to week, though I think that's somewhat inevitable since some of the poets are denser than others. Not much writing until the final research paper, which should be enjoyable work since you choose your own topic. ",
            "\u00a0If you're at all interested in poetry, take it! It goes fast but you get a really good foundation/overview of modernism ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you're very interested in poetry. "
