            "\u00a0very interesting topics and methods but poorly organized and difficult to follow along with coding \r\nwould be helpful to include more coding info in the lectures ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this class. I think the information was fascinating and I was introduced to a topic I knew nothing about. I left the class feeling pretty confident in some of the surveillance techniques we learned. I would say that I wish the teacher stayed more on track with the syllabus. We ended up only having 1 or 2 homework assignments and I feel like if we had had all 4 I could have practiced some of the methods more before the exams. As someone who does not really know how to code in R, I would have liked more instruction on the coding aspects than just sitting there and watching them run through the code. I appreciated what they did teach about R and know this is not an R class but I liked when they gave the R code with missing pieces because that actually required us to think through what the code was doing than just running the chunks. They should do more of that in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Really enjoyed the class - think it covered a good range of topics! I would have enjoyed more hands on coding rather than filling in the blanks, but overall, I loved the course! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learn about surveillance and modeling, and actual applications of what we learn. Weaknesses: As someone without R knowledge, I was hoping to learn more R coding but it's very difficult to actually learn basics in this class when all the code is written out for you. I can definitely read some code and understand it better now, but if asked to write it, then I would have no idea. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a bit of a mess.  We basically just sat there and watched Dan fumble with R code.  I felt the class had no active learning.  I did not learn any R though this course like I hoped.  You just click \"run\" on R markdowns.  I felt very unengaged during lectures and found the course boring to just watch R output in class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many new skills during this course. The lectures and assignments are super interesting and I felt as though I could apply what I learned to my research or a career. Very useful! ",
            "\u00a0Though it wasn't what I expected, I enjoyed the course and feel like I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class I have taken at YSPH!!! As a graduating second-year, I am so happy my schedule allowed me to take this class.  Especially as an EMD student, this course was tailored to surveillance methodologies I know I will rely on throughout my career, such as aberration detections, modeling trends, and creating cluster maps.  Dan even showed us how to make an interactive web app for clustering given various factors that I know I'll try to utilize in the future.  The subjects we discussed every class period were all so fascinating and I loved being able to follow along in R as Dan or Kayoko explained the code and how each portion worked.  Not only was the material fun and engaging, the course work was relatively light.  Given that half of the students were drowning in thesis work, this class provided a great respite from other stressors.  In every way, this was a class focused on getting students to actually learn and engage with the material, and not just do busy-work to get grades.  I can't say enough great things about this class and Dan; I hope the school continues to offer this course! ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I felt that the course was not terribly engaging. Dan is a really nice person and engaging lecturer, but the course structure and material leaves a bit to be desired. We did not do much coding ourselves (a bit here and there during the homeworks and exams), and we mostly followed along pre-written code during class. I did not feel like I have a solid grasp of R despite this course heavily focusing on it. I felt that I learned R more in other classes not emphasizing it as much, such as Ted's transmission dynamics models course. It could be improved by the students doing a little more coding on the homework and/or exams. Maybe the class can be divided into 1 day for the lecture and 1 day for a lab \"tutorial\" to better facilitate this. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized. Thought the work was worth doing and gave space to learn something new. \r\n\r\nThe course could use a little more explanation of the code from labs as translations of concepts. Labs could be made more useful if we had to code more of it to ensure that we understand how to implement the methods. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course.  I learned a lot of surveillance methodology that I did not know before.  The material was presented clearly and the assignments/tests were more than fair. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class was a great introduction to methods to identify aberrances and use of health systems data to evaluate public health interventions. ",
            "\u00a0More straightforward lecture material? I really appreciated the in-class exercises and the format of the homework assignments and exams, however, I feel like without those things I had no grasp of what was really being taught in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0probably my favorite class this semester! Both concept and methods driven with hands on components and labs. great! Maybe give more homework assignments that allows for us to do hands on coding rather than just manipulating code. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be helpful to break down the R code a bit more; it was sometimes hard to interpret the code in the Rmd files. ",
            "\u00a0good ",
            "\u00a0Extremely useful class, may need introductory skills in R prior to taking the class even though the class instructor said it was not necessary. ",
            "\u00a0strength: hands-on analysis ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course and I learned a lot of concepts that will be valuable in my future career. While I felt that I did not get to learn R as well as I would have liked, I appreciated the effort the instructor and the TFs put in to explain the meaning and purpose of the code. At the very least, I can understand what the code is saying, which I can build off of. \r\nStrengths:\r\n-instructor and TFs were amazing, very helpful, and greatly conveyed their desire to help out students\r\n-concepts and topics were very relevant and have definite future applications\r\n-in-class activities were helpful for hands-on learning\r\n-notes will be helpful for future reference\r\n-Enjoyed the last series in the course, working with PCVs and understanding what information to give different stakeholders and organizations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-While I do have some confidence in reading and evaluating R code, I don't feel confident using R or writing code on my own; while I understand the purpose of the class was not to learn R specifically, it's difficult to not compare to classes like AAME where I not only learned to read and evaluate the code, but to also be able to write out the code on my own, understand the basics of the program, and troubleshoot most issues. I also acknowledge the programs are not equivalent, but I was looking forward to be more adept at R through class ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good. I learned a lot about different surveillance methods. I liked how applied the class was and that worked with real-life datasets to practice methods. There was a little bit of a learning curve to using R, but I got the hang of it pretty quickly. The course started out slow, but I definitely enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good but it felt a bit rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, I learned a lot! Definitely very useful skills if you are interested in surveillance. Would have been nice to have some coding practice (rather than going through existing codes), but I understand that this might not be feasible within the scope and time frame of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is very interesting and valuable course on surveillance methods. The material is excellent and presented in a very understandable way. The organization of methods taught in the latter third of the course felt somewhat confusing though. Some of the guest lectures were well-intentioned but did not add a great deal to the course because they lacked focus or failed to emphasize methods and rationales. "

            "\u00a0Daniel Weinberger was a great teacher. He is very thorough in explaining concepts and does not mind repeating himself over and over until we understood the material. Like I said above, I just wish he had kept to the syllabus more and maybe offered more practice with the actual coding of the techniques we learned. Overall, I thought he was a great professor and very much enjoyed learning this new topic from him. ",

            "\u00a0Dan is the best!  He is genuinely vested in trying to get students to actually learn the material and it shows.  His passion for the subjects are infectious and his lecture style is very engaging.  There wasn't a class the entire the semester that I was bored in at one point or another.  Dan was receptive to comments from students and is clearly always trying to improve the course.  For example, about halfway through the semester I had mentioned wanting the equivalent SAS code to what we were doing in R, just so I could more easily apply these methods in the future should my career require the use of SAS.  Sure enough, the very next class he had created a file in which he would continue to post both the SAS and R codes.  By far one of the kindest and intelligent professors at YSPH; take any class you can with him! ",

I would also say that it is a very interesting course where you can learn some cool new methods. I liked that it took a different view of many of the public health courses I have taken prior that have focused on interventions. This really got you to think about how do you evaluate the success of an intervention. ",

Exams were very fair and reflected the material taught well, but I felt as though most of my learning was done through taking exams.  The class needs to be more engaging than watching R code be run. ",

            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to anyone and everyone.  It absolutely was one of my favorite classes I've ever taken, not only at YSPH but throughout my entire academic career.  The material and methodologies were fun and engaging, there was never any busy-work, and Dan and Kayoko literally gave you all the code you could need and then also went through it line by line explaining how it worked.  It was great following along with them and being able to do some small-group exercises that were never stressful or a waste of time, but rather a way for us to engage with the subject at hand better.  Also, the selection of speakers for the first few weeks of the semester was great.  The topics were interesting and it also provided students a way to ease into their potential last semester of school without any readings/homework for the first month (a major bonus for all of us stressing over our thesis).  All in all, I truly looked forward to class sections every week and am sad to see this course come to an end.  I can't recommend it enough! Take it if you're even only slightly considering it, you won't regret it! ",
            "\u00a0I would only take it if you are really into modeling or learning more PH surveillance. As someone who wanted to take it for fun, it wasn't my favorite. There are some nuances with coding that only certain people would appreciate, and I didn't feel like I developed a solid grasp of R after the course. ",
