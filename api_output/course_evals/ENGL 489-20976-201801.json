            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how the process of writing works. I have not had the chance to completely finish and revise a long piece from beginning to end, and to get the chance to do so provided invaluable experience. Under Professor Choi's guidance, I feel confident enough to will keep expanding my project in the coming year so that it is eventually ready for publication. ",
