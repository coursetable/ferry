            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and critical thinking was highly encouraged. The assignments were helpful as topics could be chosen to relate to each student's interests, and the instructor's feedback was very thorough. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely interesting tying physiology to public health. Ver relevant to the major porblems we face today. ",
            "\u00a0The course is good but speed is a little bit too fast. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Including questions for discussion with other students in class helped me engage with the material more and made it easier to understand how to apply concepts we'd just learned.\r\n- The weekly assignments allowed me to explore topics that I was actually interested in but was never given an opportunity to write about in previous courses.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- A lot of material is covered in the two-hour lecture (understandable given the breadth of the course). It can be a little exhausting and difficult to concentrate near the end of the lecture, which is typically when the TF starts lecturing. It might be nice to include a short stretch break in the middle of class, especially given that this is a Physiology course where we encourage physical activity so much. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course! I like that we were able to focus the weekly assignments on areas of interest to us. The major weakness is that what we learn in class doesn't match up with the content of the assignments and didn't really come together until the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course. Physiology is something I have always found interesting, and we hit all of the key points. Each week is for a different system, and sometimes we're lucky to spend 2 weeks on a single system (liver, cardiovascular). My favorite part about the course was the opportunity to write about any topic you want for the weekly write-up. There were students from various departments in the course, so you can really tie in your own interests with the system we studied. This made the assignments a ton of fun for me, as it gave me the opportunity to 1) learn more about the physiology relevant to my interests and 2) dive deeper to explore the nuances of my topic of interest. ",
            "\u00a0It's very helpful for students begin learning academic writing. Each week we need to submit a write-up with different topic which trained our ability of searching materials and writing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the professor and TF's in-depth knowledge, the richness of the slides and readings, and the open, inviting interactions between professor and student via the weekly reflections.  The only weakness was the sometimes vague phrasing of questions on the midterm and final (might be helpful to have the TF or another pair of eyes read through for clarity to students before posting). ",

            "\u00a0This is an accessible physiology class with direct practical applications, doable for people with no physiology background or people that need a refresher. It was very interactive, which is always great. The instructor is passionate, very accessible, and truly wants her students to learn. The weekly write ups kept us engaged, but they were very broad so didn't always feel directly related or pertinent to the class. The other sometimes difficult thing is that the slides often seem disorganized and incomplete - more like a stream of consciousness rather than organized information. It made it pretty difficult to study with them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very informative, covered all the systems \r\nWeaknesses: the exams were very difficult ",
            "\u00a0Loved the course. We covered the major systems, all while tying together the content and presenting an epi/public health perspective. There was a lot of ground to cover but I think Yeckel did a great job doing this. One opportunity for improvement would be to have a bit more structure in the group activities. They were mostly fun but we could have gotten more out of them if they were like informal case presentations or something. ",
            "\u00a0The course was really interesting and my first physiology class so I am really happy to have gotten that foundation. It was very comprehensive and detailed without losing the context of public health. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn so much about physiology from both a biological and public health standpoint in just one semester. You learn to think critically about the material and the class is very engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it would've been nicer if the slides had more detail; Catherine is incredibly knowledgeable but the material she presented sometimes either deviated from the slides or weren't included in the slides at all, so preparing for the write-ups and studying for exams were often challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This was an EXCELLENT class! Professor Yeckel gave an amazing overview of major body systems, and balanced detail with larger public health ramifications (for example, we learned both about the microscopic structures of the kidney and about how our current sedentary lifestyle can interfere with function and lead to CKD.) The class included dynamic, thought-provoking questions/scenarios to get us critically thinking about how these body systems work and what their vulnerabilities are. The lectures were fascinating and very easy to pay attention to -- I looked forward to attending every week.\r\n\r\nIf you are at all interested in medicine, or even if you just have an extra open class and want something interesting, you should take this class! ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing. In terms of knowledge gained, I think this course taught me the most over the whole semester than any other one I've taken here. You are introduced to topics in a way that truly engage you, and give you a deep understanding of the material. Only thing I would improve is the structure of the slides, sometimes the organization just got a little tough to read. Loved the slides themselves though! "

You can tell that she is passionate and enjoys the material she teaches and does a great job at engaging students with the material.\r\n- Her comments on weekly assignments have helped me improve my public health communication skills as the weeks have gone on.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- None. Anyone who has the opportunity to take a class with Dr. Yeckel or at least talk to her outside of class is incredibly lucky and privileged. ",

Moreover, she taught me to think about the physiology knowledge not only just limited in each systems, but also compare the knowledge in different systems. That's very help for better understanding body physiology. ",

            "\u00a0Catherine is a gem of a human. She is the most enthusiastic professor I've ever experienced; it's very clear that this subject is her absolute passion. This enthusiasm can definitely rub off, and it makes you want to work to make sure you don't disappoint her. It can also sometimes mean that lectures can get a little tangential and sometimes a little scattered. She is a wonderful person who cares about her students, understand that life happens, and is always accessible. Her feedback on the write ups and exams was thorough and enthusiastic. ",

I looked forward to lecture every week, and had zero trouble staying engaged in the material. She gave clear, timely feedback on our weekly reading responses, asked thought provoking questions that testing our knowledge of organ systems. She was very kind and helpful during office hours. Overall, I really think Professor Yeckel is a great teacher, and I very much hope she continues to teach this course. Thank you! ",

It gives a great overview of the main body systems, which is very useful when trying to study chronic or infectious diseases. Dr. Yeckel is very knowledgeable in this field and does a great job summarizing the important points that students need to know. The course doesn't involve an excessive amount of time or work, but students will have to be engaged in the material during lecture to gain the most from this class. ",

Each week explores a different body system or organ, and you'll have autonomy to design your own deep dive into a related topic of interest in the weekly reflections.  The professor is extremely knowledgeable, very approachable, and fair in the grading of the reflections, midterm, and final.  I don't know why this isn't a requirement for everyone graduating from YSPH -- physiology is the basis of health and, therefore, public health! ",

It does demand a chunk of your time, as there are weekly write ups that require research (only a page long, though). It's important to take good notes in class, because the slides are sometimes disorganized and don't include everything that was talked about in class, and are not always the most helpful when studying. The exams need critical thinking, but Catherine is great about being flexible as long as you justify your answer. She's also a wonderful professor, who genuinely cares about her students, is flexible if things come up for you, and crazy enthusiastic about what she teaches ",
