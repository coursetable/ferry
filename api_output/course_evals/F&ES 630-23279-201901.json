            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the structure and function of the atmosphere and how it interacts with the land surface and ocean. The first half of the class was a really great overview of how earth's climate has developed and changed over time, and how it is being impacted by anthropogenic activities. I also learned about the different ways that climate modelers are predicting future changes in earth's climate. ",

            "\u00a0I gained insight into the physical processes that shape our climate system and the ways it is currently changing globally. I gained some understanding of how global climate models work and how that awareness can help me better comprehend charts of global climate changes. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, we covered the physical-chemical-biological components of the earth climate system. We learned about the climate cycles from various historical data sources and compared it with contemporary data to present various sources of evidence that support the theory of climate change. We also learned how to use a GCM general circulation model to simulate the earth's climate, and in the end, covered the more complex interactions of humans with the climate. ",

One session felt insufficient to get a full grasp. Although I realize any more exposure might have necessitated a standalone class for advanced GCM modeling. ",

I also learned a lot (because I started from zero) about general circulation models, which is very neat. The information taught in this course would be useful for every single student at FES, because these topics are fundamental to today's environmental movement. "

However, I expected to learn a lot more about climate modeling and feel skilled in the software by the end.  This was not the case. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class aligned with my expectations. I expected to learn about earth's climate system, and we did. In the second half of the class, we spent too much time on our projects and not enough time actively learning. ",

            "\u00a0The class did not really line up with my expectations. I expected there to be more quantitative analysis in terms of the physical science presented and in the work that we did, and I expected to use the EdGCM more. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class was very informative about the earth climate system that covers it from many different dimensions. The second half with the GCM and presentations was not well organized. The GCM was not very informative since we could only run very coarse simulations. As a result, these results were not helpful to inform the final society-climate presentations because of the finer and more complex parameters needed. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly. It was pretty high level, which was helpful but at times easy to disengage. ",
            "\u00a0It aligned fairly well. The most useful part of the class was interacting with a climate model and writing the final report. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well. Although I felt the core scientific concepts were rushed and crammed into 6 weeks and then spent far too long on modeling. We should have spent at least 2 more weeks on the core scientific concepts and much less time doing Powerpoint presentations on the progress of our modeling projects as the core scientific concepts are the main reason I enrolled in this class. Perhaps the modeling in this class should be at an introductory level and the advanced modeling should be left for another, separate class. ",
            "\u00a0Poorly. I did not expect this class to focus on modeling nearly as much as it did. I was expecting it to be more like the first 1/3rd of the class where we learned about climate systems as they relate to our various interests. Instead, we spent the 2/3rds of the class doing modeling exercises and projects. I also was under the impression that Professor Raymond would be there for the whole semester and was surprised when I found out he left without making it clear to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty well - I was happy with the curriculum and learning objectives. ",
            "\u00a0I think they aligned well. I expected to learn about the science of climate change, and that's exactly what the first half of the course was about. I wasn't quite so aware that at the halfway point the course would shift from lectures/powerpoints to climate models and group work; nevertheless, I think that latter half was also valuable. "

            "\u00a0strengths - topics covered\r\nweaknesses - organization. this course was very poorly organized. I understand that it was the first time the course has been taught, but the level of sloppiness was unacceptable, even for a first time course. readings were often posted late. expectations for large assignments and presentations changed regularly. the main professor listed for the course, Pete Raymond, ended up leaving campus halfway through the semester. the unit on modeling could have been much more engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is it is very comprehensive and covers various parts of earth system and discusses different techniques for climate impact assessment. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very unorganized.  There are so many varying topics to cover, so the professors need to be more strategic about what information they want to focus on instead of trying to shove it all in and not having time to explain anything well. \r\nI would have liked to spend a lot more time in the computer lab learning how to use to edGMC software.  We had very little time to explore the software.  \r\nThe final project was set up in a very strange way.  We had to give 3 different presentations for he same project (project proposal presentation, a progress report presentation, and a final presentation).  This felt like a huge waste of class time.  Presentations for the same 8 projects took up 4 whole class periods in addition to a large chunk of time during reading period. \r\nOverall, the class needs to be planned and organized much more thoughtfully and strategically. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of the class was the final project. While the first half of the class was great, it felt like the instructors ran out of things to teach us after that and we spend much too much time on the projects. It felt entirely unnecessary and like a waste of class time for each group to present on the same project three times, without much time in between to make a lot of progress. I do understand the value of progress presentations, but they could have been done more informally (and at the very least, there should only be two presentations per group). Also, while I do understand the value of getting hands-on time with modeling, I found that aspect of the course challenging as well. It was hard to focus on Linda's modeling presentations via zoom, and once we started using EdGCM it became clear that it would be too coarse to be of use for many of our projects.\r\n\r\nThe biggest strength of this course was Pete and Xuhui's teaching in the first half of the class, when we were still going over the bulk of the material. Having both of their expertise was great and gave us a full picture of the current state of climate knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Less EdGCM/project, more problem sets. Diving into the science was great, but I'll never use the GCM skills again. I absolutely appreciated learning about GCMs, but didn't need such extensive hands-on practice -- not sure why that needed to be such a big component of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Class seemed a bit disorganized. The beginning part of the class was strong in organization, walking through the different impacts of climate change. The second half was less organized. I believe there were too many presentations: these can be condensed into two and eliminate the middle progress presentation. Groups should also be on similar timelines (which elimination of the middle would help facilitate). It also was not clear whether we were required to incorporate our own projections into our assessment. It may be worth considering running models in the beginning of the semester (so students can gain a conceptual understanding of models) while the second half is used to examine the results of other models. The reason I bring this point up is that our own model was not extraordinarily helpful and, likely, error-ridden; including it in a formal report and presentation at the end of the semester may undermine or weakens some of our analysis. ",
            "\u00a0The modeling was cool, and the midterm was very reasonable. The only point of improvement I'd recommend is taking out one of the update presentations. At a certain point they got a bit repetitive, since people could only make so much progress. Also, Narasimha Rao was great and a couple other guest speakers like him would be an awesome addition. ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job of segmenting the first and second halves. The first part was logically structured with a new topic each class. The second part was focused on group work with EdGCM and research.\r\n\r\nThe course could have better communicated class details, such as when and where class would/would not be occurring (after the final presentations, I assumed no class the next Thursday but did not know for sure). There were also days where it was not clear if we were meeting in the lab or classroom. \r\n\r\nOnce we started the second 1/2 of the course focused on student research, we still had lectures one day a week on various topics. While the material was well-presented and interesting, it felt disjointed. \r\n\r\nEdGCM turned out to be too rudimentary for many of our final projects given the size of the grid. Also, a bit more structure around the group EdGCM class sessions with Linda would be helpful (it felt rushed and then there was no follow-up after) ",
            "\u00a0The modeling project was important, but could be limited to a shorter timeline/smaller scope/use less class time. Three presentations felt like a lot to give on more or less the same material. An introductory presentation and a final presentation would be preferred, or even just a final presentation with some class time to work in our groups. I felt as though the time I spent preparing presentations (outside of class) or listening to other groups presentations (inside of class) could have been better used working in my group. ",
            "\u00a0The psets and exam are both fair and generally reflect the lecture material. The EdGCM portion of the class was a little disorganized and I think would benefit from more structure. We also spent probably too much time on update presentations in the second half of class. ",
            "\u00a0Great first half of the class (although it was a lot of material), but would really recommend spreading it more evenly across the course. The second half felt like there was less content and more kind of filler lectures. Really did not enjoy sitting through three very similar presentations from each team. ",
            "\u00a0The workload of this class was particularly low, and overall the class might have been more worthwhile if the problem sets continued into the second half of the course. The second half of the course seemed to drag on, partly as a result of the lack of work and partly as a result of the fact that each group presented their group projects three separate times, which significantly cut in to the chance to learn new material. It was extremely repetitive to have to watch and give all of the presentations several times, and I think we would have all been better served if we gave at maximum two presentations, and possibly just one. In thinking about new ways to structure the class, I could see the bulk of the material being condensed into just a half-semester course. I think by the end of the semester, it seemed like many people had lost interest in the class, which is a real shame given the extreme importance of the material. ",
            "\u00a0As I said in the previous answer, the first half of the class was very informative as a general lecture class. While I appreciated that the latter half of the class was project based and facilitated interactions with my classmates, these interactions did not lead to more learning. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty boring lectures. The final assignment could be more beneficial if re-worked somehow. ",
            "\u00a0The midterm felt like a high school exam - just memorization of small facts. The climate model section of the class was interesting, but expectations were very unclear. Also, one of the important lessons was on a day when a lot of students were in DC for a school event, so that was a bummer. I liked the way the three professors worked together, but by the end of the semester there was just one left. That was strange. There was no need to have three presentations for our final project. Doing a first progress report kept us accountable, but we ended up presenting our second on a Thursday and our final on the following Tuesday. It felt like we wasted time preparing the second presentation when we could've been working on the final product. Also, no one listened after the first presentation except for the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Similar to the above, I felt very rushed to learn the core scientific principles of climate science in the first half of the course. These are such critical concepts that we should have slowed down a bit. The truth is that Professors Raymond and Lee are brilliant and incredibly knowledgeable on the topic of climate science and I would have really enjoyed getting more lecture time from them. \r\n\r\nAlso, I felt the midterm was not congruent with the material we learned. The material we covered was very complex and high level and I spent the bulk of my time trying to understand what each concept was and how they relate to each other (which was incredibly useful). However, the exam felt like a big \"gotcha\" moment because some of the questions were  things the professors mentioned (literally) once such as \"How many milliliters of rain does New Haven get annually?\" While an interesting fact, I don't think questions like these test our foundational understanding of the atmospheric and earth science concepts we grappled with in class. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the first several weeks of class were excellent and that the professors had such a depth of knowledge that really complimented what they were teaching. I would have enjoyed going further into the dynamics of climate systems as they relate to causal human impacts and felt that would have been really valuable to my education. Jonathan was also an extremely helpful TA and helped us navigate the course and material. The courses greatest weaknesses were in the organization, communication, and use of student time. It was not always clear what the plan for the course was and when we were working on climate modeling projects or presentations things often went wrong. That is a minor waste of student's time but then I felt the final presentations were a deliberate waste of our time. Each group was asked to present on their projects 3 times which took up two class periods each time. Very little had changed between each presentation and it felt absolutely ridiculous to present on the same project every other week. I also felt the project was not worth our time in it of itself. It did not progress our skills further and we received very little feedback. I walked away from this class feeling like I stopped learning things that were relevant to what I wanted to pursue after the first month and half of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Great topic coverage: it catered to mutiple career and sectoral interests\r\n- Great introductory course: digestible for students who have no prior knowledge / experience with the topic\r\n- Varied and useful assessments: the problem sets, group project, etc. provided a good mix of skill testing/measures\r\n- Guest lecturers / speakers: highly appreciated the other professionals/experts delivering presentations on specific areas/topics.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- one potential area for improvement might be the group project arrangements. There were a number of deliverables for the project over the latter half of the semester, but the requirements for them were not always clear / distinguishable. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was the dedication of the professors and TAs to make the course beneficial for students. The overwhelming weakness was a lack of organization/planning in terms of how the semester was going to go. Communication was also a weakness  there were maybe half a dozen days when my friends and I weren't sure where class was being held. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would suggest that if a student studied environmental science in college, then they should not take the class.  I did not feel like I learned much new material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that people take this class if they want to learn about earth's climate! I definitely learned a lot. But either hope that they change the format of the final project, or try to get started early. ",
            "\u00a0Take notes in class, the lectures are well-structured and there's a lot to learn. ",

            "\u00a0As far as climate science and earth science classes go, I think that this is actually a pretty good option. I am an energy studies scholar and I was looking for a class in the dreaded track II. I think that this is a good class to satisfy that requirement (don't be intimidated by the fact that it is a grad class, all the forestry students are really nice). ",
            "\u00a0It's a new course so ask questions about faculty about their intentions for the next year. They seem open to feedback so be transparent about your learning objectives, and I'm sure they'll be open to hearing what you want to learn. ",

If you are interested in learning about modeling and getting to try some super basic modeling runs then this may be more suited for you. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great introduction for persons who are unfamiliar with the science, and necessary for those who intend to work in the field - regardless of approach/application (research, policy, etc.). It is especially a useful follow up to Prof. Anisfelds foundation course in Physical Sciences. ",
            "\u00a0This course is new, so don't expect for all the kinks to be ironed out yet. If you're not good with flux, this class might not be the best option for you, because you'll probably have to go with the flow a bit. But it's definitely doable, so that shouldn't be a dealbreaker for everyone. You'll get out of this class what you put it, so ultimately the benefit you glean is determined by you. "
