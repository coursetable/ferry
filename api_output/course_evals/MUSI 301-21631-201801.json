            "\u00a0learned how to write counterpoint, and listen . ",
            "\u00a0A pretty encompassing look at the horizontal v. vertical functions of music making, from two to four voices. Although niche, I've found that it interacts quite well with other aspects of my (admittedly more modern) music composition tactics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write modal counterpoint up through 4 voices, which entailed understanding the principles of the style and developing skills for composing efficiently. ",
            "\u00a0Facility with writing according to the rules of 16th century counterpoint. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of counterpoint and how to write it, which has been very useful in approaching early music and composing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of the compositional procedures for 16th Century counterpoint for up to four voices with imitative entries.  Although I struggled to truly emulate the style at times, I definitely have a much better sense of it now.  I have also learned to hear the voices in my head better than before and have improved at catching my errors. ",
            "\u00a0This was primarily a skills-oriented course, designed to teach you specifically how to write modal counterpoint in the style of a small subset of canonical composers from the 15th and 16th centuries, such as Palestrina. Unlike tonal counterpoint, we didnt spend much time talking about why counterpoint is a worthy course of study, why it works acoustically, why its considered a music theory discipline, or why its an important field to study today. Rather, we did a series of intense exercises to learn to imitate a small handful of specific compositional styles. Through this course of study, I learned to imitate said styles, though in contrast to the tonal counterpoint course, I cant say I learned much more than that (though of course, there is value in learning to imitate and, for many, in learning this particular style).

            "\u00a0This was an excellent class. Perhaps improvement from numeric grading scale rather than just giving everything a letter grade. ",
            "\u00a0teacher is great, and understanding - can move a little fast. ",
            "\u00a0It was a pretty large class, meaning that we got very little one-on-one time with the professor outside of office hours. And since everything in this course stacks, one misstep or misunderstanding could lead to greater trouble down the road. ",
            "\u00a0Professor McCreless clearly articulates his expectations for the course and is quite generous with his time and support of students. I just wish it weren't so early in the morning. ",
            "\u00a0Alternating between working on assignments in class and getting immediate feedback, and doing assignments at home was a really good way to approach the topic. The combination of ways to learn was helpful.\r\nThe only thing I'd say is a weakness is the nature of the revision system. Though it is enormously helpful to get revisions to see what you did wrong, actually implementing those revisions only helped me a little bit. What would have helped in addition, I think, is some kind of optional mastery assignments where students would have an opportunity to do the same *kind* of thing (e.g. writing a three voice, 8-10 measure, untexted exercise) for extra credit and/or a chance to improve a worse grade. This would be helpful in giving students more of a sense of mastery over the material, especially after doing badly on an assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were excellent because they were challenging but accessible.  Each assignment was always a significant learning process in itself.  The main weakness was that the classes themselves were not that interesting and consisted mainly of just walking through the details in the book and then working individually.   I would suggest doing more workshops with student works because even though it puts pressure on people to expose their work, it is very helpful to learn everyone's different styles and thought processes.  Also, I would suggest including some small listening assignments to help students get used to and appreciate the style. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n-You will learn to imitate compositional styles and norms from a subset of canonized music from the 15th and 16th centuries \r\n-you will practice and learn basic species counterpoint from 1st to 4th species, learn to imitate in the familiar style, and begin to feel comfortable writing modal counterpoint for 3-4 voices (culminating in composition of a 4-voice motet) \r\n-you will get practice and advice on text-setting, which can be applied to many genres of music \r\n-Professor McCreless is relatively good about providing feedback on work and giving you a chance to revise/improve it\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-(some might like thispersonally, I did not): Unlike MUSI 302, you will not spend much time on bigger picture questions or exploring the context of this work, why it should be studied, or how/why this is  classified as a music theory course. time will almost exclusively be spend on technical conversions pertaining to the practice of modal counterpoint \r\n-you will not get a thorough overview of music from this periodjust a small subset of composers and styles (which, to be fair, is reasonable in a course titled modal counterpointI just wish the course covered a broader range of music from the 15th and 16th centuries. I realize we are also limited by availability of scores, scholarly texts, etc. But there certainly could be a better effort to incorporate music we do know about). \r\n-most class time was spend on reviewing the rules of counterpoint and not listening to or having conversations about the music. I would have preferred to only get to 3 voices or skip a rule or two in exchange for more time listening to the music, talking about how our class pertained to the history/compositional process, etc. ",
            "\u00a0There were many days where we worked on examples together as a class and many days where we worked on examples individually. I think that setup was good in that it made sure people weren't falling behind but still held everyone accountable for their own work. "

            "\u00a0My class had a lot of students who were not singers or who were not particularly into renaissance music so this made the course a little less fun. I wanted it to move at a faster pace. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an excellent and fun way to fulfill the theory requirement of the music major. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if you like theory, or need a theory requirement - its better than most. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to someone looking to micro-analyze their songwriting and see how a certain kind of foundational music can be made ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you don't mind composing counterpoint! It is not entirely my idea of fun, but Professor McCreless is so kind and engaging that it made for a really pleasant classroom experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Counterpoint is like a fun logic puzzle, and learning it definitely helped me grow as a musician. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone with a strong background in music theory who enjoys detail and intricacy.  Counterpoint is a subtle art that takes much concentration. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a specific reason to study modal counterpoint (e.g., you want to work in a catholic church, study this era of music, etc.), then you certainly should take this course. If you need a theory credit or just want to learn the basic rules of counterpoint, I think youd be much better off taking 302 (tonal counterpointwhich I also took). Both classes are a lot of work, but in 302, not only is the style more immediately useful for most contemporary composers and musicians, but the way the class was structured allowed for much more meaningful engagement with the music. In both courses, I feel I learned to write decent counterpoint and imitate styles, but only in 302 did I ask why I was doing this, get exposure to a wide variety of composers and approaches to the course material, think about the bigger picture, and really listen to and engage with the music from the period we were studying. In 301, time was almost exclusively spent on learning and imitating rules read in a single textbook. If you like that kind of approach, this class might be perfect for you! But in terms of getting a broad education as an undergrad and learning about this period and style of music, I felt there was a lot of busy work and not a lot of deep thinking. ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful class. The music is beautiful, and learning it to write it eloquently is rewarding. Professor McCreless is insightful and very helpful, and he really knows this stuff; my counterpoint skills grew a lot under his direction. ",
            "\u00a0I personally wasn't interested in the subject material, and was kind of bored the whole time. If you like counterpoint though, the class is well taught so I think you'd enjoy it. "
