            "\u00a0The great strength was the focus on pathology which is not covered in most Yale biology courses, and the compelling lecturers who are experts in their fields. It is a good course to take later in the biology career after building up background in normal physiology, including cell biology and molecular biology. It might help to list this as 400 level or list the normal \"Physiological Systems\" course as a prerequisite. This could also give more time by not having to cover normal physiology of kidney and gut so much. I feel it might be hard to follow without the right background. I don't know why students dropped out early but maybe this had to do with being intimidated by the difficulty or feeling underprepared? Some of the students who stayed in were very capable and experienced. "
