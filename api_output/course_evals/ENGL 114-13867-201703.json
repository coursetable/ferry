            "\u00a0In this course, I was introduced to college writing and encouraged to break the formulaic molds I had learned in high school. I also was challenged in my perception of what makes the sacred and the secular. I developed my ability to read and understand complicated philosophical texts. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths would be the teaching style, where it is a small seminar style class. Weaknesses would be the reading, where I think it should be more varied. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in its structure. I felt like every class had a distinct purpose and the section did not feel institutionalized in any way, although it was a part of a bigger course. I felt like there could have been more of a balance between the writing exercises and discussions of the section topic though. ",
            "\u00a0The teacher didn't create an engaging environment for the students nor did she choose interesting texts. Despite the goal of an engaging writing based class on an interesting topic, most of the real skill development was outside of class writing papers, without assistance from the teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of interesting readings ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions allowed us to develop a better understanding of the texts and the revision process became optimized throughout the semester. Successful peer editing on google docs made the process of revision go a lot smoother. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if writing is not your forte. It helps you learn how to structure your essays properly, and how to clearly have a purpose in your writing. This specific section, also let me think critically about the affect of religion in our lives, and Felisa is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to first-years looking to fulfill a WR credit. However, there a lot more interesting ways to accomplish the same thing. ",
