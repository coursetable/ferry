            "\u00a0Learned a lot about what web development is, and a lot of the popular frameworks/languages involved: i was able to learn about things not really covered elsewhere in the CS major: Flask, React JS, HTML/CSS, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Express/NodeJS, Git, Heroku ",
            "\u00a0I learned some new languages and modules (HTML, ReactJS, Flask, SQL) and better developed my understanding of the development of web applications. ",
            "\u00a0Full stack development; real-world issues with dealing with clients; working despite being handicapped by bad programming languages and convoluted packaging managers. ",
            "\u00a0Learned fundamentals of web development, HTTP, and SQL "

            "\u00a0Stengths: For the second half of the semester, you're able to work on some pretty cool projects throughout the departments at Yale (like the architecture school, or the Art gallery)\r\nWeaknesses: at least this semester, the course was fairly disorganized; It essentially amounted to looking up tutorials on your own and hacking together a functioning web app for the very vaguely assigned psets (there were only 2). This isn't necessarily bad, as there is really no good way to cover so much material in a lecture style setting. Also, it was unclear as to what the expected background for the course was, and as a result there were several varying levels of experience with web development, which worked out to a degree, but may have been challenging for those with less experience.\r\n It's also important to note that making a full stack web app takes a lot more time than you would expect, especially if you're doing it for the first time. My first project easily took me 30 hours over ~3 weeks to finish. ",
            "\u00a0From the title, \"Applications in digital humanities\", I had been expected applied methods in working with digital humanities, rather than the development of DH applications. The former description is more relevant for humanities / non-CS students, and would not necessarily require a strong background.\r\n\r\nThe class could improve by adding in the dimension of humanities research and specific considerations of what digital humanities methods and considerations look like. Studying DH projects, speaking to campus researchers, and reading DH theory would be helpful. Also, surveying existing applications that help common research questions (like text analysis tools). ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, the biggest weakness came in a lack of defined structure or style -- common with first-time classes, in my experience. It was a class where you 100% got what you put in, which I personally like but that allowed some to slack pretty hard in group projects.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that \"how to set up a development environment outside C9\" would be nice (npm, git, $PATHs, etc). C9 basic is great for CS50 but an utter pain for full-stack. I don't think anyone was using it by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0A little all over the place in terms of which languages were used but the main aim of the class was fun and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0A little more structure at the beginning would have been better when it came to learning web development and sql. "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in web development, then this is a solid opportunity to essentially learn it by yourself, but also get credit and have access to a TA and some cool projects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although the course is new, there is a lot of potential for it to fill a much needed gap in the school's CS curriculum.  Challenging students with digital humanities projects and collaborations, while at the same time teaching basics of web development and databases is great. "
