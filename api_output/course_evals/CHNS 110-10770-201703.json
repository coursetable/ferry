            "\u00a0I built proficiency in basic Chinese. It helped me build my confidence in speaking as well; the strong emphasis on spoken language and conversation is unique to Yale's program. ",
            "\u00a0Beginner level knowledge of Chinese. Speaking, writing, reading, listening all at a conversational level. ",
            "\u00a0Introductory Chinese ",
            "\u00a0Learned basic writing/reading/speaking of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Although I had taken a couple of Chinese courses before, this class took my use of the language to a level far beyond what I had thought possible in this short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I received a transformative introductory education to Chinese and cannot express enough how much I enjoyed this course. Critical thinking, pushing myself to my greatest academic limits, and more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to speak Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically think about and use the grammatical structure, pronunciation, writing, and reading of the Chinese Language. I also learned valuable listening skills and was challenged to find creative and alternative ways to learn the language in ways that were best for me. ",
            "\u00a0I went from 0 knowledge of the language to feeling comfortable learning. I've been told by several Chinese speakers that my accent is excellent, and I can begin to decode Hanzi. It's really great. ",
            "\u00a0a whole new language! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much grammar and vocabulary that would be essential to all types of conversation in Chinese. Before I dont think I would be able to survive in China, but now I want to travel to China and learn more Chinese. "

            "\u00a0One of the very few things I would change about this wonderful class is the level of support students receive with respect to writing characters. No instructional time is regularly and consistently dedicated to understanding the pictorial etymology of characters or practicing radicals -- I strongly believe that a greater focus on writing during class time would be enormously beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Great teachers! ",
            "\u00a0This course doesn't have many weaknesses, but I might have appreciated being forced to have more extended conversations more often. Otherwise, the instruction is great and the homework is just enough to keep you caught up in class without drowning the student in new material. I never found myself too busy with Chinese, but I still learned loads this semester. ",
            "\u00a0It meets everyday, so there is daily homework and daily quizzes. Which is great for learning but a lot of work! The materials are fun and easy to study with. Class is a bit fast-paced with an emphasis on speaking, so there isn't much time to take notes. ",
            "\u00a0Great teachers, very interactive and engaging ",
            "\u00a0I have no complaints about the course, I especially like the system of rotating teachers. ",
            "\u00a0Really a fantastic course all around, the only way I could possibly want it to change is to have the teachers suggest more opportunities for students to further their learning except for the Chinese table and calligraphy on Fridays. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were certainly the small class sizes, the wonderful peers and friends developed in them, and the quality of each professor. Every one of them was incredibly engaged and interested in you learning in a positive and productive way. ",
            "\u00a0no weaknesses \r\n\r\nstrengths - phenomenal teachers! I felt like every single teacher really cared about me learning Chinese and was very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very well structured for elementary students in Chinese. For the students who speak a different dialect of Chinese (eg Cantonese or Fujinese), perhaps there could be beginning Mandarin class for them. "

            "\u00a0If you are even remotely interested in the Chinese language then please take this course. Yes, it can be a lot of work at times, but it really is so rewarding at the end of the day. The teachers work very hard to make the language easy to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend. Great teachers and great class setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's one of the best classroom learning environments you'll find if you want to learn Chinese. There's a reason Yale is known for its Chinese program. ",
