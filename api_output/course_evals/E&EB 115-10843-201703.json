            "\u00a0It is strong because it teaches about an important, and yet understudied, subject. It is also good for non-science majors that need a science credit.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is its workload in the sense that it is a lot of different things. ",
            "\u00a0easy to understand for non science people ",
            "\u00a0Great course!!! I loved learning new things about the environment and natural world, and really enjoyed having Professor Puth as a teacher. We took a couple of trips to the Peabody, which were amazing, and the topics chosen for lectures were really interesting. A weakness of the course was the lack of feedback - it's reading period now and I still haven't gotten any feedback on any of my written assignments or debate participation. ",
            "\u00a0Linda is a great instructor. There are 3 exams and 2 papers, which seems a lot but is manageable if you stay on top of your work. ",
            "\u00a0The material for this class is actually pretty interesting. I'm not big on science so I took this course to just get my credit out of the way but was pretty engaged the whole time. BUT I would honestly say the tests are super challenging despite the material being pretty simple. It's good that total the tests only make up 50% of the grade or else I wouldn't say this class was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0The tests really need to be improved. The questions were really poorly worded so even if you knew the material it wasn't clear how to answer the question. Also they were time test -- if you are a fast test taker you do well, if you're a bit slower you'll do poorly. Prof. Puth claims that she doesn't want students to \"memorize\" but wants us to apply our knowledge. But that is totally inconsistent with a time test where she wants us to jot down concepts rather than explaining our thinking. She needs to pick one or the other -- either have a memorization time test, or a test where we apply our knowledge thoughtfully and have enough time to do so. ",
            "\u00a0The exams for this class were a weakness.  The exams were way too long, and it didn't seem like Dr. Puth really thought about how long to make the exam to fit into 50 minute class periods.  The exam should not be accompanied with the hope that the next class in the room will stay out as long as possible to let us get through the exams, but that was the case here.  It was very frustrating because people who studied a lot could very easily not do well, and people who just guessed could do well.  There was no time to check over the work at all, which I think favors people who are good at test taking rather than people who understand the material.  But this isn't a class about test taking, so the exams could have just focused on the material.  Plus, going through quickly and having no time to check over work doesn't even seem like a very good way to let the students show what they know and think about what they have learned because there is no time.  \r\n\r\nLuckily, there were papers to write, which seemed a much better way to think about the material. Also, the lectures were very clear and organized, and the variety of assignments was good. ",
            "\u00a0There were some very interesting outside lectures, as well as field trips to the peabody which helped keep the class exciting. \r\nLinda Puth is a wonderful professor, I really enjoyed her lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Topics are interesting, especially case studies. TAs did a good job making time for students. \r\nWeaknesses - Exams were difficult. Lectures were often boring. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the course moves at a good pace and each unit is related to the previous one. A weakness may be that the format of the exams changed with every coming midterm. ",
            "\u00a0A strength would be its accessibility. You do not need to know anything about Biology to benefit from and do well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: An effective combination of STEM and humanities; the assignments are unique\r\nWeaknesses: Tests are formatted differently from what is usually expected ",
            "\u00a0The exams are the greatest weakness. They are designed in such a way that you can study extremely hard and do poorly, and not study at all and do well. They are also way too long and give fast test takers an advantage. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you to think critically about human impact on the environment through different methods, including examining case studies, reading scientific papers, creating your own examples of species extinction, active conversations and debates during discussion section, policy papers that make you engage with the material, and exams. \r\n\r\nThe exams are perhaps the only weakness of this course in that the structure of each test varies, but if you do the reading, go to discussion sections, and study then youll be fine! ",
            "\u00a0Overall great course ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are pretty engaging in the course and you do some interesting activities in section-the exam questions tend to be confusing because they are built off of concepts in the class and require a lot of interpretation on your part ",

            "\u00a0A lot more work than I expected. Too many assignments and exams. The expectations for each exam varied and were not clearly explained. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was its content. Conservation biology is an interesting and important field. Besides that the other main strength of the course I think was the debate we held towards the end of the semester. Literally everyone involved got incredibly excited and invested in the debate, which was great to see. I would say the main weakness of the course was the amount of assignments - three exams, two essays, and a debate. I think the debate should be kept, as should the position piece, but I think the outside lecture at least is unnecessary. "

            "\u00a0No--there are better Sc credits. I was personally interested in the material covered, learned a lot, Stephen/his discussion section was wonderful, but there was a wide consensus that the exams were unnecessarily difficult. The way they were graded and structured prized test-taking skills over engagement with the material (reminded me of high school). ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend for a SC credit. Engaging, interesting, not difficult, and very obvious what was necessary to obtain a high grade. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you just want to get your science credit out of the way. Big caution though: the tests are not a walk in the park. You get lucky though because you have a lot of opportunity to do well in other areas. I thought I'd be walking out of the class with an A range grade when I looked at the material but I honestly doubt I will now because I don't think there is a curve. That being said, the TAs and Prof Puth realized that the tests were different and weighted them differently (said the best 2 out of 3 would be weighted 20% of the grade, other one would be 10% I think). ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for an easy science credit don't take this class. Even if you go to every class and study for the exams, you aren't guaranteed an A because the tests are too long for the allotted time and the questions are poorly worded so even if you know the material it can be hard to answer the questions correctly. Plus there's a ton of work -- three tests, an outside lecture report, a paper, and a debate. I much preferred Issues Approach as an easy science credit, mostly because the tests were very fair and you were rewarded for doing the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course because it really frustrated me.  I thought I could improve because I thought the material was interesting and tried to figure out how to take the exams, but the exams felt very arbitrary and too long and specific, so I didn't feel like improving on how to take the exams was possible. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah! Would recommend especially if you are a non-science major looking for an interesting and applicable science credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, If you're interested in the changing environment, I would definitely recommend this course. It is a lot of work, and the exams are challenging, but I learned a lot from it. It's a good science credit but I wouldn't say it's a gut. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students because the teaching by Professor Puth and the TF's was great. Their commitment to always answer questions and hold review sessions was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you need a science credit and want to take a class that will give you different perspectives to carry over into your other areas of interest, you could do much worse than Conservation Biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would; it's an interesting and important subject, and not too difficult of a science credit ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially someone who is not a science major, because it serves as the bridge between the humanities/social sciences and STEM. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to everyone (both STEM and non-STEM majors) because the class teaches you to better understand the current state of our earth and the history as well as future consequences of climate change. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you if you are interested in species/conservation efforts, because you will absolutely learn a lot. It is not a gut! The tests are application based so even if you know the material it may be hard to score well on those. You should go to class, because the slides are mostly pictures and it is hard to understand material for tests if you skip. Discussion sections were fun though ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for a science credit you might wanna look into it but there is a good amount of work... three tests 2 papers and a debate ",
