            "\u00a0It was overall a very interesting and informative course. I personally didn't enjoy the exclusive focus on research, and feel there should be more variety offered in a course that is a requirement of the Global Health Concentration. It definitely shouldn't be listed as a policy class any longer. ",
            "\u00a0I wish they would honestly change the title. It is very misleading. I thought the class was going to focus on the leading issues facing global health today (ex. climate change, antibiotic resistance, obesity, nutrition, etc...) but instead it primarily focused on doing research in low to middle income countries. ",
            "\u00a0great ",
            "\u00a0Course was great! The weekly reading reflections helped me stay on top of the readings but didn't feel like a burden to do at all. Loved the set up of the course and how much class involvement was encouraged. Guest lectures and panels were super informative. ",
            "\u00a0Good ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course! It definitely deepened my interest in global health. The speakers were interesting, the paper was manageable (I liked that it was broken into sections due at different times), I liked that you could pick which weeks to do the reading summaries. I LOVED the poster session on the last day! That was a highlight of the semester for me.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestions: Attendance should be mandatory and tracked. It was frustrating when we would have these incredible, high-profile speakers visit, and then only have a small number of students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: faculty panels were excellent, I really enjoyed being able to hear from all those people who have had meaningful  and impactful careers; course-long project was also really great, especially for us non-EMD people who aren't really given the opportunity to develop research proposals like that in our other courses.\r\n\r\nImprovements: changing the role of the student presenters- I think it was a better experience when they guided discussions instead of just presenting reading facts at the beginning of class (as we sometimes didn't have time to always discuss the questions the group posed) ",
            "\u00a0Kaveh approaches global health topics with a perspective that I felt was very valuable for us to get as students early in our careers in global health.  He helped us to think about ethical issues inherent in university research in low and middle income countries, and I feel like I am leaving the course with a greater depth of understanding of the complexity of work in global health. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing, one of the best 3 courses I have taken at Yale School of Public Health.\r\nReadings for the course were excellent and reflected weekly themes which followed and contributed to the bigger theme of the course. The professor clearly put a lot of effort and thought into planning this course which is why it was a very effective discussion on multiple aspects of academic research in global health setting, its responsibilities, challenges and the way in which it can be used for furthering the global health field and health worldwide.\r\n\r\nBest run panels from any class. \r\n\r\nThe capstone assignment for the course was a very useful exercise in ethical research project planning, and the poster session was a great way to understand and be exposed to other students' projects and areas of interest. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good class exploring various topics in global health.  Thoughtful discussions were held and you got out of it what you put into it. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: maintained common thread throughout a survey of material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: felt like there was too much different material - led to a feeling of being spread too thin. Would have liked to have been able to focus more on one main area each week, especially for the faculty panel portions ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was a great survey of different issues in global health as well as contemporary approaches for mitigating these issues. I really liked the course structure, which removed much of the pedagogy insofar that students presented every week and the class was truly run like a discussion instead of a lecture. The one weakness I see is that many student didn't show up on most days given that we were  held to an honor code, I think this is not good for a classroom setting where we are all supposed to be learning from each other's experiences. ",

            "\u00a0i wish i came out of it with tangible skills in tackling global health issues. we mostly just had guest lecturers. i wanted to have actual lessons taught by kaveh. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the class was good for exposing us to a lot of different professionals in the global health field. I feel like I learned about things that I never did before. I also appreciated how the work on the research proposal was done incrementally. However, it would have been nice to go into deeper dives with some of these topics instead of just skimming the surface. Perhaps every week, a small cohort of students can sign up to get lunch with the main speaker(s) after class if it's a topic they are particularly interested kind of like the Healthcare Colloquium? Also, I don't think many students felt very incentivized to go to class every time/felt bad for not going. Also, it may be good to alter the class so that it is not solely research based because not all students who are interested in global health want to approach it from a research lens (some may want to be more policy based) ",

            "\u00a0Kaveh has a tendency to want to talk over guest lecturers. If you invite them there please let them speak. If you want to talk about some subjects then stop having so many guest lectures. That was like 90% of the class. ",

I looked forward to his class every week which is not something I can say about literally any other class I took this semester.  Kaveh was an exceptional professor. ",

",
            "\u00a0The course was okay--I feel like I learned a lot about global health but I think if there can be explicit opportunities for more networking with the faculty that come that would be great. You will be challenged to think about things in different ways and you will gain a lot of knowledge. However, sometimes it was easy for the class to be an afterthought. I would recommend it to a student if they want to learn broadly about global health topics generally, but not for deep dives. ",
