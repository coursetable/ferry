            "\u00a0I learned about the stages of literacy and the role that play has in healthy  development. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about children development, and the importance of play in it. It has been mind-opening to expand my knowledge on how play is involved in developing a lot of crucial cognitive, language, and social skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to take meaningful field observations and synthesize them with academic materials to craft compelling writing. I learned how different teachers have different approaches to instructing young people, and overall, how crucial and meaningful these early stages of education are. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about all the ways that play is absolutely essential in a child's cognitive, social, and emotional development. I was able to strengthen my own knowledge about early education and child development through the classroom observations, which provided an invaluable practical space to apply theoretical concepts from our classes. ",
            "\u00a0I gained practice observing children in an early education setting and interpreting behaviors and vocalizations based on existing theories in childhood development. "

            "\u00a0I wish we could've discussed the reading more in-depth, most of the classes were guest speakers and I wish we could have had more time to discuss our reading and our observations with our classmates! ",
            "\u00a0The weekly observations are great! And listening to everyones project on their own child at the end is also a great part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the talks by different teachers and the weekly observations at Calvin Hill. The course could be improved by having periodic meetings in class between student observing the same class to discuss our journals. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strength of the course is the hands-on experience that it provides for us to observe and engage with children in the Calvin Hill day care centre. The discussions in lectures with Professor Horwitz and Close, together with the knowledge learnt from guest lecturers, were all very enriching and inspiring.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the course could increase time given for discussions and opportunities for us to observe classrooms of other levels in the day care centre. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Observations, engaging with the kids. Our class discussions (when we had actual class discussions). Variety of guest lecturers. \r\nWeaknesses: At the same time, the variety of guest lecturers could also be discombobulating and developing themes and consistency through the class was difficult. Certain guest lectures involved dozens and dozens of books that we passed around and skimmed, and while entertaining, they could be distracting from the main lesson, and we didn't critique or discuss them. Most classes did not include discussions that related to the material we'd read, and sometimes it just felt like we were repeating the material we read. I would love some updated literature on these subjects, and I don't think that a TYCO notebook should be required to be bought (too much $$). I would love more class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0As many other students have noted, I would emphasize how beneficial it would be to find time to observe in different classrooms, at different times of the day, and to meet up with the other students who were observing in the same classroom. I did find it incredibly helpful to visit Head Start and the Infant Classrooms, to see the wider range of early education besides the classroom we each observed in. "

            "\u00a0Definitely, a great class to understand better how young children learn and develop language and social skills. Not only good for psych majors, but honestly anyone that wants to be a parent one day should take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - it's wonderful, I learned a lot, and it has a manageable workload. Classes are so much fun and enlightening! ",
            "\u00a0I would- you get to observe at Calvin Hill which is pretty awesome! The kids and teachers are fantastic and you learn a lot by observing a pre-school classroom once a week! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely a good class to take before leaving Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course especially to students that enjoy learning more about children, and want to understand how play is important in it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you enjoy learning about kids. However, I would love to see some more of these changes implemented (though that's also my opinion). ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! You really can't go wrong with a class by Nancy and Carla. They are such wonderful professors and wonderful human beings who care SO much about the field, their students, and the children at Calvin Hill. You are guaranteed to learn a lot and your observations at Calvin Hill will be some of the most fascinating and most valuable hours of your week. The individual child assessment at the end is also really interesting and a lot of fun to prepare. "
