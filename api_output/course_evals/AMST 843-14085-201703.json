            "\u00a0this class made me view photography a bit differently by learning how to ask about all the different decisions that go into making a photo and the ways in which power and collaboration play out in those stagings. ",
            "\u00a0- Reevaluation of the history of photography\r\n- New perspective to better understand the medium of photography\r\n- Being able to talk about photography in an academic context "

            "\u00a0the course was very free-flowing, which allowed for good class discussion, especially since our group was so diverse yet small. i appreciated the various guest speakers throughout the course as it helped break up the monotony of the syllabus and also allowed for very insightful contributions. the weaknesses of the course have to do with the logistics of time and technology management. we often stayed late to look at the photo clusters. presentations also went a bit longer than anticipated sometimes. and we had a few hiccups with the logistics of putting up the clusters or viewing photos/videos/etc. ",
            "\u00a0- Course material was very interesting\r\n- Assignments were helpful to understand the goal of the class\r\n- Final discussion at Brown was very good and joined seminars with other schools should definitely be continued "

            "\u00a0yes! it was great to have an experimental class this semester. i feel like i learned a lot in very different ways and it made me bond with my classmates more. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students, because the way of understanding and working with the material was unique and different from pure text-focused classes. Furthermore, the discussions in class were really interesting and helpful. I definitely have the feeling my knowledge of photography and my skills to talk about have increased throughout the semester. "
