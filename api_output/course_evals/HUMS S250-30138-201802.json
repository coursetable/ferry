            "\u00a0- I learned how to navigate through an unknown place\r\n-  gained a ton of background info about rome (historically, politically, economically, socially, etc).\r\n- learned how to prioritize time ",
            "\u00a0This course builds upon all of the history we learned during the City of Rome course in the spring semester. We got to physically experience the sites where that history happened and is memorialized, which was very powerful and moving. The course emphasizes \"learning through place,\" which is a real skill that I felt I developed over the five weeks in Rome. It basically means learning how to read into the choices made in the architecture and planning of a space in order to determine facts like what time period it comes from, or concepts like its purpose and meaning. I found it most fascinating to make connections between things we had read during the spring semester and places and artworks we saw during the summer program, especially the references to the tales of Livy, where we began. Personally, this course was my first experience with completing a research project and academic paper, so that is a skill I now feel much more comfortable with as well. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to combine many methods of observation to understand the layered history of a place. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to understand a place, a city, through the material environment. I learnt how to read narratives of a place, historical and personal. I learnt how to learn on site, as opposed to sitting in a classroom, as a way to understand through reading spatial relationships, materials, texture, spolia, layout and more. I learnt that Rome is a city of layers--historical and semiological. "

            "\u00a0- strength = lectures and amount of information we were given; saw lots of really cool spaces; group dinners \r\n- weakness = some aspects of the housing weren't great (fans didn't work, keys didn't work sometimes, showers clogged a lot); some comments the professors made towards students were hurtful. ",
            "\u00a0The total immersion this course provides in Rome and its history is its greatest strength. The living situation, the on-site classes, and the group dinners all contribute to the lifestyle fo the course, which is intellectually stimulating. I found that our discussions would nearly always spill over into conversations outside of class between me and my classmates. I got the sense that the course was meticulously planned so we could get the most out of it. At times, it did feel like a lot of work was expected of us while we also tried to be mindful and reflective. There were many sites I would have loved to revisit more calmly and thoughtfully but didn't have time to because of a list of new sites we had to see that week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the on site classes and the out-of-classroom learning really facilitated our true and honest interaction with a place. "

            "\u00a0definitely, if the student is interested in rome / antiquity / humanities ",
            "\u00a0I would very highly recommend this course to another student! If you are interested in Rome as a legend, a history, or a modern city then this will be a fascinating course. Whether or not you are a humanities major, there are so many themes to connect to your life and contemporary environment, from politics to theology to engineering. Even besides the academics of the course, it is an unparalleled opportunity to live in a beautiful city and let yourself feel inspired by what you see and taste. It is physically and mentally a demanding course (but for two credits condensed into five weeks), but it will go by unbelievably fast. After everything we did, I still feel like there was more to see, but all I can do now is reflect on my experience and plan my next visit to Rome! ",
            "\u00a0It's very intense and all-consuming, but absolutely worth it. If you have any interest in Rome, or the classics, and you can take this course, absolutely do. ",
            "\u00a0It is an incredible intellectual and cultural experience! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was the best learning experience I have had. I learnt how to learn better--what it means to be always engaged. And Professor Jewiss is incredible. "
