            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about fundamentals of neuroimaging techniques. In addition to learning the \"why\" of these techniques, this class often focused on the \"how\" of these techniques. Although some of the fundamental math was challenging, the professors made sure to make the material engaging and understandable. Through the 1-page synopsis assignments, I learned to distill the main points of each lecture and draw upon previous lectures to make connections. Further, through the class presentations and paper assignments, I learned a great deal about how to read the existing literature. This is especially useful for those of us who would like to pursue a career in research and medicine. ",

            "\u00a0The strength is the discussion encouraged during our weekly meetings. Indeed, we learned a lot of technical details but we also learned how to discuss the implications (ethical, financial, etc) of neuroimaging techniques. The class was made up of a diverse set of students, so discussion would always be interesting and engaging. One weakness might be the fact that we only meet once per week for 2 hours, making it difficult to remember class material from past weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Gave a very good grounding in the topics. Seminars were better when kept shorter. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed my time in this class. The lectures, readings, and 1-page weekly synopsis assignments were manageable throughout the year. Make sure to start on the midterm and final paper early, as these assignments require a lot of literature review and editing. The class was always really enjoyable, as the lectures were often well-organized and discussion was always encouraged. ",
