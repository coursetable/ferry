            "\u00a0The Capstone is incredibly practical--I learned more data analytical, technical, and professional skills in this course than in any prior class at Yale and while, it was a heavy workload, feel proud of my accomplishments over the semester. Most useful, in terms of my future career, was the opportunity to travel to meet our client in Geneva, which allowed me to witness firsthand the inner workings of the global institutions where I hope to one day work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work efficiently and divide responsibilities in a medium-sized group, tackle a problem given a specific timeframe and scope, and tailor analyses to a client's request. I also learned how to make quality powerpoint presentations and improved my presenting skills. These are all very useful skills for someone who intends to work in consulting, but I think they also apply to any career that involves working in a team. ",
            "\u00a0The overarching lesson of the capstone program is one of team-based problem solving. You learn how to effectively tackle ambiguous projects of large scope in a larger than optimal group and how to effectively communicate findings to clients. This means acquired skills in planning, data analysis, interviewing, and generally conducting oneself in a professional manner to leaders in the field. In terms of Hecht's project in particular, his and Shan's background as consultants was an incredible benefit to the class's learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course this semester. A hands on project, it allowed me to develop translatable real world skills in a supportive and collaborative setting. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The problems of a group project are the extra difficulties in coordinating and ensuring that work is spread evenly. We were somewhat unsure at first of the direction we were meant to take the project and it felt self-directed at times, but I appreciate the way the group dynamic functioned. ",
            "\u00a0The team aspect of Capstone is both a strength and a weakness. As a group, we are able to do a lot more meaningful work for the client, and it's fun to share in the Capstone experience with others. However, dividing up work and managing responsibilities among eight Yalies is not easy. Learning to work effectively with a group is one of my main takeaways from this course. My group in particular developed a good dynamic, and we had an excellent teaching duo, which really made the semester enjoyable. In terms of the Capstone senior project model as a whole, I think it's a valuable experience, especially for those who intend to go into consulting or similar fields. However, it would also be nice to have the option of completing an individual Global Affairs thesis (perhaps in the spring) as the culmination of my four years at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The core strengths of the Global Fund project in particular was the access we had to leaders in the global health field and the support Shan and Hecht gave us in structuring our approach and pushing through our analysis. The lack of structure may seem like a weakness, but this is the name of the game in any consulting engagement, and once it is accepted as a problem to solve, it allowed for a pretty wonderful learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0The course was organized very well and guidance was given by professors when needed. The end of semester presentation was a wonderful way to cap a great experience. "

            "\u00a0I think the Capstone is a fantastic, unique element of the Global Affairs major and should be preserved. It allows students to gain practical skills and generate meaningful work that directly engages with issues of global importance (in a way that would not be accomplished by a thesis). Moreover, the group aspect, while challenging, is rewarding and a means of smoothing the transition from academia to the \"real world.\" I think this course was incredibly rewarding in terms of the skills I gained, and I would recommend it over a thesis. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a requirement for the Global major, but I would definitely recommend Professor Hecht's Capstone group. His connections in the global health field allow his students unique opportunities to explore some pretty cool problems and meet important stakeholders and researchers in the field. He and Shan offer valuable feedback on all Capstone work, which helped us put together a very comprehensive final presentation and report. I am proud of how much our Capstone team was able to accomplish under their guidance this semester. Plus, we got to go to Geneva to meet with our client and other global health organizations! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The learning experience provided by the Capstone project was unparalleled (and preferred over a thesis). This opportunity, thanks to our fantastic mentors, was a test in teamwork, information gathering and synthesis, insightful analysis, and the coherent,impactful presentation of recommendations. These skills will definitely serve me well going forward, and the Capstone project was an all-around great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This is the biggest selling point of the Global Affairs major. "
