            "\u00a0A vast knowledge of classical literature, an improvement in my reading speed and information retention, and ability to deduce what is and isn't absolutely necessary to read given the massive workload, a much keener eye for critical analysis and an improvement in my essay writing skill. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a solid understanding of epic literature and fundamental texts of western civilization. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Yeazell helped me develop strong close reading skills and an ability to think critically about the texts we were reading. She allowed me to see each work in a new light through her careful and thoughtful analyses. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the canonical works of the classical period and the relationship between these works. I improved my writing skills and sharpened my eye for literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge of how to write an essay close reading a poem and knowledge of ancient classics. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking Directed Studies Literature, I strengthened my reading, writing, and speaking skills. Reading-wise, given the large volume of works that students were expected to read in this course, I learned how to read faster and more efficiently through identifying and focusing on the important passages of each work, all while slowly perfecting the art of skimming. Writing-wise, given the amount of writing required of the Directed Studies Program (an essay nearly every week) and the caliber expected of each essay, I've found my academic writing skills to be improving simply because I've been practicing so much. Finally, I really did enjoy the seminar-format of this course and found that it exercised my ability to speak about the works that I've been reading, which is an important skill to have. ",
            "\u00a0More detailed and focused analysis of texts, throughlines from Greek literature to Medieval, making concise points about extremely unconcise topics, etc. ",
            "\u00a0DS Literature was an incredibly fruitful course that exposed me to a broad stretch of the western canon - from Homer to Dante. Professor Yeazell was able to transition us easily from period to period, and it was spectacular to see the era of pagan Greek and Roman gods and values transition into the Christian world view. Lectures gave useful insight into texts before we discussed them in section, enabling me to make connections and critically think about the texts within the context of their time and cultural period. ",
            "\u00a0Further developed my literary analysis skills, gained a basic knowledge of epic poetry and authors in this tradition. "

            "\u00a0Brilliant professor who I definitely learned a lot from. However, I found I often got lost in classroom discussions. Also, grading seemed needlessly hard. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is the inherent weakness of DS, that we go through too many works in too little time. However, all the works in first semester DS literature are so indispensable from the understanding of these classics as a whole that I am willing to sacrifice a little depth in order to gain a basic understanding of each of these fascinating works individually as well as their many interconnections. ",
            "\u00a0There was not enough focus on each book - too many are included in the course design and the classes were not very focused much of the time. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was its small seminar format. That is, I enjoyed being in a classroom and being able to discuss the course's readings with my professor and classmates. (My professors and classmates thoroughly challenged me to think of these works, some of which I have read prior to coming to Yale, in new ways!) The small class size made the discussions even more enjoyable, because it was easier to get to know my classmates, to hear more from each person, and to share my ideas in class. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course, however, is also one of its strengths: the speed at which we read and discuss works of literature. At times, the weekly readings for the Directed Studies Program (Historical and Political Thought, Literature, Philosophy) was extremely challenging to finish due to its length. One way that this can be improved is if the Directed Studies Program assigned summer reading that extends beyond the first week. Finally, with Directed Studies Literature in particular, I wish that there was even more guidance with writing essays. Professor Ruth Yeazell always gave great, detailed feedback on essays but I would loved for our seminars to have more discussions on writing essays. ",
            "\u00a0The class was great, and the discussions were VERY rigorous. Too much reading, however. ",
            "\u00a0I think one shortfall with the DS Literature curriculum is the lack of time to study each text in depth. Because of the huge breath of books we cover, we can't spend much time on each text, which is a shame! Nevertheless, I am very appreciate of how the syllabus has been designed to give us a really firm and strong introduction to ancient literature (at least this semester) which I believe will be a great foundation for me to build on in my future courses. ",
            "\u00a0The texts were my favorite part of the course; I enjoyed the breadth of material we covered and authors we read. I enjoyed the lectures because most of them was fascinating and a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nWhile the seminars were great and allowed for a lot of discussion, I feel like the quality and depth of discussion suffered because of how DS seminars are based on student participation.While I enjoyed talking about my thoughts on the books, I often felt I didn't gain much from the seminars.\r\n\r\nI would like professors to give more of their insights about the text. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brilliant survey course on the early epic-styled works such as Iliad, Aeneid and Divine Comedy. Many of the lectures are amazing, the professors are clearly passionate about their subject matter, which is reflected in their lectures, and I gained so much information, especially context, regarding the texts through listening to the lectures.\r\nWeaknesses: Too much assigned reading, most of the readings assigned are not discussed in class and are left forgotten until revision for exams. When there are sections of a text not assigned, I'm often lost as I skip forward to the next part. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Definitely. After taking Professor Yeazells literature seminar, I feel like I read differently. Im now cognizant of language and content that I never had an eye out for before. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend DS literature and Professor Yeazell! ",
            "\u00a0I would not necessarily recommend this course as part of the program, but if it existed separately it might be more appealing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thoroughly enjoyed taking the course and felt that I gained much out of it, both academically and personally, despite the learning curve that I faced initially. I would recommend this course to any student who is willingly to put in the time and effort to complete the readings and assignments, any student who has the enthusiasm to be in a seminar-style classroom, and any student who is ready for an intellectual challenge. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! DS is a rough ride, and the workload is definitely a lot more, but there is incredible fulfilment at the end of it. I have never been so intellectually challenged, and my worldview has pretty much been completely changed having taken this course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it. I enjoy how DS allows for connections to be drawn across texts in classes and that enriched my experience with literature. I felt that none of the books were covered in even close to sufficient depth, but that is inevitable with the breadth of material covered; it was a sacrifice I was personally willing to make. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you are looking for a set of survey courses on the Western tradition! It's a lot of work but if this is your area of interest, definitely go for it! Never took literature before and this was probably my favorite course last semester! The texts in Literature are all highly engaging, and often fun to read. "
