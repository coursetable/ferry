            "\u00a0We covered almost two centuries of South Asian history, starting from the origins of the East India Company in 1757 to Partition and Independence in 1947. We learnt a lot- from histories of Orientalist knowledge production in the late 18th century to conceptions of nationalism in the 21st. ",
            "\u00a0Foremost among the skills I learned during this course is analytical reading of primary and secondary sources. We read very interesting and memorable sources, focusing on both trials, like those of Warren Hasting, Bahadur Shah, and Gandhi, and on stories like Tagore's The Home and the World, Mayo's Mother India, and George Orwell's Burmese Days. I learned a lot about the manifestation of colonialism in both art and in politics and the cultural and intellectual debates surrounding the development of India under the British Raj. Truly, I learned too much to be so briefly mentioned as I done here but suffice it to say that detailed reading of diverse media including first-hand accounts, letters, movies, and books lent themselves to a deep knowledge of India over two centuries. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great survey of Indian history through the period of British colonialism viewed through various lens. In particular, the course places an emphasis on analyzing legal history, which is not too common in undergraduate courses. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course if youre interested in specific case studies, but leaves you a bit confused on the broad progress of Indian history in colonial times. ",
            "\u00a0Lots about the British rule of India and the making of a nation. ",
            "\u00a0I got a solid background in British colonial history as well as sharpened my ability to read and analyze primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Indias transition to independence and the patterns that have defined colonial and post colonial rule in South Asia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to discuss primary sources in a rigorous manner and about the history of colonization in India. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) The material was fascinating for this course. Overall it was well organized and helped to highlight several key issues related to the British Raj and its repercussions for Indian society past and present. (2) Professor De is an encyclopedia of knowledge on the history we discussed, and was very helpful in clarifying context for the lectures in class. (3) I appreciated the diverse approach to the class discussions, including splitting off into groups, watching video clips and listening to relevant speeches/interviews.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses/Improvements: (1) The course often dealt with very niche subjects that required a strong working knowledge of the historical context. While Metcalf was helpful, perhaps a summary sheet of the historical context for the week's readings and/or a lecture or two upfront to get a better sense of the background would have been helpful for both us and Professor De who often would deliver a rapid crash course on the background the day we were talking about that same subject. A solution could involve students presenting on the following week's readings. This way we have a sense not only of the historical backdrop to what we would read the subsequent week but also an idea of the key themes Professor De wanted us to keep in mind for the following week's discussions. (2) There was unfortunately little to no feedback that we received throughout the semester on our work, despite weekly reading entries, a film review and participation in class. This made it very challenging to feel like I was truly learning or progressing as a student, and left me guessing as to how to improve/maintain the quality of my weekly reading responses/writing approach. More consistent checkpoints where feedback is given and discussed would highly increase the value of this course. (3) The film review seemed a bit much to weigh on the grade. This should have been the response for one of the week's readings, and the 10% could have been replaced by a student presentation on the week's readings. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. De is incredibly knowledgeable on the topic and curates classes very well. He strikes the right balance between talking himself and letting the students discuss, and also ensures that our discussions are not in the air but are always geared towards understand particular themes or readings. The readings were fascinating and coming to class every week was always a highlight of my semester. That said, I think Prof. De could do more to give us feedback- although he does read every weekly reading response, he did not give us feedback on them or on the assignments, and its often wise to seek him out for verbal feedback instead. ",
            "\u00a0Intellectually rigorous and well taught.  More feedback would be good. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very valuable, especially in its visits to the British Art Gallery, and the Rare Book Reading Room. It was interesting and fun and provoked great interest in deep research and detailed understanding of themes and players. Glad of the challenge. \r\nThe course covered so much content that the time we spent in class was often insufficient to allow full discussion of ideas. Often, I would leave class feeling like I had been unable to contribute the ideas I had spent time reflecting on and wanted to speak about in class because of the speed with which we moved through the material. However, I would not decrease the content offered in the course, rather structure the conversation so as to allow for student participation while maximizing conversation motion. Certainly, there is competition among students to participate in seminars throughout Yale; this competition however, can be frustrating when it delays or prevents to full covering of material. \r\nSecondly, I think the course could be improved if greater feedback on performance was supplied, possibly in releasing grades for reflection responses, etc. ",
            "\u00a0A large part of what made this course so successful was its structure; although we followed a roughly chronological path, each week had its own theme, and the readings reflected it. I particularly enjoyed the fact that our readings drew from a wide array of sources; legal texts, academic writings, novels, letters, etc. The sources are very well selected, and give students great insight into the development of political debate in India through the colonial period.\r\n\r\nOne thing that could be improved with regard to the reading selections is that at times the legal texts felt long and tedious, but we were often encouraged to skim them, and they still provided a good background to the week's theme when assigned. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved if students were given more feedback. Professor De is very kind and extremely knowledgeable, but does not provide much support or comments on student work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the syllabus (excellent readings and well-structured to facilitate learning). Week by week the classes build on each other. The readings are fantastic primary sources that you likely would not encounter otherwise. The weaknesses are mostly in the organization (Professor De is not good at giving consistent feedback). ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting, but the feedback we received from professor de was minimal. ",
            "\u00a0The course is great in its discussions  the material Professor De chooses is wonderful, and people genuinely came to class prepared to discuss them. I thought its weakness was that I still feel that I didnt get a full historical overview of colonization and decolonization. It could have been helpful to review the history a bit more together in addition to reading Metcalf. "

            "\u00a0This class is an intensive course in Indian history and assumes a good amount of prior knowledge. The conversations weren't easy to enter into unless you had done the readings carefully and even then, they often required background knowledge (which was not covered in the primary source readings). Prof. De knows the material really well and guided the class through fairly detailed discussions. We didn't get any grades back before the end of the semester but he did give comments on final paper drafts, which was very helpful. The class is worth taking, but be prepared to shore up your background knowledge of the topic if you want to get the most out of the readings and discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is an excellent seminar and Prof. De has an incredible mind and will really make you think too. I leant so much! ",
            "\u00a0This is a serious and intellectually demanding history course. It is fulfilling and worth the time, even if you don't get lots of feedback throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think this course is an excellent if work-heavy class very rewarding in the amount and depth of knowledge gleaned from it. It sparks questions about technology, science, education, law, art, sexuality, class, race, thought, globalization, disease, health, trade, geography, rebellion, religion and communalism in the context of colonialism--there is really something interesting for every historical concentration here. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! India has an absolutely fascinating history, and understanding the social and political debates that have shaped the country throughout the past few centuries feels like essential knowledge to understand the 21st century as India becomes an increasingly powerful player on the world stage. Moreover, this class will lead you to better understand the inner workings of British colonial policy and its legacies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially to anyone interested in some kind of colonial history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But I really hope professor de gives more feedback in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if youre prepared to engage with the readings and dont really care about your grade because you wont hear about it until the end "
