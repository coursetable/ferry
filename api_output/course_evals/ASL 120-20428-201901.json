            "\u00a0Gained new grammatical and expressive skills, new vocab, new knowledge of Deaf culture and historical figures. My ASL has visibly improved from this time last year or even last semester, and I am confidently able to jump into conversation with Deaf people around me, though I'm far from fluent. I specifically have a stronger understanding of grammatical structures in ASL, which are really different from structures in English or any spoken language I've learned. ",

The activities and assignments were fun and inventive. I learned a lot and I felt excited about the progress I was making. Jessica is an incredible teacher and we're lucky to have her. ",
