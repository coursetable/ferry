            "\u00a0This course is okay. It was a little disappointing since I expected much more. There's a lot of experts that come in to speak, which provides students with an abundant source of information. However, lectures don't tie well with each other and seem very scattered. It's hard for students to know how to study. The assignments are also not very stimulating. This course wasn't really about epidemiology of cancer. It was more about different types of cancers. ",
            "\u00a0I like that the course incorporated lectures from various experts in the field. This kept class interesting and engaging. Very manageable workload with interesting assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Having guest lecturers that are experts in their field is a strength of the course, though it can be somewhat challenging to know how to study for the class since there are so many different lecturers/lecture styles. Having a midterm may be beneficial to get a clearer sense of study strategies before taking the final exam. The three class assignments were interesting and of an appropriate level, but I found that the instructions for the assignments were somewhat vague and open to interpretation. Having clearer instructions would improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0great ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of speakers who bring in various perspectives which is fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe weakness is that sometimes the topics can be a bit dry. Also, there's a lot of material and it is a little unclear how in depth the instructor wants us to go. It has a broad range of very biological to grand scheme of cancer epidemiology. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of cancer epi ",
            "\u00a0I think the weakness of this course is that it doesn't require students to think critically about the information provided. Much of the course is fact memorization along with simply presenting information in the form of an essay. It might be more valuable to have practical application of the course material, in the terms of writing hypothetical policy. The readings were interesting if cancer is something of the student's interest, but otherwise, there wasn't much in the course that would keep most students engaged. I would assume that most students probably came to class without doing the readings because it was easy to go through the course without readings. The information was interesting, but I think more could be done to get the students to apply their knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for an introduction to cancer epidemiology. It is lecture-based with guest speakers almost every week. It was interesting to learn about different cancers from experts in the field. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good overview of the different types of cancers however it is poor in its design. We had guest lecturers come in every week but there was no cohesiveness and this added up to a lot of studying for the final. Dr Cartmel's instructions are extremely vague and do not help in preparing for the final or the papers assigned during the class. The strength was the assignment on grey literature since it was very practical and fun to do. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a big picture of the cancer epidemiology in the US and in the world. It illustrates some underlying reasons for the fluctuation of the incidence rate and mortality rate. The introduction to each cancer site could be more organized. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent. it provided me with knowledge about the epidemiology of cancer, as well as knowledge about the specific pathology of cancer from a clinical standpoint. I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Good introduction to cancer epi. If you're an MD then likely overlap/refresher of stuff from medical school. Good guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0While the material presented was interesting, I expected a more thorough discussion of epidemiological methods used to study cancer at the population level. This was more of a \"topics in cancer epidemiology\" course, since we received a relatively brief and disconnected overview of many different types of cancers from many different perspectives. I believe the course would have much more value if there were more thorough discussion of methods and study design. We could then draw connections from how a certain method or design used for one cancer can or cannot be used for another. Clinical information such as tumor staging is less useful for public health scientists, and such clinical details seem outside of the scope of a \"cancer epidemiology\" course.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I think the final exam was an inappropriate evaluation for this course. Not only was the exam antithetical to what we had been told about it (\"no questions on specific clinical trials, mostly general concepts, etc.\"), but we had not had any other examinations in the course up to that point. As a result, the final exam felt entirely out of the blue, covered a huge variety in topics, and I came away feeling frustrated and like I had not prepared sufficiently (though I had been to nearly every class, paid attention, and reviewed my notes thoroughly in advance). I would consider replacing the exam with another paper or presentation, since, in my opinion, the exam did not benefit the student in any way. Perhaps proposing an epidemiologic study design would be a good final project. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly interesting material and very knowledgeable speakers and professor!  Great overview of major dilemmas facing cancer diagnoses and treatment. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Difficult to know what would be covered on the final.  In the future, it would be helpful if midterm assignments were similar to the final. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course very much. Very dynamic and covered a lot of interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0interesting, very disorganized ",
            "\u00a0The course has clear strengths in the amount of material it covers and who covers them. Experts in all forms of cancer from all over Yale come and and lecture alongside Dr. Cartmel to truly give students a comprehensive look at cancer in the U.S. and internationally, both currently and over time. I think the main weakness comes in the assignments we had to do, but only in how they were returned/graded. I think just the speed in which things were returned made it hard to know how you were doing in the class with good notice, and the grading scale was somewhat ambiguous. I think if Dr. Cartmel explained her grading system a bit more on day one and kept us up to date more on the process of grading, everything would be a lot better on this front. That being said, if things are kept the way they are now, everything would still operate smoothly. ",
            "\u00a0this is a very good course with a lot to learn. The instructor and guest speakers give fun classes with intuitive materials. I suggest to make the slides on canvas more organized. for example, order slides by lecture numbers and align the slides names with the syllabus. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Cartmel is clearly passionate about what she does, but I think the primary challenge of her course is that she has to communicate information that she is extremely interested in to a class full of students that may be taking the class purely for a credit. The lectures need some more engagement and animation besides mostly talking from lecture slides. There's so much cool information to be gotten from cancer epidemiology. The trick is communicating it in a way that exemplifies that, potentially inspiring students to join the field. ",

Her teaching would be a lot better if there was more organization and clarity in the assignments, and transparency of grading scale and thresholds. There is no way of knowing how well you are doing in the class based on a scale since this information is not revealed to students. Her lectures are nice, however, once again, there is too much breath of knowledge rather than depth. ",

            "\u00a0Average course. Not really what I was expecting, but good for if you want to know more about different types of cancers. Just don't expect it to get into epidemiology concepts. It's more of a general overview/introduction to cancers, treatment, and detection. ",

I would recommend the class to a student wanting to learn more about different cancers in a qualitative format. The course does not emphasize epidemiological methods for studying cancer. If students are more interested in methodology and working with cancer data, this may not be the right course for them. ",

However, anyone could read the papers provided in this class, and you don't necessarily need the class to get information about cancer epidemiology. In all honesty, if you are interested in cancer, I would recommend reading the literature on your own time, which is a bit of a contradiction to my first line. However, I think the joy of taking a class should be in the fact that it is taught by a professor with years of experience and expertise in the field. I think the professor, rather than the coursework should be inspiring to the students. If Professor Cartmel injected more of her life experience into the course, in a way that demonstrated how passionate she is about what she studies, the course could be so much more than what it is. As of now, the class is pretty standard, and doesn't stand out from your usual class that you would take for credit. ",

If you want to learn about different cancers, another way to do so is just read the lecture slides and network with professors who work in the cancer world. ",
