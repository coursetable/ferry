            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about different aspects of social movements, as well as gained detailed knowledge about the specific case studies we looked into. I learned how to analyze social movements, the dilemmas activists face when organizing movements (the naughty or nice dilemma, the identity dilemma, etc.) I have also gained insight on the workings of current movements as well as other movements which we have not discussed in class. Because of the large amount of reading and writing I did for this course, I improved my analysis skills, my reading skills in terms of skimming and summarizing, and writing skills in terms of how to articulate my thoughts in a more clear manner. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing social movements in the perspective of cultural sociology, and learned some theoretical framework like collective identity, narrative, framing as tools of examine certain campaign. Learned about some background knowledge about several social movements in the U.S., and developed the skills of writing essay and using theories to a broader context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of empirical cases of social movements and a number of terms and theoretical tools to analyze those movements. The reading and assignments, especially the feedback of assignments improved my skills in reading, arguing and writing. The course gave me a perspective to view social movements as a kind of social action, and to think about why people choose to or not to participate in movements. Also, it allows me to consider more about the protests happening in my home country, which is a good connection with the real world. ",
            "\u00a0First of all, I got to know many information about those social movements introduced in our classes. Its not only about movements themselves, but also the history and those relevant events of them. Secondly, I learnt methods to analyze a social movement. It is teachers narrative as well as the text book he recommended that provided us different aspects to view a social movement. More importantly, I learnt a boarder view to see a social event. For example, from the discussion in our class, I got used to take culture difference in to consideration. Finally, my reading and oral English both improved a lot during our classes, and my courage of speaking in public also increased. ",
            "\u00a0I acknowledged a deeper and broader understanding of modern social movements, feeling closer to American society and citizens' life. From Jasper text, I learned basic principles and concepts, while in other books, I looked carefully at every single movement. The cause, the process, the sustain and further influence should all be valued. Since social movements stand for typical American style or American values, I gained much knowledge about them in Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The social movements class introduced me to more scholarly study of social movements. The class demonstrates comprehensively, using case studies of famous social movements, how to use academic concepts to analyze a movement. The struggle o ver infrastructure and meaning really explains a lot about the differences I observed between feminists activists and their focuses. Also, I become more able to examine social movements like populism, which are always(perhaps not) condemned by the public and have a negative connotation, with a calmer and more objective perspective. The ability to maintain a neutral perspective allows me to escape from an activist's perspective and comment on the strengths and weaknesses of some social movements I am part of. The class also succeed in providing clear information and explanation on historical or contemporary contexts of the movements. ",
            "\u00a0Different perspectives to look at a movement. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a comprehensive overview of knowledge about various important social movements in the United States since the 1800s. I also learned various ways to analyze and compare social movements using themes/tools outlined in the Jasper textbook. \r\n\r\nI also learned the importance of narrowing down a presentation topic so that my group can excel at the few issues we aim to address. \r\n\r\nI also learned that I am able to write good essays under time pressure, which was not only good practice for the school year/life but also a nice confidence boost. ",
            "\u00a0how typical social movements in the US formed and developed.\r\nsome basic and crucial concepts in the process of evaluating social movements.\r\nhow various social movements have in common.\r\nthe skills of communicating in groups when studying sociology.\r\nthe skills of writing essays. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic knowledge of the entire series of social movements in the American history. I had a further understanding about democracy, freedom and equality.  Critical thinking skill was also trained for most of the ideas in the class were new to me, so I had to think of the things in a different even opposite way. There were a lot of reading material and assignments to be finished, so my English reading and writing ability improved a lot. We needed to search for some information about the topic discussed in class, so my ability to acquire necessary information was enhanced. "

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the selection of different sources for each week's case studies, which combined with theoretical knowledge about movements in general, gave me a deeper understanding of certain aspects of each movement. The weekly short essays gave me a chance to better organize my thoughts and gain a deeper understanding of the course materials we've learned each week. Because of the large class size, this course could not be a seminar, but consequently, this gave me more opportunity to meet and discuss with people from diverse backgrounds and different experiences through group discussions. In addition, the talks from local activists have really opened my eyes to the issues people and activists face in their real-life and for me, made the topic of social movements (including issues such as police brutality, institutional discrimination, and lack of living wage) real. I'm really thankful for the opportunity to listen to and meet activists.\r\nThe weaknesses of this course would be how lectures, although short and compact as they were, does not involve much participation from the students, and could sometimes make me drowsy. In addition, it was a bit difficult to get the many books to read for this course - I originally ordered from the Yale bookstore but turned to Borrow Direct and online pdfs when the books hadn't arrived in time. Nonetheless, the classes were enjoyable and successful in the task of introducing social movements to students and providing them with the tools to understand them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: there are more students in the course and so there were more insights in our group discussion. Also, the course combined teaching format like lecturing and playing videos with students' autonomous study, like group discussion and presentation, which is effective for learning.\r\n\r\nWeakness: the class hour is too long and sometimes made students feel sleepy. and the lecture can only provided some basic knowledge about the history, evolvement of certain movement, but a big picture of it. Sometimes I feel I can only grab some details or a vague figure of certain movement instead of having a deep understanding into its nature. So it seems students can learn the course themselves by reading and searching for some materials online. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: (1) the movies and guests' lecture are good ways to broaden our horizons, and help us know what happens in real social movements.\r\n(2) the feedback of the assignments is really helpful in improving our argument and writing.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) the lecture part, sometimes without very detailed slides, is a little complicating and hard for me to catch up with. I think some more key words and pictures can be added to slides to help students understand the lectures better.\r\n(2) The course, including the textbook \"Protest\", seems to concentrate more on detailed specific facts and lack some broader and more abstract theoretical perspectives. For example, I think it will be better to give an introduction to some theories on social movements' role in the society, or some reflective ideas of what it means that the movements' identities are more fragmented than before. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n(1) clear narrative: compared with the other course, our teachers lecture and PowerPoints were both very clear, which was really friendly for international students.\r\n(2) ample participation: we had a lot of opportunities to discuss our own perspective and ask questions in our class, making sure that everyone have a change to talk and listen to others opinion.\r\n(3) comprehensive materials: our teacher chose a lot of movies and historical documentaries for us, providing a deeper insight of the events.\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n(1)\tSuperficial discussion: sometimes our discussions were not so deep. For example, we were asked to search materials while discussing about One Job is Enough Campaign, instead of preparing the material in advance and discussing about their reliability or how to use them. Personally, I think the peer-revising of essays was the best one among all the groups works. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is properly placing steps for us to go into the world of social movements, instead of simply and directly going to a high level. I also love the style of it which Roger comprehended lecture, group activity, and guest presentation into a whole system, making the class not fixed to a certain mode. \r\nTo me, personally, I went through struggle reading one book per week, so difficult to accomplish. So I probably suggest to leave selected text instead of complete books for us to read. In addition, in the lecture section, since PowerPoint was always in a small number and hardly any words, I felt hard to understand and easily distracted for a few times. (Maybe because I am a foreign student) ",
            "\u00a0Although the number of students in the class is higher than I expected, the teacher really did a good job in allowing the student to discuss among themselves and set good guidelines to lead the discussions, ensuring that the discussions are efficient and productive. However, I think it will be even more productive if the amount of time spent on student discussions are longer since some parts of the timeline of the movements are not necessarily important to go through in class. Students can easily go through them by themselves and the information are easily accessible online. However, I do think that some parts that are main subjects of discussions need to be stressed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching style is great. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course could have been improved if the seating arrangement had been modified to be a U-shape so that all the students could see each other. \r\n\r\nThe strengths of this course included its structure/organization and its professor-TA combo. ",
            "\u00a0maybe could invite more social movements participants (although current is great). ",
            "\u00a0One of the most obvious strengths is the content was abundant. It covered almost all the important and typical social movements in the American history from civil rights movement to LGBTQ movements. The content brought me to think of democracy, freedom and social movement itself to a whole new level. I used to believe social movements were just like some peaceful marches, but it turned out to be a hard progress towards the minority's deserved but long lost rights. \r\nOne weakness maybe that the class only studied the movements in America. There were many international students in the class, it may be a better idea to study some cases in Europe and Asia. Besides, just because the class tried to cover all the important movements, it seldom went deep into any movement.  Thus the sociology course felt a little like history class to me for it just introduced the background, reasons and outcomes of the movements. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The material was incredibly engaging and eye-opening, and it definitely helped me learn how to view the world through a different lens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely, but only to students that are well suited to regularly reading large amounts of materials and writing analytical essays. This course was fun and engaging, but also relevant to my real life in a way that my other class wasn't. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe yes because comparing another course I took, the workload of the course is slightly smaller and the content of the course is easier. But in terms of my personal experience, I think the course is average and not well worth recommending since I'm not really interested in social movements. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe, because it provides students with a broad look at a specific aspect of sociology, and help those who are interested in social movements think about them more critically and sociologically. ",
            "\u00a0I will recommend this course for the students who study sociology in other counties, curious about sociology or social movements, and those who want to improve their English. First of all, the intellectual level of the class was medium, which was friendly for those international students. Meanwhile, the course provided a different view into social movements and social events. The narrative of the course was quite different from my own country, so I guess it was really cultural-based. Thus, it is good for sociology students all over the world. Last but not least, the course provided a lot of opportunity for discussion, which was a good opportunity for practicing English. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I think it is a fundamental and very important class to take, especially if someone chooses sociology. The process is gradual and easy to follow, kind to green hand learners. Professors are great; guests are also wonderful, for you would never have another chance to meet these social movement activists. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for a variety of reasons. First, for international students like me, it will be a great course to take since it introduces a lot of the movements that are so closely bounded to the history and society of the United States. To be able to understand and respect the way things are in the U.S., this course will be great to add more intellectual and factual knowledge. It also provides opportunities to discuss the movements with someone who is likely to be involved. Especially for someone from a region where information is largely manipulated by the govt. and social movements are rare, it is a brilliant class to be introduced to the mechanism and dynamics of movements in general. For other students, this class is also useful because it helps you to think more critically about the movements instead of only focusing on the surface. However, I think that students who come to the class with a \"black or white\" mindset, for example, someone believes that because anti-abortion movement is bad and refuses to listen to any neutral comments on some of the successful techniques it employed, will not benefit from taking it(taking the course will only cause more pain for them and for other people having discussions with them).\r\n\r\nGenerally, Social Movements is a brilliant course that introduces students to practical and intellectual knowledge while also balancing with seminar-form discussions that allows more individual opinions to be exchanged. ",
            "\u00a0No. Not because the course is not good. It is because, after learning the course, I found myself not into this kind of subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would! ",
            "\u00a0of course. this course provides vivid examples of social movements in the US, which gives me a deep insight of an uncommon social phenomenon in my country. "
