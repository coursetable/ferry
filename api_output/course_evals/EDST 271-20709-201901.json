            "\u00a0It's a mess lecture wise. There's so much potential and it's just kinda squandered. The class's analysis doesn't get deep enough, the work doesn't push any true grappling with the material, and class engagement is so low. This class would be better served as a seminar, reading academic papers/legal briefs and/or econometric analyses of issues in education policy. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, the class has the reputation of not being very challenging. The majority of students in the class were taking it for this reason and as such lectures were only attended by the small fraction of the class (10-20%) who were actually interested in the material. I think this class could be improved by turning it into a seminar and selecting only the students who genuinely want to be there. Ironically, the most rewarding class days were when attendance was particularly low, and Prof. Jaynes abandoned the lecture format and instead turned class into a seminar-like forum for discussing the material. On these days, discussions were engaging and participatory. I believe this class would better serve students with this structure, and it would also be able to avoid the \"gut\" label. ",
