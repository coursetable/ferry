            "\u00a0This is a really great and challenging class! I learned a lot about how to design strong molecular biology experiments and different experimental techniques, how to analyze data, and how to read a paper and not just understand its conclusions, but also be able to pinpoint its flaws. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think a weakness is that the first half of the course is very interactive, while the second half isn't. I liked the interactive nature of the first half and it definitely helped me learn more. Another weakness is I felt like the feedback on my reading responses didn't actually help me improve at all, and I actually got no feedback for the majority of the responses I submitted. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this to undergrads who have taken MB&B 301 and are prepared for a similar class that is equally challenging but with slightly more generous grading. This class requires a deceptive amount of effort which is hard to tell from the syllabus but you get a lot out of it, especially if you're considering a career in molecular biology research. "
