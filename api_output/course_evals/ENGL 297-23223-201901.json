            "\u00a0Phenomenally enlightening course on the complex intersectionality that black women poets embody today in America. And in general, a huge push to look at experimental poetry (and by extension, \"non-experimental\" poetry) in a new light. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to read work by Black American Woman Poets and to think about experimental poetics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about race, gender, and identity both as they relate to literature and in general. This class taught me an amazing amount about how to think critically and differently about issues. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to analyze poetry and think deeply about important, big concepts improved dramatically with this course. ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about contemporary black female poets!! Learned how to analyze poetry in a major way. ",
            "\u00a0A great exploration in to a fairly new and exciting field of experimental black poetry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read poetry critically and place things in context "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was really excellent but I found a lot of the poetry really hard to access; I wonder if there's a way to introduce each book more comprehensively before sending us off to read it? It's frustrating to read for several hours and not get much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0People seemed a little nervous at first to participate for fear of saying something wrong, but loosened up as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great; Maryam and Professor Rankine were a great team. ",
            "\u00a0This class only has strengths! It teaches students a completely new system of thinking, has really interesting material, and is engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The class was really successful with two professors leading it. The organization of the class made it easy to follow with a new poet or book of poetry to focus on each week. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the two professors, loved the material, loved everything tbh ",
            "\u00a0Very well structured. The balance of Professor Rankine with an equally brilliant Graduate student made for a fantastic course that was very honest. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the diversity of readings and discussion in class. Class could be improved by more feedback during the semester on how we are engaging with our reading in the reading responses. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",

            "\u00a0Yes definitely!! Take this class! It's fantastic and very student-focused, while still being extremely well-organized and planned for clarity and structure. I couldn't recommend it more!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in poetry. It is so important to study the poetry that people are producing right now and by centering on the work of only black women we were able to specify and focus our discussion. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! Professor Rankine is AMAZING and really cares about her students learning and is so brilliant. Maryam is also the GOAT. ",
