            "\u00a0A broad overview of optics ranging from reflection, interference, coherence, to near-field optics, starting from maxwell's equation. It helped familiarized myself with the breadth of this field and various terminologies/concepts with explanations of practical applications/experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basic optical concepts such as waveguide theory, polarization, diffraction, interference, etc. We also covered some modern optics applications. "

        [
            "\u00a0I liked how Prof. Cao focus on the key aspects relevant at hand (among the enormous amount of information spanning optics), giving us insight into what each equations told us very intuitively. She nicely found the balance between giving a broad, big picture of different topics and, at the same time, providing a reasonably in-depth explanation of the various concepts involved. There is still room for improvement however: for example, the topics on transmission involved too many equations that lacked sufficient explanations. Also, instead of talking briefly about several applications, focusing more on one or two could have helped understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of optics for those of us who have never taken an optics course before. Grading was a little confusing as the TA gave detailed notes, but there was limited feedback for the oral midterm/final presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like we mostly looked at pretty pictures and glossed over the actual physics.  I wish we'd have delved into a little more mathematical detail. "

            "\u00a0If you want to gain a broad understanding of optics, facilitated by intuitive explanations of key concepts with potential applications and experiments, I strongly recommend this course. Those who desire a more rigorous, mathematical approach may want to look elsewhere. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely if they're starting work in an optics lab. A good introduction. ",
            "\u00a0I would not.  I don't feel like I actually learned much. "
