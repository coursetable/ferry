            "\u00a0I learned a lot about strategic thinking and asking the right questions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad overview of political theory and historical analysis as it applies to strategic decision-making in the practice of diplomacy and foreign affairs. ",
            "\u00a0Generals, Princes, Social Change Leaders, and specific case studies ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater understanding of close reading texts, identifying the authors claims and evaluating them. ",
            "\u00a0General survey of grand strategy theorists at various moments in history; discussion on how to accomplish great things with limited ends in a world filled with obstacles. ",
            "\u00a0I improved by ability to contribute meaningfully to class discussions in a small group discussion format. I also improved my writing and argumentation skills. The excellent group of students raised the quality of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of political theory and history on Grand Strategy. I learned the topic is more abstract than I expected, but the course readings helped me understand at least how past writers and leaders have conceptualized the topic  and pursued great ends with limited means. I also got the chance to meet a lot of incredible scholars and leaders through the program's weekly Monday dinners. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths are the great power politics, Thucydides, and dinners. The activism and social feels forced and out of place. ",
            "\u00a0I think there was a good batch of students; I learned so much from each person. There are some weaknesses: the coursework often left me wondering what I should be learning or whether we would just gather together and take away what we wanted from each lesson. ",
            "\u00a0I think the first part of the course is a great overview of literature on strategy and it does a great job engaging with not just governmental strategies. My main frustration throughout the semester was with how uneven the workload was from week to week. With just 150 pages of readings one week and 400 the next, it was difficult to plan out time to do everything properly. I also think the class could (somewhat) benefit from a reduction in reading load because, especially later in the semester, we barely got to discussing some of the assigned texts. ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading list was far too much, particularly the Machiavelli readings.  It made it next to impossible to have any takeaways settle or resonate.  It was a task to get through the material and I often found myself just trying to get through it than be able to interpret it.  Given that, I particularly enjoyed the readings on Social Movements and the case studies at the end.  \r\nI also think sometimes, because of the heavy load, the class discussion was all over the place.  I don't think it's necessary to have \"one single takeaway\" every time, but sometimes I struggled with even the general concepts because we jumped around and covered so mcuh. ",
            "\u00a0The class is arranged very well. I am very impressed with the level of preparedness and the program's ability to bring in top notch scholars and practitioners. I am also very grateful for how involved the professors were with giving feedback and opening up their offices to us during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were clearer guidance on what it means to complete the assignments to a satisfactory level. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses:\r\n-a lot of reading, more than was necessary to grasp the understanding of the course or that could be covered in class\r\n-easy to get off-topic in class\r\n-Unclear expectations for assignments\r\n-Very large time commitment, especially in a five course schedule\r\nStrengths:\r\n-opportunity to engage with accomplished practitioners\r\n-opportunity to do fully funded research ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the various readings that we did; the selection of thinkers was really interesting and informative, and for me the readings were honestly the best part of the course. Discussions were also good, but I think (as is the case for most 2 hour seminars) they started to lag/drift by hour two. There isnt much to be done about that, but maybe a little more direction/structure in the second half of class would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus can be a bit disjointed and fractured at times. The seminar discussions are excellent--mostly because the students are very well selected. The instructors did an excellent job of introducing subject matter and framing the class discussions. I think the class merits more than two credits, as the numerous Monday night dinners are not a small time commitment. ",
            "\u00a0I really think the smaller GS class size was helpful this year. The group got to know one another and there was more accountability to finish the readings for each seminar. The weekly dinners were rewarding (particularly with the practitioners!)\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for improvement would be to incorporate our weekly reading responses more into class discussions (maybe as a kicking off point?) I'd love to talk more about the questions raised in the discussion section on Canvas. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are actually interested in Grand Strategy, international relations, great power politics etc. Though the professors have tried to make it accommodating to the activist types, I really think you should give this a pass if you don't want to talk about armies and power. If you do, then this course is fantastic, with lots of dinners and other events. Be warned that it is a fair amount of work and a much greater time commitment than most seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I would since it does make you question previous beliefs you had; it's also a great opportunity to look into the minds of some of the great leaders of the past. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to dedicate the time to attend every required dinner, do (most of) the readings, and truly think about the lessons in grand strategy preached by the authors in this course and how they apply to your life and goals, then you will get a lot out of this seminar. Having access to some incredible speakers with diverse perspectives and experiences is a huge plus. The class also becomes very close; I feel supported and encouraged by my classmates despite initially fearing GS would be an overly competitive environment before beginning the program. Finally, having access to three incredible instructors who guide the conversation but don't attempt to indoctrinate their students with certain viewpoints truly is the icing on the cake. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think the concept of grand strategy, the readings, and the speaking events were a huge factor in my development over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0100%. This course would be an amazing opportunity for any student interested in policy, social change, or coalition building to increase their knowledge and network. ",
            "\u00a0If you get into the class, take it. GS is a unique and incredible course at Yale. While many students are understandably skeptical of the concept of \"grand strategy,\" Professors Gage and Garsten do a wonderful job showing students the very real advantages and pitfalls of the strategy framework. If you fully immerse yourself in this class, it can fundamentally shape the way you understand politics, organizing, leadership, and your own life path. The readings are also incredible, and you'll get to explore important texts you may have already read through a new lens. ",
            "\u00a0-If you haven't read the texts, I would say so, but it felt like a repetition of classes I had taken previously\r\n-Very large time commitment, so must be really interested in course material ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its an amazing opportunity to meet a really great group of peopleboth the guest speakers and the other students. Ive really enjoyed getting to know my cohort, and am looking forward to part two. I will say that like most things, you get out of it what you put in. If you do the readings and are engaged during class, youll have a good experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommended. It's an excellent cohort of students and instructors. The practitioner guests are all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class IS NOT a leadership 101 course, and it won't give you a list of actions to be a great leader. BUT it will help you better understand how thinkers in the past have conceptualized leadership and achieved large ends with small means. It's also a great chance to study alongside a group of peers that is eager to affect chance and think critically about how  individuals make leadership decisions. "
