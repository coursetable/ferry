            "\u00a0This course delves deeply into several broad aspects of reproduction, from abortion to infertility to contraception, and examines them through sociological lenses, bringing in concepts like medicalization, social construction, and the \"culture vs. biology\" binary. It offered me many perspectives on different facets of production and was a good introduction to sociology for many of us who hadn't taken such a class before. I learned how to condense hundreds of pages of weekly readings into concise, 250-word reading responses, how to look for peer reviewed articles and present on such research, and how to challenge assumptions and facts that I had heard before (and some that I encountered for the first time that still merited a critical approach). I also learned what a sociological thesis statement is, what kinds of qualitative and quantitative research methods exist, and what to look for when reading studies and even books about reproduction. My reading and writing skills improved considerably because of this class, and I learned so much about reproduction itself; institutions of research, policy and medicine; and necessary context for the debates over reproductive justice that are happening in politics and society right now (and throughout history). ",
            "\u00a0This was my first sociology class, so it was great to gain a vocabulary and do a lot of readings I haven't done before. You learn how to summarize a lot of text, talk about sociological issues, conduct an interview. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about topics I had never thought very deeply about, despite how relevant they are! ",
            "\u00a0We took a deep dive into all things reproduction, from preconception health, to contraception and sterilization, to \"alternative families\" (with non heterosexual parents), to sperm and egg donation, and much much more. Some of the topics we explored include how our society constructs norms of biology and gender; how gestation, labor, and birth have become medicalized; how structural inequalities in race, class, gender, and education impact reproductive rights; how fathers' contributions to the health of embryo (via sperm health) have been virtually overlooked for centuries; and how modern-day strides in policy and law are challenging the hegemonic, heteronormative reproductive standards of our past. ",
            "\u00a0I found the course was particularly insightful at learning how to write concisely and effectively about topics. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first sociology course I'd taken, and it was so illuminating to think about the ways that the social world informs what we think of as \"biological.\" ",
            "\u00a0This was an awesome course covering many topics surrounding reproduction. I learned so much about sociology, specific topics, and my own thoughts and opinions. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Almeling was is so thoughtful and organized, it made every day of class interesting and productive. Readings were really interesting. Grading/Assignments made it so that I learned a TON without ever being stressed. Class atmosphere was also very positive. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course struck a great balance between outside work and energized, thoughtful in-class discussions. There was definitely a lot of reading, but after a few weeks the response memos were very manageable and I really appreciated knowing Prof. Almeling read each one and wove so many of them into the conversation each week (it didn't feel like we were being asked to do a ton of work that was never seen by anyone). The discussions each week were so fruitful and enjoyable, largely because Prof. Almeling asked thought-provoking questions that moved us along such that we covered a lot of ground and also got to dive deep into certain topics/readings without the conversation feeling boring. I also loved the assignments, because their flexibility allowed for a lot of freedom and at least for me emphasized the quality over the quantity of our work. I was especially glad we didn't have exams, because papers/projects allowed us to explore the nuance of topics and apply our course knowledge to them in a way that felt personal and valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Really great readings and discussion. Learned so much. I felt like it got kind of repetitive at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- interesting material, you'll definitely learn a lot, projects can be fun\r\nWeaknesses - some weeks I felt the readings were a bit too much. towards the later end of the semester, the readings became really manageable though ",
            "\u00a0This course really has no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weakness might be some of the readings could be improved upon. As in there are now better texts that could be included. But overall, a really interesting set of readings each week. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course is the care that Professor Almeling puts into choosing the readings and facilitating discussions. Class discussions were so positive and so interesting, and I always walked out feeling like I understood connections in the material on a different level. It was fairly reading-heavy and some weeks were less personally interesting than others, but there was always something new that I wanted to talk about. ",
            "\u00a0This course is phenomenal. While some of the readings are long, each reading increases your understanding of reproduction. Professor Almeling does a fantastic job of selecting readings that introduce multiple viewpoints and are from different disciplines. The class format also makes it so students can easily give feedback on readings they like or how the course can push ideas of reproduction further. I also enjoyed the emphasis on learning and being able to share ideas and thoughts openly in seminar. We had many interesting conversations and I really benefitted from this. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe shorter readings. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely loved it. The readings are so cool and discussions truly feel like a privilege to be there ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course comes from the class discussion facilitated by the professor. She really got us to dig deeper into the topics of discussion, sometimes asking very challenging but interesting questions. I also liked how she called on specific comments from our reading reflections to motivate all students to share their perspectives. The selection of readings was great as well, and my only wish is that this course had been a year-long course so we could cover some topics that we did not have a chance to cover and to engage in each topic further!

            "\u00a0Yes!!!!! I loved this class so much. The readings and discussions were so interesting. I learned so much about reproduction and also improved my writings skills. Not stressful in terms of grading but a lot of reading (I thought this was perfect, because the readings were great). ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely, unconditionally recommend this course to other students, regardless of their major. This course definitely skews female, but I think male perspectives would be really valuable too. Your critical reading and thinking skills will improve, as will your ability to write concisely  not to mention  your knowledge of reproductive justice, agency and related issues. This class really blends aspects of science/medicine and politics/policy, so if you're interested in one of those but don't have much background in the other, you can still get a lot out of it and also contribute a lot to the discussion! Don't be intimidated if you haven't taken a sociology class before  Prof. Almeling does mini lectures on topics that are really significant, and is excellent at facilitating discussions so that they are accessible to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - it was such a great learning environment with an emphasis on conversation over individual stress. The readings sometimes took a long time, but it's worth it to really put in the time. It's so nice to have 3 projects instead of a final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Almeling is just such a wonderful professor. She's great at helping us learn and facilitating discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Politics of Reproduction with Professor Almeling was absolutely amazing! Anyone with any bit of interest (medical, political, social justice, or otherwise) in reproduction should consider taking it. You learn so much more than you can imagine you will, and the diversity of academic interests in the students sitting around the table make for extremely engaging conversations. The 2-hour seminar each week isn't even enough time to get to all the amazing readings, which were themselves really interesting and fun to read. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course as you get to learn about a lot of different topics and issues. The readings can be challenging but remain intellectually stimulating. Furthermore, my peers also enriched my experience. ",
            "\u00a0After four years I may have found the perfect Yale seminar. Professor Almeling is an incredible professor (and even more importantly, an incredibly genuine and thoughtful person). The workload is so low there's no final paper or exam. Instead, over the course of the semester you write three three-page papers on topics of your choosing and give a short presentation. There are approximately 100 pages of reading each week (much of it sociology papers that are easily skimmed), which I always dreaded on principle but got very into after a few pages. The readings are so interesting, and Professor Almeling organized the syllabus by theme with so much care. There is a short weekly reading response, and she actually reads them and brings them up in class for people to talk about. The discussions were amazing, and she created a class environment where people were not afraid to ask questions or work out their ideas aloud. The class is the perfect example of low effort, extremely high reward. I truly recommend this class to anyone interested in the topic, it was absolutely one of the best courses I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Yes! If you have the chance, take it. Definitely one of my best classes at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Reproduction is so relevant, I think everyone should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Easily one of my favorite classes at Yale. I will carry the discussions with me for the rest of my life! ",
            "\u00a0STRONGLY RECOMMEND! This was my favorite course at Yale, and I was truly sad when the class ended. MORE MEN SHOULD TAKE THIS CLASS! Reproduction is often thought of as a \"female issue,\" which is exactly where many of the problems arise. But it takes two (or more!) to create a baby. "
