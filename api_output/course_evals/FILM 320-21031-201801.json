            "\u00a0In this class I developed a greater understanding of film structure and the formal elements within a film. Leading a discussion also helped me to better engage with my peers and develop presentation leading skills. ",
            "\u00a0Got exposed to a lot of significant films and directors in film studies. Loved the international and historical variety. Also liked learning about some key ideas in film theory (the uncanny, doubles, autonomous camera). ",
            "\u00a0Learnt how to analyse films ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use the elements of a film's form to draw conclusions about the film as a whole and about the larger industry. I also learned a lot about film from different countries and time periods. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the films in the course were varied enough to keep the discussion interesting and different even if I did not like the films. I think the presentations could have more clip analysis so that the class can engage with the visuals more instead of trying to recall them. I think some more structure to the discussion might help to improve the quality. ",
            "\u00a0Class time could be more structured. It was essential having the weekly student presentation linger for 2 hours, with very little engagement from other students most of the time. I didn't feel like I really understood what some of the film analysis terms meant. ",
            "\u00a0It was engaging to watch a film weekly ",
            "\u00a0More appropriate films and a clear understanding of why we are watching a given film. There needs to be clearer and more specific instructions when it comes to course assignments and expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the diversity in the syllabus - all the films were very different and highlighted different aspects of the genre. I also thought the assignments did a good job of making us think deeply about the films and be engaged with them. "

            "\u00a0While I took this course because it was required I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. That being said I don't think it is a course that people would enjoy who are not film majors since the films aren't the most exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was nice to get to spend time learning about interesting films/directors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was interesting ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another film major since it's a good deep dive into film analysis that would be helpful in later courses. "
