            "\u00a0Vincent and Nora were warm hosts for this special session. They offered clear insights into their unique work as corporate literati, and they shared a great deal of their personal insight into the importance of cultivating disciplines in the areas of spirituality, writing, business, and environment. \r\n\r\nI cannot commend enough the way that they lead by example and the warm way they invite others to learn from their leadership. I learn a great deal from their principles and their careful ways of looking at the world, and I am so grateful to have the chance to be able to get more direct contact with them and their work. I wish they could be here for a whole semester! "
