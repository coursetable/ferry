            "\u00a0I actually really loved this course. It taught me to think critically, although there was little to no theoretical papers which made me sad. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to properly read scientific papers and to obtain information efficiently. I learned to not just take conclusions at their face value and to spend some time interpreting the data myself to see if I agree. ",
            "\u00a0This course does an excellent job of exposing students to the realities of scientific research. By reading papers and critically discussing the merits and flaws of published work, it shows students the care and forethought that has to be put into experiments. The course surveys many different topics in Molecular Biology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to better critically evaluate published literature. ",
            "\u00a0This was the most useful course I will take in graduate school. I had little experience in critically evaluating full research papers before this class. Week by week, the instructors and my classmates walked through the papers, highlighting big picture ideas and important smaller details behind each work. Through this process I learned how to discern between well-planned research that answered questions definitively and weaker work that poorly addressed its goals. Overall, I am a better scientist for going through this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a paper effectively. ",
            "\u00a0How to critically evaluate primary literature in molecular biology research. How to convey and present ideas on the papers read as well as extending those beyond thinking about future experiments. Learned about the fundamental research completed that has led to the foundations of molecular biology as we know it today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read a scientific paper and extract important information and assumptions from it. I also learned how to think and develop experimental ideas based on existing research. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me valuable skills for reading scientific publications. I learned how to analyze publications in many different fields with a very critical eye, especially in terms of the logic of the course. I now feel very comfortable approaching scientific publications in biology. ",

            "\u00a0I would rather meet twice a week for 2 hours each and read two papers instead of three since we really only seemed to focus on 2 papers at a time. ",
            "\u00a0It was well planned and it was exactly what I thought it would be. A course where papers are discussed and the level of difficulty to engage is entirely dependent on how well the student prepared beforehand. Improved by alternating the pizza selection maybe? ",
            "\u00a0This course undoubtedly accomplishes what it hopes to do; it exposes students to real scientific discovery and makes them think critically. \r\n\r\nHowever, this course is incredibly in accessible to students who are new to Molecular Biology. Students who do not have experience in biochemical and biophysical research are at a severe disadvantage in this course because they are forced to read three papers, teach themselves new concepts of biology, and understand foreign techniques at a level high enough to be able to critique professional papers. This is nearly impossible to accomplish in just one week. Students who do not already have a biology background can't question the validity of experiments and the implications of results when they are not familiar with the basics of these concepts. Thus, these students can't participate in discussion the way the professors would like. This is especially frustrating when professors decide to randomly call on students for explanations, and even more so given that the course grade is largely participation-based. Students who are new to biochemistry are constantly playing catch-up and are not able to get the most out of this course. They certainly learn a great deal in this course, but it is in a sink-or-swim attitude rather than a development of deeper understanding. \r\n\r\nThis course would be far better suited for second semester after students have been through the entirety of Macro. Macro gives the foundation for biochemistry and biophysics which would allow students to entire Methods and Logic in second semester with prior knowledge. This way they would not be struggling to learn as many new things as they can but instead building on their existing knowledge and questioning what they read. \r\n\r\nIf this course stays in the first semester and the department continues to recruit new students from outside traditional biochemistry disciplines, professors should make a greater effort to help new students. This could take the form of assigning or distributing background reading and information. There needs to be more support for those students because they cannot be as successful as professors expect on their own without foundational knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall very good, but I felt that I learned by far the most doing the final project, which was also only the really way to get any real feedback about how I was doing/the level of my understanding. It might have been more helpful to have smaller versions of the project throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The overall planning of this course was great. The selected papers were diverse in their topics and modes of logic. \r\n\r\nI would like to make one suggestion meant to aid students without a strong background in biochemistry. Given that BQBS is trying to recruit students who majored in physics, math, computer science, chemistry, etc., it would be very helpful if a list of common biochemical techniques and phrases could be handed out at the beginning of the semester. For instance, I had no idea what was meant precisely by \"hybridization\", and no clue what an IP or co-IP was, among many other ideas. This greatly limited my ability to participate in certain parts of the discussion, because I lacked the relevant vocabulary. While I learned this technical language through discussion with my peers, it would have been nice to have an idea of what I could look up beforehand to increase my engagement with the class. You could frame this as a homework assignment, by giving out a list of words for students to look up if they had never heard of them, or if they wanted a refresher. I realize this list could take several class cycles to develop, but I contend that it is necessary if the BQBS track wants to fully engage students without strong biochemistry backgrounds. \r\n\r\nFinally, pizza on Thursdays was an absolute god-send. ",
            "\u00a0Given how famous and beloved this course is for upper-level students, I was expecting a better experience than the one I had. I think because of the massive size of the class, it was impossible to have a true \"discussion\" about the papers each week. It became an elaborate game of professors randomly calling on students to quiz their close reading comprehension skills rather than a discussion that included everybody as a way to really learn about the main topic each week. By the middle of the semester, it was evident that a handful of students dominated the discussions and it was hard to steer off of that from then on. ",
            "\u00a0The class size might have been to large for a discussion based class for everyone to participate equally. Maybe make the class size smaller even if there can only be one professor there for each section. \r\n\r\nI thought the length and amount of material covered each class period was enough to allow students to understand the material more in depth, but not too overwhelming. \r\n\r\nI thought the professor were very helpful in facilitating discussions that students were unable to think about as much during the meetings where only students were present.\r\n\r\nThe timing of the class was not the best for my schedule at least, since because of this class I had class until 8pm two nights a week. It was right in the middle of dinner time and even though I really appreciated the pizza, I think that the time of the class could be switched to better fit student's schedules. Preferably students could meet with professors during the afternoon or earlier. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty good the way it is and I wouldn't change anything. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it forces students to think critically about problems in biology and how one can set out to show test hypotheses logically. This is facilitated by student and instructor discussions about the papers. I think that is all done very well. The only weakness of this course is specific to this year. There were a lot of students in this year's course which made discussions difficult at times. Many students didn't get a chance to answer questions from the instructors due to some other students being more outspoken and answer quickly. If it's possible, I think it would be better of students were split up into smaller groups when discussing with instructors. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the discussions but having both tuesday and thursday sessions for the same papers felt repetitive. Thus I wonder if we could have done 1 paper (ungraded) as a primer for the thursday session (another 2 papers but graded). ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the professors and paper topics rotated each week. However I strongly believe that the course should have split into 2 groups for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is the fact that it relies on discussions. "

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0The class is actually kind of fun if you prepare well enough. It is good to partake in this kind of discussion as you gain the ability to think critically when reading different papers. ",
            "\u00a0This course is required for the BQBS track, but if I could make a recommendation to future students (and actually affect when they take it) I would STRONGLY discourage students from taking it in their first semester. However, it is only offered in the first semester so unless that changes there is nothing I can do. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I thought the course was well structured and develop skill that I hope will be quite helpful to me in my career as a graduate student, I'd recommend it to others. ",
            "\u00a0I am actually disappointed that most graduate students don't have the chance to take a course like this. I would recommend it highly to any student who expects to critically evaluate primary research on a daily basis. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if it were better organized to facilitate student discussion during the Thursday groups with a faculty leader, perhaps divided into 2 or 3 sections that were randomly assigned each week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think any student that is entering a PhD program or is wanting to conduct meaningful research should take this course or a course similar to it. I learned a lot about the field, how to conduct research, and how to read/write articles. ",
            "\u00a0The course is required for a reason: to learn to read a whole lot of papers and get basic knowledge of the field in terms of idea development of now commonly known facts ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is very valuable in learning how to read a paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I gained a lot of valuable experience critically analyzing scientific papers from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting to learn about fields and methods of thinking that we aren't used to. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course encourages discussion between peers. "
