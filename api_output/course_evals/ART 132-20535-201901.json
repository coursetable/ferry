            "\u00a0How to express graphic ideas in both abstract and concrete ways. How to think about text as a medium with which to create. How to analyze, discuss, and critique graphic works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to plan, design, and execute my idea. I learned that technique may not be the most important but instead, the idea is. I think I learned the most from my classmates whose ideas constantly surprised me and inspired me to reach for more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about design and general work in the arts. This was my first artistic/creative class and it took a little while to get used to the project and evaluation based methods, but once I got the hang of it, I really enjoyed it. I learned so much about design- principles, styles, techniques -but I also gained some technical skills in terms of creating physical art. I relearned cutting and gluing in a big way! ",
            "\u00a0I learned some of the history of graphic design. I also learned the process of designing by hand as opposed to a computer. There was a lot of work done by hand like cutting and copying that I wasn't expecting but I enjoyed. I also learned how to use InDesign and Photoshop during the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of graphic design concepts, language, and practice. ",
            "\u00a0I relearned a lot of principles of design, learned a lot of history of design, and now understand what it means to be a good designer. "

            "\u00a0Strength - breadth\r\nWeakness - confusing instructions ",
            "\u00a0Strength- the consistent projects ensure that you're keeping up with the work and understand the topics at play. Furthermore, the in-class evaluations of both your work and your peers' work definitely helped me understand how to improve/broaden the scope of my ideas.\r\n\r\nWeakness- constantly evaluating peers' work can be tiring, but if you were an active participant it was a lot of fun! ",
            "\u00a0I wish we learned more about techniques and less about the history of graphic designers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great intro class, great mix of practice by creating art (analog and computer) and discussions (how to critique works and readings). ",
            "\u00a0The beginning of the course was very analog-driven, and the end was very technology-driven, and I wish I had realized that I could have continued doing more analog-driven designs if I preferred. I think using the computer held me back quite  a bit. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. The ability to think and create graphically is indispensable. This course has given me so many new tools with which to design and to look at design. I plan on taking more graphic design courses next semester.\r\n\r\nJulian's class covers both analog and digital workflows which is even more useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course gives a good general overview into design. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend! Julian was great, and the work was so much fun. Even when it was a significant workload, it was never too intense that I couldn't listen to some music while working and enjoy myself. I made some new friends in this class, which was exciting as well. Such a fun class! For someone who's never taken a formal art class, this was such an exciting adventure! Definitely the highlight of my academic semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you want a formal introduction to graphic design! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was very refreshing for me to take an art class, and I think that at a liberal arts school, taking an art class is essential, and this one was especially accessible for people who aren't necessarily already trained in other areas of art. "
