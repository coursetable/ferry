            "\u00a0I have a deepened understanding of Ancient Greek and Roman culture and the transference of classical ideas into the age of Christianity. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an immense amount of knowledge about the interconnectedness of the great works of western literaturei.e., how different works incorporate aspects of older pieces. I had an inkling that this was the case but it wasn't until a couple weeks into the semester where I was able to read all of them and figure out the various allusions/appropriations. Moreover, I also gained a lot of insight on to how to craft an argumentative paper such that the argument develops in a nuanced and propulsive manner. Most importantly, however, was that I learned to read in a much closer manner than I was usually accustomed to. Now, when I read I understand that these are conscious decisions made by the writer and are therefore purposeful and significant in regards to the central messages. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about literary analysis in this class. I learned a number of ways to approach a text in order to glean as much meaning from it as possible. I also learned how to take risks in my interpretations of texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about writing papers, the purpose of art, and the development of literature in the Western canon. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading techniques; literary analysis; familiarity with a vast array of classical texts; writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course encouraged close reading of the texts assigned, synthesis of themes across the books in the syllabus, and analytical writing.  Professor Peirano challenges students to see beyond the obvious in the text and remains supportive of unique readings of the texts. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to perform close readings of literary texts in order to discover deeper than surface meanings and connections between works. I improved my paper writing and research abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the skill of being able to read a text closely and analyze it beyond the surface. Literature has a wealth of commentary that reveals a lot of what the authors thought and how they saw their world. "

            "\u00a0Like any DS class, it is helpful that we read works chronologically. Also, for literature more than the other courses, well generally spend 2-4 classes on a work rather than one. The slower pacing is necessary for these longer works. \r\n\r\nA weakness, which could just be the Professor, is not mapping any themes within a single work or across a work. We focused primarily on close reading, and I found myself missing the big picture quite often. ",
            "\u00a0Though there was a lot of reading, I thought it was structured in a fantastic way: it was slightly chronological and allowed us to see the influences of each work on the next subsequent batch of books. I really don't have anything else to say: it was challenging but doable and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0In general I thought this class was good. I really dont understand why we spend as much time as we do on the Bible. I understand that it is a foundational text in the western literary tradition, but I really dont see any reason to spend as much time as we did with it. Pauls letter to the Romans in particular was an interesting read, but it didnt have much purely literary value on its own, and I didnt really see it show up in any of the other texts we read. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Peirano's knowledge of the classics was wonderful to behold, and really enriched that part of the curriculum.  I felt that Prof. Peirano sometimes lost track of class discussions.  Also, feedback was sporadic and could be unclear/disorganized.  However, I learned a lot and really enjoyed studying under her. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus has some works that probably should not be there, namely Aristophanes and Sappho.  The Wilson translation of the Odyssey is not that great.  I am surprised that Oedipus is not on the syllabus.\r\nIt would be better if the students had to read more and if sections gave a broader overview of the work instead of focusing on specific parts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Selection of texts, discussion format\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were hit-and-miss ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the class discussions which always left me with a greater understanding of the book, Professor Peirano's helpful feedback on our essays, and the ability to engage with some of the greatest texts of the Western Cannon. The weaknesses of the course include the speed with which we covered the books and the workload. However, with good time management, the work load is doable. ",
            "\u00a0The course seemed rushed at certain points due to the volume of the material that must be covered over the semester, but this is an issue with many Directed Studies classes. It is this volume that is also a strength, as it can serve as a survey course to discover interests in certain works and expose students to some of the best of the Western Canon. \r\n\r\nThe Emily Wilson version of the Odyssey seemed to be too simplistic compared to other translations, and seemed incongruous with the rest of the works we read. ",
            "\u00a0I wished that the course didn't move so fast through the texts. I was especially disappointed when the class didn't spend more time on the Oxford Annotated Bible. The text is by far the largest work from the first semester, but the class only spent time on a few books from the Old and New Testaments. "

            "\u00a0I would, but with the caveat that they must have a deep interest in literature: there is a lot of reading and the professor expects you to not only do it but to have nuanced and thoughtful insights regarding the work. For an introductory class, however, there is nothing better: you learn a lot about the works, how to read subsequent books, and it instills in you an unquenchable thirst to read even more (surprisingly, it's true). ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. Almost all of the works we read were interesting, and though the volume of epic poetry could get beyond exhausting from time to time, it felt like there was a world of analysis to be done and that was interesting. Besides it really was interesting to see the intertextual connections emerging. ",
            "\u00a0I think these works ought to be read by everyone, but not everyone needs to do so.  I would only recommend it to potential majors in Humanities as part of the broader DS curriculum.  I would probably recommend DS to a potential English major, if only because of the importance of seeing the Western canon play out. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this course -- it was a pleasure to read the texts, discuss the works, and write the papers. It also grants a foundational understanding of Western literature which adds to the joys of reading modern works. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved the class discussions and the opportunity to read all these books. I would, however, warn them of the workload, but the curious and the brave will have no problems with the course. ",
            "\u00a0If the student has a vested interest in the subject matter, I would recommend both this class and directed studies. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to a student who has had some background in the fundamental works of Western literature and is passionate enough about the subject to pursue it as an actual course. "
