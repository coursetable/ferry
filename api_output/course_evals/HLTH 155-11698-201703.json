            "\u00a0I wish this course was spread into year of teaching. I feel that there was more to learn but not enough time. \r\n\r\nStrengths - this class has been one of my toughest, yet exciting classes. I felt so challenged but so rewarding when i would understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0On the whole, a great course! \r\n\r\nIn terms of improvement, give more time for the quizzes and midterm please. Half the battle was a time crunch, not a test of what we really knew. ",
            "\u00a0We learned so much relevant and interesting material, and I enjoyed every moment of it. I would just suggest that quizzes and the midterm be made a bit shorter. When taking them, even going as quickly as I could,  I often found myself scraping for time. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught extremely well. Professor Belperron has the level of the material tuned really well to make it still challenging and interesting, but also accessible to people who aren't majoring in stem. The classes were always interesting. I only have two problems. First, that she covers like 20 extra diseases over the course of maybe 20 minutes spread through one or two lectures and it's waaaaaay too many for students to remember all of them. Some of them can definitely be cut out so she can focus more on ones that are actually important. Second, the quizzes are way too many questions in too little time. It's not even that they're too hard, just that students need more time to complete them. The midterm especially is way too long. It's essentially impossible to finish. It feels like she takes pride in them being so difficulty, and that's honestly really annoying and feels counterproductive. If the point of an assessment is to show that I understand the material then I should have enough time to really show that. ",
            "\u00a0This class is interesting but the workload is incredibly high towards the end of the semester, with a group presentation, discussion panel, quiz, and final paper all due within two weeks.  It seemed like a huge workload for one course. ",
            "\u00a0The class is detailed and in-depth. It was challenging but manageable. All material was explained well. The tests were fair material wise but I would have liked ten more minutes for each one. ",
            "\u00a0Biol 106 was a great class. Strengths: not too much daily homework (readings that are interesting but not discussed in class), small class that is conducted like a lecture where you can (and are expected to ask questions). Professor Belperron is always willing to answer questions outside of class and in office hours. Scientific material is presented in a way that is understandable to non-majors but doesn't feel too \"dumbed down.\" Exams require thought and not too much rote memorization. They are tricky, but graded very forgivingly. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course for the density of the material. Sometimes, lectures didn't match up with the readings, so that was one weakness. I also felt that sometimes the quizzes were a bit too difficult in material--she wanted us to understand larger themes and concepts, and it was hard to do this when I felt like I didn't have a great grasp of some of the more general themes of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class went at a good pace and I was able to understand all of the material. I felt that the second half of the course was rushed and I did not understand as much. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in public health, take this. It is a lot, very challenging, but so worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but know that it is definitely not a science gut. As a non-STEM person, it was difficult but very doable. You'll have to work hard, but you'll learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredibly fulfilling. If you take it seriously you will learn so much. The week to week workload is incredibly low. A lot of the reading isn't really necessary, and the questions are pretty easy to write. The classes are always interesting. Professor Belperron is incredibly engaging, and fantastic at answering questions and explaining things. My only problem with the course is the quizzes/midterm, which are incredibly difficult. If you don't immediately know the answers to every question it's almost impossible for you to finish in time. The midterm especially is a nightmare. If it was half as long it would more feasible in the time given, but as is it's pretty awful. The paper, on the other hand, is actually pretty fun to do. You get to choose the topic and it can definitely be cool to do all the research and give your presentation on it. Despite the quizzes, I would definitely recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't recommend this course to anyone who was looking for a low workload science credit, as it stacks up towards the end and the tests are time-pushed and difficult to do well on. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in a science credit where you go ind-depth and learn lots of material then I would recommend it. Ive found knowing more about immunology and disease prevention in general has helped me to understand global health and general goings on in the medical world much better. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A great science credit for non-majors. Not a gut (you definitely have to think about the material) but not too much daily work and is very interesting for anyone interested in public health and social/policy issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's definitely not a science gut, though. ",
            "\u00a0Good bio class for non-majors "
