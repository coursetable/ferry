            "\u00a0This is a must take course and has been the pinnacle of my Yale career. I have gained so much in terms of how to analyze what a life worth living looks like and how I can live that out practically. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches you to not only look into other people's traditions and beliefs, but also into your own. The class will teach you to open up to your own biases, and learn about other people's ways of life and their vision of a good life. Every single paper is philosophically and psychologically challenging, as it makes you deal with your personal biases and your belonging in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much broader understanding of different religious traditions and a vocabulary to discuss these traditions. I felt the course helped me clarify my own beliefs through the process of studying other traditions. ",
            "\u00a0It was really a blessing to get to spend so much time diving into other intellectual and religious traditions, but I was totally surprised by how much this course pushed me to engage deeply with my own tradition (especially given that its taught by a Christian pastor!).\r\n\r\nIm still not 100% sure that I buy the core framework they present for how to evaluate a traditions approach to the good life, but, for the purposes of this class, I thought it was compelling. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It provides you with a framework and the language necessary to evaluate the most important questions of life. LWL doesnt provide answers, but it forces you to confront your own beliefs in a critical way. In general, the course is an overview of major religious and philosophical traditions that address the question of what does it mean to live a life worth living. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a framework through which I can understand various traditions' notion of the flourishing life and learned to articulate my own vision of a life worth living. I also learned how to synthesize and integrate different texts in shaping an argument. ",
            "\u00a0This class is basically a good religious studies class (that takes each religion as valid truth claims) and it also asks you to personally evaluate yourself in relationship to these major religions. For someone who was not raised religious but is considering converting to Christianity, I really enjoyed this class and having a pastor as a professor. It was also a good space for me to talk about what I want to do with my life, and that is a unique space to have at Yale. Furthermore, I gained lots of friends in this class, and our class even has a groupme, which I am very thankful for. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures may be the biggest weakness of the class. In this semester, two lectures were cancelled and one other had the guest lecturer arrive very late. I think guest lecturers are also a hit-and-miss. Some lecturers were amazing, with highlights being the Christian and Buddhist lecturers, while some were underwhelming. I think there needs to be more effort put into finding the most suitable lecturers for this class. Also, the interview format is not always the best. I think having the lecturer give a talk would be the best move forward. The retreat was nice but perhaps could be longer. Maybe a full weekend retreat at the start of the year would be best. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thoughtfully planned and the instructors did an incredible job creating mutual vocabulary to discuss and compare different traditions. They did a really good job making the material very relevant and personal by bringing in a speaker each week. The course covered a lot of material which at times only allowed us to discuss a very small part of the tradition. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This is just an excellent course. Its hard to put my finger on why it pedagogically works so well, but it just does, which is why Im kind of reluctant to suggest any changes that could disrupt the balance of how everything comes together. The obvious stuff retreat, Matt, generally intimate feeling of the seminar, practitioners, dinner, concept  is all great, but I think that goes without saying.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have cut scientific naturalism from the syllabus. There was so much that we just never got the chance to dive into for lack of time in other units, and I dont know that I gained anything from those readings or very much from that discussion. I also dont really believe that its a cohesive enough tradition to present us with any kind of vision of the life worth living (and I have my own personal vendetta against Sagan  I think hes just sorta bad). Also, I felt totally lucky to get placed in Matts section, but, if its at all logistically possible, giving folks the option to rank timeslots or something after were accepted would have made scheduling for the rest of my classes a lot easier.\r\n\r\nMy main gripe  and I dont know if theres anything to be done about this  is the application process. I get that there arent enough slots to accommodate everyone who wants to take the class and that we want folks who are really ready to engage with it, but I think one of the biggest obstacles that Yale creates to leading a good life is the propagation of the idea that everything worth doing has to be exclusive, which forces every single thing here to be selective so that it seems cool. LWL is amazing  and would be amazing regardless of whether it was selective or not  but it should be breaking down those elitist, forcibly-competitive barriers, not helping build them up. ",
            "\u00a0The size of the course is important. The core of this class could not be taught in a lecture, but the weekly lecture with a representative from each tradition were eye-opening. The faculty do a great job of introducing you students to different traditions, distilling out the major themes and truth claims, without pretending that its possible to understand an entire religion in one week. My favorite part of the course is the necessary level of personal engagement and course assignments encourage you to look at a tradition in the context of your own life. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is in the breadth of its curriculum, the diversity of its students, and the sense of community that the course fosters. A potential weakness is that I always felt like we were rushing through learning about any particular tradition before moving on to the next one. Though the guest lectures were interesting, I do think it would be nice in the future to have instructors from different faith and spiritual backgrounds, not just a Christian one. Finally, I felt that though we talked a lot about what a life worth living is for us, we didnt discuss much about what we should do to achieve this life. ",
            "\u00a0The religious makeup of the class is interesting but it is very Protestant/Agnostic/Formerly Religious heavily. Additionally, the racial makeup of the class is heavily white people and East Asians, so I think the professors and program could work on outreach to minority groups. However, overall the class does what it says it will do, which is help you articulate a vision of a life worth living. While most people want to have a huge spiritual awakening, but I think for most of my classmates it was helpful to articulate their version of a life worth living, even if it was essentially the prayer of St. Francis. ",
            "\u00a0While the academic, theological, and philosophical aspects of readings in this course have been rewarding, they can sometimes be difficult for students with less humanities experience / background. It'd be nice to always discuss applications of the text in daily life that everyone can identify and contribute to "

            "\u00a0YES. TAKE THIS. WITH MATT CROASMUN. ",
            "\u00a0Life worth living is definitely a great class and particularly Matt's section was a joy to be in for a semester, so I would definitely recommend taking the class. I would however say that since the course can only spend one week on each of the traditions covered, it simply cannot do justice to each of them and the course ends up feeling at times like an introductory religion and philosophy survey course rather than a cohesive course on \"life worth living.\" As a whole, however, I think the class was rewarding and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting/unorthodox course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is the best course I've ever taken at Yale, and many people I know who took this course would agree. It is a totally unique course not found anywhere else, and totally different from Psych and the Good Life or Positive Psychology classes. This class can be very personal, and can easily change how you view other traditions as well as your own. Lives have been changed throughout this class. A must-take for seniors who think deeply about how they want to lead their lives after college. I don't recommend underclassmen to take this class, as you will not learn much from it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think every student would learn a lot from this course and felt the course was uniquely relevant. The questions we asked in class need to be discussed, but often are not. The course encouraged me to reflect deeply on my own beliefs. I also really enjoyed the readings and class discussions. The course did a great job creating a very open, friendly environment and I looked forward to class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dont expect that this course will give you answers to the questions it asks, but itll certainly give you the tools to grapple with them. Just take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes Yes Yes Yes.....Yes. This is the quintessential Yale class and somehow it continues to beat expectations every year. The purpose of the class is straightforward: trying to understand what makes a life worthwhile. You seek to answer this question through the exploration of different religious and philosophical tradition. Do not take this course if you are not willing to be vulnerable and put in the effort to think deeply about your own life. The beauty of this course is it doesnt provide you with any answers, but it helps you better ask the question. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I wish this course were mandatory for all students at Yale, and a great class to take senior year. Though we may all be deep thinkers, it is helpful to learn how to articulate and explain your own values and goals in a way that others can easily understand. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class! I applied on a whim because I had been thinking about the existence of God. This wasn't the class to debate the aristotelian argument for the existence of at least one Unmoved mover, but this was the class to be totally awed by my classmate's own conversion stories and religious experiences. We also have retreat, where we do short bios, and theres a lot in this class very carefully designed to facilitate student bonding. It's very well thought out and I'm very glad that I took it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! "
