            "\u00a0Strengths: Great introductory course. Work-load was manageable and classes were engaging.\r\nCons: More in-class activities (handouts, group work, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0More opportunity to get one on one meetings with the professors and more opportunity to get a more help with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that this class furthers my critical thinking skills, however this course is very challenging. What balances that out is that there are many opportunities to get tutors, go to office hours, as well as meet with professors. John Hall does an amazing job of making sure each student feels as though they have the proper help they needed. ",
            "\u00a0I don't like math, nor am I good at it, but I felt that I was as engaged in the class as I personally could have been, and the structure of the class facilitated my learning experience. However, I do not think the weekly workshops should be mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0Well taught, fair tests and good review. The daily quizzes were annoying at times though, I'd rather just have those as practice problems in class ",
            "\u00a0weakness - had troubles understanding some of the theories as they seemed overcomplicated but got a firm grip once we started doing questions ",
            "\u00a0This course has a good sense of support between students and ULA's as well as professors. I would like to examine some materials more closely. For example, we spend lots of time on the pure methodology for solving/deriving, but we breeze through the application problems, which are often more difficult to fully understand. ",
            "\u00a0With the help of ULA office hours and professors, they provide a really strong support system and help you do well. The short quizzes every class period helped you gauge how you were doing. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class come from the professor and some of the ULAs. They were very passionate about making sure people understood the course material and passed the class. I could change the quizzes at the beginning of class because I feel like they don't much in terms of reviewing the previous classes materials and just stress people out. I would also change how the course ends with 2D and 3D density problems because it's something very difficult and needs to have more in-class time dedicated to it. Also, making it easier for people to see what their current grade in the course is, as opposed to just problem set average, would be a great help. "
