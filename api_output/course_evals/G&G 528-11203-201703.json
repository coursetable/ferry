So this class gives me a chance to go through some classic examples involving different math techniques. I feel like that I have a better sense of how to tackle the complex question in a mathematical way. ",

            "\u00a0Strength is that it covers a lot of topics and it is good to broaden my vision. Also, I like Jun's lecture style- deriving almost everything from scratch in a very rigorous way.\r\nThe weakness is that because it covers a lot of topics, time spent on each topic is limited. Also, as the students come from various backgrounds, the topics are chosen so that they are general enough. Being general is at the cost of being specific. Say, Jun talked about the Monte Carlo method. I was pretty interested about it because I want to learn something about the uncertainty estimation by Monte Carlo method. But maybe this is not general enough so that it is not covered? I do not know. ",
