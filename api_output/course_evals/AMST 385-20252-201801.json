            "\u00a0I developed a comprehensive understanding of the ways that trauma and culture interact, grounded in mostly theoretical, academic literature, which is supplemented with the viewing of various TV and film in order to apply the theoretical concepts to actual media/events. Furthermore, the final research paper allowed me to do in-depth research into a historical event combining both the theoretical and historical aspects of the event as filtered through the TV series I chose. It also gave me the freedom to do extensive work on a topic that interests me greatly, which seemed to be the case for all the students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the nuances and definitions of trauma and culture and how they intertwine to influence the media that we consume. ",
            "\u00a0I learned trauma theories, culture studies theories, and a great deal about the American psyche more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a fascinating look into concepts of trauma and culture, helping me develop a language to discuss these as they apply to pop culture. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general understanding of trauma theory, and had a chance to discuss the repercussions of such understandings on media representations of trauma and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0This course explored various theories of trauma. The assignments required students to utilize aspects of assigned scholarly journals in creating their own definitions of trauma. In many ways, the course utilized these concepts in analyzing popular television shows and movies. Thus, the course also strengthened my ability to read films as primary texts. ",
            "\u00a0An interdisciplinary analysis into trauma and its relationship with culture, this course was very insightful in providing me with the language to inquire, explain, and cognize trauma and its impact on society. Through the use of film and TV series, we could see the theories in our readings play out through simulacra, which was both a fun and instructive process. It was particularly exciting, personally, to see my various interests intersect in this course: psychology, philosophy, film studies. "

            "\u00a0I really liked the final paper presentations because it allowed everyone to workshop and respond to each other's ideas in a group setting, which was very helpful in guiding my own research and writing because everyone had such valuable and particular perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly felt the course had no weaknesses. Dean Muller assigned great readings and did an excellent job at guiding class discussions. I thought that the essays were great exercises for digesting the class material, and I really enjoyed hearing about other people's final papers through the class presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent variety of topics, excellent variety in the various types of readings (videos, films, articles etc)\r\nWeaknesses: Structure of the course was slightly disorienting due to change from trauma to culture and back to trauma as main focus.\r\nSuggestions: Possible course restructuring to allow better transition between topics. ",
            "\u00a0Felt a bit repetitive but very enjoyable discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I think the best parts of the class were the discussion with the groupI thought the class had a lot of great people in it and prof. Muller always had something to steer the conversation as well. I would say a weakness is that we didnt always get to discuss what we most wanted to because we spent a lot of time discussing the readings rather than the film and TV that we were analyzing. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was very interesting - its central premise was nuanced, as it focused specifically on trauma as it is embodied in film and television. The seminar discussions were definitely a strength, as they allowed students to explore their own theories of collective trauma. The course utilized The Walking Dead as its primary text - analyzing this show was a strength, although I often felt we could have spent more time working with this text. In general, the course could benefit from a more transparent grading system. Although I was very confident with my work throughout the semester, my final assignment grade for this course felt like an outlier. I was surprised to find that my overall course grade dropped significantly after classes had ended, which I was caught off-guard by. In the future, the course could benefit from more transparent progress reports. Although it works off of a point-system, giving students a range they are falling into could help them feel less anxious in the end. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone who enjoys cultural analyses of popular entertainment/media and the theory underpinning them would certainly enjoy this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in a heartbeat. Dean Muller is a wonderful instructor, and I really enjoyed focusing on the intersections of film and trauma psychology, something I don't get a chance to do in my other classes. If you think the subject material pertains to any of your interests, you should definitely take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Dean Muller is leaving Yale, so it won't be offered again :/ But YES in principle! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Understanding the ways that America has been shaped by numerous traumatic events is very valuable insight for all students, irrespective of their chosen field. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend if you are interested in the intersection of trauma and culture in particular. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, although Prof. Muller is leaving so Im not sure if that would happen! I fully enjoyed all the seminar discussions on film and TV and the key readings were interesting, although we couldve gotten by with fewer supplemental readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. The topic is relevant and the course materials are stimulating. Overall, my time spent in the course was very positive, and I always left class with new ideas to discuss with friends. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you are interested in understanding how culture and trauma interact to influence the development of a societal consciousness. The course doesn't go terribly in-depth into that field, which is a good thing, because it allows itself to be accessible while being enlightening at the same time. Towards the end though, it might seem like the mind-blowing revelations and interesting theories discovered in the first part of the course is being paraphrased and repeated through different perspectives. I don't see this as a particularly bad thing, because it means that it isn't very difficult to understand the content, and the various readings which pursue the initial ideas in the course in different ways allow for the nuances of trauma and culture studies to emerge. Overall, this is a very manageable class with an interesting curriculum, great professor, and fun content. "
