            "\u00a0The instructors and TAs are extremely invested in the course and prioritize their students' learning above all else. Sometimes I felt that the instructions in the lab manual were unclear and I felt slightly unprepared going into the lab, even after carefully studying the manual. The lectures during lab can sometimes run long and could be more focused. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghs include the fact that the little out-of-class workload allows students to enjoy the lab sessions more and be more intimate with the material. I greatly appreciate the fact that there are so few homework assignments. \r\n\r\nThe in-class lectures are good but need to be trimmed a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0the strengths are most experiments are easy and the TAs are helpful during class. there are only two lab reports which are nice but the reports do take some time. the weaknesses include that the class is unorganized. sometimes you feel confused during the class because you just move from one step to another and then maybe to another page in the instruction manual and then you take a quiz and maybe do the lecture and it's all kind of a mess and then you go back to the experiment and maybe there's a step that's missing from the manual or the instructions are different of the instructions are different from what the instructors say. sometimes it's hard to understand or hear the professors and it makes me a bit confused as to what we're doing. it's also made some content harder to understand than necessary. but both of them are really nice people and helpful when asked. weekly quizzes are a thing and they are difficult and even though you do the readings or watch the videos, you still may get low scores on them. they test for specifics and not for general which i feel they should since the purpose of the quizzes is just to see if we've read the manual. i stress about the quizzes. grades are kind of slow. we haven't received any grades besides our quiz grades. we also received a grade for a pset but there is no section for psets on the syllabus so i don't know why we did them or how they'll be incorporated in our grades. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-strong prep for labwork\r\n-professors who care, deeply\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Lectures can be unorganized, reorder information - hard for two lecturers.\r\n-Not well organized summaries of information\r\n-Quizzes confusing, and many questions off topic/nitpicky details that are memorized and forgotten, (like diagraming his tag on Nickel)\r\n- Lab Report instructions confusing, especially lab 2, took hours to understand what the desired information was, calculations, or values. Clearer instructions, samples, or lectures on the material to be in the report would be helpful. Also, changing lab 2 sample confused me and others further, as we thought that some values mentioned in the report had to somehow be in ours, or that..... And hours spent trying to untangle instructions and sample reports/calculations. took away from the hours that I could put into this course. Lab 2 especially felt beyond scope of/not reflective of the lectures.\r\n-We never get the lab reports back, to understand grades, or how to improve, or what we did wrong. \r\n-Lab should start at 1:30 as advertised - I thought I could have a lunch break, but don't\r\n-Spent hours prepping for labs, from reading the manual to watching sometimes hours of documentaries, and still never felt prepared. Probably a personal problem, but I honestly put time in, and would ask leaders of class to consider condensing information, organizing it better, or eliminating documentary series. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class was the experiments and the helpful instructors. The course's weakness was that the course grade depended mostly on the reports, but the course did not touch on how to write reports and the rubric was a little vague. In addition to this the first report was not graded before the final one was due, so students did not know if they were doing well. "

            "\u00a0I recommend this class if you need a biology lab or just want to learn basic biochemical laboratory techniques. You won't master any techniques, but you'll definitely get exposed to /a lot/ of techniques in a semester. ",
            "\u00a0For a lab class, it's a good filler. I feel comfortable with several methodologies used in MCDB research, I just with we did more of them. ",
            "\u00a0there are better bio labs out there to do probably. this one's workload is alright, just 2 lab reports and weekly quizzes and 2 psets but the class is a bit disorganized and the labs are long. this isn't an intro bio lab although it only has biol 101 as a requirement. the basics of lab are not taught and if you haven;t worked in a bio lab before, then it must suck. the weekly quizzes are though and require studying even though they are advertised as quizzes to make sure you skimmed through the lab manual. the lab reports aren't terrible but do take a lot of time to do. ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. Out of all the courses I've taken so far at Yale, this is the first one that I will flat out REFUSE to recommend to another student. It's just an awful, awful class. Yeah, you learn some useful lab techniques, but then the 30 page lab report hits you in the middle of the semester. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AT ALL.  Unless you need this for your major, don't take this class. Please, spare yourself the pain and agony. ",
            "\u00a0This lab is difficult, especially for students who have not worked in. The lab reports are huge, and honestly, even working on them before and not waiting until the last minute, they will still take up all your time. I overall thought it was too ambitious, and did not do a good job at organizing the material to be digest-able in enough time for a half credit, nor give good feedback to help learn how to write better reports, as these are most important to the grades.\r\n\r\nTake a MCDB lab if looking for something more attainable, and are uninterested in the time to invest, or doing lab work.
