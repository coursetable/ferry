            "\u00a0I learned the basics of ASL, including the alphabet and vocabulary that was relevant to daily conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Alphabet, numbers, Basic vocabulary and some grammar ",
            "\u00a0The course was tremendous fun and incredibly well structured and has been one of my most treasured language courses ever. The 110 course is rudimentary language skills like any other class and we basically learned an enormous amount of vocabulary and how to properly use it. Besides learning how to actually sign from the very first day, I learned a tremendous amount about deaf culture, history and community. I feel entirely capable of holding my own in conversation--maybe just a few minutes, but learning language is a tremendous effort. We learned of careers with ASL and the variability of this skill for career pursuits. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a thorough knowledge of the basics of ASL through this wonderful course. ",
            "\u00a0In the first semester of ASL, we accrued a ton of different vocabulary that would allow us to have casual conversation in sign language. We also learned important facets of ASL such as the use of classifiers and non-manual markers that are key for robust expression in ASL. Lastly, we learned a lot about deaf culture--some of the history, some of the community values, and were encouraged to attend events that explored these themes thoroughly through talks at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about basic ASL vocabulary and grammatical structures, as well as about Deaf culture. ",
            "\u00a0The beginning skills of understanding and signing American Sign Language. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge regarding the basics of American Sign Language as well as Deaf culture and community. We learned vocabulary, how to form sentences and questions, and how to tell stories. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of beginner ASL--much better, after trying to learn with way less success for years. ",
            "\u00a0I can now understand basic sign language which I did not expect to grasp so well at the beginning of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Learning the fundamentals of the language as well as the background of deaf culture, which added substance and purpose to the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much more ASL this semester than I thought I would. We learned probably over a thousand vocab words, as well important components to ASL grammar, such as classifiers, locatives and non-manual markers. "

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the small class size and teaching style. The class activities were very helpful and made it easier to apply the things we were learning to real life. ",
            "\u00a0I think maybe learning grammar after we had a stronger foundation in vocabulary might have been helpful ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well structured and well taught, however I would have greatly appreciated a better way to study. ASL, as we learned in course, is a visual language and requires visual cues and visual stimulants. As the course and the ASL department grows, I'd like see an investment into online technologies and software that promotes better (and easier) studying habits. ",
            "\u00a0This course was exceptionally structured and provided clear feedback. It was a highlight of my semester to have it every week. ",
            "\u00a0Because the class was highly interactive, we all learned a lot about ASL and bonded as a cohort. Prof. Tanner is amazing and makes learning a new language, and a new mode of language, in a totally immersive setting totally doable and functional. We had a lot of fun class activities to reinforce our learning and the exams were more than fair. ",
            "\u00a0I loved every moment of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I feel the clarification of grading for the midterm and final could be better. Overall, very fun and amazing professor. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is definitely Professor Tanner. She is AMAZING, and one would be lucky to get to take a course that she teaches! Another strength of the course is the small-group interaction. Because there are only about 14 kids in the class and all of us were very interested in taking ASL, it made class much more interesting as we participated in a lot of class activities to improve our ASL skills. One weakness of the class is that there isn't always a clear schedule and we did not follow the syllabus as closely as other classes I've taken. Although we didn't follow the syllabus handed out at the beginning of the year, Professor Tanner always made sure we knew what was due and when it was due, which was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think anything needs to change, really. Maybe a few more video assignments? ",
            "\u00a0I wish the classes were longer and that we utilized canvas for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The class stayed engaged, which was a strength of the material and the professor, but by the end of the semester there needed to be a shift away from vocal discussion at all in the classroom ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Tanner is so kind and patient, making the classroom feel like a safe to take risks and make mistakes when presenting in front of the class.\r\nWeaknesses: She was not very strict about keeping track of time, so towards the end of the semester we were not able to get to some vocab units we had originally planned to go over.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that is genuinely interested in ASL. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Tanner is great and its such a fascinating language. Definitely reccomend ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a great class and the students are all really interested in learning ASL. I am looking forward to continuing to the next level. ",
            "\u00a0I would enthusiastically recommend this to another student. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any inkling at all to take ASL, you absolutely should. It's quite ridiculous that it's taken Yale this long to implement this course and it could not have been done better at this time. Prof. Tanner is incredible, sweet, and very understanding. You learn a lot of vocabulary per unit but it's so worth it to be able to hold a casual conversation in near-real time by the end of the semester. The assignments basically break down into attendance, three unit exams in class, and two projects that are just a chance for you to sign and Prof. Tanner to assess. You really bond as a class and learn so much about the language skills but also Deaf culture and history. Take this class, support ASL at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved professor tanner and the language is very beautiful and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Amazing Professor with a great personality: entertaining, funny, smart, patient, passionate. I feel I have learned so much in this one semester, and I  consider languages fairly challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is extremely interesting and I will be continuing on in the ASL sequence because of how much fun I had this past semester. The students who take it are usually very passionate and Professor Tanner is excited to teach ASL, both of which make for a great class! The workload is less than other languages, but we do more work in class such as signing in front of our peers and Professor Tanner to learn proper ASL. Overall, this course has been one of my favorites at Yale as I'm sure anyone who has taken it would agree. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I hope the sign language curriculum continues. (As a graduate student, I was surprised it didn't simply exist in the Linguistics dept). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the course is informative while being fun and engaging. The material is useful as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! Learning ASL is fascinating and fun, especially if you are interested in Linguistics, as I am. This class also opens your eyes to Deaf Culture and Deaf History, which is rarely considered in other history classes and in hearing peoples daily lives. Learning about the Deaf Community widens your perspective of the world. "
