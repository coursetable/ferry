            "\u00a0Professor Bsheer inspires awe in her students. She does this by pushing students to identify the biases and hidden narratives running through the information they have been fed about the Middle East, and then to interrogate these, and to replace them with more emancipatory frameworks. Ultimately, you gain background information on revolutionary movements in the Middle East and then gain the theoretical tools to compare them and understand their relevance to the modern day. ",
            "\u00a0New insights about the regions history ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me an excellent overview of 20th century Arab political and social history. ",
            "\u00a0Learning about social movements in the Arab World in the best way possible, through diverse sources and an analysis led by the amazing Prof. Bsheer. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a real intellectual challenge, but you will learn a lot, as professor Bsheer likes to focus on theory as well. The group is quite self-selective, and in order to make good contributions to the class you have to have concepts from the reading locked down. Because the class is challenging, you will really learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0An amazing course. The discussion, even on its worst days, was at a higher level of engagement and quality than any other seminar I have been in. \r\n\r\nThe course taught historiography as well as a significant amount of theory (about how to study social movements) that we then learned to apply. Since it's difficult to have students conduct full primary research without language skills, Professor Bsheer wisely made a primary source assignment (3 pages) and then a full historiography paper (12-15). I thought both were excellent assignments that -- by separating the primary and secondary work -- served to sharpen our skills in history, which felt like great preparation for thesis work. ",
            "\u00a0This course is meant for students with a general understanding of Middle Eastern history and allows for more nuanced understandings of topics such as Pan-Arabism. This course more than others of taken focuses on historiography and is more theoretical than many other courses as well. "

            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It was very challenging, especially if you are unfamiliar with the discipline or the region. You are encouraged to think and engage with material in an entirely new way. A huge strength of the class was the collection of students that professor Bsheer was able to assemble. Everyone was very engaged and it was clear that week to week, everyone had done the readings and came ready to discuss. ",
            "\u00a0The course considers social movements from a variety contexts and asks students to think deeply about their historical and political impacts. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is that it forces students to engage not only with history, but with a broader dialogue encompassing politics and philosophy. Professor Bsheer expects you to think about theory more than facts, which I believe is ultimately what history is about. This makes the seminar setting so much more valuable, and I always came out of class feeling like I had learned a lot.\r\n\r\nI can think of no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly I can't think of any weaknesses. Professor Bsheer is a treasure among a sparse Middle East studies faculty. I only hope that the department hires more professors like her in the coming years who are as dedicated to innovative scholarship and thoughtful teaching! ",
            "\u00a0This is a very strong course overall. It is well organized and well led. The readings for each week are dense but not overwhelming and selected with a theme in mind that is not often obvious, making it an interesting question to keep in mind while doing the reading. I really do not know if this class could be improved. "

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. Prof Bsheer has a cult following on this campus for a reason. She's tough and engaging in all the right ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! An incredible class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course. It is a fantastic way to gain a deeper appreciation for the region and those who dreamed of a better future. ",
            "\u00a0I am always amazed by the energy and engagement that I feel whenever I leave Rosie Bsheer's class. She is an incredibly engaged educator and thinker, and being in her class sharpens and clarifies my own mind. I we  all learned so much. I cannot recommend this highly enough. In addition to learning about the region, you will learn how to think about history and about your own thoughts. Cannot recommend highly enough. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I you are interested in the Middle East and want to learn more about political theory, the philosophy of modern power, and decolonization, this is the class for you! I would recommend taking it after professor Bsheer's History 344 class (Making of the Modern Middle East), that way you'll have a solid background in the history of the region before taking this class, which is much more focused on historiography and intellectual history. This should definitely not be one of your first history classes at Yale, but if you want a challenging class with a dedicated and super bright group of students, take this! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, without a doubt. But you have to be prepared to engage very seriously in the readings and material at a theoretical background, and you need background both in studying the Middle East or studying history. Most of the students had done a lot of previous work with the material which led to a very high-quality discussion; the few students that did not have that background, or were not prepared to make up for their lack of background, detracted from the discussion. You get out what you put in, and this course is worth putting work into. You don't want to miss anything! \r\n\r\n(Also, Professor Bsheer calls any bullshit, and anything you say that is imprecise or wrong will be called out. You can't take it personally, but you have to embrace it and be willing to grow from it. She doesn't fault you for being wrong, but when you're wrong she wants you to learn from it.) ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, but only after taking Professor Bsheer's lecture course or a similar survey course on Middle Eastern history. "
