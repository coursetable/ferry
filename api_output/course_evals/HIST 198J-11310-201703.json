            "\u00a0I learned extensively about the Age of Jackson in the United States and finished the class with a deep understanding of how race and gender relate to that era. I also learned about the contemporary historiographical debates that currently consume the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to work with primary sources, how to work with historiography and analyze different historiographical arguments/streams of thought, and how to apply modern concepts of race and gender to a past historical era.\r\n\r\nThe seminar specifically imparted knowledge about the political, economic, and social characters of the \"Age of Jackson,\" with a particular emphasis on how race and gender impacted and interacted with politics and ideas of \"democracy.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course, more than any other History course I've taken, taught me about historiography. Professor Lynn did a wonderful job of picking secondary readings from scholars with a wide range of historiographical viewpoints and leading seminar discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of these varying approaches to scholarship. I also learned a ton about Jacksonianism, which I wasn't overly familiar with before this class. I especially appreciated the two weeks of the class where we went to the Mark Lilla talk and the Jackson at 250 conferencebeing around professional historians and being able to talk one-on-one with some of the people whose articles we read in class was extremely valuable to learning about both history as a discipline and the period we were studying in particular. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about politics in the age of Andrew Jackson (1820-1860), and focused on groups that were excluded from American democracy (women, African Americans, and Native Americans). Coming out of the class I have a good handle on how politics worked from 1820-1860, what the largest political parties stood for, and who supported each party. I can also turn a more critical eye towards what I read, understanding the source base that each author used. The class teaches how to read historical sources critically and put them in conversation with one another through weekly discussions, short papers throughout the term, and a final research paper. "

            "\u00a0I legitimately cannot think of a weakness for this class. The assigned readings were fascinating and Professor Lynn always prepared thought-provoking discussion questions that helped students dive deeply into the week's material. I think the course forces students to truly engage in discussion and come away with a legitimate understanding of the Jacksonian era. Professor Lynn makes himself more available than any other professor I have had at Yale and offers tremendous writing and research assistance. Consequently, I think this course also helps students improve their historical argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar provoked really fascinating discussions and had a really great set of readings from both primary and secondary sources. The subject matter was rich and compelling, but it was not too broad  I felt like we were able to go into detail each week and dig into the sources. I also thought the format of the class worked really well; the reaction papers were helpful and the final paper was very rewarding. I received really helpful feedback from Professor Lynn, who led great discussions each week. In addition, the \"Jackson at 250\" conference we attended was a great addition to the course and a culmination of everything we learned. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure if anything comes to mind about how to change the course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the historiographical approach that Professor Lynn brought to the seminar. I also thought that the two weeks we took for the Lilla talk and the Jackson at 250 conference were incredibly valuable in showing us what the potential of our research is. I wish more professors encouraged/required undergrads to go to conferences like that. The one suggestion that I have for the beginning of the seminar is to provide a timeline or overview or something of the Jacksonian era to contextualize our study inbecause the seminar wasn't always chronological, there were points where I would have to do a quick google search to ground the articles we were reading in the larger historical context because I wasn't incredibly familiar with it beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Lynn as a discussion leader and teacher, well chosen readings, a small class of very engaged students, and appropriate assignments. No weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. After three semesters at Yale, this has been my favorite, most rewarding class. If you want to gain a better understanding of race and gender in the antebellum United States, take this seminar without a doubt. Even if you are not acutely interested in the topic, I would still recommend this class as a way to drastically improve your ability to interpret and analyze history. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class. Lynn is a great, devoted professor; he leads great discussions, is always available during office hours, and truly cares about his students. I learned a ton and really engaged with history in an active way in this class. This was one of the best learning experiences that I've had at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take it for any number of reasonsto take a course with Professor Lynn before he becomes one of those famous professors whose classes it's impossible to get into, to study the Jacksonian era from scholarly perspectives that you likely haven't encountered in intro courses, or for a course that self-consciously asks questions that remain relevant today. Professor Lynn is one of the best and most available professors I've had, and every History major should take a class with himhe is incredibly invested in his students and will take time out of his week to talk to you about anything from graduate school to how to improve your writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this courseits the best history seminar Ive taken at Yale. Its an extremely well taught and well-organized class. Professor Lynn is an excellent discussion leader, who guides the class with really interesting questions. His questions encourage and focus the conversation between students. The readings were substantive but not unmanageable and each week we thoroughly covered a topic like womens involvement in politics, or how black rights evolved under the law. I loved the discussionsit was a class of 6 people in Fall 2017 and everyone was engaged, so we learned a ton. "
