            "\u00a0I truly feel as though I did not learn much from this course. Class was uninteresting, and the professor mocked students when they got questions wrong. ",
            "\u00a0Quite honestly, I don't feel like I learned much in class during the 140 half of the program. I think I learned more from speaking with my host family & watching Gilmore Girls & Grey's Anatomy in German with them than I did in class. Being in Berlin gave interesting insight into life in a big European city, which I found to be much different from both American city life and European life in a small city. ",
            "\u00a0Continued to improve all aspects of German language and learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course furthered the fluency, vocabulary, grammatical proficiency, and cultural understanding that had been developed in GMAN 110-130. ",
            "\u00a0I literally got worse at German during these 4 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my speaking and listening skills well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is more or less a continuation of the German S130 Summer course with more cities and a greater emphasis on complex grammatical structures. ",
            "\u00a0The class offered further practice in previously-acquired German skills as well as introduction to new topics like subjunctive 1. ",
            "\u00a0Almost the entirety of the knowledge, skills, and insights I developed during this course were in no way related to or because of Dr. Gehlker's instruction. The content of GMAN 140/S140, understandably, contains a lot of review of past concepts from 110-130, and so often the material covered in class (if one could say it was \"covered\" at all) was known or at least familiar to the students. This was very fortunate for us students, as the instruction provided by Dr. Gehlker at best muddied information that we thought we knew and confused every student, no matter the topic in question. The most enriching aspect of this course was living in Berlin during the four weeks and speaking with my host parents every day. I greatly improved my language ability, specifically my facility of conversational German, entirely through communicating with Berliners and my hosts, and I felt actively stymied (that is, in plain, negatively affected) by attending the daily class taught by Dr. Gehlker. Any improvement of my abilities were largely gained during the first half of the summer program (during Dr. Schenker's GMAN S130) or from native-speaker communication, and NOT from Dr. Gehlker's instruction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about city living in Berlin. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly don't have any idea what I learned in this course, as I felt as if the course was so disorganized and confusing that I felt as if I barely learned anything in the classroom. Most of what I learned was from my host family. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I know a handful of people who would probably disagree with me, but I did enjoy the Berlin part of the program more than the Jena part, though that had absolutely nothing to do with the learning aspect of the course. My Berlin host family and the ease of transportation in the city (two things that I felt could have been improved in Jena) were both fantastic, and the city is full of excitement and history. The museums pass really gave us the opportunity to experience the intellectual side of Berlin, which I found to be quite fun and interesting (but also tiring). I also liked the overall structure of this part of the course better, as the homework seemed more spread out and manageable & the workload felt lighter than in 130. (Though I will say the two projects in 140 were kind of brutal, even though I did like having the chance to work on a project independently.) Weaknesses: Instructor. Though Alina (our TA/grader) is great in her own right, you know there's a problem when everyone can agree that we consistently felt like we learned far more on the one day of week that Alina taught as compared to the three or four days that Professor Gehlker taught combined. This course could have been absolutely fantastic with a different instructor. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well laid out and I think the material of the course was well structured. However, it was at times frustrating to feel that class time was not that valuable and that I was not learning as much as I would have liked to. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: It was in Berlin.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Professor was poor. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were its immersive nature and the fact that its being held in Berlin allowed a much more comprehensive exposure to German culture and language than would be otherwise possible. I think that the syllabus was well-organized to strengthen proficiency and provide plenty of practice in the language, while also including projects and activities that exposed students to life in Berlin. However, I think that the execution/teaching of the course was often quite unorganized. As opposed to class time being productive and the time in which I learned most of the material, class time was often quite disorganized and I mostly taught myself from the textbook in my own time. ",
            "\u00a0Literally teach better ",
            "\u00a0The course was fine, but the video presentation is not the best use of our time, nor was the first presentation. Neither made very much sense, and should be reconsidered. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good in that it did a very good job of immersing us in German culture. We learned a little bit about German cities, and my speaking abilities developed significantly over my time in GMAN S140. However, there was a significant portion of the course that was designated to complex grammatical structures that are rarely used in everyday conversation or writing. A lot of class time was used on the explanation of these structures, which I think would be much better used exploring the cultures of the cities in the textbooks, which were spoken about significantly less than in GMAN S130. ",
            "\u00a0There was a massive disparity in the quality of this course compared to the quality of the 130 course in Jena. It didn't feel very organized and moved very slowly. A few times we didn't start to cover an important grammatical concept that would be on the upcoming test until the last hour of the class before that test. The lessons led by Alina, our TA, were usually much more helpful, and for this part of the program I relied much more on speaking with my host family than on the class in order to improve my German. Professor Gehlker was the biggest weakness of this course. ",
            "\u00a0The trips during this half of the program seemed even more ill-advised uses of time and money than the first half, which was largely very successful, entertaining, and educational. The night stay in Dresden comes to mind  we were put up in a hostel 20 minutes by foot from the center of the city, we were not reimbursed or provided a stipend for travel (that is, for the street car that shortens the commute to town), and the city itself does not offer enough such that an entire night stay is warranted. The fact also that it took so long to get there from Berlin, and then that we were to leave the next morning after we arrived, made the entire trip seem useless and ill-planned. It would have made much more sense to travel to Dresden from Jena (which is a much shorter trip) and to allow some money to subsidize travel cost if the students are made to stay there for a night. This is all aside from the absolutely horrible instruction provided by Dr. Gehlker, which actively confused the students about topics we already knew and did not effectively instruct us in new topics (or rather, did not instruct us at all). Dr. Gehlker regularly laughed at language mistakes made by students while in class with other students present, most often when a student would ask her a question. She rarely if ever actually answered questions posed by students, instead automatically forwarding any question to the class (her go-to answer was, translated from German, \"Well, what the others think?\") or to our TA, Alina, who was thankfully on hand to actually teach a bit of language and maybe even clarify what exactly we were supposed to be doing. The course suffered greatly because of Dr. Gehlker's instruction, and would be greatly improved with another professor from the German department. I recognize also that it could have been that no other professors were available to teach abroad, but I strongly recommend against Dr. Gehlker's instruction, as it made the course nothing short of miserable to attend. ",
            "\u00a0The classes themselves were not structured in a productive way. You could easily go all the way through German 140 without learning anything because you would do nothing in class. ",
            "\u00a0I can't name a strength. I felt so unengaged and every class felt extremely tedious. After coming from GMAN 130, where my engagement was phenomenal and class was a joy to attend, GMAN 140 made my Berlin experience significantly worse. I attribute this to the teaching of the course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I loved being in Berlin for this class, but honestly, the teacher was not great. She is rather disorganized, does not seem very interested in her students, and ultimately made my time in Berlin a bit less enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend the summer program to another student, though this course & its instructor are not among the reasons I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend GMAN 140 as a course, but I would say that the instructor with whom the class is taken matters and that one should read the reviews and get a sense of the instructor's teaching style to find a style of teaching that suits individual preferences. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but if Marion Gehlker is your professor, be warned that you may be bored out of your mind for 3 hours. She is actually a nice person and quite friendly outside of class, but the last thing I would call her is exciting and interesting. My opinion (and those of my peers I am sure) may be a little biased since we had such an amazing professor in GMAN 130 in Jena (the month before this course in Berlin), but still I usually don't care about who the professor is and Gehlker is making me question myself. Proceed with caution. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other German students. The opportunity to learn the material in Berlin and while being able to focus solely on German, as opposed to during a normal Yale semester, is priceless, as is the chance to live with a host family and practice the language with them. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as Marion is not the professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student only because you have to take it after 130 and Berlin is a great city to live in for 4 weeks. The workload isn't that bad, so there is a lot of time to explore the plenty of places that the huge city has to offer, and the other cities that the students visit are quite memorable. That being said, the class itself is nowhere near as interesting as I would have hoped or expected after taking 130. We focused far too much on grammar that we would never use, and not nearly enough on the cultural aspects, which was the whole point of traveling to Germany to take this course as opposed to taking it at Yale. In short, I would recommend the course in spite of the class itself for the experience of being in Berlin and taking 130 beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think any student studying a language should try to spend some time in a country where that is the main language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend going abroad-- Berlin is amazing and it is a great experience to learn German in Germany. I do not recommend this professor- she didn't really teach anything or clarify anything. After coming from Jena with Theresa (amazing professor)-- I feel like my german just got worse and worse. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course to another student. The German summer abroad program, on the other hand, I would recommend. The problem is just the teacher for this course was not in any way capable of teaching GMAN 140 well. If there was another teacher for GMAN 140, I believe the course would have been much better. "
