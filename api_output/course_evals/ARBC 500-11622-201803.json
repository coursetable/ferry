After learning basics and how to search for common roots of words, I feel whenever I want to learn on my own, I have fundamental strategy and techniques on how to use my learnt tools from this class.

            "\u00a0The only weakness I can see or rather downfall for myself is the amount of work we had throughout this class. I enjoyed every bits of it, but having four additional graduate classes, work and applying to another school, was too much for my first semester where adjustment was a big factor of my learning skill as well. Hopefully after having first semester of first level, second one will become easier knowing the strategy, course material and techniques of learning a new language. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think the intensive approach of the course is the most effective way to learn a language without direct immersion through travel. Professor Alkasami is brilliant, and quite helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If anyone wants to learn Arabic in an intense mode, then a student should definitely take this class. It develops learning, writing and reading skills greatly. However, they should be ready for the workload. And it did take the quality time from Arabic itself and other classes which put me in doubt whether to continue learning Arabic, but giving up is very easy. "
