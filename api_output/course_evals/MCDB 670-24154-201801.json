Just getting together to talk about interesting papers that aren't things I would necessarily read otherwise is fun, engaging, and makes me think about things in slightly new ways, which is great going into a grad program where I'm trying to do new an innovative research. Journal clubbing is a hard format to improve in some ways. Maybe having students be responsible for some sections of papers would be useful in some instances, where technical details of an experiment schema make it less likely that a read through will give enough info and can lead to confusion.
