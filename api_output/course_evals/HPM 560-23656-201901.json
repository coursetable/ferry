            "\u00a0Learned a lot of very useful information in the healthcare space that I did not know about before. Things that I thought I understood but really didn't. Loved this class! The tests were fair and the lectures engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It is a really good course. Professor Cooper is clearly very knowledgeable and fun. It was a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very well organized overview of healthcare policy and economics, Professor Cooper is an expert on the topic and the TAs are also very helpful, workload is very fair\r\nWeaknesses: pace during class can be a bit too slow especially for students with more industry experience ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the professor does a really good job at explaining concepts and making the information really interesting. I can't think of weaknesses for the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course had incorporated more cases. Zack brought such an interest perspective to the cases, combining his economics training, his academic work, and his consultant work. Overall it was one of my favorite courses from my time at Yale and I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a great course to take for an introduction or refresher on the U.S. health policy. Prof Cooper is a very engaging professors and explains concepts very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class - the material may seem a little redundant, but Cooper presents it in way that is SO interesting and interactive. This is one of the classes at YSPH where I learned the MOST and actually felt challenged. Additionally, I felt that it actually prepared me to work in the health care industry. I could have used a little more practice with memos -- I know they are hard to grade, but maybe one more would be good to have under my belt. Also a few more case studies would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Far and away the best course I've taken during this program. The content is so interesting and conceptually challenging, and I've changed the way I think about policies based on this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course had extremely engaging material, as it described why the nation is in so much financial debt and possible solutions. As a result, students raised their hands and participated a lot. Course weaknesses included there not being enough material or assignment complexity. It almost felt like an undergraduate-level course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Professor Cooper is clearly super smart, already highly accomplished, and isn't afraid to show it off once in a while. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- not many, good class, reasonable workload. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Cooper does a great job breaking down economic ideas and showing students how they can use data to inform policy. I feel as though this class has provided me with both a broad and comprehensive understanding of the U.S. health care system. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - organized lectures, knowledgeable professor, great readings (10/10!)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - constant schedule changes, the midterm exam focused too much on adverse selection...there were much more interesting concepts to explore\r\n\r\nImprove - an opportunity to develop and receive feedback on a healthcare econ research project (instead of 2 policy memos), more in-depth exploration of research methods/ software utilized in the studies (maybe one review session on this). ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I really enjoyed this course. It provides a great introduction to policy work-- writing memos, crafting recommendations, and understanding trade-offs in the policy space. Each topic focuses on crucial elements in health policy and equips students well to understand how policy recommendations are crafted and decisions are made. This course also builds on the foundations of EPH 510 and further explains why the US healthcare system is so complicated. In addition, I enjoyed the assessments -- both the written memos and assignments clearly focused on the important themes of the course and allowed students to engage creatively with the material. In other words, the assessments promoted and measured student understanding and critical thinking rather than rote memorization. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of the course was that it sometimes felt like a \"refresher\" of microeconomics. This is great for other students who don't have an Econ background, but among health policy students (for whom microeconomics is a fall semester requirement), it was a little frustrating to repeat much of that content. In the future, it might be good to make micro a prerequisite for this course, which will ensure all students have the same level of economics knowledge going into the course. ",
            "\u00a0Good use of primary research to discuss modern topics in health policy.  Practical.   Could be improved with a pre-req of microecon, so the health policy kids could get into topics beyond that. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite course by far! ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class was interesting when Cooper was discussing his own research but otherwise, the material was boring and didn't add to the breadth of knowledge we were getting from other courses. For policy students, who are both required to take the intro policy course and the microeconomics course, this class didn't really add anything on top of those courses. I think that in the future, this class should either not be required for policy students if the course material doesn't change or microeconomics should be a pre-requisite and change the material to reflect this. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredibly enlightening course that teaches about healthcare from an economic perspective that is still easy to understand for someone who has never take an economics course. Learning to write policy memos is an important skill that will be useful throughout my career. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fine course but would be made much, much better if students were required to take an introductory microeconomics course before enrolling in this. Too often Professor Cooper could not delve into economic details because many students in the class have no economics background and so we largely stayed at broad, surface-level themes throughout the semester. This class has also gotten far too big for what it should be because it is open to all students; there was absolutely no ability to have meaningful discussions about topics or the readings we were assigned because it was too large and not enough students have the background to really pick apart the subject matter. \r\n\r\nPLEASE require microecon to take this course next time it is offered. Without it, students hardly get any real opportunity to delve deep into health care economics. ",
            "\u00a0Very thought-provoking course! Would prefer that students be graded on EITHER policy memos OR exams; I feel like the exam format didn't suit the class material or format as well. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this class. I think it could have gone a lot more into the weeds, and I really think Econ should be a prerec. Class was very easy, and exams honestly mostly tested Econ things we learned in other required courses. He gave me something to think about each week, and I think his research is very interesting. This is much. Ore of a policy class than an Econ class thigh. ",
            "\u00a0I have no background in econ anything and I feel much more competent engaging in a conversation regarding this topic after taking this class. There is a steep learning curve as there is some time at the beginning during which there is terminology that students who have not taken microeconomics are unfamiliar with. ",
            "\u00a0I had never written a policy brief before so the class assignments were a great introduction on how to write them. There wasn't any new material that I hadn't already learned in microeconomics. ",
            "\u00a0Overall enjoyed going to class and the lectures were interesting, felt like this course didn't really build that much on what I had already learned in Schwartz's Policy Class and Friedman's Econ class. I.e Midterm was literally 3 questions on adverse selection, all covered in the fall. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. While the presentation slides were not ideal for reviewing outside of the classroom (lack of detail), the lectures were fantastic and I learned the most from this course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0What I hoped to gain from the course was a greater understanding of the marketplace for health insurance, current trends related\r\nto pricing and costs, etc. I didnt necessarily view it as a strict econ course but rather greater relationships between policy and economics. I gained what I had hoped! ",
            "\u00a0While I think there were positive elements to this course, including (on some weeks) the professor's insights there was simply too little content in the course. There needs to be more material covered in the future as the course seemed to fizzle out about halfway through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0this was a very thoughtful course - but I wish it had been smaller to really foster discussion and engagement. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course for a first year with little or no experience in the work world. As someone that had spent time in industry prior to school, it felt repetitive and a bit more basic than I was hoping for ",
            "\u00a0Great class! I had no background in economics coming into this class, but I still learned so much and the class was made to be accessible for those without economics backgrounds. I feel that I can now confidently talk about health economics with others. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this is an excellent course if you want to better understand the problems the US faces in improving health care efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and access. I did not have any problems engaging with the material or concepts even though I did not take Zack's microeconomics course. Minor annoyances: a) Some of the lectures felt like they meandered for too long. b) The session with guest speaker James Hatch was interesting but did not really engage with course material. Zack graciously offered a make-up lecture with dinner for all in attendance but this was outside of our normal class hours, so many students could not attend. c) A few microeconomics questions appeared on the midterm exam but the material was not emphasized or much covered in lectures or texts. Things I liked about the course: a) Zack wants every student to participate in class discussions and does a very good job of creating an environment for all to contribute. b) It is nice to have a class where the professor actively discourages the use of laptops during lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. After having taken microeconomics the previous semester, this course was more of a broad-picture view of health economics. I very much enjoyed the class format, especially the case-study lectures. ",

            "\u00a0I felt confused in one class only. The literature suggested that many physicians are practicing below an acceptable level. I am not sure how economic arguments change that feature. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cooper is amazing to learn from as he is an expert on this topic and has published and spoken frequently on current topics in healthcare reform. He does a great job of presenting different sides to an issue and challenges students' assumptions without creating a negative classroom environment. ",

            "\u00a0Fantastic lecturer. Wish he had shared more about his consultant work! ",
            "\u00a0I would've liked to hear Prof Cooper include more of his own input during case discussion days, as those days the discussion can digress from the main point, but overall it is a small critique-- it makes sense to have the class lead the discussion when discussing cases. I thought Prof Cooper was a great professor, you can tell he's been teaching the class for a while and is very knowledgable about the content. ",
            "\u00a0He's probably one of the most knowledgeable and PRACTICAL professor at YSPH. His experience clearly shows as he keenly can present facts and then can argue both sides of the arguments. He allows students to contribute, without it taking too much class time and can speak from experience about relevant health care topics. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Cooper is a fantastic professor. More than anything, I appreciate how the course information was so real-world and based off of his own experiences. I think I learned more that way and was far more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Cooper was very dynamic in the classroom and was clearly passionate about the material he was teaching. He also was very available to students outside of class for office hours, lunches, or phone calls and responded quickly to emails. His teaching style might be improved if he does not provide as many personal anecdotes.  A few are fine, but after a while, it seems a little unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0He probably won't be at Yale forever, so take a class while you can. His research and projects are meaningful, relevant, and pertinent to major issues facing the healthcare industry. Can come across a little bristly on a 1-1 situation and there's probably a little room for a touch more humility, but overall, learned a lot in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cooper is a fantastic instructor. I loved coming to class each week. He engages really well with students and also keeps the class lighthearted. In class, I never felt overwhelmed or intimidated by the material because he approached it and explained it so thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Cooper is a great instructor. He clearly explains material in a way that makes sense conceptually and in the context of the course. He is always accessible to students and makes an effort to prioritize his responsibilities as an instructor. I also appreciated that he was sensitive to the fact that students were generally tired during an evening class and included breaks. ",

Also appreciate that he attempted a balanced political class--gave statements and facts and evidence, and left the opining up to us.  My favorite professor at Yale thus far. ",

I think he also isn't very good at teaching the basic concepts in economics because he is all over the place when teaching concepts rather than working in a step-by-step way (e.g. when he was talking about utility curves). Had I not taken microeconomics, I think I would be more confused. I think he's good at teaching his research but otherwise, the class was very scattered and I think he could improve this by spending more time on his slides and less time on anecdotes. ",

He is clearly extremely smart and is doing interesting work but it seems to be imposing on his ability to dedicate time to preparing for this class and his students. I also feel that Professor Cooper had to hold himself back from getting into the (more interesting) weeds of health care economics because many students in class did not have a foundational knowledge of econ. \r\n\r\nI met with Professor Cooper several times throughout the semester to talk more about ideas that he had brought up in class (and because I am interested in going into a field similar to the work he does) and I usually felt like he had absolutely no interest in my questions or me as a student. That is totally fine-- I hardly expect to be his top priority-- but I wish Professor Cooper simply would have declined my requests to meet or had directed me to a TA instead. ",

            "\u00a0Key for thinking about economic issues in health care - Zack has an interesting way of presenting and discussing the issues that is a little different from the other professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course is useful for students who are interested in further education on US health policy. A useful prerequisite would be EPH 510 - Health Policy and Healthcare Systems or have prior experience and solid understanding of the US healthcare system. ",
            "\u00a0A solid course with a reasonable amount of work that provides a good industry overview. May be too basic for some ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who wants to gain a good understanding of the U.S. healthcare system. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to 1st and 2nd year students wanting to learn about the issues facing the US health care system from a policy and economics perspective. The workload is manageable, the instructor excellent. You will definitely learn something of value. ",
            "\u00a0This is a standard-workload type of course. It is not necessarily a \"hard\" or \"analytical\" economics course, in the sense that you don't spend a lot of time going over fundamentals of microeconomics. Instead, this course focuses more on broad trends in healthcare economics, using a lot of methods that are taught in \"Methods in Health Services Research\" (which I took this semester as well). All of Professor Cooper's lectures were fascinating, and I really appreciated his teaching style. Overall, I would highly recommend this course to anyone at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0Very good "
