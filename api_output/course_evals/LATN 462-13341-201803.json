            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about Tacitus in particular, about the ancient historiographical tradition more generally, and about the philosophy of history and history-writing. I learned both how to make sense of Tacitus' concise, pointed style, and (a fortiori) I improved my ability to read other Latin authors as well. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a really fantastic course. The material is original and fascinating, and it is presented in a well-organized and clear way. To study Tacitus' style and aims really closely was wonderful. And there was an excellent balance between reading Latin, writing papers, and thinking about secondary literature. A great course on a great author  who (as I learned) possessed breathtaking psychological complexity and sharpness. "

            "\u00a0I absolutely would. Tacitus is such a terrific author, and the story of Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian is absorbing and surprising. At the same time the higher order questions of history, historiographical influence, and tyranny raised in this course are relevant and fascinating. "
