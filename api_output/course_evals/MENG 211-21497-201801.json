            "\u00a0I learned a lot about thermodynamic systems and power cycles. I also learned how to come back from failing the first test of the semester to mastering the material, which was pretty awesome. "

            "\u00a0I thought it was organized well in terms of balancing lecture and problem practice. The power plant visit at the end of the course was also a cool addition! Could be improved maybe in how it's applicable/used in industry? We didn't learn about the software that does many of the calculations we were learning in industry, but I think that could be useful to see. ",
            "\u00a0I heard scary things about Judy's course last year, but that she was a great person. Well she is still great, and has truly taken into account all of the feedback she received and improved the course. I like the examples we did in class, she follows the textbook pretty closely, and the class is very straight forward. ",
            "\u00a0The course works well since we cover examples in class. It helps us understand concepts better. Much of the class is very theoretical. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Cha is a very effective lecturer and concepts she taught in class almost always made sense. The greatest weakness of this course was not spending enough time on thermodynamic relations. I did not feel fully prepared for this section on the final due to a lack of sufficient pset/review session/in class problems and not enough time spent discussing the concepts in class. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the material was covered a little rapidly ",
            "\u00a0Judy is a great professor!!!! So charismatic! ",
            "\u00a0I felt it was good at teaching how to actually go about analyzing a problem given a known set of data and situation, but I think it would have been nice to connect it a little more to the real-life situations these scenarios mirror and talk about applications of such math in real life. ",
            "\u00a0This class isn't easy, but if you put in the time it can be very interesting.  I thought the problem sets, though difficult at times, did a great job of solidifying the material.  I wish we spent more time on chapter 11 as it felt very rushed despite comprising almost 1/3 of our final. ",
            "\u00a0Very theoretical, maybe less? No other suggestions ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was run very smoothly, and the lectures were well done. The problem sets were helpful and related well to information learned in class. More time could have been spent on thermodynamic relations and proving relations. ",
            "\u00a0Thermodynamics is, by nature, a rather difficult subject to rap your head around the first time you encounter it. One of this course's strengths is that it provides a decently thorough introduction to this very important subject. This course would be improved by making the beginning material seem more structured. By the end of the course, it became very clear how I needed to approach most problems, but at the beginning, I often had no idea how to start a problem. This could be remedied by emphasisixing a clear set of steps in order to approach the initial problems. ",
            "\u00a0I like that the psets are thorough yet manageable. I think chapter 11 was not that useful. ",
            "\u00a0It is required so no one is really taking it for fun, but Professor Cha is great! She is honest with you and it is great. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Professor made it so that I didn't want to fall asleep in class. But Weakness: I will say that some concepts could have been more ironed-out before going into the practice problems, and some things didn't feel explained as clearly as I might have needed from time to time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the textbook is BOMB, you should definitely use it as a resource if you're taking this class. Some people said they never opened the textbook and can't fathom how that is possible. Also, the TA was very knowledgable and always happy to meet up with students to answer questions. Also the steam power plant trip was cool! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Professor Cha and the TA's did not really communicate well, so when you were trying to seek help from the TA's they new the material, but not specifically what was expected of us from Professor Cha. That was pretty annoying. Another weakness is that Professor Cha just doesn't believe in partial credit?? Like if you make one little mistake, you get little to no credit on that problem, which led to ridiculous grade disparity because you either got full marks or none. That was very unlike other mechanical engineering courses I've taken at Yale and made it difficult to prove your knowledge of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well taught though there seems to be a disconnect between class, problem sets, and exams at times. The class and exams seem to be somewhat split between more concept based derivations and numerical problem solving, but the problem sets are almost entirely numerical and formulaic which can make it difficult to learn and study for anything on the exam which involves derivations or more conceptual problems. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best taught engineering classes I've taken here. It's hard, for sure, but the curriculum is well structured and there are good resources for outside help. I loved the power plant tour too. "

            "\u00a0If you have to take it for mechE, I would recommend it with Prof. Cha! She really cares and makes asking questions easy. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but chances are you're taking it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think anyone takes this course unless it's required for your major. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a very useful course for engineering students, although most have to take it anyways. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a Mechanical Engineer, you have to take this class.  If you get professor Cha, you'e in luck because she's very helpful and good at explaining concepts in lecture.  If you don't work alone on the problem sets, they're quite viewable.  I would say don't be discouraged about what you hear about the workload. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro course. Midterms are challenging, but otherwise fine ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are mechanical engineers as it is required. There are other thermo courses for other majors, and I feel this one was tailored specifically toward meche so I don't know if non-meche majors would learn a lot from it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if they have to take it would I recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well organized the psets were thorough yet totally manageable. Judy is great and funny and tries to get to know her students. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you must. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great and necessary course for (arguably ALL) engineers, and anyone interested in applications of thermodynamic principles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I took this class even though I really didn't NEED to for my degree (BS12 MechE), and I really enjoyed it! It was REALLY really REALLY hard, but most MechE courses are and that's kinda why we're taking them, right? Also, the skills you develop in order to not completely fail the class are incredibly valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Most people who take thermo are taking it for a major requirement, as was I. Considering it was a core engineering course, it was actually pretty good. "
