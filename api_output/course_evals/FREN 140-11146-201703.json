            "\u00a0A lot of grammar\r\nI learnt more about France during world war II\r\nI learnt more about Francophone countries and their perspectives ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to utilize French grammar with greater accuracy, read francophone stories/books with greater insight, and write and speak with greater clarity. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a much more in depth understanding of French grammar. In this course I practiced my grammar and reading, as well as expanded my vocabulary. I don't think my speaking improved as much as other skills. I also gained a lot of knowledge about Francophone countries and WWII through the literature we read. ",
            "\u00a0I was nervous to take this course initially because I was not confident in my French. This class was the hardest course in took this semester, but in saying that, it was the course from which I learned the most. Improving my speech, grammar skills, writing skills, and comprehension of the language, I feel like I have much more knowledge coming out of this class. ",
            "\u00a0My French improved tremendously! It was amazing. I know think in French and speak naturally, circumventing the translation process. I found confidence to speak, think and write critically and intelligently in French. ",
            "\u00a0Focused on conveying ideas and analysizing short stories ",
            "\u00a0Further fluency in french ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my French speaking and writing capabilities. ",
            "\u00a0I was pushed to practice my speaking skills much more than I had been in the past. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to better develop my speaking skills mainly as every class placed a great emphasis on speaking. The main challenge in French 140 would be to read the novels and assigned readings for the course. However challenging, it really pushes you to expand your vocabulary and expose yourself to many different styles of French writing. "

            "\u00a0The course packet is a great way to organize the material in this course. I found it so useful to go though the course packet and do exercises in order to better understand the concepts we learnt in class.\r\n\r\nWe read really interesting material and I loved reading from the French diaspora.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the workload was a lot, almost too much, but I liked the days off in the calendar to give us a bit of a break. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that you are forced to participate and that reading and interacting with French every day really helps you improve. Weaknesses are that there is a lot of work due everyday, but sometimes the work feels like busywork. ",
            "\u00a0I like that the class stresses conversation and active participation. It forces you to use French constantly and correct yourself as you make mistakes. The workload outside of class was overwhelming at times, but completing the work independently and then discussing it in class the next day was effective and efficient. \r\nThe course packet was difficult to follow at times and it was challenging to figure out what was assigned for each night, much more challenging than it should have been. If I ever went to class without doing a piece of the nightly assignment, it was simply because I did not understand what I was to complete for that night. An improvement in the syllabus formatting would help solve this issue that many of us students encountered. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was the instructor. She was so supportive and challenged us to speak more and really hone our skills. It was also really nice to have a small class which allowed more speaking opportunities. In addition, it created a sense of safety that I think is really important when navigating a new language and finding confidence in a new space. The curriculum was challenging and created habits that formed a foundation for my French, for which I am now very grateful. \r\n\r\nI did not find any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course occupied a large percentage of my workload while it was a required course and I would have preferred to spend the additional time on a class I was more invested in. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of work. The readings are long and often difficult to understand. Tests are hard. There's lots of listening comprehension, which I thought was the most difficult part. But you will improve your French a ton. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths were the class conversations and the readings. I would say that some of the grammar lessons were unclear. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like one main way to improve would be to prove answer key for the course packet practice questions. As students, we take the time to complete the exercises and we hope that we get some feedback on the work that we have done. Going through the exercises in classes alone is not extremely helpful because the 50minutes is highly limited and we are forced to leave out a lot of pages left unchecked. \r\nAnother way to improve would be to cut down on movies and videos watched. Personally I feel like the selection of movies did no really complement our reading and if anything, were poor representations of the books, sometimes even contradictory. We could devote that time taken to discuss the videos watched to instead develop a better understanding about the readings we have done. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The way my professor taught the class really helped all of us practice speaking and becoming more fluent which is something i wanted to work on going into the class. However, I definitely recommend that you shop professors because some of my friends i other sections had a pretty different experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Your French will improve greatly, and the stories/books we read are very interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for a student who genuinely cares about improving their French. If you enjoy the subject, the workload isn't too bad. ",
            "\u00a0If a student really wants to improve their French, then they should absolutely take L4. The class is difficult at times. It will definitely show you that you are not as good at French as yo thought you were, and as frustrating as that can be, its the wake up call you need. If you are serious about getting better at French, then I recommend it. If you are looking to simply get your language requirement out of the way and are thinking of continuing the French education you received in high school, I would consider avoiding the French Department at Yale. It's more intense than you would think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would! If you want to improve your French and gain fluency, you want to take this class. It is challenging but rewarding. If you work hard and truly believe in yourself, you will gain so much from this course, like I did. ",
            "\u00a0I would say you learn a lot of french and it is done well I was just not very interested in language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who was interested in improving their French but had the time to dedicate to it. If you want to put in the effort, put your all into the daily workload, and leave a step closer to fluency, go for it. But it's a stressful and difficult class with a ton of busy work.\r\n\r\nI wasn't a freshman when I took it, but I wish I did. Definitely a great way to meet people in your class if you're in a section with lots of other freshmen, which is most of them. ",
            "\u00a0I would, although it was very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to fellow Yale students who are serious about pursuing French on an intermediate level. I feel like for language courses being consistent is key and French 140 ensures that you are in constant contact with the language and its intricacy. I enjoyed the rather small class size which could potentially be useful if you are looking for intimate interactions between peers and professors alike. "
