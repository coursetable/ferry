            "\u00a0One of the few finance oriented classes offered at Yale. Gained knowledge about the U.S. Banking System. ",
            "\u00a0This course will teach you about the banking system before, during, and after the financial crisis.  You'll learn about how banks are regulated, how they interact with other financial institutions, and their role in the US financial system and economy more broadly. ",
            "\u00a0Thorough understanding of the US Banking system, really good course. ",
            "\u00a0Great analysis of the crisis ",
            "\u00a0This class covers important aspects of the U.S. banking system. It teaches about commercial banking, investment banking, securitization, repo transactions, monetary policy, regulatory frameworks, etc. It also covers important moments in the history of finance and financial regulation in the US. ",
            "\u00a0Information about US banking ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the US Banking System ",
            "\u00a0In this class, you learn a lot about banking history, regulation, & theory; I also really enjoyed learning about the crisis. Take this class if you want to learn more about how commercial banks make money, the crisis, Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac, and what regulation can and does look like going forward. ",
            "\u00a0I gained significant knowledge about the mechanics of the US Banking System (per the course title) and how the events of the 07-08 financial crisis changed the American economy. ",
            "\u00a0You learn all about the banks, from a systematic and regulatory perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the structure of the U.S. banking system and some of the most important debates surrounding how we ought to structure a banking system. We learned about topics like bank balance sheets, how banks fund, and how these factors lead to potential instabilities in the system. ",
            "\u00a0You gain an intuition for the US financial system, looking at mortgages, interest rates, financial regulation, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much considering how I didn't know anything about finance before taking this class. I finally understood much of what happened in 2008 and the government's response. I understand the way much of banking works and different kinds of banking. This class was so much fun and so interesting, but it was also so hard. I felt like I would have learned more if I took an intro finance class before so I would recommend doing that. I learned a lot of the stuff from Khan Academy and Marketplace A&M Youtube videos so I recommend doing that. "

            "\u00a0Professor Pascutti's enthusiasm is a strength and his organization is a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are all related to Professor Pascutti's dynamic teaching style. He brings what would otherwise be boring concepts to life through demonstrations, anecdotes, etc. which are not only entertaining but also incredibly helpful. The major weakness of the course also comes from Pascutti's style. Though he is a wonderful lecturer, he can be a bit disorganized at times, making it hard to condense his materials into digestible units. This making study for quizzes and exams a bit difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely good course, no suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0Pascutti is the reason to take the course, he saw the crisis firsthand working in industry and his anecdotes complement the material nicely ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the readings were not super integrated in the lectures. Apart from that, the course organization and content was great! ",
            "\u00a0Good as is. Maybe the final paper should be removed. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are strong, I would say that the readings are somewhat convoluted and often too high-level. I thought there could have been more guidance around the paper ",
            "\u00a0He teaches so much and you actually have good notes to follow during the course which is so helpful. One thing I would have liked is more participation from some students. ",
            "\u00a0Taught by a professor with first hand experience in the topic of the class, and a very important one at that. You must pay attention in class, as Professor Pascutti moves very fast and in many different directions. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is excellent. The material is really well done. I think that perhaps a more conversation-based format (would require a smaller size) would be really good. ",
            "\u00a0Per usual a little disorganized. There is a lot of material covered and the tests will cover the randomest things from that material. Needless to say, studying is difficult. However, Pascutti is a great guy to know and learn from. I would take the course just for him. ",
            "\u00a0It gives a great intuition and sense for the field. You have to study a lot of minute details, however, for the assessments. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing, the subjects are interesting, the quizzes are hard. This course could be better if there was a simpler way to explain a lot of the complicated concepts like CDOs, leverage, Government bailouts, etc. I learned much of that basic stuff from Youtube. However, I spent most of the semester not knowing anything until I crammed for the last few quizzes and the essay. Professor Pascutti really cares and is always there to answer questions, so be sure to ask him anything you don't understand. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is a valuable coarse as not many finance classes are offered at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has even a vague interest in the financial crisis or the financial system in general. As someone who is going into banking, I found it very helpful to learn about the industry I'm going into from a holistic perspective. However, the class is invaluable for anyone regardless of their background in finance. If you want to know what banks actually do, what makes them risky/safe, and what happened during the financial crisis, please take this class. After taking this, I guarantee you will have a better understanding of the US financial system than 99% of your peers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, be prepared to work but its an incredible course. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Workload was reasonable. Assessments were based on things we learned in class. Pascutti is awesome ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if youre interested in the banking sector as a part of the bigger picture of finance in the US ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is such an amazing course. I learned some much about finance and financial history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Extremely engaging professor. Will learn a lot with little effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed it a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Recommend if you are interested in financial history or regulation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a lot of work, but Professor Pascutti is very easy to listen to and learn from, and very entertaining as well. Not to mention the very relevant course material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. Pascutti is an amazing teacher, really appreciate the energy he puts into the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any Yale student. I think that the evaluations are very doable for those who show up to class and therefore should not be a hindrance to taking the class. I think that the material is really, really interesting. The readings really get into the details, but those details are not totally necessary to understand the main concepts/issues at hand. I would say that this class lets you engage with some of the most important issues facing our society today. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in finance, I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you already know a bit of finance. "
