            "\u00a0This course passively taught vocabulary related to business in French. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of new vocabulary in French related to business. It was great to take a class at Yale where I could develop tangible skills related to my professional and academic goals and ambitions! ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of various business practices in France and the francophone world, with particular focus on entrepreneurship, labor rights vs corporate rights, and societal perceptions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the current status of business administration, business-government relations, entrepreneurial activity, and the diverse business market in France through French conversations, videos, films, and readings in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about business topics in the Francophone world. ",
            "\u00a0This French class helps you develop two main skills: 1) you will practice your spoken French, particularly your skills in discussing complex topics, and 2) you will learn enormous amounts (and often some very surprising facts) about the world of business in France. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many technical terms about business, and I learned how to say them/talk about them in French. We also discussed many cultural aspects related to the world of business in France and francophone countries. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course was somewhat unorganized. It didn't really directly teach a lot of requisite vocab but required a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0While the course was overall well-taught, I wish there could have been more of an emphasis on vocabulary retention. While the articles discussed in class were very informative and helpful for learning new vocabulary, it would have been nice to revisit the vocabulary through occasional quizzes as opposed to abandoning it with each new topic. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly a really fun class that really keeps people engaged and solicits input from all members of the class.  My only recommendation would be to perhaps reduce the number of presentations and do some other sort of project so that 1) it does not take up quite as much class time and 2) it gives a little more variety to the coursework.  Additionally, some of the concepts (e.g. the finance unit with Socit Gnrale) are rather difficult to grasp, regardless of what language it was in: it would perhaps be beneficial to have shorter additional materials to help explain these more dense concepts so that is not too overwhelming and the readings can be understood fully in real time rather than in retrospect. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: we were able to have great discussions on what we thought about how business was conducted in France. We were able to compare that with those in the US. It was a fun class in that we were able to deeply discuss corporate tax laws, how to improve business-government relations frameworks, and the benefits and caveats of those frameworks. ",
            "\u00a0This course has an incredible professor, Leo Tertrain, who is kind, funny, patient, and cares about students' success and well-being more than anything else. Class discussions were interesting and exciting. My only suggestion: might it be possible to somehow structure student presentations so they will be more interesting? For example, by requiring them to be skits/videos, etc? The only moment at which I felt like the class was not engaging was during many of the student presentations, because quite a few of them were, unfortunately, mind-numbingly boring. This is not Professor Tertrain's fault at all, of course. ",
            "\u00a0At the beginning of the course we used class time to do a lot of different activities (class discussion, smaller group discussion, short readings, videos, etc), but towards the end of the class it became less varied (class discussion, student presentations, occasional videos). "

            "\u00a0Not unless it is better designed to teach vocabulary. There were no real takeaways from the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to someone that genuinely enjoys the French language and is looking to use French in a professional capacity. Definitely don't take this class if you haven't at least completed L5 French at Yale or have not had an equivalent language placement or else it will be too much for those that are at a beginner or intermediate level in the language. Leo is an amazing instructor who is very kind, flexible, and very good about delivering constructive feedback to aide in your understanding and comprehension of the French language, thus making you a better student. Class discussions were always interesting, and I really appreciated getting to explore new topics through the oral presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was a great extension of French language learning as well as conceptual understanding of a piece of francophone cultures. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in having discussions in French about business and the financial market in France then this is the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Leo is very nice and you can always find something you're interested in in the readings and to do for the projects. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who wants to practice their spoken French and is interested in the world of business in France. Even if you're not the most business/economics-oriented person (I certainly am not), the topics we discuss are interesting and relevant to anyone, and you'll enjoy the class discussions. You'll also learn lots of specific and technical French vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a really great opportunity to continue speaking French and improving my French vocabulary, as well as a great opportunity to learn something new to me, at least. "
