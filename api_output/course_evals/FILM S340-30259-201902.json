            "\u00a0I learned about Global Health and film and their complexities. I also learned about the histories, conflicts, and cultures of South Africa and Eswatini. ",
            "\u00a0A lot.\r\n-to take criticism and react to it (both positive and negative)\r\n-learning basic photography \r\n-learning a lot about film, story and structure \r\n-basic global health principles but more importantly, how to think critically when approaching global health questions. ",

            "\u00a0The class was intellectually challenging. It required a great deal of time, work, and teamwork. I believe that these are strengths because I was forced to work hard and with others. \r\nAs for weaknesses, I think that sometimes the film portion of the class overshadowed the global health class. I learned a great deal about visual storytelling, but wish there was a bit more emphasis on health. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-dedicated instructor \r\n-lots of new skills developed \r\n-amazing locations \r\n-small group size \r\n-a huge sense of accomplishment after the mammoth final and film project \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-a little more clarity with structure/a schedule. Even a loose one.\r\n-a lot of the work load seemed to be in 2 weeks. Maybe try and spread this in some way. Dont be complacent. The work amplifies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: beautiful place, get to meet amazing people, interesting to try something new if you havent done visual literacy or global health before\r\nWeaknesses: its so difficult to live with your professors and classmates for so long. It becomes confusing where the line is between professor and friend. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It was a great way to learn about Southern Africa, step out of my comfort zone, and meet some truly amazing people. ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible summer and so academically and personally rewarding. I learnt so much about the subjects and myself. Thank you to everyone who was part of it. If youre lucky enough to go on this program, please do, and be open to everything! "
