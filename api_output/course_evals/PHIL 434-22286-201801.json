            "\u00a0Survey of epistemological issues in peer disagreement, read a bunch of papers in the field each week and discuss. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a understanding of higher order epistemology, especially the epistemology of disagreement.  I also developed a general sense of how formal analytic philosophy is done.  I learned about the connections between Bayesian statistics and models of higher-order knowledge. Finally, I had several clarifying insights about my own thinking, including my perspective on the relationsionship between philosophy and empirical science. ",

            "\u00a0The class had very interesting and diverse readings, and the discussions were stimulating. Sometimes I felt that we moved on too quickly from good debates in order to cover all the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course had the most interesting premise of any class I've taken at Yale, and the class did not disappoint. Readings were interesting, and the reading response format allowed for creativity and a way to express precisely what interested you most about the topic. A truly excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: seminar discussion was engaging and illuminating. Specific reasons this was so: the professor outlined key arguments in advance, asked interesting follow up questions to student arguments, and there was a reasonable amount of reading for each week (60-90 pages). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the room was very stuffy every week and it sometimes made it difficult to focus.

            "\u00a0Yes, it's the only course I've seen that goes into these issues and Prof Pittard is good. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who is intrigued by the philosophical implications of disagreement or who has a particular interest in epistemology. Keep in mind that this is a very specialized course, which can be both an advantage or a disadvantage depending on your desired course of study. Make sure you go to office hours to discuss your papers; doing so makes it much easier to write them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student and have, in fact, already recommended it to several of my friends. What a great thing to think about, and so relevant for college students trying to sort out what they believe! ",
            "\u00a0This class addresses key questions in the epistemology of disagreement. It is well organized and Professor Pittard is skilled at leading discussions. I would recommend the class to anyone who wants to learn more about how one should approach disagreement. "
