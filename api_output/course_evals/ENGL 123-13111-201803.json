            "\u00a0- Expanded my writing \"toolkit\" and developed skills beyond just my preferred writing style\r\n- learned to read for craft\r\n- developed a network of other very able writers that will continue to help with my own writing\r\n- Improved editing processes ",
            "\u00a0This class was great. We learned a ton about writing stories in different formats (fiction, poetry, and drama). We learned so many tangible skills about how to write good dialogue, giving characters clear wants and needs, etc, and so much more. ",

            "\u00a0In this class, you'll learn how to write creatively in many different genres, from poetry, to fiction, to drama. It's a great survey course of different styles of writing, to help you figure out which you like best! ",

            "\u00a0It's very laid back for a class. It's all about just experimenting and having fun, but though that you still learn a lot about writing. ",
            "\u00a0it was very hands on and interesting and the feedback was great ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: So many structured opportunities to write! The class is structured in such a way that by the sheer amount of work you produce, it is impossible not to improve. My class was also very insightful and eclectic, which made the experience much more fulfilling. The class is also a very kind and supportive environment. I even made several friends in my Creative Writing class that I'm going to stay friends with throughout the rest of Yale. Professor Green is also a lot of fun! \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: The class doesn't really afford as strong of an intellectual grasp on creative writing as I would have liked. My professor really focused on fiction and drama, so it felt like those two genres were given much more attention and love than poetry, the genre that I liked the most. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Green was extremely passionate about the craft of creative writing and provided insightful advice to each individual student on how to improve their writing during one-on-one meetings as well as our first drafts. This class was extremely fun and there was a supportive writing and peer-editing environment. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the readings could have been discussed more in depth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- Visits from practitioners in each of the 3 mediums was a very fun insight into each form of Creative Writing.\r\n- The formatting of the majority of the class being in our smaller groups with rare, larger lectures was very successful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- No intersection between the different classes creatively. (I think it would've been fun to have each professor from each section select a work from each of the worshoppers of the unit to present/read to the larger lecture) The more writers, the better! ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome. I wouldn't change anything! ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Great lectures, feedback and time with teacher. Really helpful class workshops. Maybe more time to share work with class would be better ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved the group plenary lectures, the reading material, and the workshops. I liked that the course was varied, so it always felt like the momentum was high. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think there could have been a bit more emphasis on reading for craft, rather than jsut talking about the craft. It would have been fun to talk about the readings a bit more extensively. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the workshopping and teacher feedback. Weakness is how hard it was to meet with the professor ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: always so enjoyable and felt very productive (as someone interested in continuing to write, but I think all would agree). Weaknesses: sometimes a little unorganized ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Even if you don't plan to do anything professional with writing, it will help you develop academic writing skills and it's really fun. ",
            "\u00a0yes! this course was awesome for creative writers and a super fun class ",
            "\u00a0I would! It is not only a therapeutic class, but it seriously does help you improve at creative writing. The class forces you to examine your own work with much more candor and much more often, which helps illuminate your strengths and your weaknesses really clearly. The more you put into the class, the more you will definitely get out of it. Because I put a lot of work into it, I felt like I had a final portfolio of work by the end that I really felt best represented me. I will also say that the class FULLY depends on the professor and the people in your class. My professor was super affable and the kids in my class were really smart, so it was much more fulfilling than it may have been otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you have a schedule of hard/stressful classes, because Engl 123 definitely made my semester more fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Even if you aren't planning on being a writer, this course is a great way to do something creative that won't overwhelm you completely. The class environment is very encouraging, and its a nice way to sample different kinds of creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any interest in ANY of the three forms of writing then take this class. I took it for the fiction writing but ended up loving the poetry section the most. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Amazing course ",
            "\u00a0YES! It's a course that I think every student would enjoy at Yale. It's challenging but not in a stressful way, and allows you to grow as a creative thinker. Readings are fun and interesting, but not overwhelming, and getting the chance to be workshopped is a great opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Really fun class and chill ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! It is a great time and will help you develop your creativity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Green is incredibly open to student work and enthusiastic about helping them make their writing better. It is creative, allowing students to write about whatever they please. It is a great way to dip your toes into creative writing, or just have a creative outlet for a semester. "
