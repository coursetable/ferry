            "\u00a0I'm glad we had three rotations. I'm not sure if this is true, but it felt like the second rotation was much shorter than the rest and I feel like they should all be even. I also felt like not much organization went into the final rotation talk, which made the students feel like the talk wasn't very important. I also think an off rotation isn't always necessary as many students do have a very good idea about what they want to do, but I do agree that for some students it is valuable. ",
