            "\u00a0I learned how to build on top of my own code through 3 lengthy assignments. I also learned a lot about how distributed systems work. I also got a sense of how the Internet that we know today was developed. The course covered some really cool topics on privacy, anonymity, and blockchain. Now, I get a sense of how to develop those systems, and I also get a sense of what it takes to make those systems be robust. ",
            "\u00a0File sharing in distributed systems, how MapReduce works, reputation systems, attacks and defenses for these systems, practical usage of cryptographic hashes, anonymous reputation, some networks stuff, BlockChain/BitCoin. You will build up a distributed system that lets you chat in a network (as a big group chat), privately message people, upload/download files from the network. ",
            "\u00a0A great overview of modern distributed system and some important papers in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of distributed systems with a focus on decentralized systems in the homework assignments. Learn about important research done in the past few years. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the progression of a lot of distributed protocols since the beginning to now. The protocols and algorithms were interesting and we read the papers in which they were presented. \r\nWe also had to implement a lot of these protocols which involved a lot of fun coding. There were two great things about the psets that differentiate them from most other CS classes I've taken.\r\n1) Our systems had to work with peer systems, mimicking the real-life fact that the way in which your system is implemented doesn't matter, as long as you respond correctly to other people's messages and send the right things to them. \r\n2) Each assignment built up from the last. This is also how systems are in the real world--you're never done maintaining and adding to a piece of code you've written unless you remove it entirely. This helps to emphasize the importance of writing modular, readable, and clean code. ",
            "\u00a0Very, very interesting and challenging course about distributed systems. I learned so much about all the major topics of distributed systems. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about interesting new research in distributed systems, as well as the foundations of distributed computing. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the development of distributed systems all the way from chat systems to bitcoin. We learned how these systems worked and what design choices went into them to make them as reliable as possible. This course is a must take for any CS major. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about distributed systems and their applications in the real world. I'm now familiar with some of the cutting edge literature about distributed systems, especially in the fields that Ennan is most interested in. ",
            "\u00a0This class focuses a lot on the development of different techniques/protocols in distributed systems.  You get a good overview of the history behind the techniques, and then some exposure to implementing them through the psets.  This class might be taught completely differently next year (as Ennan won't be around anymore). "

            "\u00a0The lectures were overall very good. Ennan does a really good job of introducing the topics well enough that we understand it, so that we can pursue it further if we want. But he doesn't require us to fully understand all the nuances involved with proving why the systems work, which is nice. I got a good intuition for how things worked, which is a really key. This worked especially well with conjunction of the problem sets since implementation is great for learning the details of how things work. The best part of the course is probably Ennan. He really understands how students think; he knows that it's hard for them to study and do a problem set at the same time, and he adjusts the schedule accordingly. He also takes the time to know all the students, and he is always very responsive and willing to help. \r\n\r\nThe weakness is probably the student presentations. Some of the students did a poor job of delivering the material, like CryptDB, that would otherwise be very interesting. Also, some of the topics, like system verification and configuration, were just not as interesting. Also, the TA, Peizhen, was just not very responsive; he would sometimes not respond to emails, especially when we needed to test our implementations, but Ennan is so helpful, he makes that a non-issue. The course would be better if Peizhen was more strict about edge cases, but it seemed like he didn't really care about edge cases, so it gives me pause when thinking about the robustness of my Peerster implementation. ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture was extremely organized and effective. The material was usually very interesting even though I didn't expect it to be, and Ennan is very good at explaining them. The psets are also fun, and you feel like you're accomplishing a lot. Not many weaknesses for this class - it's one of the best the department has to offer. ",
            "\u00a0I would get rid of the student presentations. They did not really contribute because we ended up not really learning the student presentation concepts thoroughly. \r\n\r\nI thought the psets were fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0The labs were challenging and rewarding. The tests were not challenging if you studied the material well. Lectures were very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0The overall focus on new research in the field was very ineresting, and in my opinion, should be followed in more CS electives. One slight improvement might be to have more than one assignment dealing with implementations of the systems described in the papers discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The last lectures were on systems' failures. Although this topic was certainly interesting and useful, it would have been nice to have had more than one lecture on blockchain given its current relevance. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the psets in this class and Ennan clearly cared a ton about being a good teacher. He would always be very patient with student questions and eager to help out as much as he can. ",
            "\u00a0Great material - really good blend of in-depth technical detail + high level overview of why stuff we're learning matters. Great lecturer - always in command of the lecture, explains clearly, and is pretty funny as well (get ready for some memes). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A lot of very interesting lectures and topics. Problems sets were fun and interesting\r\nWeaknesses: I thought some of the lecture topics in the second half of the semester were slightly less interesting than in the first. Also, while I appreciated the opportunity to present a paper we read to the class, I thought I learned less than I would have if Ennan gave the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Ennan was an awesome lecturer.   The concepts in this course can be pretty dry, even if you like reading systems programming papers.  Nevertheless, Ennan's enthusiasm and lecture slides made everything come alive and helped me stay engaged with the course material.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of the class was that it took a while to get feedback on our work, though this was understandable given that the psets are naturally pretty time-intensive to grade.

            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class if Ennan is still around Yale! I really learned a lot, and the workload is totally manageable. Debugging can be challenging sometimes because you don't know which node the problem can originate from, but it's nothing that patience and print statements cannot solve. Ennan is absolutely one of the best professors (even though he's technically only a post-doc) I have had at Yale. He is extremely understanding, and he takes the time to know the students, and he is always open to helping students. You get to learn a lot of topics about distributed systems, beginning with more arcane topics, but then moving onto modern and futuristic topics like privacy and block chain. Ennan is also really good at explaining the intuitions behind the topics, which is really all you need to know, so you're not stressed with all the details of why the systems work. This is definitely one of the best courses that I have taken at Yale, and I would highly recommend it to anyone shopping the class. I think Ennan's speech at the beginning of the class may have scared off students because he said you'd have to write 800-1000 lines of code, and he compared it the workload to Networks. But it really wasn't as bad as 323, which required a lot more conceptual understanding, in addition to the length of the assignments. If you have to present for him, make sure you really know what you're talking about because he will absolutely grill you to make sure you have done the work to understand what it is that you're presenting, whether that's your paper presentation or your final project presentation. The final project can be really good, and you can learn a lot from it, but it really depends on what you make of it because Ennan lets you choose. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE THIS CLASS IF IT'S OFFERED WITH ENNAN. This is one of the best if not the best CS elective I've taken, and I've taken a good amount. You will learn a ton and enjoy doing so, plus it's very practical to understand distributed systems. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best CS classes I have taken at Yale. I've taken lots of the \"hardcore\" systems classes in the past, but I would say that if you're not willing to put in up to 10-20 hours a week (understandably) into a low-level class, but want to actually learn something useful from this department, this is the perfect class. The labs were pretty involved, but they were definitely manageable due to the fact that they're bi-weekly and also very well specified. The readings weren't mandatory at all, so you could just focus on completing the coding assignments, but lectures were very clear and informative. You learn a lot of practical knowledge about distributed systems and since you basically build your own system from scratch, you end up learning a ton about C++. Ennan is also super understanding and involved, so there really were no downsides to taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0If Ennan is teaching this class again(which is unlikely), you must take it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class, especially if Ennan is taking it. Ennan is a great lecturer and is very available through office hours. The assignments were very rewarding and interesting. I didn't know any C++ prior to taking the class but it is relatively easy to pick up if you already know C. The topics we cover in class (P2P communication systems, security, file systems, reputation systems, etc) are also really cool; the knowledge is useful and applicable to jobs/internships. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Ennan is awesome and this class is fun. It's probably the only CS class at Yale I never really complained about meaningfully. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets are a lot of fun and are very manageable. There were only 4 and the last one is more of a project. That one was a little bit more stressful because, even though you can have a partner, you have to do more than one pset's amount of work in the same time, and that time includes Thanksgiving, when you can be sure not to finish any meaningful work. \r\n\r\nExams are straightforward and just test if you understood the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Probably one of my favorite CS electives at Yale. The labs are challenging but rewarding, and they do take a while. Tests are not bad if you study well. Ennan truly cares about each student. He is very responsive and goes above and beyond to make sure you are in a position to succeed. One of the only professors I've encountered who truly cares about whether his students learn or not. ",
            "\u00a0If Ennan is teaching the class, this may be one of the few CS electives I would definitely recommend. If you're interested in learning more about research in the relatively young field of distributed systems, this is the class to take. Ennan is also very accessible and might be a great person to talk to if you're considering doing research in the field. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE, ENNAN IS THE BEST! It is incredibly useful and you will learn a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I'd definitely recommend distributed systems -- especially with Ennan, because he's a great professor. You'll learn the fundamentals of how distributed systems work, which is really helpful for tech in the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Go take this class. Top 5 best CS classes - great content + great lecturer (Ennan Zhai) + great psets (we built a decentralized chat app that can talk to your classmates' chat app, building out features on top of each other one pset at a time). ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. But it helps a lot that I found the material very interesting. Ennan is very knowledgeable and very nice, though occasionally I didn't feel super engaged in lecture. I found the psets the perfect balance of difficult but fun and not too too time consuming. I'd recommend this course to anyone who thinks they might be interested based on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Came out with some good practical knowledge without having to drown in work like other CS classes.  Do recommend! "
