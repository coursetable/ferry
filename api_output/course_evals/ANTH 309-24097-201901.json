            "\u00a0Large theoretical concepts were made very easy in this class, and big names in linguistic anthropology (Peirce, Saussure, etc.) were made very clear throughout the weeks of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about semiotics, and was able to practice synthesizing texts (for the final paper). ",
            "\u00a0This was my first course in anthropology, so it exposed me to a whole new area of reading and thinking. I am much more aware of how culture influences the ways we communicate and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0The title of this course is kinda misleading. You don't exactly talk about language and culture, but rather you get an introduction in linguistic anthropology via the study of semiotics and ",
            "\u00a0I learned about theories of meaning and read major linguistic/anthropological theorists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the foundations of linguistics and how they can be applied to studies of cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I had no previous experience with linguistics of any kind, so I learned a lot. In particular, I came to understand some of the earlier approaches to linguistic anthropology and the later works that built on these ideas. This course gave me the opportunity to engage with the world around me in a different way than I am used to doing, with a focus on how language relates to social and cultural structures and why that is significant. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about theories of language, and about approaches to studying language and culture. "

            "\u00a0This is basically a lecture, but the way the readings were unpacked every week was always clear even when the readings were extremely complicated. Every week the readings were connected back to previous readings and concepts and everything was always tied together. ",
            "\u00a0I loved Prof Kocklemans lectures. Very engaging and brought the reading material to life with relevant examples of classical phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0Not really sure if this is a class with any particular weaknesses. The worst of it is that I'm not sure what my grade is as I type, I'll know right after I submit the evaluation. As for strengths, the material is usually interesting. Different readings cater to different people, some things were pretty fascinating for me that might've gone over someone else's head. ",
            "\u00a0I think the reading response assignments were structured really well for us to internalize the readings. Discussion in seminar was always great, I wish there had been more of it. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a lot of material, which is very good for a class like this. We went over the reading every class, which was essential to my understanding of the material. Sometimes, it felt like we trailed off into other topics towards the end of each class, but I actually really liked that. Reading notes are required every class, and that also forced me to stay on top of everything which was great. Perhaps if we could apply the material to our own lives more deliberately and with greater frequency, it would help to keep the material fresh in our minds. I also would have appreciated a little bit more discussion during each lecture, although I think that may be difficult to implement in this survey style of a course, and the class certainly participated. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, with an ideal balance between readings/independent reflection and group discussion. Every class meeting felt productive and interesting, and all the readings were fascinating! "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you are interested in linguistic anthropology and want to read and understand foundational theories in the field. Any concept that you are interested in can be explored in this course in your final paper and you will have lots of background theory to unpack it. It is basically a 2 hour lecture but Kockelman is great at explaining the most complicated concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are interested in a very specific theory of language (semiotics). If you are a linguistics major, you may find that this is a refreshingly different perspective on Language. Ultimately, though, I was a little disappointed because the course material was a little different than what I thought it would be. We discuss very specific theoretical frameworks for Language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; but it is quite niche, so only if you are already interested in linguistics and the philosophy of language. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to anyone who may be interesting in linguistic anthropology, but maybe not linguistics per se. Linguistics tends to be more \"scientific\" than the things we cover which tend to be more on the humanities side of things. Readings can sometimes be a drudge, but generally are nice to go through. Workload's not bad, so really only the concepts might mess with you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! It was so interesting and really important knowledge for anyone interested in language and how it affects cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Kockelman is amazing and the content changes the way you think about communication, cognition, and human society. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It was a compelling introduction to a topic area that is widely applicable to my own life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It offers a great introduction into sociolinguistics, teaching about the basics of the field and current work that builds off of it. The readings are truly interesting and going to class was never a chore. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Kockelman is one of a kind. Learn from him if you get the chance. He makes what he teaches fun and human and fascinating and somehow connected to everything beyond the class's range. This class was a blast. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this, or anything with Paul Kockelman! He is a wonderful and thoughtful professor. Language and Culture offers really meaningful readings and discussions on language and the ways that we study it. I learned so much, with a very reasonable workload. "
