            "\u00a0I learned a lot about French politics of the late 1800s and early 1900s and filled in some of my knowledge gaps in the rest of the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the history of France from a social, political, technological, economic, and literature perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about contemporary French history and its effect on France today. ",
            "\u00a0This course is fascinating and elucidates so much of the contemporary issues facing France now. A survey of modern French history, its an objective look at the last century enshrined in great books and movies. ",
            "\u00a0The course of French history! ",
            "\u00a0I learned about France since 1871 ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about modern French history and culture. Books like Germinal and A Life of Her Own gave real insight into life in France. We cover mainly France in the 20th century, including both World Wars, but also many cultural topics like cafes, sports, religion, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The course spans a long time period, but Professor Merriman does a great job at synthesizing the most important parts and making them exciting. Most of all, I learnt about France's history (and world history for the matter) from a variety of different perspective. I also improved my \"fast reading\" skills which were essential for the course. ",
            "\u00a0I was exposed to a broad range of modern French history, including excellent films, literature, and historiography. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general overview of French history (from both this class and the Revolutionary France course). ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for a history lecture. I learned how to study and evaluate history. ",
            "\u00a0Writing ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about France in the last 150 years -- all from a fantastic, hilarious, and passionate professor. ",

Learn about how to analyse the history of France through cultural narratives and social themes. \r\nThe research paper was a helpful component: it was broad-based enough to encourage students to choose a topic that they would actually enjoy writing about but also required students to actively develop their research and essay-writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I have never taken a French history course ever in my life. I literally walk around now and quote things we've learned in lecture because it was so interesting. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really liked the films for this course. The readings were well-chosen as well but there were too many books to realistically get through unless this is the only class you're taking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the topics are very interesting and varied. The course is easy to follow, as it is chronological. The movies and books were incredibly interesting.\r\nWeakness: no structure about the final paper, so many of us found ourselves writing it at the last minute because we weren't given a deadline by which to talk to our TA about the topic or anything like that. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - The readings and movies were all fascinating and raised interesting questions. The course is well organized and the TAs were a great help. Professor Merriman has an infectious sense of humor and brings his years of studying and travel in France and across the world to the various subjects. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Merriman's lecture style can sometimes be difficult to follow, though he always finds a way to bring it back to the point he's trying to make. \r\n\r\nRecommendations - Go back to the oral final as opposed to the 3-hour written final. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is a Yale treasure. I've never had a professor more devoted to his students, more excited about teaching, or more interesting. This is a hallmark Yale class--one of the gems of the history department you've heard about. The books you read and the movies you watch are thrilling. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is subject weakness is its a little all over the place ",
            "\u00a0It was a good class, but hard to follow if you didnt speak at least a little French to know how to spell things. It also was difficult to understand what he wanted on the paper too since we were just told to write a paper, but then got penalized for not know how to write a histography. ",
            "\u00a0Very impersonal and disorganized. TA did not know our names until the last week. Attendance was not even taken in section even though participation was part of your final grade. Neither my TA nor Merriman would tell us the grading breakdown until 3 days before the final. I also do not think I was set up for success when we were asked to write a historiographical paper but given no guidance on how to do so or what the expectations are.\r\n\r\nStrengths are that Merriman is entertaining, the sections are chill, you don't really have to read everything, and the content was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall very interesting and captivating. The readings were good and pertained well with what we discussed in class. I would maybe reduce the number of books we have to read and assign excerpts instead. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman's lectures are filled with wonderful anecdotes, he could only improve by organizing each talk around a stronger central thesis. I especially loved watching brilliant French films on the big screen. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging but lack organization and countless terms on the lecture outlines were never discussed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong because Merriman is a great guy, but could benefit from clearer expectations regarding the midterm and final. The course was often a bit heavy on reading, which can be a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and work load comes in quickly at the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is a fantastic professor, and I loved our sections. Our TF, Flynn, was amazing. I have no real suggestions for the improvement of this course -- it was awesome, and needs no fixing, in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the way the course was broken up thematically but also chronologically - each lecture was distinct but made sense in relation to the others, and it was an easy progression to follow. I thought both of the midterms were fair, but I disliked the structure of the paper. We were given no guidelines for the assignment - I appreciate the flexibility of the assignment, but I think it would have been helpful for the students to have at least a short assignment sheet that outlined Professor Merriman and the TF's expectations a little more. ",
            "\u00a0More feedback during the first half of the course would be good. Amazing material, and Merriman is very knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-interesting lectures and movies\r\nWeakness-a little disorganized and too much reading ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the topics. We covered a lot of very important topics in modern France. We went in depth and also zoomed out and looked at the big picture. The weaknesses were mainly with the sections. We only really talked about the books and not about the course, or what was discussed in class ",
            "\u00a0The course could have a little more structure in terms of the lectures and reading materials week by week but all of the material and the lectures themselves were very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Nothing. This class is a gem and we're lucky to have Prof Merriman. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is interested in French history and wants to better understand France's relationship to Europe or the roots of France's politics today. ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome!! Best class to take with friends, and it will have you longing to go to France. The history is so fascinating and Merriman truly is a character. If you speak French, you'll enjoy his erratic bursts in French, and if you don't, you'll enjoy them just as much. ",
            "\u00a0Yes--the class is incredibly fun. Merriman is a great professor, and the readings/movies are incredibly interesting. Very fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. Professor Merriman is a legend in his field and is a great person to get to know. The readings and movies are worth the time investment. You will learn a lot about France today and in the past. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really terrific. Professor Merriman is one of Yale's finest teachers. You'll never meet someone more devoted to his students and the material. The workload is great--some really interesting readings, a few films, a midterm, an 8-10 page paper (on whatever interests you), and a final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I love marrimans course ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Not really because the professor was great but all over the place when talking. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to be taken credit/d/fail because your essay is a huge part of your grade. If you are really good at history essays then I would recommend it. Otherwise seek out guidance and make sure you know what the expectations are. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. You won't get bored in lecture and will most likely become very fond of Professor Merriman. The readings are also really good. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. I must say, however, that I hope an oral final is offered next year! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to other students! It serves as a great fifth class and exposes you to a crucial period in modern Western history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. Merrimack is one of the best lecturers Ive had at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are willing to roll with the punches ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this because Merriman is a fun lecturer and is always interesting to listen to. ",
            "\u00a0No its very TF dependent and arbitrary ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. 1) You learn fascinating things about France from a man who is brilliant and deeply loves the subject; 2) the workload is not at all overwhelming: one midterm, one final essay, and one final, and 3), John Merriman's TFs are somehow invariably fantastic. Definitely take it! You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is at all interested in history. It's not an overwhelming workload, and is very interesting, especially taught by Prof Merriman. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! However if you have a lot of knowledge about 20th century Europe this class is maybe unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes Merrimans great and the material is interesting ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Whether you know nothing about France or you live there, this class has something for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course based off of Professor Merriman's knowledge, warmth and teaching style. However, this style is not for everyone as it can feel at times a bit fragmented. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, I think it's a perfect, detailed overview of French history. You can't go wrong. "
