            "\u00a0I learned a more streamlined process for design, in this case costume design, but I feel like I can definitely apply some of the strategies we learned to other areas of design.  I learned a little history about clothing, especially from the 19th century. "

            "\u00a0I think all the benchmarks that were set during the semester helped me to stay on top of the work, and there were some great exercises we did during class that helped me improve rendering designs.  I wish we spent a little more time going over some of the terms for the costumes, somethings went straight over my head when we talked about them. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, sketching and coloring for projects were a very enjoyable experiences ",
            "\u00a0Everyone who cares about theatre should take this course.  You gain a real appreciation for costume designers and all the thought that goes into the work.  You also feel more connected to the texts and characters since you will have to make choices in your designs that are not necessarily implied on the page.  It was an interesting challenge to give personality to characters that were underwritten. "
