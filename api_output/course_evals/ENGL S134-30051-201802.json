            "\u00a0This being my first college level creative writing course, the class reviewed the basic elements of fiction writing, such as narrative structure and characterization. The class examined these elements of craft through reading and analyzing great pieces of literature, from short stories to novels. In addition, through a number of writing exercises and writing workshops, I gathered opinions from my fellows writers in the class and improved my own writing accordingly. ",
            "\u00a0During this course I learned a lot about the craft elements of writing and how to wield them most effectively in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a comprehensive and in-depth view into the elements of a traditional short story, from plot and character to description and point of view. This course also showed me how fruitful and healthy a writing workshop can be, and equipped me with the skills to be a constructive and supportive workshop participant. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to closer examine the technical and mechanical components of writing. This course was enlightening for me as a reader, but even more so as a writer. The detailed focus on everything from plot structure, characterization, dialogue, syntax and diction was a new look into the craft of writing that I very much enjoyed. "

            "\u00a0In the course, students learned different elements of craft through reading masterpieces, which, in my personal opinion, is a great way to approach creative writing. The students were not only able to see how different writers manipulated these elements of craft and create dramatic effects but also form their own opinions and develop their own styles and voices through the exploration of literature of various styles. However, since the summer session was highly condensed, it must be challenging for an English class to organize its readings. While a student in the class would read a novel in a week if the course were operated during the regular school year, students participating in this course during the summer had to finish a novel in a weekend, which was a lot of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We read a huge variety of short stories, ones that are representative of multiple cultures within the American literary tradition, which was great. The daily writing exercises were immensely helpful too in building skills in specifics of craft in a short period of time. The workshops of each others' stories were a highlight, in particular how we went in circles to state one good thing and one area of improvement. Such a workshop style resulted in very balanced feedback that both felt encouraging and constructive.  \r\nImprovement: I think the syllabus could include perhaps 1-2 short stories from different countries, to see how more non-American cultures may engage with the traditional short story format. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I don't have much to say on any pitfalls of this course. It was structured well, the materials for the course were more than engaging, class discussions were facilitated well, and the professor was more than helpful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who either has a background in the area (has taken at least one creative writing classes and some literature classes) or is interested and moderately skilled in writing but has never taken a creative writing class. Although the course assumes no previous knowledge of what is covered in the course, some knowledge in creative writing and literature would help a student participate in class discussions. A student also must be ready to read a lot and read something he or she does not like, since the reading in the course varies in time periods and styles. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I learned so much in the class and the material was really engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Sexton is a terrific instructor. His course is designed purposefully you learn about different aspects of a writer's craft then put it to practice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think any student who wishes to engage in creative writing must take this course. It was an entirely different outlook from any creative writing workshop or literature class I have taken at any other college. The course allowed us to look in detail at the mechanics of writing, which are so often overlooked. "
