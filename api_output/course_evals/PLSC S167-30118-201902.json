            "\u00a0This course offered me a broad range of knowledge on human rights. As a fundamental right of human beings, human rights are entitled with the genesis of human beings and justified by the sayings about the human dignity. I developed theoretical understanding about the human rights, including its genesis, justification, legislative tools, authoritative policies, and multi-disciplinary application of it. Also, I developed practical utilization of customary international laws, human rights based approach, good governance, global thinking, and local application. By taking a trip to the headquarter of Human Rights Watch and talking to the staff there, I was able to observe how the mechanism of running a non-governmental organization about human rights was, and apply that into my final essay tackling a real-world problem. This course also developed my ability to integrate knowledge from theoretical level to practical level fast and empowered me more principles to implement human rights based policies. ",
            "\u00a0I have gained insights on the fundamentals of human rights conditions around the world, the specific rights that humans have, and the international law and organs protecting human rights ",
            "\u00a0I've known more about how public policy works, how organizations like the UN and others co-operate together to make the world a better place. Now I'll be willingly to pay attention to human rights news all over the world. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the foundations of human rights and the institutions and mechanisms that help to protect human rights. ",
            "\u00a0This course honed my critical thinking skills and my ability to analyse an issue. I was able to broaden my perception of the framework of human rights and the level of accountability for the international community. I was able to discuss controversial and highly contentious issues, however, was then able to deconstruct them back and depoliticise the content areas. The diversity of the class was such a positive dynamic which enabled me and the other students to share our perspectives in a comfortable environment. Professor Zavala was an enlightening presence in the class and stimulated great discussion and debate. ",
            "\u00a0I have a better idea on human right based approach and the whole scheme of international human right protection. I challenged myself by reading English essays of more than 600 pages and conducting an independent research on a particular human right issue. I kown more about the human rights protection situation in Mexico, Austrilia and South Korea, thanks to my classmates' share. We talked about  problems about refugees and political persecution. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Zavala prepared enough amounts of readings for us to enrich ourselves with ample understandings of human rights principles. This course really urges you to learn something. For its essence as a seminar course, the efficient discussions in class also enable us to have a deeper understanding with the contents in the readings. Also, the instructions Professor Zavala gave to us are clear and made us easier to understand the readings. The pedagogy Professor Zavala used worked quite well within our class.\r\nWeaknesses: If there can be some weakness, I would suggest to explain more about the customary international law and its terms in Latin. As an essential part in the mid-term exam, we have to spend quite a lot of time to understand it, not to mention apply it to a real-world issue. It is difficult to study international law, but when this part cannot be ignored within the theme of human rights, I personally thought Professor Zavala can spend more time explaining that to us. Additionally, the goal for having this course can be clearer, like more theoretical or practical. If the former, I suggest us spending more time debating the genesis of human rights and the sayings from different philosophies. If the latter, I suggest us spending more time discussing the cases related to real-world issues and discussing the advice of our final essay, which is the public policy analysis and proposal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: have had a chance to evaluate in-depth reading around human rights\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some content was hard to assess and evaluate, might need more time to comprehend ",
            "\u00a0The course involves a field trip to UN Human Rights Watch, which deepened my understanding of the practical implementation of human rights protection. The requirements of the format of the final essay could be more timely and clear. ",
            "\u00a0More time can be used to explain international human rights law, especially for non-law students like me. ",
            "\u00a0The content of the course was extremely engaging but also difficult to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0The content and frameworks of human rights was very enlightening and engaging. However, I found some of the readings from the syllabus to be at times repetitive and broad. I would have preferred an initial focus on frameworks and theories of international human rights, followed by more specific case studies. Although, the limited time we do have for the summer does make this difficult and I believe we covered significant ground considering the time frame. ",
            "\u00a0We should talk over our reading materials in class, overwise it doesn't make sense why should we read a great bunch of files and essay. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThere are huge amounts of reading assignments to help students better understand the course.\r\nWeakness:\r\n1. There is not enough discussion about reading assignments in class.\r\n2. Sometimes it is difficult to understand the Latin terms. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. First, the topic of this course, international human rights, needs to be stressed and should be used to raise the awareness of the public. If this courses essence can be learnt by the public, there will be more people respecting, protecting, and promoting the human rights in a large scale. Second, this course itself urges students to learn a lot of things. From teaching the historical perspective of human rights to the present practical utilization of human rights organizations and tools to achieve the human rights based policies, it enables you to think about the different and various aspects mixing human rights studies, policy studies, and political sciences studies. It provided a comprehensive range of knowledge to the students, what the students may use in the future as a guidance of developing to be a better person or trying to create a better society. Last but not least, Professor Zavala himself is experienced at teaching us, the group of summer students coming from all over the world and with different ages and knowledge. Within the rigorous academic requirement Professor Zavala set to us, interesting things represent the essence of Yale summer that Same Veritas, More Lux. The field trip is a good opportunity for all students to enjoy academic and refreshing life. In all, this course made feel the vigor and rigor within the Yale courses that definitely needs to be recommended. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in learning more about human rights. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It completely broadened by understanding of human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I would not. I believe that I didn't get enough guidance from my professor, as well as the feedback. I received no feedback concerning my mid-term examination and my final essay, which is why I felt a little bit confused and disappointed when I know my grade. The class is about public policy, but I feel not very clear about the boundary of this class. ",
            "\u00a0It is a difficult class, challenging our ability to read, write and critically think. "
