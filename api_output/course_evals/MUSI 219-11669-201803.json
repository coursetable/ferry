            "\u00a0I learned basic aural, singing, and rhythmic skills in music. Moreover, I learned about some basic chromatic chords and the functions they accomplish. ",
            "\u00a0I was already fairly proficient at dictation, singing, and rhythm before taking the class, but I did gain a better understanding of the written side, including chord progressions. I also reconnected with piano, which I hadn't touched in almost a decade. ",
            "\u00a0Sight singing, ear training, overall musical sense. ",
            "\u00a0Dictation, singing, and rhythm practice were certainly helpful, but the biggest thing I learned was figured bass realization on piano. Keyboard labs taught me a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Very good for building a strong foundation in intermediate music theory, as well as practical skills that would greatly benefit any musician. ",
            "\u00a0Sight-singing, rhythmic and harmonic dictation were the primary focus of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to build upon my ear training skills, as well as keyboarding skills not in the strict sense of piano performance, but learning how to think in terms of figured bass and jazz notation, as well. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class has a very relaxed pace and atmosphere. It is an easy environment to learn and practice musical skills in. Sometimes, this course seemed a little disorganized and I feel that a little more organization might help to keep the course on track; however, the openness of this course did allow for us to take our own pace as a class and gave us the flexibility to tailor the class to our own desires and needs. Weekly keyboard labs were well-taught and really helped me to develop keyboard skills in figured bass reading. ",
            "\u00a0The class is incredibly laid back, making it one of the highlights of my day. Sitting in a small seminar and discussing music was a calming pleasure I never knew I needed. Furthermore, I feel like the material is well presented to teach students, and while I found it easier due to my prior musical experience, I think a newcomer would find it well taught. \r\nI think if anything the class could have a bit more material put into it. We spent a lot of time reviewing and just talking about random musical things, which I really enjoyed, but if we had delved a bit more into, say, jazz I would have enjoyed that too. ",
            "\u00a0The skill-based teaching method is very helpful. I would love for more direct applications such as real musical examples in songs/pieces-- but I am satisfied with the way the course went. ",
            "\u00a0A strength would be keyboard lab. A weakness would be that some sessions seemed to lack structure and were thus not especially productive ",
            "\u00a0The piano aspect of this course was a high point for me, but I do wish that the course included more graded assignments and quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lay in its ability to draw material from various sources, including rock music, making it more accessible and engaging. Weaknesses may have been in the way keyboarding lab was structured, with it almost being its own class in that it didn't directly interact with the main material, but having such little time allotted to it, shared with a partner. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course, as it really helped me to develop basic skills as a musician. I improved a lot over the course of this semester because of the skills we practiced in Music 219. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a fun way to become a better performer, and learn a little piano to boot, this is the class for you. If you want a super rigorous study of music theory, maybe the 210 211 track would serve you better? I wouldn't know, I haven't taken another music theory course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- take it with Nate. He will make sure you learn something. Especially if you are taking this class to take lessons for credit, Nate makes sure that it is not only a requirement, but also fun. Nate is incredibly smart, and seems to know literally everything about theory, but is not condescending. He makes relevant connections to music we listen to beyond classical music, and isn't afraid to bring in material that won't be on the exam, which really facilitates real learning. Class is organic and fun. Even though the material is certainly incredibly elementary for him, he has fun exploring different musical ideas with us, and answering any questions we may have about the music world at large. Most useful theory class I have ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- if a student is looking forward to a small and interesting music skill class. ",
            "\u00a0The keyboard lab is good, and if you need to take it for a pre-requisite, its fine, but I wouldnt recommend it to someone who doesnt have to take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would mainly recommend this course to performers. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a fun way of improving my aural skills, and I very much enjoyed the course. "
