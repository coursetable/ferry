            "\u00a0This was a good introduction to general relativity, a fundamental topic in physics that isnt really covered in the undergrad curriculum. It gave me a much better understanding of astronomical phenomena and cosmology. ",

            "\u00a0I leaned how to work with tensors, the basics of differential geometry, connection coefficients, the riemann curvature tensor, Euler Lagrange equations to apply the principle of least action to fields, metrics, how to derive simple metrics (radially symmetric in a vacume, radially symmetric with an electric field from a charged black hole, etc.) I learned about the geodesic equation, conformal mapping, cosmological models of spacetime, inflation, tests of general relativity like gravitational redshift, Shapiro time delay, the anomalous procession Mercury, etc. Then we covered gravitational radiation. I honestly still don't feel like I get the vauge invariance part of the derivation but hopefully grad E&M will help that. ",

            "\u00a0I loved the material we covered, though I could've done with fewer \"applications\" and more rigorous theoretical stuff. ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome because it exposes you to a totally new branch of physics! (and if you, like me, don't take enough math classes, than to new math as well.) Most physics classes build on a set of principles and formalizms that you already know, but the leap of thinking about gravity as geometry is totally different. I feel very empowered by this class to learn more about GR now.\r\nI think having the math introduction at the beginning is very useful and well paced. It also helped that psets forced you to continuously practice certain concepts. I think the psets were the right length and the questions were challenging enough to make me push myself and feel very rewarded when I figured them out. \r\nProfessor Skiba is also a great strength of this course when I took it!

            "\u00a0Yes. GR is very important. ",
            "\u00a0For reference, I'm an undergraduate. I thought that the psets were harder than in most of the undergrad physics classes (e.g. the 440/441 psets took me ~ 7 hrs, whereas the GR psets took me ~15 hrs). The length of the psets totally depends on the professor. The material was challenging at the beginning because a lot of the differential geometry stuff was new to me, but it got easier as the class went on. So like steep learning curve, but ultimately not that bad. ",
