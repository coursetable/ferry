            "\u00a0Important understanding the the centrality of colonial global history & theory. ",
            "\u00a0Intro to Third World Studies has been the most meaningful, engaging, and important class that I feel I have taken in my Yale career so far. This class is a comprehensive overview of the power dynamics that are at play throughout our society, and how the theories of radical liberation from thinkers across what has been called the Third World can be applied to our everyday lives as \"subject-selves\" within the formation of society. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely incredible and has become my favorite course that I have taken at Yale. This course helped me develop a new way of thinking about myself and the world. I learned how to question the way education can shape students. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned a lot of background about Third World Studies and the Third World Liberation Front that has been really critical for my other classes and my major (ER&M) in general. ",
            "\u00a0This class made me reevaluate my life like never before. Its one of those classes that everyone should take to learn about the social constructs that create our privilege. If there is ever a mandatory ethnic studies requirement that all Yalies must take, this is the one I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The phrase \"third world\" contains a lot of negative stigma today in the United States, and many students, including myself, came into this class not understanding what it meant in this context. This class broke down the origins of third world studies, how it exists in opposition to ethnic studies, and introduced many readings and concepts that form the basis for a critical theory that goes beyond academia as we know it. Ultimately, I learned about the importance of third world studies and critiquing the institutions that create what we take to be true. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me more than any other class Ive ever taken at Yale. The way that you view the world and yourself throughout the semester will be profoundly changed and consistently challenged. The class touches on topics from imperialism and  colonialism to pan africanism and critical white studies. In a nutshell, it will show you how power build structures to protect itself and how you are built by these structures. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me many insights into myself, my peers, Yale, history, and the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to talk about the theory we discussed in this course. ",
            "\u00a0How to see from new perspectives and understand how to communicate with intention to better the world ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically evaluate social theory and learned to consider myself in relation to them. I feel like my knowledge of Third World subjects grew exponentially and I was taught to criticise elements of my education and upbringing in a global context. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me understand the issues of the Third Word, specifically in regards to the ideologies which shaped it and the vocabulary necessary to describe oppression. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so wonderful - only wish I had the chance to take it earlier in my Yale career, as many of the texts were referenced in my other courses. ",
            "\u00a0How to think more critically and a different insight on the world and how it was and continues to be shaped by colonialism ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton from this course (almost an insane amount of information). By the end, I feel like I learned a ton about the various theories and concepts that not only make up Third World Studies but have applicability to my everyday life. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I learned A TON in this course. It gave me a great comprehensive overview of important topics in contemporary third world studies as well as in the study of ethnicity, race, and migration. I gained a new analytical skill when approaching the study of everyday social interactions and institutions, and feel that this course has given me important historical contexts to current political and social events and phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a foundational knowledge in the thinkers who comprise Third World Studies, touching in decolonization, anti racism and the intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to assess readings in the Third World Studies curriculum and gained a greater understanding of my own subject position as a Third World Woman. "

            "\u00a0The strengths was Prof. Okihiro's wisdom, in conjunction w that of the TFs. Also, many of the readings were exceptionally interesting.\r\n\r\nThe class suffered from disorganization. On the whole, it was disorienting to discuss the lecture from the week before in section -- an example of a small problem that could have easily been fixed to facilitate learning. Also, there were too many readings for each class. ",
            "\u00a0This class urges us to question every standard of society that has been normalized or naturalized as truth, and methodologies as well as histories of understanding and opposing controls that mean to restrict or exploit personal autonomy and agency. It is a very comprehensive survey of thinkers from around our transnational globe and their written interaction and understanding of their communities as they experience the effects of western imperialism and colonialism. There are no weaknesses that I can see. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the material is really interesting, and Prof. Okirio clearly knows what he is talking about. That said, there was, at times, an excessive amount of reading, and Prof. Okihiro's lectures were sometimes hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Only weakness is that there is a lot of reading each week but its super doable to work with other people in the class to get it done. Also, the TAs are great at summarizing and contextualizing the readings in section so you will understand what you are expected to know from each author. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing course that teaches incredibly important material. It's an intro class so we discuss different themes for only a short amount of time, but the information still feels very in depth. I do wish we got more feedback throughout the course, like comments on the weekly reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0I overall enjoyed this course but thought the prompts for the finale essay and reading responses could have been more clear/specific. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: inspiring material, inspiring teacher ",
            "\u00a0I think the topic is extremely broad and that makes it hard to navigate often; there is so much information to learn or understand. But also that't the beauty of the course which seeks to understand so much in a global context and not prioritise some things over others. i do think the course could be improved by focusing some of the material and making it clearer. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by more clearly defining key terms and how they relate to the material. Terms that are essential to its structure such as capitalism, neo-liberalism, neo-colonialism, etc.\r\n\r\nI also think lecture could be better structured and not have as many tangents, even though they are really interesting, they make it hard to focus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are definitely the TAs and Professor Okihiro! They were all very helpful and open to answering questions, and very much cared about all of the students taking this course. This course is phenomenal, one of my favorite courses at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0Organization could be improved, readings could be reduced to allow for better engagement with them, and maybe making the course 50 minutes instead of 1 h 15 minutes. I enjoyed doing the weekly reading responses, which were simple and straightforward. I do wish that there had been fewer readings every week. It would help a lot if Professor Okihiro gave an overview of his lecture, maybe with key words or concepts in order to make it easier to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the positive environment, the pertinence of the material, and the constant assistance provided by the professor and the TFs. Weaknesses include unstructured and sometimes confusing lectures and insufficient time in section/class to discuss the readings. ",
            "\u00a0There was a heavy reading load. However, Professor Okihiro and the TAs did a great job explaining the concepts in lecture and section. I was never bored in this class - it was really engaging. The concepts can be personally overwhelming because they still have such salience to how one sees themselves and others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, engaging lectures and discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings were a bit too long (shortening them and pulling out important sections for students could be useful), and sometimes I felt that readings needed to be summarized and discussed a bit more comprehensively than they were (I wish we could go over and talk about the major points in each reading after having finished them), also, I did not necessarily feel like I received a ton of feedback on how I was doing in the course; I wish I had a bit more feedback on my weekly responses just so I could know whether or not I was reading and interpreting them correctly ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of material and Professor Okihiro is a great Professor. The reading could feel overwhelming at times. Overall, a great opportunity to learn from a wonderful professor and to read a lot of important thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good survey course, that is not very challenging, particularly for people who have taken some ER&M, AFAM or AMST courses before.  There are a lot of readings, but many of them will look familiar, and can easily be skimmed while still performing well in the course.  The TFs were both nice to know and helpful, while Professor Okihiro is a very nice and warm professor.  His lecture style sometimes was not the most engaging, but the discussion sections were always a positive experience.  The work of the class to learn with both the teachers and the other students was interesting, and overall it was a not particularly challenging, if at times less engaging course.  1 hour and 15 minutes as a time slot felt long for this course. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings and Professor Okihiro. Professor Okihiro was always so kind and liked to check in on his students. He was always very open and expressive and I found that crucial to my learning in the class. I would push for a smaller class size to facilitate more in class discussions but other than that this class was my absolute favorite this semester. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is one of the few classes that engages with the notion of Third World Studies, as a result of the fact that Okihiro invented the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, taking this class has fundamentally transformed how I see the world and the intention that can be seen behind every action that takes place, to define our relationship with each other and the land that gives us life. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. This course will change the way you think about the world and the way you think about yourself. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. Everyone should have a background in Third  World Studies, whether or not you are an ER&M major. The literature you read is foundational to ethnic/third world studies, and you will hear these names come up again and again. Also, this class helped me a ton with my other classes in History, WGSS, African Studies, and American Studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class  changed my life (and my major!!) \r\n100% would recommend, its not what you think it is and thats the best part. Professor Okihiro is incredible and I loved every lecture and every section. Take it and if you cant atleast shop it. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this class!!! Its one of those classes that you cant leave Yale without taking. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone at Yale should take this class. It teaches you how to critically assess and recognize power in all its articulations. At the end of the course you will understand the power, race, class and gender relations that make the world the way it is and what you can do about it. You will also understand your own place in these relations- essentially, this is the kind of class most of us came to Yale to take. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Everyone should take this class. Professor Okihiro is funny and brilliant! The material is extremely interesting. To me the title of the course was a bit misleading, in that it's not about the third world in the sense of specific locations, but rather theorizing of the third world studies movement and the significance of colonization and imperialism. There is a lot of reading but you don't really need to do all of it. One midterm in class essay test, weekly reading responses, and a final take home essay. ",
            "\u00a0I would hesitantly recommend. It was pretty easy and a good fifth class but also was more work that I originally expected. The lectures are usually pretty engaging and Okihiro is the BEST but know that they are just generally him thinking out loud and are not super organized. So I think it is a great class for some types of learners but not all! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will and have recommended this class to everyone. You learn so much about yourself and others, truly opens eyes and opens hearts ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- it is a really important course; I read so many new things by so many indigenous, woman non Western writers. I learned to consider my life and education very differently. ",
            "\u00a0AMAZING COURSE. Definitely should be required to all ER&M majors. I think everyone at Yale should take this class to be honest. Regardless of what background you come from, there is something to learn. It is courses like this that help dissipate the air of elitism within Yale and make us clearly aware of our privileges as university students living in the First World. It is important for everyone to be aware of the systems of oppression in order to understand why developing nations struggle so much and to se them beyond a number communicating their GDP. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE!! Professor Okihiro is so sweet and filled with so much knowledge, the material is interesting to read and both lecture and section get into the texts pretty well, and I felt very engaged with a lot of what was said. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it engages with critical concepts important to all students taking humanities courses. It provides a broad overview of a variety of topics, and Professor Okihiro's style of teaching is unique and engaging. However, if you don't really like learning a lot about theory this may not be the course for you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Okihiro is amazing!! Learn from him while you can!! We need to value elders like Okihiro in our community at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I think the content is super important for everyone to consider and really changed how I look at the world and how I approach issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This course is challenging but very engaging and will really change the way you think. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students if they are interested in ER&M. The course gives a great introduction to some important theories and thinkers in sociology and ethnic studies, and Professor Okihiro is very engaging and approachable. There is not a ton of regular feedback from TFs in the course which can mean it's kind of hard to tell how you are doing, but the class is super interesting and Professor Okihiro's lectures are super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! The material is very interesting and vital for understanding decolonization and anti racism. Plus, Professor Okihiro is a wonderful Professor and a wonderful person. ",
            "\u00a0This course should be a distribution requirement. It is just as important as QR, Sc, and writing, if not more. I believe this class empowers students to actively challenge systems of power that have kept Yale alive. Our world would be a much better place if this course was available to all. "
