            "\u00a0While taking this course, I began to think about the role indigenous feminisms plays on my life, both academically and culturally. I believe this course should be taught more often due to the level of critical thinking that is involved in this course. This class brought together different topics dealing with ethnicity, race, indigeneity, sexuality, and gender studies. We had to lead discussions, hold crucial conversations, and address Indigenous feminisms from an academic and personal perspective. ",
            "\u00a0This course brought me to an understanding of how \"modern\" (in the sense of modernism) Western sexuality and gender came about for the purposes of colonization which, as a WGSS major, I think has really changed how I approach all of the work I do. I learned to analyze gendered and sexual through a decolonial lens, and to look at decolonization through a gendered and sexuality-based lens. This class was fantastic and also introduced me to a range of scholars working through indigenous feminisms. ",
            "\u00a0my understanding of what sovereignty is was completely challenged (I went from not even knowing what it means to somehow knowing less), I realized how narrow minded I was in so many ways, and how lacking my incorporation of Indigenous Feminisms was in my academic curriculum and other epistemologies ",
            "\u00a0I have been taking ER&M courses for 3 years, and this is the very first time that I had explicitly encountered Indigenous feminist scholars. I feel like the knowledge I gained here went so far beyond the classroom in regards to my politics, solidarity, understanding of indigenous movements, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the theories and complications that lie in Indigenous Feminisms (Like why is it feminisms and not feminism). This course introduced me to so many important scholars that I wouldn't have known without it. Further, as an Indigenous woman, I learned how important my collective history is to my current situation. ",
            "\u00a0The class indigenous feminisms taught me a lot about not only native history, but also how native culture has been warped by colonization. Exploring different writings by indigenous feminist authors was at times emotionally challenging but also insightful and necessary for exploring personal growth. ",
            "\u00a0Indigenous feminisms are necessary when thinking about what it means to be Indigenous, both for people who are and people who are not. Indigenous feminisms is not supposed to be tokenized or excluded from a broader feminist conversation, but is entirely its own. It requires settlers to look at themselves and their privilege and their roles in making an Indigenous identity reductive, and I learned so much that has already applied to my own life. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding and appreciation for Indigenous Feminisms as a methodology and critical practice. Our readings and weekly class discussions pushed me towards new frameworks for understanding what theoretical resistance to settler colonialism might look like within the academic work I do. ",
            "\u00a0The most obvious answer to this question is that I learned about Indigenous feminisms, that I was able to read and learn from so many Indigenous scholars that helped me reframe my conceptualizations of resistance and also call myself and my community out. Less obvious but just as important was the fact that this class taught me what it's like to come into a room and challenge everything you thought you knew, how to learn from your peers as much as your (wonderful) professor, and how to walk with people in their struggle instead of simply be sympathetic to it. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to learn about different Indigenous perspectives and understandings of feminism, and it helped me to place them in conversation with one another. I felt that I learned about the concept of Indigenous peoples' sovereignty in greater depth, and I feel that I can better describe this word's complexity in relation to Indigenous peoples within the US.

            "\u00a0Strengths: The wide array of topics, the intimate classroom structure, the level of engagement, and the instructor.\r\nWeakness: The reading load was a lot for a seminar; the amount of time we met, I think it would be better if we meet more often. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredible. It was hard to do all of the readings for each week, but each reading was so so rich. The range of topics covered made me feel like I left the class with a solid grasp on the breadth of indigenous feminisms, although of course it's not possible to know the full reach of such a huge field. This class is a necessary and strong intervention into the WGSS department, centering questions of sovereignty and decolonization in studies of gender and feminism. Also, the structure of the assignments was so helpful and practical as we all got to share our ideas and really make a move on campus. My only issue with the course was that, while our discussions of indigenous feminisms was in-depth, when we brought in other groups' social movements the characterizations of those movements used in the class were sometimes over-simplified. Having said that, it was not the focus of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course, I am not sure there was anything I would change. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: reading list, Dean Fayard, high weight of participation in seminar makes people participate which is important\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of, except for the fact that this course is only offered every couple of years it seems ",
            "\u00a0We need more native faculty and WGSS classes taught by native faculty. Improve the access to resources of the professor by providing a TA and graders. Pay your professors. ",
            "\u00a0This course is so strong because of Professor Fayard and her passion for our class. She came up with such a thorough syllabus that I still cannot stop thinking about which helped facilitate incredible conversations. She also is such a personable professor that it her interest in any subject is pretty infectious and makes students interested who may have had very little prior knowledge to this subject, or who literally live out Indigenous feminisms in their own lives. A weakness is that Professor Fayard was not getting paid for her work as a professor! That is still so terrible and if anyone can pay her compensation out of the WGSS department or whatever retroactively, I think they should. Her class has been the best class I have taken here at Yale, and it is pretty much all because she was the one teaching it. Who knows when the next Indigenous Feminisms class will ever be taught since Yale only has one tenured Native professor who specializes in History/ER&M. Not Indigenous Feminisms. We need more Native professors. Another strength is that Professor Fayard empowered everyone in her class whether they were a settler or Indigenous and I am so grateful to have had a professor who believed in me and all of my classmates so much. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings that were assignedthey covered an extremely large depth and breadth of the field of Indigenous Feminisms. Dean Fayards instruction was massively helpful in the context of our class discussions as well as the assignments I turned in to her. Having discussions led by pairs of students was somewhat hit or miss throughout the semestersometimes the discussions ran very smoothly and productively, other weeks they were more stagnant and felt like we were only getting through summaries of the readings. However, Dean Fayard was usually very good those weeks at stepping in and pointing the discussion back in productive directions. ",
            "\u00a0The themes of the course were incredibly well developed and Dean Fayard is amazing. I'd say perhaps the only thing (and this was sort of fixed later on) is that the syllabus was a little too overwhelming in the beginning, which made discussions a little bit more difficult since everyone would do different readings (since it was pretty impossible to do all of them). All the readings are of course amazing and important, but I think prioritizing would help keep students from being overwhelmed. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class had engaging readings that helped expand my understandings of the main topics of the course immensely. Class discussions made it so that I learned so much from listening to others in the room, and I wouldn't change anything about this course. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. 11/10 ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course and think every WGSS major should take it. At many points, the readings deconstructed and critiqued modes of knowledge production I have seen too readily endorsed in other WGSS classes. We read entire books, which I found helpful to seeing how full arguments pan out and develop within a field. The classroom community was really strong and collaborative, and it felt like everyone felt they had a stake in the learning. ",
            "\u00a0100%! The knowledge is so crucial to everything, and was helpful for me at least in examining my own epistemologies and in considering ways in which my mind may still be operating in colonial frameworks and helping me question it, plus the people in the class and Dean Fayard are just amazing (*cries*) ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely amazing course that should be kept. Its very unfortunate that Dean Fayard is leaving. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Indigenous feminisms is a critical perspective, not only for Indigenous students but also for anyone else living in the so-called United States. The readings are challenging and insightful and provocative, forcing you to grapple with uncomfortable topics and ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course should be a requirement for every major at Yale, but especially every ER&M major. This course is absolutely critical to my formation as an academic and as a human being. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Sadly, Yale doesn't value Native Studies so I'm not sure if this course will be taught again. Please talk to your departments about the importance of making sure this course is offered yearly - we have to make Native Studies sustainable. ",
            "\u00a0'Indigenous Feminisms' is absolutely spectacular! If the opportunity arises to take this course, take this course. It provides the depth and the analysis of Indigenous feminine knowledge along with ally-ships in other women of color feminisms. This course fills in the gaps between AMST, ER&M, and WGSS. I highly recommend this course because each week, the topics are super interesting and the discussions were thought-provoking and engaging. The knowledge learned in this course is influencing my perspective on all of my scholarship. This second iteration of the course was taught by Dr. Kelly Fayard - a true mentor and leader. Take this course! Demand this course! Indigenous Feminisms is our future! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If other departments @ER&M @WGSS @AMST would fucking hire more Native academics! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Learning about Indigenous Feminisms as an animated methodology has totally shifted the ways I think academically and the kinds of projects that feel meaningful to pursue. The class was very helpful for me as a white settler to critically think through my positionality and ownership within systems of settler colonialism as well as conceptualizing ways to divest myself my whiteness and participation in colonialism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%, but only if you know when you can talk and when you should listen. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. This class helped me to formulate a lens through which to engage with all of my other studies, and I think it's an essential lens to engage with the world with. "
