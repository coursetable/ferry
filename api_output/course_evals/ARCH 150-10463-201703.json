            "\u00a0I learned some cool history about famous and lesser known buildings and architects. I developed some drawing skills and knowledge about historical contexts. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first architecture course I have ever taken, so I learned a lot about the history and theory of architecture as an art, as well as the principles behind architectural design. I also developed my drawing skills through the weekly assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better drawer in addition to developing a different frame of thought around architecture, particularly the architecture around campus. ",
            "\u00a0This courses forces you to develop your skills with drawing through weekly drawing assignments that you present in section. I was worried about this going into the course, given my lack of experience with visual arts, but it turned out to not be a problem at all. People start with all levels of experience, and I certainly improved a lot. The actual lecture of the course focuses on various themes throughout architecture, giving each a 1 to 2 lecture treatment. There are also two design projects and a paper, but these are all very manageable (and the design projects were quite enjoyable) ",
            "\u00a0Really helped me with my drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I have a much deeper appreciation for what architecture is about; it's about many things, and different people throughout history have different impressions. Now, I can walk around my everyday life, and I know to ask what the designers were thinking when they were creating that space. I can also ask how effective were their choices. I have a whole new understanding of my visual environment. Also, now I know about line hierarchy, which can be helpful when drawing out diagrams. ",
            "\u00a0This class really opened my eyes to the different ways to understand and analyze buildings. It has been very eye-opening to see the number of ways a building can be constructed and all of the elements that go into a single structure. On top of this analytical skill, this class has enhanced my artistic capabilities. Through the weekly sketch assignments and the drawings in class, my ability to translate an object from vision or though to paper has improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Learn how to appreciate buildings from practical perspectives (not much theory) ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about architecture and architectural thinking. My drafting skills significantly improved. Because of the lectures, I noticed things that otherwise seemed unimportant in the design of buildings all around me. ",
            "\u00a0I now feel like I am more aware of my surroundings - specifically, I tend to look up more and notice what is around me, which is quite refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0From Professor Purves's lectures, I learned a lot about the foundations of architectural design, and about seeing the world through an architectural lens. In particular, lecture changed the way I look Yale's campus and New Haven by teaching me about the history, context, detail, and beauty of the space around us. I also learned a lot about what architecture is and how it works, and how to think architecturally.\r\n\r\nFrom section meetings and assignments, I improved my drawing skills and my ability to represent architectural objects in a way that is easy to understand for viewers. Before the course, I was totally unpracticed in any kind of drawing, especially architectural drawing. The course gave me the opportunity to practice my drawing regularly, and pushed me to think about how my drawings would be seen by others. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a basic survey of (mostly Western) architecture and architectural concepts. It was more abstract than I expected but was definitely interesting. It also taught me how to observe more closely and be more creative. I improved my drawing skills through this course - the assignments are diverse and encourage you to experiment. It definitely gave me a greater appreciation of architecture and the spaces around me, and also because of the focus on Yale's architecture, allowed me to appreciate Yale's buildings more! ",
            "\u00a0Intro to Architecture doesn't teach you how to be an architect, but it gives you an appreciation to the attention to detail that architects put into simple, everyday structures and objects. You learn to understand humans' relationships with nature, materials, other humans, and the greater world around us. This class is definitely more philosophy of architecture than a technical drawing class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the emphasis on making in this class! ",

            "\u00a0I look at buildings and the built world differently. I can better draw and analyze 3-D structures. I have some idea of the history of architecture and how to approach an architecture design problem. ",
            "\u00a0Arch 150 taught me how to look at the space I inhabit in a new way. Not only did I become more aware of the details around me and the different ways in which a space is organized, but I also learned about the different reasonings behind these choices. With the weekly assignment, I was able to exercise creativity and practice my drawing skills. I was encouraged to try out new media, and used charcoal for the first time and experimented with different pens and colors. I felt that this class made me much more comfortable depicting something I see into a representation that others can understand. The readings also offered insight the thought processes of certain architects and the characteristics of some architectural styles. ",
            "\u00a0A good introduction to architecture concepts ",

Walking through the streets of New Haven has become a much more thrilling and delightful experience thanks to the insights we were able to develop through this class. \r\nMy drawing skills have also greatly developed throughout this semester. Simply practicing and doing many sketches has brought more freedom and perspective in my approach to drawing. ",
            "\u00a0Increased attention to detail, I noticed more as I looked around at all the human constructs that surround me in a city or town. Also an increased awareness of the way our mindset be shaped in unconsious ways, and of the economic/urban planning aspects of architecture and art. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class, I have been given greater insight of the methodology of architecture, and how it serves to shape our experiences as human beings. In addition, this class has enlightened me on the difficulties and constraints an architect must contend with in designing a structure. Lastly, taking this class has helped me come one step further to deciding what my major will be, whether it be Architecture or Computing and the Arts. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing skills, basic overview of architectural concepts/vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of drawing. Additionally, I learned how to see the the world through the eyes of an architect. ",
            "\u00a0I really improved my drawing and visual thinking skills. I became more willing to take risks and try things. \r\n\r\nI learned how to see the world around me better, and how to see past the surface of a building. I also learned a little bit about other disciplines within architecture, such as theory. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of architecture on every scale, from the small details like materiality and light to the macro, like building organizations and the spatial organization of cities. ",
            "\u00a0The foremost thing I learned was to evaluate the world I exist in differently, whether that be spatially, functionally, or aesthetically. This class really showed my how to think and observe in a way that I had never encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different ways to study and analyze architecture - both in the sense of buildings and cities - as well as how to translate what I see to a drawing on paper. ",
            "\u00a0All around, Intro to Architecture with Prof Purves was an excellent course. I'm a senior economics major and decided to take this class because of my interest in architecture as well as my desire to take a class that was completely different than my major. If you are even remotely interested in architecture, I would highly, highly recommend taking Arch 150. You will gain a better understanding of \"space\" and how to interpret it, while also getting to hone your drawing and creative skills. Prof. Purves is an absolute gem; it was clear that he has taught this course countless times and has essentially perfected it. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing, visualizing, making, appreciating architecture and structure ",
            "\u00a0I learned to see world in a new way. Now when I look at buildings, I focus on different details and ask different questions. I learned a lot about sketching and how to use different materials to describe the built world around me. I think this is a course that you only get out of it what you put in. I put a lot of thought into my sketches and gained so much from learning to draw and the different materials. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths are Professor Purves's extensive knowledge that he is able to share. He has great enthusiasm and his presentations are always well done. \r\nThere are many weaknesses to this course: it says you don't need to be an aspiring architect to take the class but if you can't draw or have no experience there is no support and your grade is hugely based on your drawing capabilities. The lectures move fast and no textual explanations are posted for the slides so if you didn't catch something the first time there is no chance to figure it out. It's totally western centered--he's up front about this, but still it can feel frustrating. The final design project has very little to do with architecture, the paper is so random and unsupported. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the lecture. Professor Purves is an extraordinary teacher and very engaging lecturer who clearly is passionate about this class. Every lecture was filled to the brim with new insights.\r\nThe weakness is the grading structure. Literally no one know what grade they have in this class, it could be absolutely anything. Feedback on assignments was always given through vague and general comments, but never any grades. This makes it nearly impossible to know how you're doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed how the lectures were really easy to just sit back and listen to. They were very digestable, for the most part, and relaxing in that it was easy to just listen and understand Professor Purves' positions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a huge weakness of the course if that you literally have zero clue what your grade is all along. This is very stressful as a Yale student! You will get minimal feedback. There is a paper and problem set due during the class, as well as a final project, all of which you will not get a single grade back on or know how much of your grade these constitute. Extremely stressful! It's really hard to tell how much effort you should put into things. A little more transparency on grading would go a long way. ",
            "\u00a0Alec is a great lecturer, but I wasn't as big a fan of some of the guest lecturers that make up the latter half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite part of this class was the lectures! ",
            "\u00a0The regular lectures with Professor Purves were fantastic ... very clear and interesting in all regards. That said, the guest lecturers were not helpful whatsoever. I found that all of them came across as pretentious, using complicated artsy terms that didn't have any clearly defined meaning and which just confused everyone. Moreover, one of them even took the opportunity to promote his own book at multiple points. In particular, the last guest lecture of the semester involved a string of words being put together that thematically seemed to have something to do with architecture, but certainly had no correlation between them in any way resembling English grammar. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture with Alec Purves is excellent. It would be great if there was a bit more reference to non-Western architecture. Section can be quite tricky for people who aren't artistic and there are also no grades during the semester so maybe take the course Credit-D. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The lectures were really, really wonderful. Overall, the class just gives a wonderful introduction to what architecture is about, which is very impressive considering how rich the field is. Yet, I can walk away feeling like I have a deeper understanding, which is something that Yale classes do not necessarily do a good job of sometimes.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There were two guest lectures that I didn't really like: globalization and ornaments. I didn't really understand what the point of the globalization lecture was. As for the ornaments lecture, the introduction to the history could have been cut down significantly. Otherwise, the rest of the lectures where he started showing pictures was really cool. \r\nAlso, the TA's kept going over time for the section meetings. It becomes really unfair, because some students would get a lot of feedback during section, while other students would barely get any feedback. Also, the TAs would email us about certain things we have to do, which is fine, except that their emails usually only arrive a day or two before the assignment is due, so it doesn't give us a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class would be the course content and potential to learn and improve. However, there are a number of weaknesses. Lectures, while interesting, tended to become overwrought and boring towards the end. Additionally, guest lecturers were very hard to follow, often problematic, and simply boring. The weekly sketch assignments really helped further my artistic capabilities, but they are extremely time-consuming, and the course favors those with artistic backgrounds. Finally, there is absolutely no understanding of grades. While I think there are more important aspects of learning than grades, we still have to receive grades, so there should be some form of insight into how we are doing. ",
            "\u00a0This course is super interesting. I have started to look at buildings on my way ever since! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was a very well taught course. I enjoyed the lectures (though less so the guest lecturers) and the assignments. I would like the way the final is presented to be slightly altered. For the final project, each student was asked to produce a design and present it to a panel of architecture professors. Unfortunately we were not allowed to explain the concept behind the designs themselves due to the nature of the silent presentation. I would have liked to have had a dialogue with the viewer about the piece I created. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of this course, for me, was the TFs. I absolutely loved Izzy and Amanda, and they were incredibly helpful and supportive.\r\n\r\nI found that having the readings all online did not work well for me. I would like it better if there was a main book that we could purchase/rent because I would feel more inclined to then do the readings. This might just be a personal problem though... ",
            "\u00a0The class features wonderful lectures, by Professor Purves and many excellent guests. The assignments are interesting and worthwhile, and for the most part are paced reasonably even for students with no background in art or architecture.\r\n\r\nOne weakness was the structure of section meetings. Although my TFs were very competent, helpful, and kind, I often felt that the feedback I got on my assignments during section was too vague to allow me to grow from week to week. My TFs were encouraging to everyone in the class, which is really important, but this sometimes came at the expense of receiving more concrete feedback on ways to improve. Moreover, no grades are released on any assignments at any point in the course. While this does minimize discouragement and stress to some extent, it also makes it very difficult to gauge progress in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Please be more transparent about the grading system. Would be great if readings had something to do with lecture or section. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course as a beginner, knowing nothing about architecture and not intending to major in it. I was still able to follow along and learn from the professor, and I think this course does a good job of catering to all levels. The sketchbook assignments and design projects encourage creativity, and  I also enjoyed the paper, which was in a style I had never written in before. I appreciated the incorporation of examples from different cultures into the lectures. I think I'd like to see more of that, and I also thought that most of the guest lectures weren't as informative and engaging as Professor Purves' lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is Professor Purves, who has a deep love of and connection to architecture and humanity. He clearly articulates his thoughts so that we can understand the motives of the architects that he is talking about. The weekly discussion sections are a good place to work on developing your drawing skills, as you can see different techniques from your peers that are better artists than you. One big weakness of this course is that you have no idea what your grade is going to be. We have weekly sketchbook assignments, a paper, and a final review, and you don't receive a single grade the entire semester. As I write this, I still don't know if I'll get an A- or a C. Who knows. ",
            "\u00a0I  wish the course included more design problems.\r\n\r\nI also think some of the lectures were incredibly dense and seemed irrelevant to the material.\r\n\r\nOverall, wonderful course! ",
            "\u00a0The class had three aspects, the readings, sections, and lectures, which were poorly connected. I did not feel like my understanding of one informed my understanding of the others. ",
            "\u00a0Great TAs, but no grades throughout the course so it is difficult to know how you are doing. ",
            "\u00a0The TFs are all very encouraging and engaging. I did not have to reach out for them to provide helpful tips and ways to improve. ",
            "\u00a0Fascinating course, don't have to do readings really, but you don't get ANY grades until literally right now as I'm filling out this evaluation ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It really forces you to think as an architect would, and sometimes that's challenging. There's also some instruction on \"how to draw\" versus in other classes there is none.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have appreciated more \"how to draw\" and at times the workload was very high, because it took me 3x the time to make an ok drawing as someone who was experienced to make a very good drawing. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures - Alec is a wiz. The TAs were all very involved and constituted most of the student-admin relations in the course. Most of the guest lecturers were absolutely terrible, but it was great when Alec stepped in. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are sometimes hard to follow, and the professor dims the lights so it is easy to fall asleep. Th material and sections are very interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments are fun, engaging, and reasonable. The lectures are very interesting. The only weaknesses are that nothing is graded until the very end of the course so it's hard to gauge if you're working hard enough or making enough progress in your TAs eyes. Also, the guest lectures at the end of the semester are pretty terrible compared to the regular lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing lectures! Great sketch and project assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Class contents sometimes may seen jumping and vague\r\n\r\nHomeworks are interesting ",
            "\u00a0Readings weren't mentioned much in section since the focus was on sketchbook assignments. Would have been nice to discuss those more. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were engaging and informative. Drawing assignments were interesting and took as much time as you wanted them to. Section was an excellent counterbalance to lecture, allowing for good personal feedback and a chance to see other student's work. The only thing that could maybe be improved would be more help in teaching the design process prior to hands on projects. Some students struggled to come up with ideas and construct good models, a discussion of iterative design would have been beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were enjoyable and most of the assignments were good too.\r\n\r\nOnly weakness is that the TAs may have been almost too encouraging and didn't criticize our assignments enough ",
            "\u00a0My strengths were the drawings and the understanding of the concepts we learned. I felt less certain about my design ability and my ability with constructing accurate architectural renderings. I think the course could allow for a broader spectrum of artistic approaches, or specifically give instruction on how to draw and design in a certain way. ",
            "\u00a0The class was great for non-architecture majors, and I'm now more aware and observant of details. One topic I would've liked was an overview of all the architectural styles and maybe a bit on their histories. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures for this course were some of the most enjoyable, accessible, and engaging lectures of any I've seen at this school. \r\n\r\nI would have appreciated more specific feedback in section though. This is a required course for architecture majors but is also taken by many students who have no drawing experience or interest in architecture long-term, so I think it could have benefitted from a separation of those groups: it was probably annoying for the inexperienced people in my section to listen to the critiques of the more experienced students, and I feel like those students could have benefitted more from seeing the work of other people at their level. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting, engaging... could be improved by incorporating the reading list more thoroughly into the class. I learned about architecture from Purves but dont feel like i got a great sense of the classs texts / how they all fit together. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n      A wonderful lecturer, excellent readings and a engaging variety of topics covered. \r\n      Lots of optional, extra material provided for those who are interested. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses \r\n      The unusual and unhelpful grading policy (hint: there was none). \r\n      Not clear that the feedback on assignments really helped student learning. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the design problems! as well as the drawing assignments. Having smaller sections was helpful. \r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved by having fewer course readings, but being more clear about which readings should be read. Because there were so many readings listed, I ended up almost never doing any of them. TA feedback was also pretty helpful when we got it. I would have appreciated more frequent feedback from my TAs, and  more constructive criticism! I think they were generally too nice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is Prof. Purves and the TAs. Prof Purves was a great lecturer and taught things thematically, which made it clearer to us the abundance of diversity in architectural design throughout its history as a subject-matter. He is passionate about architecture and called upon many guest lecturers to enhance our perspective on different parts of the field. The TAs make this class especially useful. Each week, they help us work through the following week's assignment and give us feedback on the work we have already produced. They are available to answer any questions we have, and they are truly invested in our learning. Breaking up such a large class into small sections so that everyone can become engaged is very successful. I would say the weakness of the class is that the professor only really served to give lectures, he never made himself available to the students. He supposedly evaluated our notebooks but we got no comments from him. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was incredibly well taught. I loved the lectures and it was inspiring to see the work of other students in section. However, I wish more guidance had been provided at the beginning of the semester for the less-experienced students. I felt a little lost on some of the first drawings. Perhaps there could be some drawing lessons incorporated into the first section meeting? ",
            "\u00a0There were in my opinion no weaknesses to this course. ",
            "\u00a0For the final project, they should explicitly tell you that you need to block all the light, because I didn't know that and then the reviewers said it was disturbing. Professor Purves was great, but two of the guest lectures were not so great. One read from his notes and the other was extremely hard to follow. That being said, I appreciate the guest lectures because it gives you a sense of what other classes and fields there are in the department. \r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with this class is that you have no idea what your grade is the whole time. I took this class at the same time as 4 intensive STEM classes, and knowing my grade would have been helpful to know what to prioritize at the inevitable times where I had to cut some things short in order to get everything done. \r\n\r\nOtherwise I love this class! I love the balance between drawing and lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was well taught, but sometimes unorganized and assignments were given out at the last minute, making it difficult to complete them ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was absolutely incredible. I enjoyed the assignments as well. At times I was a bit frustrated with section. I think that the TA's didn't always manage the time very well which meant that we didnt get to spend equal time talking about the work that everyone had done. ",
            "\u00a0This course is so enlightening and enjoyable! The sketchbook assignments are so fun and also really help you improve. Alex's lectures are so eloquent and entertaining. \r\n\r\nOften, our section time was not long enough to talk about our sketchbook assignments and design problems, let alone the readings. Making the assigned readings more integral to the course would provide students with more incentive to do them. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the grading was more transparent throughout the term. The rubric was vague and we didn't get grades back on assignments. If there was a particular reason for this, I wish that was told to us. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is probably how excellent Prof Purves is; I really have very little to complain about on his part. One weakness is that the readings are extremely abstruse and esoteric, but honestly you can learn plenty by just atttending lectures. I suppose it would have been nice to have a bit more material posted online in the event that you miss lecture, but on the other hand the lectures are excellent and you should try to attend as many as you can (despite being at 9 am, for us non-morning people). \r\n\r\nOne important point that could be improved upon was grading feedback. To be honest, I don't recall receiving any grades throughout the semester on the weekly assignments. I guess that might be because of the inherently subjective nature of assessing the assignments. If I had to guess, I'd say grades are ultimately determined by your level of effort, but frankly I don't know.\r\n\r\nI particularly enjoyed the paper (5 pages interpreting a New Haven building in light of one of the readings) and wish there were more comparable assignments. Many of the homework assignments were geared more toward creating (drawing, building models, etc), and I would have liked more interpretive assignments. Then again, it's an intro level course, so it's important to have a diversity of experiences. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is its opening up the mind to other ways of thinking, and the active side of drawing and making (rather than sitting behind a computer or book). ",
            "\u00a0My major qualm with this course was the scheduling. I think it might have only been a problem this particular semester, but the week before our first design problem was due, our TA's were all out of town. This made it difficult for them to present the project with enough time to fully develop our ideas and make them a reality and we couldn't get feedback before we turned in our projects. Otherwise the course was well balanced! I loved the guest lectures in particular because I found they offered to many new perspectives and a great introduction to what the architecture major could be at Yale. Lectures were really interesting and related well to our weekly sketches. The sketches were always fun challenges and I got a lot out of them. I also learned so much from the readings, but there really was no incentive to do them. I think they were really thought-provoking for the most part, so the TA could have done a better job incorporating them into section. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Definitely not. Unless you want to be an architecture major, don't take it. This is not a liberal arts class; it is narrow and designed for specific skills that you have to already have. It takes a lot of time to do the assignments, sections are on Friday, you don't have much support and it's overall quite boring. Would be better off with some type if art history course focused on architecture. I thought it would be a cool way to learn about something I have always been interested in, but no, it was just a source of frustration throughout the semester. The TAs picked favorites and would spend most of section on a couple of people's work and breeze over the rest of us. They seem like nice people, but they knew who they liked and wanted to encourage. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but hesitantly. The course is wonderful, but the grading structure can make it very stressful if you are trying to maintain a minimum GPA for summer grants or the like. ",
            "\u00a0I would say yes. It's great to be able to take a class on architecture and have access to the School of Architecture. I learned a lot more about the graduate program here and that was really cool. It's also nice to take a class that is less emphasized on readings (don't do any of the readings, you'll never be tested on them) and more structured around doing. The workload is very manageable and I'm glad that I took something outside of Yale's core curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this class! It is so different from other classes in the types of assignments and types of lectures--especially the emphasis on hand drawing, that I think it offers a nice change of pace in a schedule even if you aren't considering the major. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course! The lectures are among the best that I have had at Yale, and it's totally worth getting up early in the morning for them. It can be a little intimidating at section when everyone shows their drawing, because it's obvious that other people are really good at drawing. But I don't think that should intimidate you, because the TA's try their best to provide feedback, so you should definitely try reaching out to them more to learn different techniques. Having a weaker artistic ability and background compared to others, I think it would have helped if I watched YouTube videos on how people applied different drawing techniques. The one problem with this course is that you don't know anything about your grade, and the impression the TA's give is that it's about effort. So make sure you draw a lot in your sketchbook. Do a few sketches before trying to \"hand in\" something for the sketching assignment. And draw in your sketchbook during lecture. Also, the final review for the final lampshade project can be a little brutal since there are several architecture professors making multiple comments about what you spent a lot of time doing. So definitely make sure you put in a lot of effort, and talk to the TA's. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class to someone if they are for sure going to be an architecture major and have an architecture background, they have an extensive art background, or they take it Credit/D. While this course claims that everyone of all artistic backgrounds can take it, people with drawing and crafting experience have a prodigious advantage. The weekly assignments can take several hours if you do not know how to draw, and critiques can be extremely intimidating. I would also recommend taking this class Credit/D simply because the work is so demanding and there is no basis for grades. The good things about the class are that lecture is super interesting and my TF's were extremely helpful. I met with my TF's multiple times to learn new drawing techniques or go over assignments. I'd recommend shopping it and seeing if the first assignment is something you can handle or enjoy. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers you a different perspective. It encouragers you to observe and to draw. ",

            "\u00a0Take ARCH 150! Professor Purves is an absolutely fantastic lecturer, supplemented by many outstanding guests from the School of Architecture. The topics covered in lecture are far-reaching and in-depth, from most rudimentary ways of thinking about architecture, to Yale and New Haven as architectural repositories, to a few lectures on theory and the future of architecture. The readings are absolutely wild and add a whole new layer to the significance of the class, but also are not at all essential for getting through the class. Section meetings are always fun--your fellow students are very, very talented, and it's super cool to see what other people create each week. \r\n\r\nIn terms of workload, a typical week has some assigned reading and a sketchbook assignment which corresponds to recent topics in class. There is also a modeling project, a group drawing, an essay, and the final project. Every project is very well-structured, often with tight restrictions that lead to creative solutions; a few are time-consuming, but you really do get out what you put in on those. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who is looking for an interesting and moderately challenging course. Professor Purves is a great lecturer and you will learn so much from him! The TA's are also super helpful and approachable. The assignments and especially the projects take quite a bit of time and are hard to BS, so take this class if you're willing to put effort into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has been interested in architecture for some time but hasn't had the time nor opportunity to get a formal education of it. You should have at least a few art techniques in your arsenal for the sketchbooks, but most importantly you need to see the world in a different lens than how you usually do. I have a greater appreciation for the buildings around me because I understand some of the decisions that were made to get to the finished product. ",

Also, it's very early in the morning and I had a 9am section - at times that's very rough. It does help you to think creatively, though. The grading is also unclear. Even now I have no idea what grade I got in the class, which is frustrating. The reviews are sometimes harsh, but they definitely help you learn and the TAs are always very open and friendly. ",

            "\u00a0Section was the highlight - David and John are the best. Weekly drawing assignments were fun, but lecture was repetitive and unexciting and readings were entirely unnecessary, never being referenced in any way. Take if you want to get better at drawing (thereby at seeing) and if you have some interest in built environments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course highly to another student, even if they aren't an architecture major. I think it was a really rewarding class, I produced work that I was happy with and was able to use skills that go unused in most other humanities course. ",

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend it. The course tries, and succeeds, at giving students a panoramic view of the subject. Which means that it's likely you will find something that suits your interest.\r\nThis is basically an art class. It's a great complement to your other academic work. \r\n\r\nThe readings in this course are very interesting (I thought), but at the end of the day, quasi-optional. \r\n\r\nIt's not so much about the history or theory of Architecture as it is about architecture as a living discipline. Hence the quality of an art class. But relevant history and theory readings are provided for those that are interested.\r\n\r\nThe professor is excellent: articulate, deeply knowledgeable, and genuinely in love with the subject. \r\n\r\nIt is important to know that most of your engagement with this class will be through your TAs, (graduate students in Architecture) and not the professor. \r\n\r\nFeedback (which comes form the TAs) in the course is limited and often unhelpful. Don't expect to receive a single grade during the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. As a senior (and not a prospective architecture major) it was a relatively chill class, thought-provoking, and the assignments were a really refreshing way of thinking and the right amount of challenge. The lectures are pretty engaging as well! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It is a low-stakes way of getting into visual arts and teaches you to look at the world in a new way! The assignments are a lot of fun and a nice change of pace from work in other classes. The projects are a bit harder but also really fun and you will get a lot of support and feedback from the TAs and other classmates. The lectures are enjoyable and I personally found the readings to be interesting, though they were only really needed for the one written assignment we had (basically, you don't need to do the readings, but I would recommend doing at least some of them, they make the class even better).

The lectures are very good and very interesting, so don't miss them, but you are not really assessed on their content in any way, which is nice. Weekly sketches, 2 model projects, one paper. The sketches are time consuming but really fun. TFs are great. This class made me notice so many things I have never noticed before. ",

I had never taken an art class before so at times, seeing other students' amazing sketches truly did astonish me and dishearten me, but the projects were fun nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would very much recommend this course. It is interesting, informative, and requires an artistic creativity that is not common in many other Yale classes. ",

            "\u00a0Introduction to Architecture with Professor Purves was one of my favorite classes at Yale. I took it as a senior economics major because I was interested in architecture and wanted to take a course completely different from my major. If you are even remotely interested in architecture or are considering taking an \"art\" class, I would highly, highly recommend taking Arch 150. \r\n\r\nWhile I'm a bit impartial because I am very interested in the topic, I would highly recommend taking a class in architecture since itmore than just about any other field I can think ofcan actually be applied to the world around you. I can confidently say that Intro to Architecture changed the way I view the \"space\" around me, including but not limited to things as seemingly mundane as my apartment, my college dining hall, and Cross Campus. Moreover, the beauty and intricacy of the architecture on Yale's campus makes this class exceptionally worthwhile. \r\n\r\nUltimately, architecture is \"the thoughtful making of space,\" according to famed architect Louis Khan. This class will teach you how to understand and interpret man-made space through excellent lectures, drawing assignments, building models, and a short paper. These assignments both help you better understand architecture while also honing your drawing and creative skills. \r\n\r\nI'm not going to lie, the workload is somewhat significant but that really depends upon how much time you dedicate to the assignments. There assignments due almost every week at the friday sections, at which everyone shares their work and the TAs give feedback and tips. For example, one of the early assignments was to draw a gothic window from Yale's campus. This could take anywhere from 30 minutes to many hours depending on your level of detail and effort. Still, I did not at all find the work to be a drag, like many of my other classes. Rather, it was a very welcome break from more traditional homework. In addition, I felt that almost all of the assignments actually help you learn if you are willing to put in the effort; you aren't just assignment meaningless assignments for the sake of giving you work. For context, I also have almost no artistic skills but still found the work entirely do-able. \r\n\r\nProf. Purves is an absolute gem; it was clear that he has taught this course countless times and has essentially perfected it. He is well-spoken and engaging; clearly conveys otherwise complicated ideas; has thoughtful and well-organized lectures; and so on. Honestly, I wish I had more professors (especially in economics, my major) that were as skilled as Professor Purves.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I'm a senior economics major with almost no art/architecture background and consider Intro to Arch with Prof Purves one of my favorite Yale classes. ",
            "\u00a0This is a phenomenal class, and Professor Purves is amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! It was different and exciting. I loved having weekly sketching assignments instead of writing assignments. The readings were really interesting and gave me a new way to think about the world around me. "
