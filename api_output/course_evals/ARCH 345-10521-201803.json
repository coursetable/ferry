            "\u00a0This course covers the history and methods of urban planning; it teaches students to think like a true urban planner and consider the best interventions for using a public space. From Rome to Disney World to New York to Singapore, this course takes the perspective of countless cities and situations. Coming away from this class, I've noticed how I now look at the cities around me with a completely different eye. This class truly changes the way you interpret human interactions, urban spaces, and the world. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures cover a wide range of city planning history. The first several lectures are devoted to ancient precedents from the Greeks and Romans. The bulk of the course is a Western-focused Renaissance-to-present history of case studies and themes in urbanism (how cities are laid out, what kinds of buildings they have, how people get around, etc.). The last 34 weeks cover themes in contemporary urbanism. There were three paper assignments: the first was to provide a history of a public space (really fun), the second was to close-read compare/contrast two images of cities (fun if you find a good topic), and the final paper was to provide a critique of a contemporary urban design project (great). The assignments provided good practice for thinking critically about planning and researching urban history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the theory and practice of the planning and conception of cities. I also learned a lot about how to do research and present information in this field, and the field of architecture more generally. The readings were a good mix of works by theorists and writings by those who were more directly involved with the development of urban spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of concepts within urban design and architecture, and learned to illustrate these concepts in new ways through a variety of projects. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very engaging and helped me gain an analytical eye when looking st cities and urban spaces ",
            "\u00a0basic ways of thinking about cities and the architecture within them and how that relates to basic human life. super eye opening course. ",
            "\u00a0This was an EXCELLENT class. I learned comprehensively about the history of urban design theory from the beginning of human civ to the modern age. Plattus is an excellent lecturer, bringing theories to life with his apt anecdotes, and poses poignant questions about where the field is heading. \r\n\r\nI am an architecture (urban studies track) major and this class has transformed my understanding of the field. It left me with a deeper appreciation for why our cities are the way they are today. I arrived knowing we are facing complex issues in the coming decade or two  but Plattus class and our readings put this in perspective and helped me understand *how* discourse is made and how we can engage in the rich pedagogy behind the discipline. I have a better understanding of the way urban theory has evolved and potentially how we need to address issues in the space between design<>public perception<>science<>policy. \r\n\r\nPlattus considerable experience has given him incredible insight, passed on through the course. The class has deepened by respect for and desire to practice in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt more about urbanism and city planning history. Became more acquainted with historical and contemporary ideas, writings and authors/architects who specialized on the subject of urban planning. ",
            "\u00a0This class really made me see cities differently. I became more aware of their structures and systems and can criticize them with knowledge. ",

            "\u00a0I think the lectures were a bit dry and had no connection to readings/sections/assignments, which was odd. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting and informative. The lectures cover an incredible amount of useful history and the readings reinforce the concepts.\r\n\r\nI think the three assignments do a good job of reinforcing the material; I feel like learned a lot because the assignments asked me to do more research and apply what I had learned. I would say that perhaps the assignments could be reordered. The first assignment (an analysis of an urban space, including research and drawings done by the student) is a little difficult for an initial project; perhaps this could be switched with the second assignment (an essay comparing and contrasting two representations). I feel though that all three assignments were well-suited for the class and the content, but perhaps that order could be played with just a little bit (even as is though, I feel I learned a lot!) ",
            "\u00a0Once you get used to Prof. Plattus's lecture style, the classes are interesting and proceed at a good pace. The assignments are interesting, well-suited to the course material, and spaced appropriately so as to not be overwhelming. I thought it was really great how Prof. Plattus took a global turn for the last few lectures with detailed case studies in Asia, and I wish the historical course material had adopted a similar, less Western-focused approach. The readings were good overall but I thought some were overly theoretical and could be cut down to more focused sections. Also, it would be really helpful if Prof. Plattus cut the reading load a bit by designating required and optional readings from the existing list. Lastly, it would be good if there were a deadline in the second-to-last week of class or so for choosing a topic for the final project so that students can make up their minds and get to researching. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were all fascinating, but there were often far more than I could reasonably get done. When important readings began to be highlighted, the process became much easier. I greatly enjoyed all of the assignments. They allowed me to delve into a specific area of study using the mindset that had been developed through course materials but without necessarily being tied to the material the course was covering. Section often felt meandering, especially when there were too many readings. It was best when there were assigned readings and the discussion could be based on material it was clear at least someone had covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely interesting, and I really enjoyed going to lecture. The only thing I would change would be to give a bit more direction on the first assignment. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the three assignments were very interesting and fun. They were unlike any other projects Ive done at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Dont change anything about the lectures and topics! I learned SO much from each. Each was rich and filled with vibrant examples, illustrative images, and a fantastic summary of urban evolution. The lectures are structured fantastically. The readings were really excellent. The images presented in lecture were incredible. We got to see theory manifest in real projects, instilling appreciation for how important the field is. \r\n\r\nThe projects were great as well, I appreciated the open nature of each. You have the chance to really explore ideas that were most interesting to you in each project, and practice urban commentary. I came across some new ideas in my projects that I now hope to explore for my senior essay. \r\n\r\nIt would have been really cool to have more meaningful conversations with our classmates about the pressing urban issues presented in lecture...The topics delivered by Prof Plattus were such exigent, important ones. (I was also able to meet with him outside of class, which was a fantastic opportunity and helped deepen my personal connection to these topics and how we can practice within the discipline.) However, approximately 70% of our section did not do the weekly readings, and would fail to post the required reading response every week. This detracted somewhat from the value of this time.  \r\n\r\nTL;DR: My main complaint is that many of my classmates did not do the readings, leading to somewhat frustrating discussions (or a lack of discussion) in section. This is not the TF / Professors fault. Having a higher level of engagement would have helped us further learning or make some use of this time!! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were a bit disjointed and at times appeared I was lost or confused as to what exactly was the point of the lecture, or what we were focusing in on a given day. ",
            "\u00a0The class is has projects and assignments in formats I wasn't used to, which I really appreciated. The project definitely made the class more interesting for me. I think they could be a little more clear about instructions for these assignments because we spent a good amount of time answering questions about projects in discussions section. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course's materials are interesting, but I wish it focused more closely on concrete case studies as it often felt as if we were covering so much material with each lecture that it was easy to get lost. Also their were WAY too many readings. Narrowing it down would have made it felt much more manageable and encouraged greater engagements with the texts, as often I felt too overwhelmed to even begin it. Also the first assignment should be explained MUCH more clearly. It was a really fun assignment actually, but the grading rubric and exact expectations were too vague and led to a lot of student confusion. Providing an example, or outlining more clearly expectations in regard to how much text was expected and how much analysis was required is really needed in order to be fair to the diverse student pool many of whom have never taken an architecture class before. I also think maybe it would have been better if this assignment came later in the semester as I definitely found it the hardest assignment and I know a lot of students found it difficult to be suddenly hit with this pretty massive assignment. ",
            "\u00a0Provide lecture notes with words not just photos so that students can refer back. Put name of places mentioned. ",
            "\u00a0Subject matter was not very critical or nuanced, in lectures you get lectured AT rather than being given the opportunity to think about different ideas in urbanism and really engage with them. Reading load is really high, you largely only learn in the Western cannon which is incredibly limiting, and really the whole class is just one narrow version of urban history that the professor is telling you is fact. "

            "\u00a0I think that this course is hard for non urban studies/architecture majors, but it also gives you a new way of thinking so that is cool. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course; I think that anyone, regardless of area of study, should take this course, because the information goes with you into the real world, and you begin to notice things about the public spaces and cities around you that you wouldn't have thought about beforehand. It truly is remarkable how many things I've remembered from the class in application in my interactions with cities and spaces now. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend you take Intro Urban Design. The lectures are pretty good, although my favorite part of this course ended up being the assignments. It was really fun to go in depth researching and critiquing city spaces and urban design projects. Prof. Plattus is affable and has a lot of field experience. Workload isn't too high (although there is an excessive amount of readingdo the ones that sound interesting) so you will really get out of the class what you put into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. I found the readings and lectures fascinating, and I genuinely enjoyed the research I did for the assignments. It's a great introduction to the field of urban design, as it provides a rather comprehensive survey, and shows the interdisciplinary nature of the field effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student, even if they have no experience in the area. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it was a fun course to take and helps you gain a new perspective on urban spaces ",
            "\u00a0it taught me to consider the world in new ways that I hadn't before. quite different from everything else you would take at Yale unless in ARCH school. also very hands on, which is nice! now I walk down the street of a new city and think about its layout and architecture in a very different way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I highly recommend this course! It transformed my understanding of the field and practice of urban design. Definitely take this course if you are interested in a comprehensive survey of how our cities have been designed, ordered, and controlled through civic art the ages. Plattus offers an incredible perspective: there are rich and lively examples each lecture, hes very available, and you have the opportunity to explore ideas that spark your interest in each project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class. It was extremely interesting to learn about the history of urban planning and design and see it different perspectives in the real world. I would say its a good class to see if you're interested in going into a design field. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but as a fifth class. Assignments were fun, but the first one is pretty hard don't be fooled! Also readings are as much as you put in, you get out. Was cool to think about the city in a different way though and learn about those theories, but sometimes the vast amounts of material felt kind of overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No but it's kind of required for the Urban Studies concentration. "
