            "\u00a0I learnt so much in this class. It was probably my favourite class at Yale. I have never taken an anatomy class before and this was incredible ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify every bone in the human body and many related muscle groups. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to identify every bone in the human body (even fragments!) and the key features and soft tissue associated with each. I also learned how to distinguish specimens by age, sex, and ancestry. ",
            "\u00a0Identifying bones from fragments, siding, sexing from the innominate and skull, aging from teeth and pubic symphyses, estimation of ancestry, muscle attachments ",
            "\u00a0Pretty detailed view into the human skeleton, key features, and a few relevant muscles. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: quiz and exam style, professor\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0This class was strong in that it was all open lab, so we learned by interacting with bones rather than listening to lectures. Practical experience was a must! ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course, and I would certainly choose to spend more time with the specimens if additional lab hours were offered. I did feel a bit crunched for time towards the latter part of the class, especially for the second quiz. Overall, the course is very strong as it is. I especially appreciate how self-directed the pace is and how helpful the professor and TA are in the lab sessions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely phenomenal! You get to interact with incredible Peabody specimens and learn so much about the human skeleton. "

            "\u00a0100% recommend this class to another person!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its fun ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this class. A small heads up, while the class was light on work and overall not difficult, I wouldn't say it's a gut. Getting a solid A would take more work than you'd expect, which can be blindsiding considering grades are based on 2 quizzes and exams. But grades are an uninformative method of assessing learning so you should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to all students! It is tough to get in, but this has been one of the best classes I've taken in my four years at Yale and an intellectually challenging but very rewarding way to spend my senior spring. Attend lab, be efficient with your time, and put in some studying outside of class and it's not hard to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Strictly memorization, don't take this course if you're already taking several other memorization-heavy courses. Otherwise, rather pleasant. Dr. Sargis is a great lecturer and is very precise in his explanations. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was very unique for an undergrad one and the content is not TOO challenging. I definitely suggest trying to take it with a friend or getting to know someone else in the course because going through it solo was kind of lonely. I also suggest not underestimating how much time and effort it takes to memorize all the content. For people that don't have solid memorization strategies, this course may be pretty challenging. Prof Sargis is amazing though and clearly knows his stuff, he was always very available to answer questions and help students. "
