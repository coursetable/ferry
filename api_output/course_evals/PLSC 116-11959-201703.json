            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different polities in the world, how societies within states acted and for what reason, and what makes up a state.

            "\u00a0I think the most useful knowledge I learned in this course is the way that comparative politics is really a complex discipline with many different ways to go about answering a specific question. It was interesting to learn about the many different approaches to comparative politics. I also found it especially useful when we read comparative political scholarly articles and learned how to evaluate them based on their arguments and science. I think this is a skill that is useful for a variety of disciplines and that I will continue to use in the future. As someone who didn't know about many polities outside of the USA prior to taking this course, I learned a huge amount about political science -- even if it was just an introduction. This course exposed me to the many different areas of political science and I'm excited to study more of them! ",

            "\u00a0The structure of the course is confusing at times as assignments are never fully explained. The lectures are not very helpful in learning the material as many questions on the exams were never mentioned in lecture. The grading of the course is heavily depends on your TA, as one of the TA's consistently grades harsher and lower than the other. ",
            "\u00a0My weaknesses were that I had no prior political science classes, so I was not very familiar with the political science terminology. I caught on throughout the semester though. The strengths of this course are that it allowed me to get familiar with a lot of terminology. ",

            "\u00a0We did not cover everything that the professor meant to cover I believe and the focus on the exams were not very aligned with what the professor said it would be in my opinion. But the course was clear in its assignments and discussion section was helpful at times. ",
            "\u00a0Great content. Very needed for basic knowledge of comparative politics. Lectures seemed pretty dry. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was that it covered a variety of different subjects, which was helpful to me as someone who hadn't had much exposure to political science outside of American politics prior to the course. I liked the expansive list of topics we learned, which I will be sure to study in greater detail in the future. One improvement that could be made to this course is the relation of the readings and assignments to the lectures and sections. I was upset to learn that the readings we discussed extensively in sections were not evaluated in any way on the midterm or final exams, but rather the readings we had not discussed at all. I thought this approach was very unhelpful and did not facilitate learning. I think that just memorizing certain authors' theses and conclusions does not facilitate a discussion and thoughtful analysis and critique of these authors' works. I think this assessment technique was counter to the purpose of reading these articles! In the future, I think students should read and discuss the most important articles in depth and be evaluated on their knowledge and critiques of those, instead of just having to memorize a bunch of different articles that they have not had a chance to discuss. I also felt that there were too many readings to keep up with in general. As someone who is a slow reader because I like to really take my time to read, analyze, and think about what I'm reading, the amount of reading we had to cover each week did not lend itself to this type of thoughtful analysis. However, I greatly appreciated that we had a textbook -- this was especially helpful in studying when I could look back and reread areas that I didn't completely understand from lecture. The textbook was one of the most useful aspects of the course. The lecture was overall helpful, although sometimes a bit hard to follow. The sections were also helpful because I was able to develop my skills of critiquing political science articles; I just wish that what we learned was connected to what we were evaluated on on the exams. I appreciated the way that lectures and sections were set up and wouldn't want those to change drastically. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Workload, Organization, Lecture style\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class engagement (I saw more students on Facebook than on a note-taking page), No study guides for midterm/final "
