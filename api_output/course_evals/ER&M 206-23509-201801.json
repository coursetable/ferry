            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about what ethnicity means, nationality, nationalist movements, secession, etc. I've never taken a polisci course before this, and it helped me understand how social scientists view and study identity and related issues. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the field of ethnic studies in this class, and perhaps more importantly for me as a student of near-exclusively American Politics, the field of comparative politics more broadly. I've developed my ability as a reader of theory and as an analyst of research methods. ",
            "\u00a0You learn and talk about concepts that you've probably never heard about. You'll learn about how people interact with one another, but then also how to guess how states will interact on the global stage. All theories are pretty much shown by case studies, and reading consist of research papers you're asked to think critically about. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a knowledge of the breadth of scholarly thought about the interactions of ethnic and national identity with political behavior. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different ethnic identities and the way in which they interact within society. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Class lectures and discussions were almost always engaging. Almost no weaknesses with this course ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the extensive lecture slides and active discussion style that invited students to bring the readings into their life experiences made this course better than most lecture courses. The highly-specific prompt for the one essay we were assigned made it more challenging for me, but the research methods-centric first assignment was an exciting non-traditional assignment that forced us to think about the material in a different way. Very little of the pure theory seems like it could be cut, but that was a rough start to the course, which could be ameliorated by using less dense texts to introduce us to key concepts, or mixing the theory with some carefully-picked case studies. ",
            "\u00a0At times the readings for this class can be dense, but Professor Hierro does a great job unpacking the content. ",
            "\u00a0I love the content and the structure of the class!! There was a lot of discussion and student interaction, for this reason, I think this class would best be suited if it was a seminar and not a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0While it was a lecture, this course was at times run like a seminar. Professor Hierro expected regular participation and discussion from students, which made me feel far more engaged in the course than I would have in an ordinary lecture. Occasionally the readings could get dry. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the readings, the case studies, the small size and seminar style discussions\r\n\r\nweakness: the sometimes very technical theory readings ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It's super interesting! Professor Hierro is one of the sweetest people, and wants you to do well! Super small lecture to the point where it ought to have been a seminar, but it allowed you to engage with the work in a dynamic way. \r\nWeaknesses: The professor is new to Yale, and does things corollary with being in a new place. But that's about it. She more than makes up with it by the class being super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong in that it was straightforward; information was clearly presented and readily available through slide files on Canvas. However, at times the course lagged and seemed to be more of a test of our knowledge of \"what did x author think\" about the topic rather than a thorough investigation of the implication of different perspectives on identity. This course suffered from being caught somewhere between a seminar and a lecture; I would recommend choosing one in the future. Having a medium-sized lecture where students are asked to participate regularly leads to only a couple of students being truly engaged. ",
            "\u00a0This course had the environment of a seminar although it is a lecture, and Professor Hierro structured the course in such a way that gave it a very clear trajectory. Starting with the theoretical grounding, we moved on cases ranging from Catalonia to Ireland and the United Kingdom. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: \r\n--Despite it being a lecture, it has the level of engangement typical for a seminar. There was around 20+ of us in the room so Prof. Hierro would always initiate discussions and facilitate a very interactive atmosphere. \r\n--Interesting curriculum, very comprehensive\r\n--Diversified homework: two different assignements and a case study completed as a group project, I liked that \r\n--Incorporation of non-scholarly contemporary texts, e.g. from respectable media sources which not only were refreshing but also added interesting angles to the discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n--The foundational classes in which we discussed theory of what ethnicity, ethnic identity etc. are, could be a bit more condensed. I of course understand they are important but if it would be possible to either condense this part or incorporate more case studies at this point, it would have been even better. ",
            "\u00a0The professor did a great job at keeping the class engaged and offered a variety of different sources to help assist class material. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely take! Whether you just need an SO or if you're a veteran polisci major, it's worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student with the right interests. It is sometimes dense and readings-centric, and requires a real drive for the material, but Professor Hierro is excellent at running a classroom and bringing students into a complicated and interesting set of scholarly debates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was one of my favorite classes of the semester. Professor Hierro poses questions and ideas in really interesting ways that we often had great in class discussions. 10/10 would recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this class to another student. The material is fascinating and has implications for the world that we currently live in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another studentProfessor Hierro is great and this course gave me an important knowledge base that I will use moving forward in future studies of politics and identity. ",
            "\u00a0yes, very rewarding if you do the readings and very fair ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it has very unique case studies from around the world which allowed me to gain a theoretical and worldly perspective about issues in ethnic and national based politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The material is engaging and riveting, the professor is kind and intelligent. You will appreciate having taken it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they specifically wanted to learn on scholarship surrounding ethnic and national identity. I maybe would not recommend if they were mostly interested in real-world applications and case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend - not an overly challenging class in terms of workload, but a valuable \"food for thought\" experience that will make you rethink nations, ethnicity, identity, ethnic conflicts, immigration, and statehood. Prof. Hierro made the class very engaging through in-class discussions (the lecture felt in fact like a large seminar which was great given the subject matter is one than anyone had something to contribute on), and by assigning readings that were 80% scholarship and 20% contemporary media sources. The curriculum was great and very comprehensive, I truly learned a lot. Also, go to office hours to talk to Prof. Hierro, she is an inspiring and caring instructor and person. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great course taught by a great Professor. Learned a lot of political and ethnic national identities and their implications in society. "
