            "\u00a0The course could be improved by reminding the instructors that not everyone in the class works in a wet lab. Over 10 weeks, there wasn't a single computational guest instructor and many of the classes were completely irrelevant to the computational students. Even the ones that could have applied, like how to find a job over graduation, weren't helpful b/c they still focused on what a more traditional biologist would be able to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, it is completely inappropriate to have a political discussion (more like a thinly veiled criticism of Trump) and to be showing pictures of Nazi Germany without warning during a class that was billed as being about scientific plagiarism ",
            "\u00a0The course could be more engaging - it helps to try and figure out what we would do and think through situations, rather than just have someone lecture at us for 90 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the instructors were not great pairs or were not super engaging ",
            "\u00a0This class is great. I hope some of them can be more interactive.\r\nMost contents covered in this class is essential for PhD students in science. And much different from the culture I came from, I learned much about the concept and value of diversity. ",
            "\u00a0For the most part, these mandatory sessions were well-organized, but there were a few areas that need major improvement. I really appreciated that PIs were taking the time to lead engaging discussions and share their experience. Conversation tended to flow naturally, and I think many students benefitted from the sessions.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the sessions seemed to be light on substantive issues to discuss. For example, the February 7th class (\"Communicating Data to the Scientific Community\") just didn't seem to have enough ethics-related material to spend 90 minutes discussing. (At one point, the group literally considered how many supplementary figures is \"right\" to include in a paper submission.) \"Communicating Science to the Public\" was also pretty light. I appreciated the session devoted to Scientific Jobs, but it would have been nice if both leaders hadn't been young PIs who both did almost all of their training at Yale. Ideally, I would have liked to also hear from someone people with other experiences, including in industry.\r\n\r\nThe Human and Animal Investigation session was not good. The speakers conversed in a low monotone (so low that for a couple minutes many did not realize the session had started), and they seemed to suggest that what's important is not getting caught violating rules, rather than the actual welfare of animal/human research subjects. Besides, the information shared in the session was less detailed and relevant than the specific safety training we're already required to get, so I don't see the purpose of including it in this vague form in this course.\r\n\r\nLastly, the final session, led by Walter Mothes, was not a good one. Dr. Mothes started the session with a political diatribe that offended some students in the class for his comparisons of the current political situation in the United States to that of Nazi Germany. While he didn't directly equate Trump with Hitler, student sensitive to the gravity of Hitler's crimes did not appreciate the implied comparison. While he insisted that these views were relevant to the subject at hand, since integrity and ethics is important to combat misinformation and dictatorship, all of the students that I spoke with disagreed. (And just to be clear, I doubt any of us were Trump supporters.) The presentation had a lot of other questionably relevant material, and in the end Dr. Mothes went ten minutes over; no other presenter ended late this semester. "
