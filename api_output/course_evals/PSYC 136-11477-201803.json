            "\u00a0We learned about the traits that dogs possess and possibly why they possess it as well as about the field of canine cognition and how to improve the field. More importantly, we learned a lot about why studying canines was important to the study of human psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about not only canine cognition but human psychology as well. I read scholarly papers and learned how to formulate my own practical experiment. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills in being able to analyze empirical papers in the field of canine cognition as well as being able to build a repertoire of studies that I can pull from to furnish my knowledge of the field. There are so many things that I learned about canine cognition in this class that I would have never been able to learn from my own or from another class that wasn't given in this type of seminar setting. The most important thing we learned though came from the comparative psychology side of the class, where we were able to apply what we learned about canine cognition to human psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about techniques used in canine cognition, as well as how to compare species using psychological findings. I also learned how to discuss journal articles as if in a lab meeting. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dogs. :')\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course gets a little repetitive near the end. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the structure of the class was perfect. I especially enjoyed the 3-part final because it provided a lot of opportunities to incorporate feedback and end up with a good final product. ",
            "\u00a0There were absolutely no weaknesses to this course. I loved going into class every week and every class was engaging and very fun to be in while also being really interesting. Even when some studies were hard to understand the class discussion always cleared things up, and Angie was always super understanding and explained each study really well! This class really was the best class I've ever taken at Yale and the first class I had fun while writing the paper for. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! Professor Johnston did a great job of leading the discussions every week and making sure that we hit all of the important points of the papers while still letting us drive where the bulk of the discussion went. The papers that we read were really interesting and the project/paper that we did helped us to think like real psychologists. "

            "\u00a0YES! Angie makes the class very entertaining. There is a very low workload but you still learn a lot about canine cognition and even a bit of human cognition. ",
            "\u00a0YES ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to my peers. Although, I may try to selfishly keep it a secret so I can take more courses with Prof. Johnston. ",
            "\u00a0I would heavily recommend this course to another student. Angie is so amazing and this course is so interesting that really anyone with an interest in psychology would have such a fun time with this course. And the course is about dogs! How can you go wrong with that? Besides the actual course content, Canine Cognition really expands your knowledge about the field and I came out of the course feeling like I was really aware of how the field was moving forward and the state of the field currently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! We learned so much over the course of the semester in a topic that is relatively new and becoming increasingly popular. "
