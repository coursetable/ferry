            "\u00a0This course allowed me to learn more about American Studies through our discussions on fields, methodologies, sources, and other things among our first year cohort and the visiting faculty members. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an entry point into an overview of the field of American Studies. I continued to sharpen my skills in critical questioning and inter- and cross-disciplinary dialogue, both in conversation and writing. ",
            "\u00a0Got to know the professors in our department. ",
            "\u00a0Broad understanding of American studies methods and practices, exposure to variety of scholarship and faculty working in the department ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to a wide range of academic approaches within the field of American Studies. In addition to learning about the history of and current trends in American Studies scholarship, I walked away with a much stronger understanding of how my research interests fit within and push the field than I had had going into the course. American Scholars also served as an illuminating introduction to the faculty in the American Studies program and their work. "

            "\u00a0The greatest strength was getting to meet and read the work of different professors in the department. This allowed us to see and hear about not only various scholarly approaches, but also the personal stories. It also helped me feel more at home in the department. \r\nThe two assignments - genres and formations and the book review - were helpful in getting a sense of the field and understanding where my work fit in. ",
            "\u00a0I wish we had time to talk more about each of our projects/development. Bring in primary sources/etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: opportunity for the first-year cohort to be in one place and get to know each other, exposure to variety of methods and scholarship in the field, opportunity to meet faculty from across the department, online responses before class were helpful in shaping discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Changeable nature of the syllabus was sometimes hard to work with so that we could be properly prepared for class, discussions could have been more structured, would have been nice to have more time to get to know each other in the beginning of class before jumping right into the material ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that the syllabus was structured around the work of program faculty. Having the opportunity to ask each faculty questions in-person during seminar was a wonderful way to get to know faculty members. I also appreciated our engagement with American Studies keywords, though I felt during certain weeks that the keywords could have corresponded more closely to faculty work.\r\n\r\nI also appreciated our genres and formations assignment, which served as an opportunity to situate our own research interests and approaches in the field of American Studies Echoing discussions that we had in-seminar following the assignment, I would have loved for each student to share what they had learned from assignment with the rest of the seminar in order to pool our knowledge of specific turns and trends in the field.\r\n\r\nThough the course comprehensively addressed turns, trends, and concerns of American Studies scholars, I feel it would have been helpful to delve into an explicit discussion of different disciplinary methods - the how of an interdiscipline like American Studies - perhaps toward the beginning weeks of the course, or even in our weekly discussions of faculty members' work.

            "\u00a0I think this was a well designed introductory course for the PhD program, both to our specific department and to the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good introduction to the field and department and valuable experience overall ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The course was comprehensive in introducing students to American Studies scholarship and faculty, despite the time constraints of the semester. "
