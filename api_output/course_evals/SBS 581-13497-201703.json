            "\u00a0It seemed structurally like a course that was run for the first time. It was pretty unorganized. The requirements didn't make organizational sense - why were things due on Monday when class wasn't until Thursday? We didn't always get things back in a timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a ton of work and sometimes the lectures/activities were not well-organized, but I would say that out of all my classes this semester, I have learned the most from this one. I would recommend it to anyone, especially those in the SBS track. ",
            "\u00a0The class provides most examples from LGBTQ stigma - primarily because this is Dr. Pachankis's personal work - and second most from race - which are excellent - however, it may be beneficial to diversify examples for the purpose of understanding of how concepts are applied to other stigmas, as well as to help with the writing of the final paper. For example, a good section of the class is interested in homelessness or addiction/drug use, but there are virtually no examples to discuss these topics. I was a little surprised by this considering the huge influx of public health focus toward the opioid epidemic. ",
            "\u00a0It is helpful to be prepared ahead of time for class but it would be better if assignments were due Tuesdays or Wednesdays instead of Mondays. Need more time to do assignments ",
            "\u00a0The material is this course is great! It might be helpful to write the essays and assignments after the lecture that it was on though. The class seems a little disorganized on assignments and info though ",
            "\u00a0Weekly writing assignments were helpful in understanding class content and keeping me on track of readings for each class. I enjoyed the class debates and group presentations since they allowed me to meet and work with other classmates. This helped me feel more comfortable participating in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is A LOT of work. Most of which seems unnecessary. Having a paper due every week 4 days before class starts (so that theyd be graded even though they werent) is rediculous and unnecessary ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of reading, but it is all so fascinating. I appreciated the feedback from the professor and TA since it helped me improve as an academic writer. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting material, great use of both group projects and individual projects to help engage students with each other ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Thoroughly covered the different aspects of stigma. Lectures provided us with so much information as Professor Pachankis shared the findings of countless studies on each of the topics.\r\n\r\nWeakness:We often did not talk about the required readings during class. ",
            "\u00a0A great course that dives deep into stigma as a public health problem. The size of the class is conducive to good discussions. The range of stigmatized identities studied by the students in the class makes for interesting learning. John Pachenkis does an excellent job eliciting participation and stimulating discussion. The course if very well organized and despite the high number of assignments due, he and our TF were pretty diligent about getting feedback returned in a timely manner. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were the best part of class. Dr. Pachankis described modern day stigma through a narrative of past literature and research results. The weekly assignments are a reflection of the readings. There is no final, but if you take copious notes throughout the semester then the final paper should be easy. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me think critically about structural inequality in relation to stigmatized groups. John is a leading researcher in the field and learning from him was an honor. I really struggled to grasp at the concepts of this class initially but after the final paper, I realized how much I had learned and will definitely take these critical thinking skills with me in my career. He helped us outline every facet of discrimination and stigma and how that affects health and this was so helpful for my growth as a future public health worker. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very theoretical which the syllabus explained but I was not fully expecting. My biggest feedback on the class was that I was unable to make the most of it because of the structure of the course. There is a lot of reading for the course which would of been okay had we been given the entire week to complete. Instead we had class on Thursday and had reading responses due on Monday, which really only gave us 4 days to do 100+ pages of reading and write a well thought out essay. The intention of having the reading response due on Mondays was to get feedback, however the TA and professor were very behind on the feedback (understandably so), and therefore it seemed unnecessary that we were required to have things due on Monday. I would have been able to actually engage with the course more, as opposed to rushing everything if I had been given the full week to complete things. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Professor Pachankis is a great lecturer and I walked away from this course with a much better understanding of what stigma truly means.  We also had regular writing assignments each week which helped me drastically improve my writing skills. \r\nPossible Weaknesses - This course is challenging and comes with a larger workload, with a 2-3 page paper due almost every other week with presentations/debates throughout as well.  However, I think this is a good type of challenge, and the workload was never unmanageable. ",
            "\u00a0Papers are very difficult and class can be dull. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that we were able to select a stigma that we are interested in. I also liked the idea of focusing on a second stigma, but we only completed one assignment on it. In the end, I would have preferred to have used that assignment on our main stigma we studied. To improve the course, I suggest giving more guidance or clarity on the debates. Students just read off of their prewritten notes rather than debated each other's arguments. The end-of-semester presentations seemed very rushed and we ran out of time, so I would have preferred to spend that class time on another activity or lecture. Regarding the assignments, we didn't receive timely feedback to incorporate it into the next paper due. So more feedback would have been good. Also, the assignments throughout the semester vaguely reflected the final paper. I would recommend going over the different sections of the final paper at the start of the semester and assigning a section each week. Overall, this is a great course. The lectures were effective, thought-provoking, and made me think about public health in a different way. I'm sure I will incorporate much of what I learned into my future public health work. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was not conducive to well-rounded understanding of the subject matter. The organization of the course in terms of when the homework is due in relation to when the lecture was did not allow us adequate known to read and master the material that we needed to write about in the assignments. We then also struggled to recall the material for a class discussion. The theoretical approaches to stigma were valuable in the understanding and application of public health, but the lectures did not provide too much background information to contribute to conceptual comprehension. A summary and simple explanation of the lengthy readings could have been a better strategy in lecture. The class time consisting of just a powerpoint and lecture was not as informative or thought-provoking as maybe a discussion section would have been for some of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I was so grateful to have had the opportunity to take this course. The material was fascinating, and lectures built off of each other. Professor Pachankis was great - brilliant and thoughtful lectures. I will say that I do wish expectations were clearer - we had no idea about how to format responses papers, and we had to email Erin for clarifications on assignment instructions often. Similarly, the papers were interesting - but there were far too many. 5 would have been great - and double the percentage. Or, if there are to be so many assignments, make them all about our chosen stigma (instead of a few random, scattered ones). "

            "\u00a0Dr. Pachankis is really smart and has a lot of knowledge to share with us, but he didn't always seem prepared when he came to class. He relied heavily on his slides and notes and didn't necessarily seem like he was organized each day. ",

Encouraged us to push our thinking as we did research on our own stigma of focus for the course. Enjoyed the group debates. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Felt like the required readings could have been incorporated in class. Often didn't finish going through the slides in a class period. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pachankis is a world renowned researcher in stigma. It was an honor to have him as a professor. If you ask him any question regarding stigma he will be able to tell you a couple studies off the too of his head that can be used to answer your questions. He is a wealth of knowledge and a great resource to have. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We never seemed to have enough time to finish anything (i.e. the lectures of class presentations). I also felt that ",

I would always walk away from class with some profound bits of knowledge from his lecture that would keep my mind thinking beyond just our time in the classroom. \r\nWeaknesses - none ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to all majors within the Public Health program. Helps student attain critical thinking skills on disparities instead of just surface-level analysis. It made me think on  a deeper level than I was ever asked to previously about stigma/discrimination and health issues. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course had a lot of unfulfilled potential because of the lack of flow in the structure of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extremely challenging course, especially for someone like me who had not written a proper essay in 2+ years, but I found that it challenged me in a very good way.  I have improved my writing and literature review skills. And Professor Pachankis truly is one of the most insightful lecturers I have ever had, and I would 100% recommend people to take this class, despite the slightly heavier workload.  It is worth it! ",

            "\u00a0This is such an important class to take as future public health practitioners. You will learn so much about stigma and how it impacts health. The material is very engaging and you get to focus on your area of interest throughout the semester. Prepare to work hard, but it'll be worth it. I highly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0The useful parts of the course could basically be summarized in a few of the assigned readings, and the assignment schedule was very stressful based on how often assignments were due and how extensive they needed to be. With the readings being lengthy and the assignments due 3-4 days after the previous class, it can be difficult to read and produce a quality assignment in the amount of time given. I would not recommend this class to another student unless they wanted to learn how to go through large amount of information and apply this information in the context of other subjects, such as your own academic interests, as quickly as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Highly interesting course and essential for those studying public health, as stigma impacts health across many identities and dimensions... worthwhile to take the course for a thorough overview. Be warned, though. The amount of work per week in this course is absolutely staggering. "
