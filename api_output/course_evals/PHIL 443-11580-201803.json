Insight into the types of problems the philosophy of science encounters in the realm of quantum mechanics: versions of the measurement problem, problem of tails, etc. Thoughts on scientific theory construction, solving underdetermination in science, evaluating scientific instrumentalism v. realism. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive introduction to the measurement problem and formulations of quantum mechanics that attempt to address it. Along the way, we learned about the criteria for judging scientific theories and the philosophical commitments that come attached to different theories. ",
            "\u00a0This class begins by covering the standard mathematical and theoretical formalism of quantum mechanics. It does this towards the end of bringing out the measurement problem, the central interpretative problem of quantum mechanics, which then receives attention for the next third of the class. In the last third of the class, problems that have come up as a result of considering the measurement problem are shown to connect to wider problems in metaphysics and the philosophy of science. ",
            "\u00a0The course provides a helpful, approachable introduction into the daunting subject of quantum mechanics, and exposes students to cutting-edge questions in philosophy of science. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me engage with the link between physics and metaphysics, provided me with a basic framework for understanding and thinking critically about QM, and widened my appreciation for philosophy of science as a critical part of scientific inquiry. "

            "\u00a0Very rewarding class -- by the end, I can summarise different quantum mechanics theories and their strengths and weaknesses and converse on the issue with scientists, mathematicians, and philosophers alike! \r\n\r\nI think discussions could have been improved by greater structure -- we spent a lot of time analysing small points rather than summarising a view before analysing it, to make sure people were on the same page. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very good broad overview and good choice of final project that let you do a deep dive or do more broad stuff \r\n\r\nweaknesses: tbh not many. ",
            "\u00a0I really like the level of engagement in this course. The discussion section is very very inspiring! ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! The discussions were some of the most productive in their structure of any that I have had in a philosophy class (given the difficulty of the material). The teaching was phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0At the end I feel like it got a bit less organized, so I wasn't always sure how the reading connected or what questions we were talking about. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic. I think the only weakness of the course is that the nature of the material is such that the first third to half of the course is spent learning background in quantum mechanics and various theories. That being said, the material and the philosophy that comes out of it is so fascinating that I think it was definitely worth it, and the last third of the seminar especially was truly fantastic. Elizabeth Miller is also the kindest professor and so generous with her time and energy both in seminar and in office hours. She strikes the perfect balance between teaching/explaining at points where people were confused and taking her students seriously as people and as philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0I think more class time should be dedicated to question answer segments from the professor rather than prioritizing the seminar discussion. I think the course would be better if it were capped at around 10 people. ",
            "\u00a0This class was almost perfect. The reading was interesting and Professor Miller is an incredible teacher. The only weakness of the class was its size. There were around 18 people in the course. Partly because the seminar was so large, it became a forum for individuals to share their confusion in succession instead of a forum where we focused the confusion and made an honest attempt to address it. ",
            "\u00a0I think that adding a section about the motivation or goal of science at large would be helpful, because I sometimes felt like we were circling around bigger ideas that were insufficiently discussed because of the focus on quantum mechanics. In particular, differentiating between an issue specific to quantum mechanics and an issue faced by science more broadly could be really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent teaching, a great class composition, and interesting material all come together in the course, and made it really enjoyable and strong throughout the semester. Especially productive to class conversation was the different backgrounds of class members -- some were primarily interested in philosophy, others in physics, others in the intersection of the two. This variety of perspectives contributed towards a lively discussion, especially under Prof. Miller's guidance, which struck a neat balance between allowing class discussion to track students' interest and guiding the conversation towards important questions and problems. The only improvement I can think of would be to have a room that actually accommodated the size of the class -- I couldn't figure out why this was a problem, especially when it was clear from the start that the class would not be small. ",
            "\u00a0This course is somewhat multidisciplinary by nature, which made it difficult to pull off wellbut it accomplished exactly that. Discussions could have been more directed, but some digressions ended up being our most productive discussions, so its a fine balance. "

            "\u00a0Yes, would recommend, though too bad Yale sucks and isn't keeping Elizabeth on. Hopefully the next professor is as good. You learn a lot of things that you can talk about physics friends with. ",
            "\u00a0YES. It challenges the way we see the work and exposes the fundamental human limitation in grasping the ontology of our world. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It might have been the most intellectually stimulating class I've taken, because the subject matter is so deep. At turns both frustrating and delightful, it was wholly worth it and I would take it again. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student (if it was being taught in the future). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This was my favorite course at Yale. Professor Miller is so caring, patient, and brilliant. She makes the absurdly confusing understandable. This course was very different from any philosophy course I've taken, but it opened up the door to philosophy of science. ",
            "\u00a0For the material alone, absolutely. I think the course is fascinating whether you're a physicist looking for answers to \"why\" questions or a philosopher looking for interesting metaphysical problems (or both!) Yale is losing an amazing and remarkable professor and human being in Elizabeth Miller. She's absolutely brilliant and so easy and wonderful to talk to. Anyone who has a chance to take a course with her (or just meet her) in a different capacity should. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not sure if I would recommend this course, given that Elizabeth won't be teaching it. You should look into who teaches the course in the future and figure it out from there. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this is if Miller is teaching it. Great class interesting reading. This class definitely makes you see the value of philosophy in science and the value of science in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a shame that the department doesn't offer more courses in the philosophy of science. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Whether you come from a physics or a philosophy background, I cannot recommend this course highly enough. The material is awesome, and professor Miller is the best. She's a great teacher, always makes time to meet, and, perhaps most importantly and impressively of all, somehow manages to eliminate all of the pretentiousness/obnoxiousness that is all too common in philosophy classes. She fosters a classroom environment where everyone seemed to feel comfortable speaking and where everyone seemed to feel comfortable being wrong  and everyone was sometimes. If she's teaching the class, take it; if she's not, still shop it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. For anyone interested in metaphysics, the philosophy of science, or the philosophical significance of quantum mechanics, this class is a must-take. The material is really interesting, and Prof. Miller is simply a fantastic teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! One of my favorite classes I have ever taken period - from subject material to the way it was delivered, phenomenal class ",
            "\u00a0A great class for anyone who wants to find out how metaphysics, epistemology, and logic come together through philosophy of physics. Also great for physics students who want to try more axiomatic stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. The combo of subject matter and professor makes for a breathtaking semester. Recommended especially for philosophy students, who arent likely to have run into much philosophy of science. "
