The beginning of the course felt much more structured than the second half, however, and toward the end it often felt like there wasn't clear direction of what was going on in the class based on the syllabus and communication from the professor.

            "\u00a0While this course was interesting and there was a lot of student engagement, I think a lot of the students' learning focused heavily on the student group presentations, student-created simulations, and guest speakers. I took the class hoping to learn directly from Amb. Thomas's experiences, and I think the classes earlier in the semester were more what I expected -- him giving an overview of a crisis and his experience about it and allowing us to ask questions. I think there needs to be fewer student presentations and a greater lecture or discussion component, which I think is missing from this class. ",
