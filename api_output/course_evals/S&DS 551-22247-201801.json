            "\u00a0I developed two areas in taking this course. First, I developed specific knowledge with respect to Markov Chains, transition matrices, and the basic limit theorem of both. More generally, I developed stronger mathematical proof reasoning. It should be noted that I don't feel particularly confident about my newfound knowledge with respect to both. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a good overview of stochastic processes in general, going from introductory Markov chains to branching processes, random graphs, Martingales, and touching on Brownian motion and hidden Markov models. Through this course I refreshed my long-since deprecated undergrad knowledge and picked up knowledge of new concepts, and I learned how much one can prove by simply applying and reapplying the Law of Total Probability, although I still dont always catch it. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a basic understanding of Markov Chains and it's properties as well as what is required for the Basic Limit Theorem to hold. The material that was covered before Spring Break was the most developed for me and probably the biggest take away I will have from this course, which unfortunately is not a lot of material. ",

            "\u00a0The content was covered very quickly with almost no reflection time for some tricky concepts. Very hard to follow when you are deep into a proof that involves nested proofs of lemmas. Improved by going through the course more slowly with more explanations and slow careful reminders of where we have been and where we are going. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps spending less time on proving the Basic Limit Thoerem and giving more time to cover diffusion processes would be good. ",
            "\u00a0Subjectively, I believe that this course had very few strengths. It's main strength drew from the fantastic notes of Professor Joe Chang (essentially a textbook), who was NOT a professor of the course. Professor Negahban chose to use class time to write extensive proofs. He often opted out of clarifying the purpose of such proofs; as a result, sometimes we spent entire classes on proofs that seemed to have no or little purpose. In conjunction with these confusing classes, I found Professor Negahban lacking in professionalism or any common courtesy that you would expect an Ivy league professor to have. To illustrate, first, he frequently showed up for class five or ten minutes late (at least ten times over the course of the semester). Second, in a week in which I had a 102 fever for four straight days, I requested a ONE day extension for an in class test. I took the test with a 102 fever, and when presented with such an assessment, Professor Negahban said that I had an extra question from the rest of the class because \"You had an extra day to study\" (I later measured my temperature and it was 102). Similarly, when seeking help from Professor Negahban after hours spent on a research project, one of my peers was told that if he just googled information, he would find it on his project (brilliant insight). In the same conversation, my peer was told that if he didn't come up with rigorous, complex analysis that exactly replicated results in a research paper, he would do \"really really badly\" on his project. It seems to me a contradiction that a professor who suggests \"googling\" as a research tool to a project Master's students also expects complex analysis. I felt like this all semester, that Professor Negahban deferred actually teaching to insist that we should do things ourselves. As a former teacher, I of course understand the value of such learning, but learning on your own doesn't give professors a free pass to constantly text during class, show up late to such classes, text during office hours, and to belittle students in need. (It should also be noted that Professor Negahban gave us a total of three weeks to work on our project without an example project, suggested length, or even a description (he did provide us with four names of previous project-very helpful! (not really))\r\n\r\nAs such, I sadly found this class to not only be a waste of time, but also to leave a poor taste with respect to any professionalism that you'd hope Yale would instill in its Professors. As a Master's student, I leave this university with a poor opinion of its concern for its student body; certainly, I have never had as unprofessional of a teacher as Professor Negahban. ",
            "\u00a0In comparison to what I remember of my undergraduate equivalent, here at Yale we spent several lectures worth of time proving the Basic Limit Theorem that werent allotted at Berkeley. We did, through that long, winding proof, touch on coupling, the concept of total variation distance, and ideas of closure under addition, none of which were discussed at all (to my memory) in undergrad, and on top of that we later covered Gaussian random vectors and hidden Markov models, likewise not covered in undergrad. These are all valuable, important concepts that I am grateful to have gained some exposure to. However, I don't think we touched on things like continuous-time Markov chains/Poisson processes, which were some of the greatest challenges (and thereby greatest interests) to me during undergrad. I dont know if one style is better than the other, but I had been looking forward to some degree of coverage of such processes. ",
            "\u00a0Course had a number of organizational challenges throughout the term. Grading included 'participation' but there wasn't any actual avenue for significant participation in class since each day was lecture based. Going to office hours shouldn't be a pre-requisite for participation since often they are scheduled at inconvenient times for some students and scheduling an additional meeting just to show 'participation' if you don't have additional questions about the course content is just a waste of everyone's time. \r\n\r\nGraduate students were also supposed to complete a project for this course. I'm all for open-ended projects, and in the end, research is the ultimate project with very limited guidelines. That said, I think a formal course project should have more guidance than \"Do a project on Stochastic Processes, here are two past topics\". We never were given any guidance on length, depth, breadth, expectations etc. Again, I'm not asking for a blueprint, but some indication of what the prof is looking for would be helpful. Even choosing a topic had no guidance -> we were asked as part of an earlier assignment to propose a topic, but we didn't get that assignment back until just before the project was due... ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it was centered around Joe Chang's Stochastic Processes textbook, which I find to be a great textbook and very insightful. This course could be greatly improved if it developed concepts from Joe Chang's book and extrapolated the understanding to more examples beyond what could be read from the textbook. Additionally, it would have been very helpful to receive homeworks after they had been graded such that feedback could be provided to further understanding and learning of the material. \r\nOverall, the course felt quite unorganized logistically concerning when homeworks were assigned, when midterms would be, and what the graduate student assignment of a course paper would entail. Due to this unorganized confusion, it was quite difficult to learn in this setting and understand what was expected of us students throughout the course. The only part of the course that had a semblance of organization was the period of the semester before spring break, where I felt like I had understand and learnt the most compared to the rest of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Overall strong course. Would be nice to see more examples in class that are similar to the homework problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Negahban is very smart and knows the concepts well.\r\nWeaknesses: The notes during each lecture were messy. No homework solutions. It would be very helpful to have detailed homework solutions. "

            "\u00a0No. I feel that it was an unnecessary challenge caused mainly by bad lecturing technique. ",
            "\u00a0If the student has not had a class on stochastic processes in the past, I would recommend it. But if they have, it is probably better to not take it. ",
            "\u00a0Haha, not even a chance.\r\n\r\nIf Joe Chang taught it, this would be an amazing course. Sadly, Professor Negahban appears to be teaching this for the foreseeable future. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. The ways it challenges you to think, and the range of applicability there is in todays world for even a basic understanding of stochastic processes, are strong reasons to push oneself through this class despite its difficulty. That said, I have heard some rumors that students are waiting for Sahand to go on leave before taking it, and I more or less encourage that sentiment when I can. ",
            "\u00a0Not with the current organizational mayhem in the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student if the same professor was teaching it. While the material covered was very interesting, learning was not well facilitated throughout the course by the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Much of the class is proof based, which is fine, but I would only recommend you take this if you are quite confident in your math foundation. The reason being, Sahand has zero sympathy for any students that are struggling. Nor is he really able to put himself in students' shoes in order to help them. And it really is a shame because I think the material is crucial for any statistics education, and yet it's quite difficult if you're seeing it for the first time. If I had the choice, I would wait until someone else is teaching this class to take it, and I would certainly not take another class from Sahand. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to get familiar with the basic toolkit for stochastic modeling. Or if you aren't comfortable just using these methods and want to understand exactly how and why they work. Homeworks and midterms are challenging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very hard. "
