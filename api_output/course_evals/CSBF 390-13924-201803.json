            "\u00a0I wish we would've had more time to hear from Prof. Karr instead of Skyping in so many different experts. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Karr is extremely knowledgeable and experienced which add a lot to the course. The guests were also amazing, they contributed a lot and it was a great opportunity to ask a range of questions. The topics were interesting but the classes seemed a little disorganized at times. I didn't really know what we were going to be doing most days, even though I had done all of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not organized perfectly, but the guest speakers were amazing and always relevant. Maybe more work in class on how to write or practice writing ledes, etc. could have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0learned how to make my writing much clearer, more concise, and more available to a wide range of readers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Karrs instruction and guidance on reporting. I was timid at the beginning of the semester because I had no prior journalism experience, but she met me where I was and made the discipline accessible. She supported me every step of the way for all three of my pieces, and for that Im grateful. The structure of the course also facilitated steady progress on assignmentspitch days and first drafts forced you to be proactive about researching and writing. Prof. Karrs keen, thorough edits also made me think more critically and carefully about my writing in a way that other courses dont because they do not expect students to revise their papers. I also enjoyed the myriad guest speakers who shared their professional experiences and advice with us.\r\nWeaknesses: We didnt have rigorous conversations about some topics on the syllabus that I wish we had more time for. Each topic is complex and sensitive enough to merit its own course, but I guess diving into them wasn't necessarily the purpose of this class and thus isnt a valid weakness. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful!  Having two reported pieces and an opinion piece was a bit stressful, but I think Professor Karr did a great job helping us and giving us feedback.  I feel that she pushed me to become a better journalist.  I also loved all the readings and feel that I learned a lot about education in America.  Having someone as knowledgable and experienced as Professor Karr at Yale was really amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Great feedback given on all essays. Class guests were experts in the field and great to chat with. \r\n\r\nThe course tended to be a bit disorganized, sometimes unrelated to that day's assigned readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is the subject and Jane Karr\r\nWeakness is grading style  how can you give an essay such a specific number without a rubric? ",
            "\u00a0This course attempts to both explore the problems in higher education while teaching your journalistic skills, and it does neither particularly well. Yes, you do learn about higher ed but only through reading a few NYT articles. The class sessions that were most helpful were the ones with guest speakers. The class assignments are all journalism articles, but we never learned the actual techniques or components of an article. We were just expected to know how to do a lot of it or look up the terms that were thrown around in class. The course should decide what it going to be and pursue that. If it's to learn more about the problems in higher ed then there needs to be real readings and real class discussion facilitated by the instructor. If it's going to be about journalism, then we need to learn the skills that journalists employ in their articles. If it wants to do both, then the syllabus should change drastically to allow for that. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! I learned a ton and really liked Prof. Karr. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in both issues of higher education and journalism. If you're only interested in either of those things then this course isn't worth it, but it's really fun and informative if you are. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely interesting it just put a lot of stress on the only three papers of the semester which was tough. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Id recommend to anyone interested in writing stories and personal essays about anything related to education for a general audience. Its a great class to intersperse with more academic courses; the majority of the work involves researching and reporting your pieces rather than heavy reading, and the little reading you are assigned is quick and interesting. You dont need any prior journalism experience to thrive in this course. All you need are ideas, pluck, and the ability to work proactively. Professor Karr is a terrific instructor who keeps us on task, has loads of wisdom and experience to share, and is a delight to chat with. I hope she offers this seminar in the future! ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful for learning about both journalism and education.  Professor Karr is really supportive and knowledgable and will help you become a better writer and reporter.   She will also help you submit and publish your work.  I felt really lucky that I was able to learn from her.  This course is a lot of work though so do not try to take it as a gut. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student who wasn't sure they wanted to be a journalist. I just didn't learn very much and there was too much work to not get that little out of it. Almost every week we had journalists come to the class to do a q&a. This was amazing each week because it just seemed like attending a college tea. But doing that every week meant there was little arc to the class and not much discussion. In addition, there wasn't much of a chance to develop journalism skills. If you already know that you're interested in journalism and know how to do it, then this is the course for you. You'll hear from interesting people and get feedback from an editor. But if you're not sure about journalism or have never done it, all of the assignments involve reporting and there's not a lot of support to teach you how to do it. Professor Karr acts more like an editor than a professor, which is to say that she has professional (high) expectations but doesn't know how to convey to amateur writers how to achieve them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great course for anyone interested in journalism or education policy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes but take it credit d ",
            "\u00a0No, I would recommend a different course in the Ed Studies program. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so cool! We met really awesome people (Eric Hoover, Erica Green, Aaron Retica, every day in class was SO exciting). Professor Karr cares a lot, and gave really thorough feedback on papers. I met with her for hours going through my pieces and ideas, and just felt so lucky to get to work with her.\r\n\r\nParts I liked about the class: when we got to talk to guest speakers, when we talked about how to cut words from articles, about Professor Karr's experience working with these people. I wish there was more of a primer at the beginnign for those of us new to journalism, with various terms and vocab words. The three pieces were fun, I wish we had been held accountable for our narrative at various deadlines throughout the semester, so that for some of us it wasn't such a last minute cram (although of course that was our fault)\r\n\r\nI really liked everyone in the class as well. I had no experience or interest in journalism before, and this class had me applying for journalism internships. A must take if Prof Karr teaches again!. "
