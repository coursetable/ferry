            "\u00a0As a relatively new reader of ancient Chinese works in the 17th Century, this course was a great introduction and a unique one as we read over several different genre of Li Yu's work. I really enjoyed reading Li Yu and am really glad to have learned about his work through this course. It was also a great mix of students, and I enjoyed hearing comments from PhD students, master students, as well as other Yale undergraduate. "

        [
            "\u00a0The class was great in that we focused on the work of one author who happened to write different genres, so there are both consistency and variety in the works. Towards the end of the semester the author's voice across genre became more clear to us. \r\n\r\nIt a bit unfortunate that the lighting in the seminar room was dark, especially in the beginning of the semester. I think the discussions would be even more enjoyable with better lighting. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend it. I learned a ton of knowledge in a relatively new field. I would recommend taking this class, as long as you have a strong background in reading modern Chinese and can understand ancient Chinese. "
