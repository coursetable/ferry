            "\u00a0I learned about different sociological conceptions of deviance and outsiders with a specific focus on race (Black/White relations). A lot of the course assignments focused on applying theoretical frameworks to ethnography or real-life situations, and attempting to understand these theoretical frameworks. The course also gave us a vocabulary with which to discuss these topics and situations. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly formative in shaping my interpretation of black men in public space along with a number of other sociological interactions that I previously did not have any insight on. ",
            "\u00a0A much better understanding of the black experience in America and the ways in which the color line persists ",
            "\u00a0Reading & writing heavy; critically thinking; applying larger theme of Norms & Deviance across a diverse syllabus, and applying to current topics. ",
            "\u00a0A tremendous vocubulary for understanding many social interactions throughout the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about the way norms construct society. I gained a lot of insight and wisdom from taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0I got the vocabulary to understand society, and was able to decipher the many layers of social interaction and what they mean. "

            "\u00a0Disorganization. I didn't like the surprise essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course was really thought-provoking and at times profound, but disorganized compared to many other Yale classes. Often times, during discussion, we wouldn't directly engage with the readings we did for that week and instead talked about other topics from the class. There didn't seem to be a clear structure to how the readings were arranged or why they were chosen. In addition, students didn't have much opportunity to talk during discussions or the class wasn't structured to facilitate discussion, and there were a few assignments for the course that aren't in the syllabus (two or three other papers), and we only had a week's notice before they were due. There are also a lot of guest speakers in the class, which was one of my favorite parts. In hindsight, I learned a lot from this class, but I'm not really sure how I did because it wasn't in the ways that I expected. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Anderson is one of the strengths of this course; I really appreciated how available he made himself throughout the semester. For improvements, I believe that it could be helpful to ground some of the broader in-class discussions with the text we read. ",
            "\u00a0The course drew from a number of sources and provided the rare opportunity (at Yale) to think on a personal level about topics generally only glossed over. The workload of this course, though, was unreasonably high, and assignments were not announced until a week before they were due. This lack of organization made balancing this class and other commitments very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Great readings, plus of course Prof. Anderson is a legend and his lectures were amazing most of the time. The random essays on his own books were very jarring, especially since they weren't on the syllabus. But still a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: purpose & syllabus\r\nWeaknesses: needed more feedback for assignments + more engagement among students ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting and engaging. At times there was a lot of work with very little notice or instruction, so I think the syllabus and organization needs to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are few but weakness are many. The course syllabus is interesting and gives a strong framework for thinking about themes of the class. But the class itself is run extremely poorly and doesn't make use of the assigned texts at all. A two-hour seminar turns into a slow, rambling, disjointed lecture from Prof. Anderson that is both hard to follow and deathly boring. Only maybe six of the texts on the syllabus get discussed in class and of course, most of those are books or essays written by the professor himself. And to say that those six texts get \"discussed\" is a stretch considering how Anderson's insistence on talking for forty minutes at a time leaves literally no time for any sort of cohesive or dynamic class discussions to happen. On top of this, he assigned two papers at the beginning of the semester that were not on the syllabus. One was 6-8 pages and another was around 10. Both were about his own books. Neither was graded.  If that's not enough to turn you off I don't know what will. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is fasho Elijah Anderson\r\nWeakness was maybe the lack of Black women's perspective, but i feel like this class is straight without it, though i'm sure certain students wanted to address the queens in some way.\r\nTo improve, maybe we could touch on the crabs in a barrel mentality? I think it could fit somewhere "

            "\u00a0Yes! The readings were fascinating and Professor Anderson provided a lot of interesting insights. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course, but only if you're looking for a learning experience and not if you care about a set class structure. There are a LOT of readings (one book + additional papers) on average per week, and around four papers throughout the semester, including the midterm and the final. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would; it was an incredibly informative course. ",
            "\u00a0Although this course is titled \"Norms and Deviance,\" the main focus is blackness in America. There is a lot of reading, and assignments/their due dates are not listed on the syllabus, making planning ahead difficult. Professor Anderson is engaging, though, and you learn a lot about the experiences of people typically marginalized in society. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, if anything it is amazing to listen to Anderson. Be wary that he may surprise you with assignments not on the syllabus, but even so a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they have not yet interrogated relationships between race & deviance. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about biases and inequality ",
            "\u00a0No. Absolutely not. Only good thing going or this class is that you're probably likely to get a good grade with minimal effort. I know some students didn't mind the class because they could zone out and not care. But I found even this difficult. Between Anderson's lazily arrogant teaching style, his lack of inclusion of women in the syllabus or in his lectures, his tendency to rudely interrupt guest speakers and student presenters and literally a laundry list of his other infuriating habits, I found myself too constantly annoyed and angry to just zone out and not care.

            "\u00a0Yea, Professor Anderson is my guy. "
