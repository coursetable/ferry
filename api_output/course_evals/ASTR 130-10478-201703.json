We even used a supercomputer system to create our own original research. That is insanely unique for an introductory science course. Out of any class at Yale, this one pushed me the most outside of my comfort zone, yet provided enough support that I always felt capable the work. This class has pushed me to reevaluate my overall framework. ",

            "\u00a0This was my first science course at Yale, and it expanded my mind in a way that I couldn't have imagined. ASTR 130 is fantastic because it is, necessarily, broad in scope. You learn basics in biology, chemistry, physics -- necessary prerequisites for answering the question of whether life exists beyond Earth. I found that this multifaceted approach challenged my critical thinking skills, and gave me a confidence in my ability to engage with science. Thanks to the course, I am a more confident consumer of science news, and a more well-rounded person. ",

This course not only opened my eyes to the work of astronomers but it allowed me to have a hand in discovering previously unidentified information. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the origins of our universe. Really cool class for a non stem person. It at times was a little hard to follow, but everything kind of clicked by the end of the semester. We learned theories for why the universe is expanding, how to detect planets using a variety of techniques, and ran a bunch of orbital simulations online just to share a few things we did that I liked.

You get a great overview of astronomy in general, and focus specifically on exoplanet detection and the possibility of finding life in the second half of the course. Besides content, it's also a great course in that it makes you think logically to answer important scientific questions with a lot of implications. ",
            "\u00a0After learning the complete history of the universe and life in it has formed, as well as the current efforts and methods aimed at finding life elsewhere, it made me really think about our place in the universe. Learned a lot about looking at scientific papers, analysing primary data and dealing with lack thereof (uncertainties, deriving knowledge from the lack of information). ",

        [
            "\u00a0I think the first half of this course, up until the midterm, was genuinely amazing and fascinating. During the second half, I found it a lot harder to engage with the material. I think part of this is that I personally find the details of searching for exoplanets to be less stimulating than studying how the universe formed and how life emerged, so I'm not sure how exactly I'd propose to change this other than completely restructuring the course. ",
            "\u00a0The Flexbook was a great way to have all of the knowledge we were expected to know all together with helpful graphs and figures. The weaknesses of the course were really that too much information was expected to be remembered and understood. I started realizing this around the midterm when we had to know so many little details that it was difficult to ever feel that you studied enough because you could be tested on an arbitrary detail you forgot about rather than overarching themes and concepts. It only got harder after that being that we had to know a lot of long equations in the second half of the course and understand physics concepts that we presented quickly in lecture. I would say that reducing the syllabus of the course to just the essentials could make this class much easier to engage with because at times it just felt too overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Wonderful professor. Prof. Fischer was so kind, enthousiastic, and really tried to engage us as much as possible. I could tell she really cared about what she was lecturing on. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the course is too broad. It tries to cover so much information that we end up only grazing the surface on a lot of topics; it is therefore hard to get a good grasp on certain theories or equations when we only talk about them in passing. Another weakness was that some of the homework problem sets or assignments felt like busy work. ",
            "\u00a0I really like this course. It's organized, informative and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook was unorganized and sometimes it was difficult to know what information is correct and what was not, but overall, both Professor Fischer and Lily were incredible sources of information and provided plenty of opportunity to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of resources were provided to students, including but not limited to multiple ways to reach out to the instructors and TFs. In general, a lot of technological innovations were attempted; the Flexbook was appreciated, even though it was unfinished, but clicker questions were irritating. Phones often malfunctioned. I think everyone agrees that system needs to be refined. ",
            "\u00a0The course is incredible. The material is fascinating, it is well taught, and the homework and exams are fair. You cover a wide array of material ranging from biology to astronomy to chemistry and much more in order to understand how life developed here on Earth and how it might develop elsewhere. This is a lot of material and the connections between them are not always clear, which could be improved. Moreover, it would help to have a completed textbook in addition to the powerpoint notes. ",
            "\u00a0Not a gut. But also a gut. If you mildly know science, go for it, it can be easy & interesting. Attend classes cause they mark for attendance, though, but you can also have the clicker app on your phone and feign attendance during lunch. ",
            "\u00a0This subject is among the most fascinating of all, and Professor Fischer is an incredible professor. She understands that we are not STEM students, yet did not think any less of us. Instead, she emphasized certain social policy stakes that space exploration might have, such as funding for research and what the discovery of life might mean for politics. Moreover, she made sure that we did not shy away from science, and that if we became involved in the social sciences, we would be sure to understand the importance of natural sciences as well.\r\nThis was truly a nearly perfect class, but the main recommendation I have is to have slightly more organization of course material. Professor Fischer already acknowledged this, as she is still writing the textbook for this class. At points, it became a little difficult to know on what exactly to focus. However, for the midterm and final, she gave us review guides that were perfectly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was somewhat unorganized at times. Although the material was fascinating and challenging, I often felt as though we were covering too many disparate topics, that I wasn't able to fully absorb or appreciate the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: Super interesting content, Debra Fischer is a great lecturer, assessments are fair, workload is manageabke.\r\n\r\nCould be improved: In my opinion, by the second half of the semester, it felt as if we weren't really learning anything concrete anymore. We were instead just going over lots of concepts without much depth and coherence. I preferred the more structured style the class had in the first half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Really disorganized I wasn't sure what the through-line of the class was until like the last week. If the course were structured so that each module referenced a term in the Drake equation, that might be more effective than the piecemeal structure it has right now. Expectations seemed really inconsistent: it wasn't assumed that we knew scientific notation, but one of the final questions involved a little bit of calculus (this for a class that isn't a QR and in which we never did more than basic derivations for formulae). Some P-sets took an hour, some took 6. And the course expectations weren't in one place. If you wanted to know the parameters for the term paper, you had to check lecture slides, the syllabus, two different rubrics, and any Piazza questions someone asked, all of which had conflicting information.\r\n\r\nThat said, Deb is at her best when she gets political. Honestly, if you want to take a class with her, her Science for Future Leaders class sounds like it would play into her strengths way more. Not sure why a renowned astrophysicist is teaching a gut science class; I often felt bad for her trying to teach us humanities kids who were not invested in the material at all. ",
            "\u00a0While interesting, the course was too demanding in terms of workload, especially since it was promoted as a science class for non-science majors. All the work weekly quizzes, psets, a mid term, a final paper and a cumulative final exam  was too much to balance with requirements for other courses. I strongly suggest that the instructors reevaluate the amount of work to be assigned in the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very fulfilling in that the material was very interesting and geared towards one goal, finding life in the universe. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the lectures go a little bit quickly, and new topics tended to blindside me sometimes. Having different \"sections\" to each lecture was helpful in compartmentalizing information; the mini-reviews in class were helpful. In terms of pedagogy, I like that the course introduced more small-group questions by the end; talking about the material helped me learn it. In fact, collaboration was a huge part of my learning in this course; to that end, I think it might be worthwhile to stress the importance of students going to office hours. Overall, this was one of the most engaging lectures that I had been in, and I like how much we incorporated media and modern science news into the course. ",
            "\u00a0This was a solid course overall. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures can be long and tedious. I attending most of them, my friends attended maybe 40%. I think they were necessary for understanding the course material, which I thought was interesting, ",
            "\u00a0The course is one which is very interactive. There is nothing bad which can be said about the course since when aid was needed, it was provided. When questions were asked, they were answered. When an explanation was necessary, it was given.  Clearer slides could not have been provided for lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Fun class with cool material...the 70 minute block is just long. It's hard to stay engaged for the whole time. Maybe break up the lecture at 35 and give like a 5 minute break to everyone because the material can be dense at times. I liked the quizzes, the use of piazza was great, and PSETs were well written, but occasionally too long/too short. ",
            "\u00a0Stop using turning point, it glitches out too much in big lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fischer and Lily are absolutely wonderful -- they are very engaging lecturers and are very enthusiastic about the course material. They are passionate about helping students understand the material and are always available to help students. \r\n\r\nThe course was a great overview of origins and the search for life in the universe, as the course title implies, and I liked how the class was organized into modules. I liked how the last lecture of the course was the course title, \"Origins and the Search for Life in the Universe,\" and synthesized most of the course information. I thought it provided a great end to the course and made me reflect on what I learned from the class.\r\n\r\nThe online textbook was great in helping gain a deeper understanding of course material and reinforcing what was established in lecture. Piazza is also a really great resource, and I think that having the clicker questions in class provided me with an immediate way of testing what I had learned and made class more engaging.\r\n\r\nI think the course could be improved with the completion of the online textbook or some direction to other/online resources for the incomplete chapters of the textbook. The class could also be better organized within each lecture, which was addressed after the midterm, where each lecture was split into four enumerated and titled sections, with a summary at the end of each section. This sectioning of material was immensely helpful because it allowed students to remember the bigger picture of the information.\r\n\r\nRegarding course content, I feel like less time could be spent towards astrobiology and discussion of viruses and unicellular organisms. More time could potentially be spent on the search for exoplanets and modern research. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the way everything we learned came together nicely at the end of the course with the Drake Equation, and the support we received. Piazza is a useful resource for the class; the questions are answered relatively quickly. And the sections three times a week are very helpful for the homework. The weaknesses are that sometimes the lectures are a bit disorganized and hard to follow, and the Flexbook for the second half of the course wasn't written, so the only exposure we had to the material was through lecture. Also, there is more math than I expected to have to do in a non-QR course. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was a good introductory course. We jumped over a lot of the more difficult math and just covered the big pictures, which I think was great. However, I do think there were some fine details that were just unnecessary to include and made the course seem cluttered and all over the place at times. But towards the end, I saw more of the big picture and how everything we learned related to answering the question of the origins of life. I think it would be really helpful if the course laid it out more clearly at the beginning how each thing we're learning relates to the course overall. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is definitely Dr. Fischer! She's such an engaging lecturer, and her passion for the subject is contagious. She always did her best to make lectures engaging, and always provided help. It was clear that she cared about the subject, and made it clear to the students that she was ready to listen to any suggestions, recommendations, and/or provide any help. \r\n\r\nI think the main weakness, for me, was that we covered a lot of material in lectures that we never ended up reviewing again. So, maybe there was a bit too much focus on the really small details. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include very passionate TFs and a very passionate professor. They all made the students love to learn about the material and the way the course is set up, learning is efficient. The only downfall is the student to professor ratio. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material, DEBRA!!!!!!!, not difficult workload until final...\r\nWeaknesses: difficult to stay engaged for non-astro majors ",
            "\u00a0All information necessary to succeed was easily accessible. Lectures were interesting, for the most part. Loved Professor Fischer's enthusiasm about the subject and for us to learn how to \"do science\"- deal with uncertainty and work with what we know. I think the second half of the course could be improved by taking less time with each exoplanet detection method; each one didn't really need a full class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that it would be helpful if the office hours were mandatory. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the p-sets helped me retain the information from the previous lectures. The online quizzes were also helpful when reviewing the material. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fischer's enthusiasm makes this class amazing for that alone. It clearly carries over into her teaching: she makes things engaging and explains them clearly. \r\n\r\nThe weakness of this class is the Flexbook, which the professors are working on, so this is really a moot point. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly homework assignments often felt like busy work, especially the quizzes. The course's strengths are in Prof. Fischer's enthusiasm for the material, and TA, Lily's, helpfulness. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures felt disorganized. Material spiraled into chaos in the second half of the course, first half was more organized. Exams were very straightforward and fair. However, imprecise use of language made questions more difficult than they needed to be throughout the course. Grading varied based on the TA who was grading. I received 100% on all HW's except when a certain TA was grading. ",
            "\u00a0Very well designed course ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very informative and interesting. The psets and quizzes are also pretty straightforward. One of the biggest strengths is Piazza and how responsive and helpful the TA's and professor is on Piazza. The rubrics were also very clear and the TA's provided clear feedback for all the assignments. The one weakness was that there were parts of the flexbook that were not accessible or were only accessible sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the course and contents, however I think the transitions between slides and topics could be a little better ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting, engaging, relatable\r\n\r\nWeak: Nothing ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class structure was intense but fair. Weekly problem sets took a long time, but forced you to stay on top of the material from that week. Planetarium visit was very fun as was the final paper assignment. In lectures, I often couldnt answer clicker questions in time because of bad internet connection, but this problem was handled fairly in the way class participation was graded. I also really liked lectures - Professor Fischer and Lily are great lecturers! ",
            "\u00a0This course was strong all around. The workload is reasonable, especially if you go to the optional sections, The textbook that pairs with the course is extremely helpful, abd the exams are fair as well. This course covers a lot of material but I still feel like I actually understand it all and I remember it even after taking the final exam. By far this has been one of my favorite courses at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were engaging and easy to understand. More of the class time could be utilized to ask questions or to synthesize the material. ",
            "\u00a0The course tended to focus on big picture ideas, but sometimes it went into minutia. I'm not saying that sometimes going into extreme detail is bad, it just seemed to go into extreme detail on the most useless things. I would have loved to go into more detail on the doppler technique, but more emphasis seemed to be placed on specific organic compounds. Therefore, a little more thinking about which topics are explored more in depth and which are not would improve the course. ",
            "\u00a0#1 strength: Professor Fischer and Lily! Both of them are extremely passionate about the work they do, and that passion comes through so clearly in their teaching of the course. Professor Fischer takes feedback better than any professor I've known, and I am so impressed with Lily's clear, concise teaching style. As far as the course itself, I loved how the content is organized under a very clear narrative: what we know about the universe, what we know about life, how scientists have applied this knowledge to detect exoplanets, how we can apply this knowledge. It is easy to organize small details under this larger structure, plus I felt so accomplished after writing my semester paper! The weekly homework assignments reinforced what we learned in class, although a few of the quiz questions were vaguely worded and the homework assignments sometimes covered material that we didn't learn until a week later. I would also suggest a conceptual approach to teaching Kepler's Laws - while the equations are not difficult, they were a little confusing in lecture, but very easy to figure out through practice problems. Overall, though, I loved this course and would definitely recommend it to another student! ",
            "\u00a0All the material provided prepares you very much to do well in the class. The TA's are great in office hours. I liked the clicker questions. ",

            "\u00a0Lecture slides were very inefficient and so was the textbook. Unless you have prior knowledge its almost certain youre gonna do bad in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This class did a very good job of covering a thorough foundation of life on Earth and the timeline of the universe, even being a science class for non-science majors. However, sometimes the lectures and readings weren't synced up with the homeworks, which caused confusion for me on what was important from each. ",
            "\u00a0Disorganized and hard to follow for non-STEM majors. Amazing instructors! ",
            "\u00a0The content is very interesting.  The lectures tended to move very fast, which could make it difficult to stay engaged while trying to take notes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Fischer is knowledgeable, dedicated, understanding, and an extremely figure in the field. Very receptive to student feedback and is obviously quite dedicated to making the class interesting and accessible. Provided weekly sessions for questions about homework as well as helpful review sessions for midterm and final. Fair exams and reasonably interesting material. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Despite Professor Fischer's enthusiasm, the first half of the class, especially, felt relatively unorganized. Often unclear how specific topics related to the overall purpose of the class and material felt disjointed. Quizzes and homework questions often unnecessarily tricky. Organization of the class got increasingly better as the class progressed, but would definitely be aided by the completion of the online textbooks (as of now, many sections are incomplete, absent, or unclear). ",
            "\u00a0Good content in the class, but the workload picks up a lot, and the psets aren't graded fairly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great content, passionate instructors, tremendous energy/enthusiasm \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The presentation slides were slightly too text heavy ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: incredibly engaging course content, great professor, interesting projects and information sessions, and logically flow of information. The last half of the semester is so interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: assignments were tedious and the weekly quizzes felt like busy work. The lecture slides contained a lot of extraneous information, so it was confusing on which information was important and which was not. The flexbook was also not that helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I love how interactive this course was!!! Prof Fischer was amazing and the TAs were really good at answering questions and creating such a healthy learning environment. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this class were very well taught and extremely informative. However, sometimes the homework assignments seemed like too much for the class as well as not always relevant, especially the beginning ones. ",
            "\u00a0The professor and the TFs are willing to help a lot, and they teach the subjects very well. ",
            "\u00a0Great course which gave a broad overview of astronomy and life for all known history. Engaging with its content and great teaching team; the professor was amazing in my opinion. Bad parts were just the homework questions sometimes which seemed hard to understand. "

        [
            "\u00a0This is a relatively fair Sc credit for non-science majors type course. Weekly P-set and homework quiz are doable but usually not without going to section or working with other students. Midterm is fair (but covers a bit too many topics so many sure to study and go to the review session). Final paper requires a bit of work but they guide you pretty well through the process. Professor Fischer and Associate instructor Lily are really the best part of the course. They are beyond helpful, and understanding and you can tell they really don't want to trick you or fail you throughout the course. They take student feedback well and adapt to it throughout the semester which made this class bearable as a fifth credit. Overall, a great course that you can really learn some cool stuff from even if you only take it for the distributional requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I'm undecided as to whether I would recommend this course. It was not extremely challenging, but I did find myself frustrated at times due to the busy work or the somewhat sporatic nature or the curriculum. I would recommend this to anyone who is already interested in astronomy, but I would not recommend this to someone who just wants to get a science credit. ",
            "\u00a0YES. I am a philosophy major trying to look for a science gut. Honestly, this course is not the best gut one would want, but I am so glad I took it. All the materials are not hard if you pay attention in class and do the reading, but it took me about 6 or 7 hours every week on psets and readings. Yet I learned so much about the universe and the possibility of life and I think it is totally worth the time. ",

            "\u00a0Don't take it thinking it's a total gut. You will only get a good grade, not to mention worthwhile knowledge, if you put in a bit of effort. All things considered, though, you don't have to put in that much work to get a lot out of it! For someone looking to learn in a laid-back but serious way, this class is excellent. Professor Fischer is also super interesting and we have so much to learn from her! ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you're interested in astronomy. Prof Fischer is awesome. Not extremely hard but not a gut - weekly homework and quizzes, but they're relatively quick and straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, fair grading, learned a lot ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student. You will be introduced to all kinds of interesting science and you will be challenged to think. Professor Fischer is incredibly eager to help you learn and you'd be well advised to take one of her courses. Moreover, the tests and grading are fair for non-science majors and encourage you to learn without being overly stringent. ",
            "\u00a0If you wanna take a semi-gut, this is it. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS!!! Professor Fischer is absolutely amazing, and I learned so much. This is clearly a science class for non-scientists, but you learn so much. Do not expect a gut where you just show up for test day. This is a serious class, but it is not hard. It is meant for non-scientists, and if there is anything that requires a basic level of biology, for instance, Professor Fischer spent the time to explain it carefully. It is truly eye-opening. As someone involved in politics, it was incredible for me to think beyond just the country or even the world to the entire universe off of all our Earthly concerns. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Interesting and easy science credit. Debra Fischer is an absolute gem and 100% worth taking the class just for her. You get a good, broad overview of the origins of life and the universe, so you can sound smart when debating the Big Bang or evolution. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students who have an interest in astronomy, and are willing to put in the effort to engage with and understand the material. Despite the grading being relatively lenient, students still must put a lot of time into completing the work and having a handle on material. Having some science background is very helpful in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course! The content it teaches is so fascinating I actually had goose bumps many times in the lectures. The workload is manageable and so the \"learning/work\" ratio for this class is extremely high. ",
            "\u00a0Only take it if you're looking for a gutty science credit and don't mind disorganization. Didn't get much out of it, but I also didn't put much in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it with caution. It is an interesting course but it takes a LOT of time and investment if one wants to do well and that sometimes isn't possible particularly since this is a class that many non-science majors will take to fulfil distributional requirements. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it offers an interesting perspective on a topic that most students are likely not familiar with, and is good for a comprehensive introduction to the inner workings of the universe. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Especially if you're studying the humanities or social sciences, just sign up and dive right in. The numbers and high school science refreshers will seem daunting at first, but Professor Fischer and Lily will get you up to speed. Do your homework at office hours where there is help, and you'll be more then fine. While the problem sets may be out of the box for you, they will become worth it when you realize you can hold your own in a conversation with science majors and even the premediest of the premeds. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who is interested in astronomy and is willing to do some math. This is definitely not a \"gut\" course, but it is manageable. I wouldn't say I loved the class, but you do come away with a greater understanding of our place in the universe. Also, the final was harder than I expected coming from the midterm, so don't expect the final to be the same level as the midterm. ",

If you are on the fence, look up the textbook \"A Student's Guide to Astronomy\" by David Fleisch: the concepts covered are at this level.  \r\n\r\nIf you are a STEM major looking for a 5th or 6th class definitely take this one.

This is what I was looking for, and I enjoyed it. Do not expect to be intellectually challenged, and do not expect well-written problem sets. \r\n\r\nThat said, Prof. Fischer's kindness and devotion to the field cannot be understated. She is lovely, and a brilliant astronomer. She is able to present her work to students with no background in the field, which is truly fascinating. ",

All she cares about is that people learn about the universe, which is the ideal outlook of a professor. Lily is also super helpful and will go the extra mile. The class starts to drag just a little bit when you start learning about all of the planet detection techniques, but other than that the content is pretty interesting. Nevertheless, for those looking for a gut, beware. If you do all the work, you will do really well in the class, no doubt. The assessments are pretty easy, but you do have to memorize a fair amount.

If you put in the work, you will definitely learn a lot. \r\nHOWEVER, be warned that this is, by far, not a gut. If you are not a particularly science-y person (meaning you have not taken advanced chem/physics/bio at high school), this course will be quite challenging. The psets take a while (and there is one every week) and the midterm and the final are not easy. There is also a term paper, which is fun, but also kind of a pain to write (analyzing planetary systems is about as difficult as it sounds, even after having taken the class). \r\nOverall, great course, but if you are looking for an easy science credit, this is not. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely TAKE THIS CLASS! This is a completely accessible science credit for non-science majors, plus it's going to blow your MIND pretty much every day. Professor Fischer is the bomb and is always willing to help--she's also a feminist icon and addresses issues of representation in STEM on a regular basis which is so great!!! Plus all the TAs and Lily (hopefully she teaches again!) are truly excellent. I am so much more aware of our place in the universe now (and how absolutely tiny we are) and feel like I can hold a coherent conversation about astronomy. The workload is minimal (problem set and online quiz once a week) and you're going to come out with so much cool info about space. ",

You will come away with a greater sense for where you stand in the universe, as dramatic as that sounds, and feel like you did something meaningful after writing the semester paper. Stay engaged with the material (which is easy to do because you have homework assignments every week), and you'll get a lot out of this class.
