            "\u00a0This class helped me understand some of the ways in which the US government had developed out of the British system. I really liked learning about policy debates from so many different angles and citizens, as well as the effect of legislation (or lack thereof) on the people ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Britain's 'long century' and got practice in writing some different types of history papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the important individuals, events, and ideas in Britain from the late 18th century to the early 20th century, and I also learned about the British political system and society. The course provides information on a wide variety of events and individuals, from political leaders to grassroots activists. It improved my ability to interpret and synthesize complex texts, while also providing greater familiarity with the broader trajectory of European and world history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about British history from this course. Going into the course I had already learned a considerable amount before in high school and at Yale about British military and diplomatic history, but had learned comparatively little about the internal politics, society, and culture of Britain, apart from the relatively basic themes of industrialization, urbanization, and the emergence of the middle and working classes. Thus, I appreciated the material provided in this course. Also, after the first paper I noticed that my TA, Noah Gentele, had high expectations in terms of my writing. I think this compelled me to subsequently improve my writing on the second paper. "

            "\u00a0The course doesn't really have a great ark. A lot of the lectures seem quite similar. Many make the same point about disenfranchised people's participation in the public sphere and written media reaching ever more people. I think it needs to be structured into more discreet units. Some of the most successful lectures, in my opinion, were the ones that had a more concentrated subject, such as the ones about socialist reformers, women's movements and Irish home rule. The lectures on empire was a bit haphazard. Part of the problem could also be the habit of finishing half of the previous lecture in one day, and then starting another one. This, as well as other aspects of the course organization, makes it hard to synthesize the material. Another major issue is that the lectures don't often give much context for the primary source readings. I think it's a brilliant idea to assign only primary source readings, but this just isn't as successful if the sources don't clearly fit into the lecture topic. For example, one week the lectures were about Second Reform Act nervousness about expanding the electorate, and how this would soon after start a process of education reform (Lord Derby's \"we must now educate our masters...,\" I believe). That week we read a short Carlyle piece that articulated that we couldn't know what awaited us in the leap in the dark toward democratic representation. This successfully links the succession of events we learned about in lectures to an intellectual's commentary on it. However, with Pearson, Hobson, Hobhouse and other primary sources, I don't have as clear a sense in where exactly they fit into historical events. \r\n\r\nLastly, I think the essay assignments should be completely scrapped. For the life of me I couldn't make sense of either. The first one was supposed to be a research proposal based on a trial. But you would never write a research proposal without having a strong basis in the background in the subject, and being confident that the specific facet of the subject you want to learn about sheds light on the wider issue. So this assignment totally puts the cart before the horse. How are you supposed to argue that some detail you come across is very important for a field you barely know anything about it? The same with the second essay. You spend a huge amount of time trying to figure out how on earth to structure your answers to the questions in a bizarre format, rather than just analyzing the texts and writing an argument about them. If you want to keep these essay assignments, at least completely rewrite the descriptions of them and offer another option to just write a classic analytical essay. It would be very productive in this class to write two 5-7 page synthesizing some of the primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are mainly political philosophy and they are AMAZING. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings that were selected for this class, and seeing connections between what wed read and lecture. I really liked the amount of women writers that we read. Some of the central themes that we saw progress throughout the century were gender and socioeconomic relations, but this at times seemed to come at the cost of analyzing race within the British Isles. Although this course was not an empire class, I still think it could have benefited from more than glancing references to race relations ",
            "\u00a0Professor Semmel is very good and an engaging lecturer for sometimes dry material (you won't think it's dry when you're in the class but if you really think about it, it is). As with many history courses, an issue is chronology, especially if you don't have the best background in British history. Lots of junior and senior history majors. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the topics covered in this course, though I wish some topics had been covered more (social developments, but I understand that the course has a political focus). I liked the format of the course (two papers, a midterm, and a final). ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was Professor Semmel, whose vast knowledge about the time period and the British nation were an asset to the course. Another strength of the course was that a number of the topics and readings seemed relevant not only to contemporary issues, but also to modern issues, including economic inequality, fears of national decline, and the political rights of marginalized groups. Finally, it was also interesting that the course discussed such different types of figures, ranging from prime ministers and members of parliament to industrialists and cultural commentators. One minor improvement might be to provide a rubric or discuss expectations for the different components of the midterm, although we did discuss them before the final. ",
            "\u00a0This course has many strengths. First, its content is interesting. Second, the amount of information and themes students are expected to know are not unreasonable in number. Third, the amount of assignments - two essays, a midterm, and a final - was very reasonable. Fourth, the amount of reading was also very reasonable. Fifth, I appreciated that Professor Semmel included key ideas and facts on his slides - this made studying for the exams much easier, since he posted his slides. I would say the only major weakness of the course was that Professor Semmel's lectures were periodically somewhat disorganized. For example, he would hint about how a story would end at the beginning of the lecture and then tell the story through the remainder of the lecture, instead of simply going in order and telling the story. I would recommend Professor Semmel goes through his lectures and makes sure more of the stories he tells are linear in nature. "

            "\u00a0I'm on the fence, but probably not unless you have a very strong interest in precisely this area. Some of the primary sources were very colorful and fascinating to read. The lectures dragged quite a bit, and often felt repetitive. Though very enthusaistic, the TA is a bit difficult to work with and not great to meet with. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes! If you do not take this class, then you're missing out on an invaluable intellectual experience. ",
            "\u00a0NEVER SONT DO IT ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was my favorite class this term ",
            "\u00a0As a non-history major, I really enjoyed this course. Took it credit/d and it was relatively low work load. You MUST go to lecture as there is no text book. Readings can be skimmed and section will depending largely on the TA. If you're into history at all and obviously British history, this is a great course. Semmel is very high quality. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in Britain's political developments during the 19th century. Other topics are covered but there's a definite focus on the political. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students desiring to learn about 19th century Britain. Basic prior familiarity with European and British history would be helpful but not necessary, and I might recommend Cr/D/F. Many of the topics and thinkers in the course shed an interesting light on current debates, and for students who have taken American history courses, it is especially enlightening to compare and contrast the developments in Britain over the same time period. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldn't necessarily recommend this course to any student, namely because its content is rather niche. One needs to be interested in Britain in order to get through an entire semester of British political, social, and cultural history. But assuming the student is interested in Britain and British history prior to the course, I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first history class I've taken at Yale, and it was such a great experience. Honestly I would consider changing my major to history if I had time. I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you're a little bit hesitant about taking history courses or just haven't found the time to yet. Lectures were fascinating and the readings and section discussions were thoroughly engaging. I feel like I know infinitely more about Britain now than I did before this course, and I can't wait to take more history courses after this one. "
