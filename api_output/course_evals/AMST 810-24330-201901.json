            "\u00a0Prof. Wexler pushes students to examine a problem from all possible angles with empathy and compassion. Its a valuable skill set to have when working on issues of public space and interaction. I gained a level of nuance for the effects of modifying public sculpture on the public body that I did not have before. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely, this is the best course I have taken a Yale University thus far. ",
