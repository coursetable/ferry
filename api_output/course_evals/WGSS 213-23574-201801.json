            "\u00a0In this course, I learned about the South Asian diaspora in the United States. I learned how to use the tools of cultural studies and visual analysis by engaging with television series, ethnographies, theoretical pieces and pop culture articles. The multidisciplinary aspect of the class was rich in that it allowed us to think about the South Asian diaspora from a variety of angles and from a myriad of perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt more about the South Asian diaspora in the American context, something that is entirely new to me. I have also gotten to gain knowledge about the historical events that has reshaped the South Asian Americans' identity. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to critically evaluate my own subject-position as part of the South Asian American diaspora. ",
            "\u00a0The limitations of aspiring to be a model minority. ",
            "\u00a0This class helped me become more comfortable using academic terms to talk about race and identity and understanding cultural critics theories. ",
            "\u00a0I gained theoretical frameworks through which to become a more critical consumer of popular culture as well as to understand the making of the South Asian diaspora within the North American context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more information about the South Asian American narrative and how diasporic formation works. I gained valuable insights on how gender roles are influenced by migratory patterns and how that shapes our story. "

            "\u00a0Material was at times very theoretical and hard to understand for someone with little background ",
            "\u00a0This course has excellent, interesting and varied readings. I looked forward to the material Professor Grewal would assign us every week. The seminar itself was also fun and engaging. Even though we had a full class, there were a variety of voices and people were endlessly enthusiastic. The best part of the course was the diversity of readings and methodologies we used. It truly made it seem like there was something for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0The strength lies in the readings which goes in depth about the perennial struggle to realising one's identity. Another strength lies in how Prof Grewal makes it a point to always begin the class by asking each and everyone of us for our insights about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Kind of a pity party at times, far too focused on the post-modern post-structuralist understandings of race and diaspora. Not too committed to actual ideological challenges to hegemony. ",
            "\u00a0Great selection of readings and class discussion. Fewer themes and more weeks on them would be nice -- this could be a year sequence easily! ",
            "\u00a0Since the class is only once a week, we dont get to cover enough material and its difficult to focus for two hours in the evening. However, the readings we did discuss and topics we went over were engaging and eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0Beginning of class felt a bit slow with a lot of interesting pop culture discussions that I think could have been enriched with some more theoretical readings/discussions that came later in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion was generative and very engaging and the readings on the syllabus built on each other and interacted together well. The papers each gave a chance to think more critically using the thinkers we talked about in class. "

            "\u00a0The high point of the course is a creative final project that allows you to explore an aspect in the course through a creative lens. I would not recommend this class to someone who hasn't taken any classes on race/gender/culture - I think its important to have this background to get more out of the course. It may also be harder to write good essays without this theoretical background. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student at Yale. Whether you are intimately familiar with the South Asian diaspora or not, there are important insights to be gained from both the content and methods in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I will definitely recommend this course as it presents to us important aspects on the diaspora in the most enriching and exciting way as possible. Given the interactive structure which even gave us the opportunity to plan the lessons for one of our classes this course is indeed of a unique approach. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are interested in a very particular way of approaching a very particularized subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was amazing. I learned so much, got to think critically about my identity, had the freedom to shape class discussion and learn from my peers, and Prof. Grewal is both lovely and a genius. Thank you for a class on South Asian Americans! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially for those from South Asia. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its a lot of reading and you have to be able to pace yourself, but the discussions and realizations are well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very interesting discussions and the class environment was great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class! Professor Grewal is a top-notch professor and the class really helped me to become a more critical consumer of popular culture as well as to understand further the context of the South Asian diaspora within North America. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very valuable in helping me understand how race and gender affect identity and would thus help many others gain similar valuable knowledge "
