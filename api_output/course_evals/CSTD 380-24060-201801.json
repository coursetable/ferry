            "\u00a0I really believe that every student at Yale should have the opportunity to take this class. It forces Yale students to pause and consider their experiences in times of transition and their own level of self-awareness. I benefitted in how I thought about myself and my relationships with other people. This class is truly unique at Yale and seeks to cultivate a space to honestly share feelings and discuss important personal topics. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me a lot about how to understand my own development through my relationships with others and in general how to be a more thoughtful/reflective person. ",
            "\u00a0THIS IS AN AMAZING COURSE! Take it to talk about your feeling and learn about yourself! ",
            "\u00a0This class provided innumerable lessons and a countless amount of insight regarding the process of becoming an adult. Rooted in Levinson's theories of adulthood, we discussed the challenges of becoming an adult in relation to various psychological and physical phenomena that are crucial to the transition - the self, the other, in-group versus out-group, agency, power, family and the environment, and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater awareness of my own emotions, and was challenged to reflect on my personal transition into adulthood. I also learned a great deal from my classmates and their transitions. ",
            "\u00a0-my impressions of others are often projections and/or revelations about myself\r\n-I have a lot of agency in my life\r\n-familial patterns shouldn't be ignored ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the most unique and perhaps one of the most important classes I have taken at Yale so far. Through it, I was conditioned to approach each of my interpersonal relationships with a lot more care and a lot more reflection. I was further conditioned to be brutally honest with myself and to take moments of intense emotion (be it anger, sadness, annoyance, or joy) as an opportunity to learn about myself and where I stand in the world as I make the transition into adulthood. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about people, and how they interact with themselves and others, framed in a variety of contexts such as family, college, and other groups. I learned about myself especially. I learned not to be scared of being an adult. ",
            "\u00a0this course taught me how to use the other (other people, groups, institutions, etc.) to teach me about myself. it taught me the value of judging my reactions to other parties. it taught me that reflection is valuable and an important way to learn about oneself, along with writing for the sake of writing and without reaching a certain goal. it taught me that i will never comprehensively know myself or anyone else and to settle with that. this was the most important course of my yale career ",
            "\u00a0This question is remarkably personal to every person who takes this course, but I learned a thing or two about myself and my place in this world in relation to others. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I don't know if this class has weaknesses. Listening to and responding to other students' reflections allowed me to learn a lot about myself and realize that I was not the only student undergoing personal challenges. I left almost every class thinking, wow, that was such an interesting way to think about the world and my interactions with others, or wow, I did not realize that about myself. And Professor Berg is incredible! Will elaborate below. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! I found the paper prompts really challenging but I think if you work with the professor they become more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0More work in smaller groups and bonding activities to make classmates feel more comfortable with each other ",
            "\u00a0An incredible class, and an incredible opportunity to get to know yourself. ",
            "\u00a0this course is great because it makes you begin to reflect on your life and professor berg provides the best responses to your reflections! It is an amazing opportunity to learn about yourself and engage in your feelings and whats going on in your life! ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is Professor Berg. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are vast - the content is able to strike an emotional chord while simultaneously providing academic insight. As a student, you learn an incredible amount about the self, the other, groups, environments, ambition, motivations, and begin to actualize on ideas of one's place in the world. Any potential weaknesses are negligible - it was an amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0The reflections are wonderful, and I enjoyed both writing my own and listening to the reflections of my peers. I also enjoyed the activities we did in class. ",
            "\u00a0Intense reflection on the self is not something most people are used to practicing, and because of this the structure of the class and the intense vulnerability that accompanies it takes some getting used to. This is inevitable given the subject matter, but Berg does a great job at framing the class and everything in it in a way that is accessible. ",
            "\u00a0This class was an amazing college experience that is one of the only places where students were able to take a step back from our busy lives and reflect on all the things that are happening to and around us. The only weakness was that I felt it took a long time to feel comfortable and we wasted a lot of time being silent and awkward. I'm not sure how this could be improved (maybe with more icebreaker type stuff in the beginning? smaller groups at first?). But overall I wouldn't want to change anything else about the class -- the silence might be necessary to deal with the deeper revelations of the intimate reflections. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: wow. berg makes this class what it is. it was so powerful and refreshing to have a course that tells me that i am valuable and worth learning about in an academic setting. berg's wisdom accumulated from engaging with people undergoing this transition to adulthood makes it all the more powerful. his discussion topics and lessons about topics like agency that incorporate teaching but also experiencing firsthand forced us to learn things, whether we liked it or not. \r\nweaknesses: not everyone shared or was open which can't be forced, but it would have been nice if others were more willing to fall. i felt like the most i got from the class was from berg's responses to my reflections because he led me to think about my writing in new ways that i didn't even think about while writing. i would have like more smaller discussion groups because the class was intimidating sometimes because it's hard to feel comfortable being open about personal experiences "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This is such a great class, Professor Berg is the man.  You'll get a lot out of it, but be sure that you're willing to think hard about things that make you uncomfortable.  You'll spend a lot of time reflecting on your life and experiences and learn a lot about yourself.  I couldn't recommend the class any more highly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I've already recommended it to every single one of my friends. This was my favorite class that I've taken in my entire four years at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES. Highly recommended! This was probably the class that left the biggest impact on me out of all the classes I took at Yale. I consider myself a relatively introspective person, but this class really challenged me in the way I thought about myself. I feel like this class focuses on content that should be talked more about, but is never explicitly discussed in a classroom setting. Highly highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you want to take more time to reflect, though this can be emotionally challenging! ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. Berg is a true legend with a good heart. The sooner you are able to trust him, the more you'll be able to get out of it. Takeaways of the course: 90% of conflict is the self. Always examine strong reactions (positive or negative). Take it and have fun with it. FYI it's basically group therapy, which is kind of nice if you're into that. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dr. Berg is a gem. ",
            "\u00a0YESSS!!! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. This class is like none other, and Professor Berg is once of a kind. However, know that you get out what you put in, so do take this class seriously. You can get a good grade by completing all the work and cruising through, but do spend time on the reflections and be engaged in class. Please also engage with all the other wonderful human beings in the class. ",
            "\u00a0While this course was challenging in the sense that it forces you to emotionally engage with the forces that have shaped in the individual in life thus far, and the forces that will shape the individual going forward, this process is incredibly fulfilling and rewarding, and if you are able to get a spot in the class, you should without a doubt take it! Classes like this are so rare, and it was an utter treat to be able to devote time to such an important and relevant topic this semester. Professor Berg is a stellar educator, communicator, and scholar, and it was an absolute privilege to take a course with him. It was my favorite class at Yale thus far, and I feel lucky to have been able to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This course is unique, but relevant for life at Yale and beyond! Self-reflection is difficult but can be powerful. This course is harder than many others at Yale, but in a very different way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It is like group therapy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is a wonderfully important class for anyone college-aged to take. I would recommend this class to anyone willing to put in serious effort to reflect on who they are as a person and how they interact with the various \"others\" in their environment. While the workload for this class is not heavy, it does require truly intense focus and introspection that can be emotionally draining at times. This is not a gut, and do not take it if you are going to treat it as such: you will find you wasted your time and will surely regret it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. In fact, I think EVERYONE should take it. It's so important to be able to self-reflect and to take a moment to step back and acknowledge all the things that are changing and going on around you. We bluster our way through college, and this class was a once-a-week breather where I could think about all the things I normally gloss over. I learned so much about myself and about people in general. Plus, Berg is a very interesting guy who I honestly wish I had heard more from (most of the class is students talking, as it should be). ",
            "\u00a0i can't put into words how important this class was to me this semester. this class is a revolution: it sends a great message to students that yale provides a class about learning about oneself. this taught me that there is value in reflection and introspection and learning about yourself from others (you learn what an \"other\" may be).  berg is the thread that weaves this class together--he is the most caring, thoughtful person i've encountered at this often intimidating institution. the thoughtfulness he puts into each class and every response to our reflections makes you think about yourself in new ways. this class is everything you put into it--i'm glad to say i took the plunge and was grateful for the outcome. i hope you do, too. ",
            "\u00a0If you get into this course, take it. I'm sure the other evaluations will describe what happens in the course better than I could. I came in practically scoffing at the concept of the course and highly doubting that I would learn anything about myself or the world through it. I was wrong. I previously tended to think of the sorts of things in the curriculum as pure hokey, but I did not think that about at least 95% of the concepts in the course (if not 100%) - and if I did, I was pushed to examine why I thought that, because that too is valuable to the class. David Berg is a fantastic discussion leader. Weekly, the course is not a lot of work. The two papers will be hard to compose but worth it. If you disagree with something in the curriculum or something that Berg says, talk to him about it - he will be delighted to talk with you. Write down your thoughts in class or surrounding your assignments, even if you don't voice them - this may come in handy. "
