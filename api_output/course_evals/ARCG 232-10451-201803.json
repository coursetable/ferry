            "\u00a0I learned about the comprehensive history of the Ancient Andes before the Spanish conquest, focusing on the various cultures, societies, and empires that dominated the landscape up until the Inca. We focused on identifying different periods through textiles, ceramics, and architecture. We were also able to learn about the various archaeologists responsible for many of the advancements in the field (Prof. Burger is definitely one of them!). "

Prof. Burger is very approachable, as was the TA. \r\n\r\nThe only change I would ask is that the exercises be more spread out (e.g. 1 before the midterm and 1 after, rather than both towards the end of the semester).
