            "\u00a0Strengths: No time spent out of class (besides final), easy Honors \r\nLimitations: Topics and lectures are a little dry ",

            "\u00a0This course was enlightening and had plenty of exciting in-class discussions. It was a seminar format, so students would need to have completed the readings in order to properly engage. ",

            "\u00a0The course covers a diverse array of topics related to environmental and occupational medicine.  It does not require much work outside of class until the take home final, and the two instructors were very knowledgeable about the topics and were engaging in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Dull but fulfills the EHS requirement. Guest speakers could've been far more interesting--would've been great to spend more time learning about occupational health issues among marginalized populations, but that was barely one lecture. Other lectures talked about different types of rocks and chemicals, which I found too specific and pretty boring. ",
            "\u00a0I realized that I didn't have to go to class after a couple weeks so I never went after that. It was really easy and almost no work except a couple of hours spent on the take-home final. ",
            "\u00a0This course was pretty good  There was a great variety of speakers.  Of course, many students are not EHS students and take the course as an EHS elective, and the professors did a great job selecting speakers on a variety of topics so that everyone would have at least a few lectures that sparked their interest.\r\n\r\nWhen the grade is based entirely on one paper and participation, it would be better to have more opportunities to participate or to have a sign in sheet for attendance.  I am not confident that the professors know my face to my name since the class size was large and many lectures were led by guest speakers, which leads me to question my participation grade.  \r\n\r\nOverall, I thought highly of this class.  Some speakers were better than other and some were more engaging than others, but that is to be expected. ",
            "\u00a0There were some really interesting lectures (9/11, lead, radon, healthcare workers) and some which I thought were a bit boring. This is a very laid-back class - almost like a seminar. Although this is dependent on the instructor (there were guest speakers), I think more in-class group discussions would improve the overall class experience. In general, the class was not very engaged, though this may differ from year to year. The lectures based on certain chemical exposures were a bit dry, so more discussions for those would be very helpful. The aforementioned lectures which I found interesting were the clear strengths of the class, and all had a common denominator: either Mark or Marty delivered them. ",

            "\u00a0This course is excellent.  It is very low stress and even though assignments are not assigned until the end, I came out learning so much more than other classes with twice the workload.  The lecture models and case studies were very cohesive and relevant.  Would highly recommend for anyone needing an EHS requirement! ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - Having guest lectures was nice, as it allowed us to hear from different people in the field \r\nWeaknesses- Most lectures did not have a lot of discussion between students and speaker, and the class is very long so it was hard to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Generally enjoyed the course. Felt that the class period was sometimes a little too long and could have been shorter. Felt stretched for content in some cases ",

            "\u00a0Certain topics were very sensitive and could have been addressed more appropriately- such as the 9/11 and Department of Defense lectures. I don't think it was necessary to watch the events of 9/11 in class, as the video could have been triggering for students who might have been affected by the events. In the future, a link to the video should be emailed to students to watch on their own time prior to attending class. The videos of the bombs being set off and military personnel perishing also may have been triggering to students. Overall, course was good introduction to occupational exposures. ",
            "\u00a0The class did cover a broad range of topics within environmental and occupational health with leaders in their respective fields. Unfortunately, many of these lectures were not really engaging and left many of us struggling to connect with and get an in-depth understanding of the topic. Perhaps incorporating a greater discussion/participation element in the course would make it more approachable and engaging to students. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly believe that this is how a good class should be taught. The professors were extremely compelling and knowledgeable lecturers. Their guest lecturers were also extremely interesting. The class was a great way to learn about Environmental and Occupational health as well as apply Epidemiology 1 concepts. My one suggestion is that they do a 10 minute break in the middle of class. The professors started to do that towards the end of class and I think they should continue to implement this. My other concern was that the World Trade Center lecture could be approached slightly differently. I recognized and appreciated the honest attempt to be sensitive, but giving the students an option to leave right before presenting leads to a sense of shame. \"I SHOULD be able to sit through this\" was the thought most of us were left with when we saw nobody getting up to leave. I think the best way to deal with this particular lecture in the future is by sending an email explaining the lecture and providing the students the opportunity to decide not to attend in person prior to the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of major topics on epidemiological issues in occupational and environmental medicine. ",
            "\u00a0i didnt learn anything from this course. i sat in on lectures that werent aligned with my interests at all. all we had to do with write a final exam, and that was the only time i had to engage with the material and learn anything. waste of my money to enroll in this course and i wish it was more interactive ",
            "\u00a0Interesting primer into the basics and essentials of epi and environmental health.  Would be nice to have a more overarching theme and relation between courses.  Seemed like a random assortment of topics that had no real flow from one to the other. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate that there was a wide variety of topics covered. The long length of a class session also allows for deeper discussion. I would've liked to have some progress report or other assignments due at earlier points in the semester so I could gauge how I was learning the material and possibly adjust if I wasn't; having 100% of your grade being based on the final paper is a little stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course had some interesting subject matter, that is not covered in my other classes. It was interesting to hear about issues and topics in environmental and occupational health, which may be useful in the future. I felt the course was geared more toward small groups, so it would be helpful especially if the class is as big as ours was, to split people up into small groups for the rest of the semester. I enjoyed the classes where it was more interactive and involved small groups. I felt the first class session could have reviewed the course more, especially since I had trouble understanding the importance and relevance of every class and topic to the overall field of environmental and occupational health.

The formula is simple, but this was the class I learned from the most this entire semester. The final was also extremely reasonable and fair. It adequately evaluated you on the concepts and themes of the class without feeling too challenging. I recommend this course for anyone interested in the topics and/or need to fulfill the EHS requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Good learning opportunity with applicable topics.  Easier course. ",
            "\u00a0Seems like public health 101.  A good course to meet the environmental health rec. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a seminar-style class and discussion, or anyone who is interested in learning about occupational health but doesn't have a very specific topic of interest. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered topics important to environmental and occupational health and included guest lectures covering a range of topics. I would recommend this class to students looking to get a general overview of environmental and/or occupational health. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend taking this course. I'd suggest taking risk assessment! "
