            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about diverse architectural forms in past and present Islamic lands. \r\nI learned the vocabulary to describe and communicate these forms. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a broad range of knowledge about Islamic architecture throughout history, ranging from Muhammad's house in Medina in the 17th century to modern buildings in the Middle East like the Burj Khalifa. This course helped me develop basic skills regarding the analysis of building in terms of aesthetics and cultural context. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different Islamic buildings and the historical contexts associated with them. We discussed the different dynasties that created each building, as well as their social and political effects. ",
            "\u00a0This essay greatly broadened my understanding of Islamic architecture and art, and developed my skills of historical and formal analysis.  The historical overview of the development of Muslim dynasties across the Subcontinent and the Middle East was also highly informative. ",
            "\u00a0So much! From the history of Islam to the current conflicts in the Middle East, from the theoretical background of orientalist to art and architecture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more that I could've ever expected to learn about Islamic architecture and its rich history. I also learned how to look more critically at architecture, considering notions of religion, power, appropriation, inspiration, and geographical placement. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to think spatially and make connections between architectural choices and political, religious, and economic motives. Learned so much about the Islamic world that youll only see glimpses of in PLSC/Global classes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Islamic architecture (including both religious architecture and the secular architecture of Islamic societies). I also learned how to perform visual analysis of architectural sites. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an excellent survey course, especially for those who have no prior knowledge of architectural terms or styles. The course makes you conversant in the overarching stylistic trends of Islamic architecture, as well as following those trends into the present landscape. I had no knowledge of architecture, Islamic or otherwise, before taking this course, and I found it enjoyable as well as fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rizvi's course is the first I've taken that (in part) interrogated architecture through the lens of craft. I think that was exceptional and as a result I highly recommend the course to any architecture/art/craft oriented person. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a type of architecture I never have been exposed to before. If was cool inverting my thinking from being so western focused. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of beautiful Islamic buildings around the world and a few dynasties I had never heard of. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a truly trans-chronological and trans-regional perspective of Islamic cultures through the lens of architecture that really enhanced my general knowledge of the religion, its history and its aesthetic. I also gained a broader knowledge of architecture including a sense of terminology and building techniques. I developed skills that enabled me to feel more comfortable analyzing and discussing architectural monuments in general but also specifically Islamic structures with accurate contextual information. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided both the architecture and historical context for various Muslim empires, nation-states, and cities, from the 7th century to today. As a survey course, there are some generalizations made and selections taken when it comes to the material taught in the course. However, the course does do a good job explaining the architectural styles presented, as well as the context and the issues surrounding discussions of the pieces. Therefore, the course is able to straddle both the historical and architectural explanations for the buildings and cities presented, which was helpful for someone who had no experience in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Through taking this course, I gained a broad exposure to Islamic Architecture over the past few thousand years. I also gained an understanding of the themes which unite and problematize the idea of \"Islamic\" Architecture as a category. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of Islamic architectural history ",
            "\u00a0Islamic history ",

            "\u00a0Very general overview of the most important monuments in the Islamic architectural tradition ",
            "\u00a0Learned how architecture is multi-faceted (pun intended) and should not be reduced to one type of description. This course taught me to look closely and analyze buildings based on the aims of their sponsor, the architect themselves, the geography, religion, traditions, and culture/s. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of Islam, important characteristics of Islamic architecture, and a lot of details about monumental Islamic buildings. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting overview of the history of Islamic architecture. This class is particularly beneficial in conjunction to a more traditional history of architecture course, as it provides a parallel to the common narrative of the western cannon. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a fantastic introduction to the study of Islamic architecture, and was a great counterpoint to many of the western-focused architecture and art history classes available at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Motifs of Islamic architecture were explored across history and location in this course. Specific monuments studied and students were tested on monument memorization (slides) and semester principles (readings and lectures). ",

            "\u00a0We covered around 6 buildings each lecture, and they got a bit difficult to all memorize in the end. If there was some sort of checklist in the future with the buildings we were expected to memorize, that would be great. ",
            "\u00a0The class felt monotonous at times  every class was essentially the same: we would look at 5-7 different buildings, each for 8-10 minutes, and then move on to the next. The second half of the class starts to explore cultural issues more, like orientalism, and this broke the monotony. Discussion section in the second half of the class included some very interesting conversations about the ethics of cultural appropriation and other related topics. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was a very strong course. The lectures were interesting and easy to follow. I also found the ta's to be very nice and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and the readings are well curated/accompany the lectures well.  The material is taught at a good pace for a larger class size.  The field trip to the MET was also highly enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I struggled a lot with the amount of memorization required in this course. I liked the content so much, though. Being tested on it was hard. ",
            "\u00a0This class is perfect. Lectures are mind-blowing, sections are happy, and readings are interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderfully organized, the lectures were fascinating and easy to follow, and sections were very helpful. I don't have any complaints--a great course in every way! ",
            "\u00a0Biggest strength is Prof. Rizvi. She is so kind and smart and thoughtful! Such a great lecturer and really fun.\r\n\r\nDid not like the art history-style exams, and wished we could do more creative assignments like the two papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include excellent lectures, a well-curated selection of readings, and a very fair workload. The only possible weakness that comes to mind is a perhaps overly ambitious syllabus -- we cover a *lot* of content over the course of the semester and it sometimes felt like the course moved a bit too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0This class is well organized, moving chronologically as well as geographically. The only weakness is that sometimes material was covered so quickly that it became a cursory discussion of the topic. Perhaps a way to improve this would be to narrow down the list of monuments discussed so as to be able to cover the most important ones more in-depth, which might be more useful than a shallow overview of all of the buildings. ",
            "\u00a0The slide studying was very difficult as the images/names of buildings were quite confusing at times and had to be adjusted by the TAs. Clearly slide pdfs or a complete one with exterior images for the exam would have been more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Kishwar Rizvi is very kind and informed but sometimes her lectures are disorganized and her slides werent always labeled. If the course were just a bit more organized it would be spectacular. ",
            "\u00a0Exams are tough to prepare for and all the information poured out of my brain as soon as the exam ended. Really interesting content and a rare course on eastern culture. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is the global approach it takes to the topic, covering a very wide range of time periods and geographic locations, expanding the notion of what \"Islamic architecture\" really is. The biggest weakness is the course's lack of organization: the professor's teaching style makes lectures fairly confusing at times to the point of discrepancy among the multiple TF's knowledge of the material. The slideshows used are also very disorganized and not properly labeled, making it harder to follow the presentation and to study for exams afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0As a survey course, it is of course difficult to gain additional specificity when time is as limited as it is. However, I thought that Rizvi's focus in each lecture was pretty expansive, and was able to make good general exemplifications through the half-dozen or so buildings described each lecture. I also thought that the visit to the Met was also a great inclusion in the course, as it helped to connect lectures and styles from different cultures and time periods. The sections also did a good job of furthering discussion, going beyond comprehension of the material to applying that comprehension to slide comparisons and broader contextual ideas. This course could potentially be strengthened by making more explicit the connections between the past and the present, and maybe first and second term ideas since it feels like the material before the midterm is easily lost. The grading structure could also be modified; having two 5 page papers count for only 20% of the final grade, when a 50 minute midterm counts for 30% of the grade does not make much sense. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are engaging yet relaxed. Section was helpful for reviewing the material. Since so much of the courses value comes from formal analysis and comparison of the buildings themselves, I felt as though the reading lists were a bit too extensive. I would have much preferred if the expectation was that we read the textbook and one additional short and interesting article to be discussed during section. ",
            "\u00a0Im glad this class is offered, and Professor Rizvi is a lovely personit just seems like covering so much material in a semester is impossible to do well, or with any depth ",
            "\u00a0Lots of memorization of dates and places, less focus on the interesting parts like history or significance ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are fascinating and Prof. Rizvi is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the class was not very organized and made it difficult to study for the finals. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are sometimes interesting, there isn't too much work. Exams are super memorization heavy and don't actually test understanding ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you to look critically at buildings. Also does a good job of drawing on concepts learned earlier in the course. However, this course does require a lot of memorization (dates, names of buildings and people, location) which can be difficult. This memorization also takes time away from allowing students to analyze and look at these works further. ",
            "\u00a0The course exams are too focused on memorization. If it is absolutely necessary to have them so centered on memorization, then there should be more resources for preparation, such as more than on review session. \r\n\r\nThe second paper prompt was very vague and I think people were penalized for their different interpretations of the prompt. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course that provides a strong introduction to the material and problems of Islamic Architecture. It is both challenging for art history majors and accessible to non-majors. The assignments are not at all burdensome but require engagement and a bit of creativity which was nice. ",
            "\u00a0The materials and lectures for this course were both extremely interesting. Section was helpful in answering questions, which was important because in addition to teaching the architecture of Islam, this class often had to teach more about the general history of the Islamic world to provide context, which was a huge task. It would have been helpful if we were given a bit more advanced notice on paper topics, but they were interesting assignments and not too taxing. The exams were the hardest part of the course, as we had to memorize somewhere between 50 and 100 buildings for each along with many facts, but were only tested on around 6 of them. This was the only part of the course I was less fond of, as I don't think it was a very helpful way to measure our knowledge or a very productive exercise in anything but memorization. More essay questions or a wider sampling of buildings on the exam may be beneficial in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rizvi was a riveting lecturer, and the course material was neither too broad in scope nor too limiting. I particularly appreciated the study of contemporary Islamic architecture and the way that the course engaged with questions of orientalism, architecture as state-building, and how exactly we define architecture as Islamic ",
            "\u00a0Great course with a great professor. A lot of monuments to memorize for second midterm but principles were clear throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The teaching staff of this lecture are just spectacular. The material is already interesting, but Professor Rizvi just takes it to the next level, and the TAs are with her every step of the way. The only weakness is that there is a lot of memorization that in some ways precludes actually understanding themes of the class... but perhaps that's just a difficulty of a survey class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: nation state monuments and present day buildings were great - wish there was a greater focus on this material\r\n\r\nWeakness: the tests were pretty outrageous in the ask of monotonous memorization of monuments where only 6/150 would be put on the test. It so took away from the potential of the course and of the tests themselves where the essays should have dominated. I was so excited to really get at the questions that Prof. Rizvi brought up on the first day - what constitutes Islamic art? role of nation vs. religion in this architecture, etc.? - but instead we were all dragged into piling these specific facts (often not even good interpretation/analysis) of buildings or else points would be taken off. I would have much more focused on carrying on specific themes throughout the course and making us engage these really interesting questions instead of brute memorization. Likewise the second paper was a bit odd in its ask and the fact that we were only given the prompt with just under a week before the deadline was not all that appreciated since work tends to pile up for all classes around the same times. I had higher hopes for the class and was sad that the tests, second paper, and general lack of emphasis on theme-building detracted from what I imagined the course to be. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great introduction to Islamic architecture and architecture in general. More than just critiquing the buildings, the class follows a historical timeline, so that every building is situated in context. The class traces empires, major world events, and design movements - and ties them back to Islamic regions. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you are willing to put in the time to memorize large volumes of information. This was my first art history course, and I did not expect to have to be able to recognize over 60 mosques, shrines, and other buildings for both the midterm and final. If you start memorizing early though, it is relatively doable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone, even those who are not familiar with art history. A course like this is a good way to learn about a different culture through the lens of the built environment. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course.  Professor Rizvi is intelligent, eloquent, and approachable.  The TA's are excellent and adapt well to the requests of students in their sections.  The material is engaging and the lectures are lead clearly. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Rizvi is amazing and the class is very engaging! Each week you look at architecture from another Islamic dynasty which is really cool. The second half of the class is about Islamic architecture as a tool for nation-building and in the modern age. Really cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I highly recommend this to any student; you do not have to have a background in architecture or art history to engage with this course. You will learn so much, and Professor Rizvi is an absolute joy to listen to and learn from in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! Prof. Rizvi is incredible! Her perspective on the intersections between art, architecture, religion, and economy is invaluable & eye-opening. The class offers a nuanced look at Islamic culture over 1000+ years through the engaging lens of architecture. Im not an architecture student but I still found it really interesting and accessible. Definitely shop it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student -- I took it rather on a whim, as it was a subject I knew nothing about, and I am very glad that I did decide to take it because I found it incredibly interesting and it gave me a better understanding of not only the architecture of the Islamic world, as well as a geographical and political overview that I found helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The topic is interesting. If only the course were more organized I would recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in learning more about Islamic architecture, this is the course for you. DON'T TAKE IT AS A GUT. The majority of people taking this are very passionate about the subject and it is not an insignificant amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0I am hesitant to recommend this course. The material is fascinating and covers a really wide range of topics but the course is not very well organized. Lectures can be confusing (especially if you don't have any background in the subject) and studying for the exams is really unnecessarily challenging because the slideshows are not properly labeled. The workload is not too bad but you do also have to put in extra work for yourself to really get a lot of the course (in terms of making sense of all the disorganized information). If certain improvements are made to the course in the future (or if you are personally willing to put in more effort), then I would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend this course if you enjoy architecture and Islamic cultures, or if you would just like to learn more about one (or both) of these. Definitely works as a Credit/D or 5th course, especially because the material is very interesting although the midterm and final do require studying of several dozen buildings for slide comparisons and essay topics. ",
            "\u00a0I truly enjoyed taking this course. Professor Rizvi is a fantastic lecturer and the material itself is fascinating. It still blows my mind that the islamic empires that we studied were able to erect such incredible structures. Also, definetly go to her office hours, she's wonderful to chat with. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, if you want to see lots of pretty buildings and do very little work, without thinking hard or critically at all ",
            "\u00a0Interesting but repetitive ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an incredible course that will not only give you a comprehensive view of Islamic architecture, but also many parts of the Islamic world. ",
            "\u00a0yes, great prof great content good stuff ",
            "\u00a0If you're already interested in the field, I suppose you should take it. But I don't feel like I gained much understanding about the history of these monumentseverything felt rushed and superficial ",

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students that are interested in learning about non-Western architectural history and traditions. It can be challenging to find that at Yale! It is a fascinating course. I enjoyed the vast majority of the lectures. However, I don't find the coursework or the examinations very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend this class. The buildings are so fascinating and beautiful and the bit of introduction to middle eastern history was interesting and engaging as well. Prof. Rizvi is so knowledgeable and lectures so well. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. No matter what you study, if you have any interest in beautiful buildings with intricate histories, take this class. It's not a gut by any means, but the workload won't kill you, and the level of appreciation you will develop for a culture that is so often villainized and neglected makes this one of the best classes offered at Yale.
