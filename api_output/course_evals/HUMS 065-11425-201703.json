            "\u00a0I  learned how to assess my education to see what values different values on education are being instilled in me. The last paper, which was about what our vision of the \"flourishing life\" is was a great exercise in thinking about what I really wanted out of my Yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to reflect. I don't really know how else to explain it, but I learned to think about concepts and ideas, reflect on them, decide whether or not I agreed with them, and then used that to develop a clearer vision of what I want to apply to my life. ",
            "\u00a0I developed many writing and participation skills. I also further developed my critical thinking skills. I learned how to speak up in class while also listening to others. I developed a better understanding of myself and my education. This course even reshaped my potential major. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good amount about philosophy and how to think. I learned a lot about other peoples opinions and points of view ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically and thoughtfully and insightfully dissect the beliefs of a tradition and try to understand how that tradition reflects society and how that tradition hopes society might reflect it. I also gained a great deal of insight into the way I approach my education and studies, and the way that might be changed to promote wellness and flourishing in my life. ",
            "\u00a0Developed an understanding of education and a \"flourishing\" life through readings of Confucianism, Christianity, and modern options (Rousseau, Wollstonecraft, Fiere, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I got an introduction to the ideas of the flourishing life and the role of education in Confucianism, Christianity, and some modern philosophers. By studying these traditions, I informed my own views on these subjects.\r\nWriting short papers on each of the two major traditions we studied forced me to distill my thoughts and insights, in the best way possible. I gained experience focusing my scope and using concise language in my writing.\r\nBeing in a seminar setting pushed me out of my comfort zone, as I generally tend to express my insights in written form rather than orally. However, being in this course dramatically boosted my confidence and comfort in discussion. I feel more comfortable voicing my thoughts and questions in general. ",
            "\u00a0Wow, I learned so much in this class. Academically I learned a lot about several philosophies and traditions, pedagogies, and perceptions of life. In doing so, I was able to critically reevaluate my own philosophy, religion, desired pedagogy, and perceptions on my life. I feel more motivated to make the most out of my next four years. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much not only about how to frame, understand, and value my education, but also how to think and analyze texts and arguments about what the \"Life Worth Living\" means. I learned about Christianity, Confucianism, and modern understandings of flourishing, as well as having many opportunities to evaluate those groups of thought against my own experiences and understandings. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of how to think philosophically improved. I also learned a lot about religious traditions. ",
            "\u00a0This course really managed to strike a balance between learning about a tradition and learning from a tradition. I also really liked the \"tripartite of a life worth living\"  model introduced in the beginning of the semester and used throughout the course in analysis of the various components of the human experience AND the interrelation between them. Overall, this course helped me grow as a thinker: it opened my eyes to nuances I didn't know existed and gave me ways to examine them effectively. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to vastly different ways of viewing the world and helped me shape my expectations and hopes for the next four years. Beyond just the academic knowledge that I feel I am coming away with, I feel as though I came away with a deep, profound sense of who I want to become (also the recognition that I am not there yet). ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper knowledge of several traditions and explored the value of an education, particularly a Yale education in context of my own life. ",
            "\u00a01. Critical thinking and analytical skills \r\n2. Different philosophers' beliefs and theories about human beings, flourishing life, and purpose of education. \r\n3. This class really helps students think deep about the meaning of a flourishing life and how they can use education to attain such a life. The class has been very enlightening. From reading various philosophical texts, discussing with other students, having intellectual conversation with the professor, and writing the final paper, my vision for a flourishing life has been altered and I have formed a deeper understanding about life in general. I have gained a clearer picture about how I want to spend my four years at Yale. "

            "\u00a0The discussions in the class were always very relevant to the readings and to the real-world. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- class size (and its restriction to first years only), professor, the course material/readings, the ideas behind the discussion and their application to life\r\nWeaknesses- honestly just felt like we needed more time to really dive into the material (sometimes I felt like things were left unsaid...maybe a discussion post online?) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the class was conducted by the students discussing the material we had read. The professor only intervened to better conduct the conversation and make sure all important topics were covered. It was also very interesting to read texts from several centuries ago to modern texts. Very important that we always brought all our discussions back to our education at Yale. Inspiring to read other students' final papers and to have my own read by others - they offered a different perspective than my professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was lead as a conversation. Therefore, each student could jump in whenever they felt they had something important to contribute. This disabled the more introverted students to speak up in class. In this sense, I think it would be more effective to have the professor indicated who can speak next in order for everyone to have their say. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely strong. Matt is a fantastic professor and the whole course was legendary. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was the in-class discussion, centered around the different ideas of each student in the class. Another strength was the final paper and the process of creating the paper through peer feedback. It could be improved by adding more projects or assignments here and there, instead of having only two smaller papers and a final paper. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strongest point of this course was the amount of introspection it encouraged. Each tradition we studied gave me food for thought, and begged me to juxtapose the ideals promoted in the tradition with my own. By the end of the course, I genuinely felt I had a better idea of what I wanted to gain from my college education.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can cite is that we did not write a paper on the modern philosophers, and I would have liked to synthesize the ideas they presented in the same way I did with Confucianism and Christianity. However, it makes sense that we were not assigned a paper at that time, since it was so close to the deadline of the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Matt invited us all to dinner and asked us this same question so I don't really feel the need to write it out again. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think there are any weaknesses of this class. The papers are short enough to require concise, comprehensive articulation of thoughts, the discussions are engaging and new, the readings are challenging and though-provoking. Matt is an incredible teacher and discussion leader, he makes plenty of room for disagreement and conversation among students, and you leave this class feeling equipped for other Yale seminars as well as a deep grasp of what this Yale education means.

            "\u00a0Yes! If you get in, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take this class especially if you aren't sure what you want to get out of college. I could not think of a better class to guide me as I begin my next 3.5 years here. ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely encourage every first-year to try to enroll in this class as it was life changing. Discussing matters that are impacting our lives right this moment as students at college was very helpful. The discussions we held in class, the authors and we read, and our classmates' and professor's feedback really helped me shape what I want to make out of my time at Yale. This class even helped me reshape my major. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class. Some epic discussions. Great material, great people, great teacher, great course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I believe every student at Yale should have to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is trying to figure out exactly what he/she wants from a college education. It was a great start to a first semester at Yale and caused me to reflect about the person I want to become and how I will use my education to get there. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to any and every other student. I think it's a perfect way to start off college. It allows you to see your education through multiple lenses--through those of the traditions studied, and through your own lens as it changes with each tradition. For me, it nicely facilitated the identity crises I knew I'd have coming into college, that everyone has coming into college. By the end, you get at the heart of what you want your college education to be, and even if (like me) you don't necessarily have a clear answer, you may have a better idea of what to look for. Matt is absolutely phenomenal; he's invested in all of his students as people, and seems to gain as much out of the class as the students do. Take this class if you have the opportunity to. You won't regret it. ",
            "\u00a0YES. It's hard to explain how impactful this class was, but the bonds you develop with your classmates and with Matt with help the transition to Yale be a lot easier and a lot more impactful. It's just such an emotionally and mentally fulfilling class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you can get in to this First Year Seminar you are incredibly lucky and MUST take it! Matt is an incredible teacher, the class makes you think so hard about the value, goals, intentions, and meaning of a Yale education and a flourishing human. The classroom environment is conducive to discussion, disagreement, improvement, and really close friendship between the 15 or so students. My Yale education will be better and more meaningful because I took this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I think about my life. Matt is such a caring, interesting, fun, brilliant professor. TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!! ",
            "\u00a0If you want to spend time thinking about questions like \"what matters to you\" and \"what sort of person you want to become\" during your first semester at Yale in a supportive environment, take this course. If you put your heart into it, this course will you grow as a student AND as a person. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student. I think it is a great way to start off first semester of freshman year, especially because the entire course is centered around figuring out how we want to use our Yale education. I think this class is incredibly valuable to anyone entering Yale college, regardless of academic interest or intended career choice. ",
            "\u00a0I could not recommend this course enough. Education and the Life Worth Living was the only truly meaningful class that I took this past semester and it made getting up at 9 am worth it. The discussions and the readings and the peer to peer engagement within the seminar were all amazing. This course truly changed me and I wish everyone could have that experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved this course and I would recommend it to any incoming freshman who can take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Most students come to Yale with a desire to make the most out of their four years at Yale. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is important to first know what a flourishing life means. After knowing what life they want to live and what kind of people they want to become, they can better decide how to utilize the four years. This course offers such a valuable opportunity for students to think through their ideal life with inspirations from renowned philosophers' beliefs, professor, and fellow classmates. "
