            "\u00a0I feel that my reading comprehension when it comes to long works written for native speakers has greatly improved. I am also able to write longer, more complex pieces and have the vocabulary to discuss very specific issues like the French resistance movement or religious practices. ",
            "\u00a0This class has been an incredible way to learn more advanced French grammar. Koizim is one of the most devoted professors I've ever had and the work, although plentiful and difficult, was great practice and all served a purpose. In reading French novels, we explored Africa as well as French occupation during world war 2. I could not recommend this course more. ",
            "\u00a0Very much improved my speaking ability ",
            "\u00a0Speaking, writing and reading in French. Also doing some basic research and presenting in the language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot in this course. The French sequence here is tough but I will say that after every semester I come out being able to speak with more comfort and technique than I could before and for me that is well worth the effort. "

            "\u00a0Can't say enough about the strengths: professor, content, skills gained. You go over some genuinely interesting readings, really useful vocab and grammar, and do it all with an amazing professor who is knowledgeable French but also cares about your well-being as a student and as a human. It's clear the instructors put a ton of effort and thought into designing the course, and in most cases it succeeds. Weakness is the workload. I get that the workload is essential towards improving French, but sometimes I do wonder if a three-week cycle (or even 2.5-week cycle) would be more effective than a two-week cycle. The current two week system just feels like a constant grind, where as soon as we get a revised Rdaction back we're on the next set of Evaluation/Rdaction. I would also like if the course content were designed a way to better build on previous content, since right now it felt like it was a sampling of disjoint grammar concepts and vocab sets that were tested together on the Evaluations. ",
            "\u00a0One of the few weaknesses of this course is that students did not get the chance to practice French in conversation as often as I thought we should. It was a pleasure listening to and learning from Madame Koizim; however, I feel as though I didn't practice my French as much as I did in last semester's French course. Consequently, I lost some of my speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0A very well-organized, well-structured course. No criticisms. ",
            "\u00a0French at Yale clearly has a system and it works; I cannot think of too many ways of doing it differently and definitely not better. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their reading and writing skills. I appreciated the combination of important French works and more obscure stories from around the Francophone diaspora. The 10-minute expos is also great speaking practice and a nice introduction to doing research in French. ",
            "\u00a0When recommending this class I would mention the strengths of the professor, but I would also warn about the amount of work and caution that one should only take this class if they are really dedicated to the language and enjoy language classes ",
            "\u00a0French 140 was just A LOT of work. I can't speak enough about the positives of the course Koizim, improving my French, getting to work with some finer points of grammar, and seeing a diverse range of global perspectives in the readings  but I also sometimes don't know if the rest of the time commitment was worth it. If you're taking 5.5 credits (which I was for several outside reasons), it will most certainly be an added burden on your course schedule because of the daily homework (I learned that it's 1.5 credits for a reason). In the end I would most likely veer to say that the benefits were worth the costs, but there were definitely times during the semester when I questioned that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I am sure that Madame Koizim is one of the best French professors out there! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an amazing and rewarding experience, especially if you get to do it with Prof. Koizim! ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are willing to do the work and you have an intrinsic interest or a particular reason why you actually want to learn French, this course will push you and will give you the tools to vastly improve your level of understanding and ability to speak the language. "
