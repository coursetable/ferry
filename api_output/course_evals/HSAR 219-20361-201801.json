I got to learn about how much power buildings have in terms of defining a place and how places can end up taking a life of their own. I also learned how architecture is a fairly subjective field and could very much rely on personal interpretation. I think this class has truly changed the way that I look at a place when I see a building, I'm more aware of my immediate reaction (pretty, ugly, etc.) and then I start thinking about the history of a place. I also started thinking about the people and the place, what went into building a place, and what it could be. ",

I wish there had been a stronger racial lens and focus on urbanism and architecture, as this was a topic that was discussed in the course, but as race and racism are the primary factors that drove American urbanism, I would have appreciated looking at the questions of the course through an explicitly racial lens.  It is a big lecture course that also covers architecture, so I am not surprised it had less of a focus on these topics, but I do think it would be valuable for a wide range of students to learn about the realities of American urbanism.

The intention was that this would exhibit broad trends and that we could discern the important icons from the group. However, the overwhelming number made it hard to actually focus. It's difficult to remember the important buildings visually when so many similar ones are passing your eyes. ",

Sometimes, I found it difficult to talk about things that I was seeing in the buildings we were studying because I didn't feel like I had the language. ",

Lectures were unengaging and felt as though they just rambled on. It never felt clear what we were expected to know and what we weren't. I felt like I left class having taken away nothing. Rubin should work to make the material more clear for students; I would recommend especially adding words to his slides. ",

I do think we sort of disproportionately emphasized the late nineteenth century and the late 1940s and '50s (considering how we were evaluated and the broader swath of U.S. history that surely had an impact on architecture and urbanism). It also would have benefited from a more balanced view of development and redevelopment, especially as a survey, where many probably were not familiar with these themes to begin with. Overall, this was a fairly strong and compelling course. ",

The content, especially once skyscrapers begin, gets super interesting as well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The sheer volume of content can be a bit overwhelming. One lecture can cover a very intimidating breadth of information. It is easy to get worried about studying and remembering these buildings come exam time. It was hard to tell what was relevant to memorize verses just appreciate during lecture. Of course, the two are often not mutually exclusive. But some more clarity over what information was tangential and which is a key structure a student should memorize would have helped come exam time.

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course manages to cover a vast amount of material in a single semester; it is a very ambitious survey course that largely accomplishes what it intends to do. \r\nWeaknesses: For non-architecture-majors, which is most people, the readings for this course can be frustratingly dense and esoteric, and that discourages many students from doing the readings at all. This class would be improved if the readings were either shorter or supplemented by more straightforward ones that don't assume a background in architecture terminology. It would also be helpful if a glossary of architectural terms, styles, and key figures was included in the syllabus, because definitions are never explicitly stated in the lectures or readings, which can make them harder to follow. Also, section meetings were not nearly as helpful or productive as lecture. Perhaps this was because each one was led by a different pair of students, but because there were completely new topics every week, the material was as unfamiliar to them as it was to the rest of the students; I would've preferred for my TF to just lead section and involve students some other way. Finally, the final exam was much too long-- 2 5-paragraph essays and 6 slide comparisons forced us to go for quantity over quality. ",

Nevertheless, there is a lot of information to cover, and the review materials are comprised of several hundred slides. Therefore, if there was any improvement on the course, it might involve trimming the time period slightly, although the material from the beginning of the course is still very interesting and important.

The building research project was actually a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The structure of the class wasn't great. Elihu started doing topic guides at the beginning of lectures about halfway through the semester, but he should have done that from the beginning because it was sometimes hard to follow the narrative arc he was trying to convey. Sections were hit or miss--I have a couple friends who had really useless ones. Sometimes there was just too much material, and the slides for the final were absolutely ridiculous (there should have been 50-100 slides that we learned in depth). ",

The only issue I have is that I feel the course flows very similarly to Vincent Scully's stream of consciousness, and it's hard to follow the topics logically. I don't mean it's hard to understand the topics, but just hard to understand the flow of the themes. I think Professor Rubin did realise this after a few students pointed out to him mid-semester that lectures do not quite follow a logic as well (yes, it follows a theme) and tries to show the logic of the lecture, but frankly after taking all 20+ lectures sometimes the logical structure still eludes me. ",

I liked that we looked at buildings that seemed prosaic, but actually had a rich history and important place in the community. The weakness of the course was that there was so much content that it was difficult to know what we were expected to take from the lectures. I think that if unifying ideas could be outlined more clearly that would help students feel more confident for the final and study in a more productive manner. It felt like we were given a lot of information to memorize, but understanding underlying trends and tensions and similarities between similar ideologies was what was really important. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic!!! Professor Rubin is incredibly engaging! There could be a little bit more attention paid to the sections, as there was a big disparity in the quality and difficulty of the sections. I also found the rubric and grading of the assignments to be vague and confusing. ",
            "\u00a0I'd say the strength is the assignments; besides weekly comments on the readings, we only had to do a profile on a building in New Haven and a research paper that could relate to literally any theme we had covered in the class. The first assignment got me to visit the Department of Records to obtain information on the building I was assigned, and it kind of blew my mind how much information the city has documented on the most innocuous of buildings. I also loved the freedom of the second assignment. I think the class is great at making the world of architecture accessible to people like me who have never had any exposure to it at all. This might be part of the weakness of the course though, which is that we cover such a wide swathe of history (basically colonial era until today) that we aren't really able to go too in depth into any era. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting from a materials perspective, and Professor Rubin is clearly a very nice man (and was great when he lead my section!) However, I found Professor Rubin very difficult to follow and his lecture style somewhat distracting. He spoke in a way that sometimes confused me and other students in the class and made it difficult for us to understand his point. This was not true in section setting, but in lecture I found it very difficult to pay attention. The same was true of many of the readings assigned. Scully, in particular, was very inaccessible to me and many peers I spoke with. ",
            "\u00a0Elihu is a fantastic Professor and the structure of the course was very good. Some lectures felt scattered because Elihu fell behind and tried to cram too many themes into one 50-minute lecture but otherwise, a fantastic course. ",

This class has a very low workload, and I think that the 2 projects that we did have could have bee organized to facilitate learning more related to the class a bit better. I don't feel that I got much out of either, but I did get a lot out of the class when I had to study for the exam and the ideas started stitching themselves together in a way that made sense. Lectures were scattered and not necessarily on track with the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class lies in Professor Rubin's knowledge of the subject and passion for architecture. I enjoyed the visual focus: the way Rubin used images to illustrate every point. However, it would be more helpful for there to be a bit more text in the lecture slides, primarily for greater ease of note-taking. Sometimes it was challenging to put into one's own words what the building or map represented, and it would have been nice to have Rubin's description below. The \"researching a building\" assignment was also a major strength, as it was a completely unique experience that ended up being rewarding. Something that could be improved is the structure early on in the course, as it could seem choppy at times and hard to follow the narrative. ",

His vast knowledge, passion for the material, and dedication to the course really benefitted students and allowed students to both enjoy and learn from lectures. Beyond simply imparting knowledge, Professor Rubin ensures that the course encourages students to think critically about the landscapes and structures they encounter. Another strength of the course is its ability to cover such a wide range of time periods, giving a broad perspective on American architecture and urbanism. One way to improve the course would be to take time during discussion sections for teaching fellows to review what we have learned in lecture, emphasize some of the most salient themes, architects, and buildings, and connect the lecture material into a broader narrative. This would allow students to further benefit from the expertise of the teaching fellows, even if it means taking time away from discussing the readings. Another potential suggestion would be to take time during lectures to provide a succinct definition or list of defining features each time a new architectural style is introduced, as having these definitions would be especially helpful for students coming from varied backgrounds, although it is very helpful that Professor Rubin does make a concerted effort to make the material accessible to all.

I would suggest less buildings covered and identified, in exchange for more depth surrounding each building, and its social history. ",

Once that decision has been made I believe the format will be way more streamlined. I also think because Prof. Rubin expected the class to be a lot smaller it wasn't organized as efficiently.

As race and racism drove the way urban spaces in the America were created, grew and were subsequently governed I would love to see this course embrace these realities.  I appreciated and it was a strength of the course that it touched on these issues, but I think it would be valuable for such a big lecture course to focus on these realities very explicitly so as to engage a wide range of students in understanding the racialized realities of American urbanism, as it can explain so much of the United States current situation in general.

I have a thorough architectural background, but I've found that other courses are mostly ancient or totally modern, and European, not so much American and not so much 18th/19th century. I enjoyed it.\r\nOne of the projects was to research a New Haven building, which I loved because it involved primary source research.\r\nThe second paper is a typical research/analytical paper, but it's short and easy.

            "\u00a0Yes, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. The lecture is just slides with buildings and Professor Rubin's commentary about their appearance. I thought that he would talk more about the readings which were typically more interesting than what was going on in class because they covered the investors that made buildings possible, the role politics played in architecture, etc. It was not necessary to go to lecture to do well/understand the material in this class. Just do the readings and go to section. ",

The course provides a broad overview of building types, urban planning, and architecture, and it not only helps students interpret the built environment around them, but it also encourages them to think critically about their surroundings. Professor Rubin makes a conscious effort to make the material accessible to students from different backgrounds, and his passion about the material is contagious. ",

There was just so much material covered that what we learned seemed very surface-level. At the end, we had about 600 buildings up for IDs, and none of them were covered in extreme detail. Furthermore, we never had a clear definition of fundamental architecture terms. For those approaching the course with no art history or architecture background whatsoever, this made the course very difficult to follow at times. I would like to see this course offered in the future with a more streamlined and clearly defined agenda per lecture, as well as a reduction in the number of buildings covered (with an increase in the quality and depth of information given surrounding these buildings).
