            "\u00a0The lecturer gave an intuitive picture of the presented topics. This is very helpful. However, to actually use all this one also needs to be familiar with the formal definitions and proofs. This came a bit short in the class. Homework assignments would be extremely helpful to get the hands on the concepts. "
