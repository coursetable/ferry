            "\u00a0learned about global competitiveness ",
            "\u00a0This was a discussion/presentation based course that surveyed areas of society/sectors that are being disrupted by technology, and how we can leverage technology to improve competitiveness. The skill you learn is framing elements that bring about change. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of case studies ",
            "\u00a0The course focused on increasing global competitiveness through Science and Technology. Overall the course helped illuminate what global competitiveness is, how countries go about improving it, and provided interesting technological and scientific anecdotes to facilitate those learnings. The best insight from the course came from working with Professor Braverman himself, which I found very valuable, both personally and professionally. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to an incredibly diverse range of topics in science and technology, and Professor Braverman did an excellent job tying these together with the common thread of competitiveness. I learned how to think about the practical side of goals and impacts: how are they achieved, how will they benefit a country and in what way, who will work for them and what inputs will they use? Also, I found it very valuable to teach on my own area of interest for a lesson. I learned how to express information in a digestible way, and really benefitted from working with two other incredibly intelligent students in putting together the presentation. "

            "\u00a0great content and course mandate\r\n\r\ni wish that Eric would have led more of the discussions. he has far more to teach us than we have to learn from one another ",
            "\u00a0This course was designed under the premise that we should learn from our peers as they teach us about areas of competitiveness that they were most knowledgeable or passionate about. I enjoyed that structure for the most part because it gave us exposure to a wide variety of topics and issues. However, I felt it would have been better to dive deeper on a smaller set of topics than to have a number of more superficial discussions on a wider variety of topics. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I found it quite troubling that the vast majority of the class consisted of male students (somewhere around ~80% of the twenty-something students were male). If this class was not designed as a learn-from-your-peers seminar, this might not have been as much of a problem. But I think that it is crucial for a seminar where we are expected to learn from the diversity of backgrounds and ideas presented by our colleagues that the students offer a fair representation of both genders.\r\n\r\nI think this lack of gender diversity, while not normally something I would fixate on, was quite out of proportion in a class where it really mattered, and it tainted my experience during class discussions. \r\n\r\nI understand that it may have been difficult to get female students to apply for this class. In the future, I would suggest doing one (or both) of the following: (1) shrink the class size so that it is proportionate to the number of female students that apply and/or (2) proactively reach out to women's groups in each of the Yale schools to encourage them to apply. ",
            "\u00a0The open discussion format was conducive to the exchange of ideas, but at times it was difficult to bring all thoughts together and reach a conclusion (perhaps thats one of the points of the course - that we dont know whats up) ",
            "\u00a0Could be improved by having more feedback throughout the term ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are its ambitious mission and wholehearted belief, which it instilled in its students, that we can make a change in this world.\r\n\r\nThe weaknesses were the class schedule and format of individual sessions. The class itself needs to meet more frequently for longer. There is simply too much to cover in the 7 sessions we had. The method of instruction was largely students teaching students which worked, but varied significantly in quality. Some groups did great, others not so much. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness with the course is related to knowledge retention. Because the class only met once every two weeks, it was sometimes difficult to recall specific details from previous lessons.\r\n\r\nThe course had many strengths. The best was the structure of each class:\r\nStudent presentations provided examples and introductions to the broader area the class was addressing; discussion time brought up a number of ideas, arguments and suggestions; and then some kind of concrete example, guest speaker, or presentation, organized by Professor Braverman, gave us an insight into the real world consequences of the issue.\r\n\r\nAlso, the way the class dealt with genuinely current events and issues was amazing. The content was truly evolving with contemporary news. "

            "\u00a0eric is amazing. so i would recommend based on him. however, some of the material we went through was shallow such that i could just read the economist for a few months and get the same level of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a pleasure to learn from Braverman. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure! Especially if youre taking it as an undergraduate, theres a lot of peer learning happening with students from professional schools. ",
            "\u00a0Mixed bag. Cool classmates and topics, little deep engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - i'd recommend any of Professor Braverman's classes. They are guaranteed to make you think in ways you previously might not have. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. The opportunity to learn from such an experienced and knowledgeable professor, in a classroom full of talented and intelligent students from an incredible range of different academic backgrounds - from so many different Yale schools! - is genuinely so rare. "
