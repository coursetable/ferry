            "\u00a0General information into the history of interactions between American Indians and the United States government, as well as deep insight into how this relationship has been shaped and what this means for the future of Indian Country. ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about American Indian history, law or policy going into this, and I am so glad I took the class because, as someone interested in law school, it opened me up to a fascinating area of American law. The class will provide a solid introduction to the historypersonal, political and otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about history of Indigenous law and landmark cases. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the major themes and periods that define the history of federal Indian Law and Policy. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about federal Indian law, as well as an overview of Native history in general. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course with essentially no understanding of Indian law, and very little understanding of Native American history (I hadn't taken Professor Blackhawk's intro lecture course, and so any knowledge I had was pieced together from a few other courses that didn't focus on Native history so much as touch on it, laid on top of very basic knowledge from high school). As a history major and someone considering the possibility of law school in the future, I think that this course was invaluable. I feel like a gained a worldview and an insight into very important and too-often overlooked field. ",
            "\u00a0In American Indian Law, we were given the opportunity to pursue an in-depth analysis of the legal history that has affected the hundreds of Native American nations since colonial encounter with the government that would become the United States. The complex ideas of tribal sovereignty and American Indian land tenure, are two main examples that illustrate that the lives of Native American populations are intensely intwined with those of non-Indian American citizens. This was likely one of the most rigorous classes I have taken, as it took me a while to wrap my head around the legal arguments and how they fit in historical policy impacts, but it has been one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken as well. ",
            "\u00a0My writing certainly improved over the course of this class. However, I think the greatest skill I learned was how to approach one of the most profound, important and often overlooked subjects in American history. There is truly no limit to the areas this course to go and being able to touch on almost every one was an incredible experience. ",
            "\u00a0That American Indian Law & Policy is pretty complicated because there are so many mediums of government that it works through. Also that every Supreme Court case decision, every law, etc. are all grounded in some moment of history in which the culture that defines the era dictates the decision-making. Also that the excuse of making tribal governments and tribal governments out to be too new or not established is quickly becoming highly insufficient in justifying decisions/laws that diminish tribal sovereignty. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Indian American tribal sovereingty at a pretty extensive level ",
            "\u00a0I came into American Indian Law and Policy without absolutely no background in Native American history generally. I developed a solid understanding of Native American legal history and general background as well. My writing has definetely improved, I've learned how to think critically about issues that are incredibly pertinent to American society today which we often overlook. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a comprehensive introduction to federal Indian law and policy, and I practiced reading and writing about case law in a way that I had never done before. I appreciated that we did work with original documents as well as with more recent scholarly interpretations of such documents. "

            "\u00a0The course was highly effective in discussing law and policy and how these relate to Native Americans. The discussions we had in class were insightful, although sometimes there could be awkward pauses as people ran out of things to say. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were great and helped me explore the area in great detail and with breadth. \r\n\r\nThe class meetings themselves were not all that structured and would've benefitted from a more careful course plan. There were lots of interesting questions and topics that we never effectively broached as a class. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of readings, and it was very discussion-heavy in class. However, it was all very interesting and worth the reads. ",
            "\u00a0It is definitely taught as a history course and not as a law or policy course. Legal arguments are taken at face value, and policy positions were evaluated only retrospectively, normatively, and through a specific, socio-historical lens. From that angle, it did a pretty good job of that. I would have preferred reading more case-law/legal writings and less history, but I understand not everyone was looking for that, and I can't say the syllabus/instructor misrepresented the course. Finally, It frequently felt one-sided, politicized, and agenda-based. Even though I mostly agreed, that was frustrating intellectually as no one's assumptions were challenged. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazingthe workload is good, and I felt engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. Material was interesting; Dr. Blackhawk does a really good job of selecting incredible readings for the course. 2. Writing feedback was super helpful; Dr. Blackhawk gives great line edits. 3. Essay topics were engaging and aided my understanding of the subjects. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Grading structure: My final essay should not count for 40% of my total grade! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Blackhawk has a lot of personal experience in this intersection of history and law, and it shows. I looked forward to doing the reading, and always felt like I was gaining a lot from doing it. The final paper is very open, and Professor Blackhawk is really helpful in terms of helping you develop your topic if you reach out to him. \r\n\r\nOh! And the guest speakers we had in class were great, and I felt I learned a lot from them as well. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Despite his wealth of knowledge, Professor Blackhawk is not always the most engaging in class discussions (he sometimes talks very slowly, if that's something that frustrates you). \r\n\r\nThis is not a weakness, per se, but experiences of this class probably vary between Native and non-Native students. As a non-Native student, I'm not the best person to comment on this, with the most clear or meaningful understanding, but I wanted to just point it out from what I was able to notice. As a non-Native student in the course, I was definitely careful about when I was speaking/always keeping in mind where I was coming from and my own lack of knowledge. I felt that I was learning a lot from other students in the course. Because of how undertaught Native history, and particularly Indian law is, I would guess that most non-Native students in the class are coming from a similar lack of knowledge. Basically, it seems that there was a pretty big divide in baseline knowledge among students in the course, and I would listen to the reviews of Native students to see if this is something that was frustrating, or not. (Particularly because non-Native students are essentially relying on Professor Blackhawk's selections and own presentations of the topic, without other perspectives to lean on). ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is the reading that we are able to deeply study through this course, and the facilitated synthesizing of this material that Professor Blackhawk provides with his wealth of knowledge and experience. If anything was to be improved, perhaps changing the class time from 9 am would be important, as I believe the more tired students at times provided less robust answers in our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the final project--the freedom of the topic helped me become motivated about such a long paper, but the structure made sure I stayed close to the class material. I wish there was more room for course material suggestions, but those chosen were quite helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it serves as both an introduction to American Indian issues/history for students who maybe know very little about American Indians in general, but were drawn to the course because of Law in the title. But the course also allows students who are already very familiar with American Indian issues/history to dive deeper into the information and learn more about how American Indian Law & Policy came about today. The weaknesses are probably that if a student wanted to continue to learn more about American Indian Law & Policy, this is the only course in Yale College to do that in depth, so that is not necessarily a weakness of the course, but a weakness of the college course offerings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor Blackhawk is super nice, the lectures were interesting, and he was clearly passionate about the material\r\nWeaknesses: email was a blackhole ",
            "\u00a0This was addressed when we moved to the NACC- our original room in LC was too small for Professor Blackhawk to be able to sit so at the beginning of the semester it felt like we were talking directly to him rather than to him and the rest of the seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this class provided me with a strong introduction to federal Indian law and policy, and I appreciate that the course was split into various legal areas to which this field of study can apply (including gaming, environmental policy, etc). "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to not just students with an interest in Indian Country, but also those with an interest in United States law in general. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in a fascinating area of the law, yes.\r\n\r\nI probably would not recommend if you are not interested in law school or some sort of public service. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Incredibly necessary not just to prospective law school students (which, if you are, TAKE THIS CLASS), but to all Yale students in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, it is the only course which offers students the opportunity to study the history of Federal Indian law and policy which I found to be unexpectedly fascinating and thought-provoking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if you are interested in history, law, or anything else adjacent to that. Everyone NEEDS to have a proper background in Native history, and this class is perfect for it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if the grading structure is changed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The content is fascinating and so important. One thing you will learn in this class is how undertaught Native history and especially Indian law is not just in universities but in law schools nationwide, so take this class now. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this is an excellent class that combines ideas of political theory, legal interpretation of primary sources, American history from the precolonial to the present, and some concepts in critical race theory.  It made me realize that the diverse fields of law could also be an area that I could explore further in my career paths. ",
            "\u00a0Certainly. Regardless of major, this course opens students' eyes to a defining moment of American history that is seldom studied. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone who considers themselves interested in American Government or wants to be a policymaker or whatever, this course is vital. This course definitely taught me how little some students know about Native American peoples and their contemporary issues as well. I would recommend this course because American Indian Law & Policy is extremely relevant today since law & policy as decided by different facets within the US Federal Government have a strong impact on Native peoples. The students in the class could possibly be put in situations that relate to Native law/policy and it is important that this class may serve as their first exposure to the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yup! Great chance to learn about American Indians in a more modern context. Prof Blackhawk was very knowledgeable and passionate about subject. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- Professor Blackhawk is incredible but this material is also super important and very difficult to access at Yale. He will help you grow and so will the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This class helped me become acquainted with concepts associated with Indian law so that I can now take this information that I've learned and use it in the future as a lens through which to interact with other law courses and legal work.
