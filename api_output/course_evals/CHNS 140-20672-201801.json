            "\u00a0This course developed my reading, writing and speaking in Chinese. I think that my speaking improved a lot over the course of the semester, and I found it easier to memorise Chinese passages and speak with more ease. ",
            "\u00a0You develop intermediate writing, speaking, listening, and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to effectively read and write chinese, as well as listen and speak the language at a higher level. ",
            "\u00a0In short, I learned a lot of Chinese. My writing, grammar, and speaking all improved significantly. "

            "\u00a0Strength: meeting 5 times a week, although extremely time consuming, did help my chinese skills improve more quickly. The course was very clearly laid out and the teacher's were very organised.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The workload of this course is huge. In order to keep up with the class, you have to spend over an hour each night reviewing content and doing activities assigned. This impacts the time you have available for you other subjects. \r\nAlso, I found the conversion from English to Chinese in the written exams to be very difficult, although I had done comprehensive and thorough revision on the structures. Also, some students who are more confident in speaking tend to dominate class discussions, so I think there needs to be a greater effort taken to ensure the quieter / less confident students also have the ability to speak in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teachers are incredible \r\nWeakness: The sheer amount of work and time makes it easy to burn out. ",
            "\u00a0There could be less assignments, it distracted from the overall point of the crouse which is to improve chinese skills in general. The amount if work was overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class is in how well it teaches Chinese -- this doesn't need much explanation. The main weakness is the workload (2 hours per night five days a week is standard) -- it discourages people from continuing with the language. Much of the work is helpful and drives learning of the language (the strength of this class), but I felt the Quia quizzes were not particularly helpful, took an inordinate amount of time, and had very subjective questions. In addition, there are a few other weaknesses. First, I felt that the complete-the-sentence multiple choice questions on the tests often contained material not explicitly taught in the class, making them frustrating to answer. Second, I would appreciate more clarity on exactly how the grading is done -- perhaps the professors could provide a sample grading spreadsheet, already filled in with sample numbers, at the beginning of the semester. This would allow students to easily see how exactly their final grade will be determined, and they could replace the sample numbers with their own grades throughout the semester to get a rough idea of their final grade. I also would like to know the cutoffs between A and A-, A- and B+, etc. Third, I felt the end-of-year project didn't need to be done as a group. I would much prefer at least an option to do an individual, 4-minue video with 3 interviews. Instead of having a partner film the interviews, students could rent tripods from Bass Library or ask their friends not in the class to film them. "

            "\u00a0If you want to increase your language capabilities, this course is great. Do keep in mind the massive time commitment and constant workload. ",
            "\u00a0Xu Laoshi and Liang Laoshi are the best! They work around the clock to make sure no student is left behind, they really care about everyone's learning experience, and they are unfailingly energetic and passionate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for students who are very serious about learning chinese. ",
            "\u00a0If you love Chinese or need to take one or two semesters of it to fulfill your language requirement, take this class. If you're not truly passionate about the language, don't -- the workload takes over your life. "
