            "\u00a0I was able to learn about oil painting and put this into practice. Also learned a bit about different painters and color theory. ",
            "\u00a0I had never oil painted before so I got some basic techniques and experience with the medium. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my knowledge of how paint can function as a medium and how to begin to learn to manipulate it to best convey a message in my work. I think I learned more about respecting painting and understanding it as a form of art than I did about techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of using oil paints and got exposed to a variety of works by different artists. ",
            "\u00a0I learned techniques related to oil painting, which included how to handle the paint, in what ways solvents affect it, how color relations interact on the canvas and a variety of other skills which were critical with producing artwork I was proud of. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to paint! I have been leaning toward the art major and painting has always been a medium that intimidates me, but taking the class allowed me to learn how to control paint and use it in my own work. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I felt like there could have been more individualized teaching, although I realize this was limited by the class size. I had never painted with oil before and I felt like there could have been a bit more instruction on how to use the medium. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how open and flexible the course was, particularly in regards to each student's own style and creativity. Sophy also seemed genuinely invested in every student. I wish there had been more technical instruction at the beginning since this is an intro course and that we'd explored more different kinds of styles and techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this course was an introduction to painting as a medium and how to subvert traditional notions of painting. It may be hard in the smaller time frame, but I wish we could have had more time in class to practice certain skills or learn about brush size/paint quality etc. ",
            "\u00a0For new painters, 1 week per large piece without much guidance given is completely unreasonable. If the course were to begin with smaller technique oriented assignments more frequently and then move towards larger painting pieces with more time given as the semester progressed this class would have been more educational and less stressful. I really liked the variety of things we got to paint and I loved the final project but this course would make more sense as Intermediate Painting not Basic Painting. \r\n\r\nMy biggest complaint though is the lack of mention of grades the entire semester. On the syllabus it originally said that we would meet with out professor halfway through the semester to discuss our work and where we stood within the class and how to improve. Not only did this meeting never happen, no mention of grades were made the entire semester. In an ideal world this is fine but some of us don't have the luxury to take this course CreditD and not care about the grade so clarity on what we should strive to improve would be much appreciated. More specific feedback generally on each assignment would be useful to integrate moving forward as well. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course could be improve by doing more small level projects in the beginning and by practicing basic techniques such as color mixing and shading. Demonstrations would have also been very helpful. \r\n\r\nI definitely feel like the course did a good job of opening up to allow us more freedom as we went along, but it could have used stronger foundations before letting us loose. ",
            "\u00a0It is very difficult to accomplish a lot during the standard 2 hours, 2 times per week art course with a reasonable amount of work assigned outside of class time. As a result, I felt that there was not enough instruction in the fundamentals of oil paint as a medium, and even then, once we progressed past still lives there was not enough time to explore other genres of painting in class (like landscapes, portraits, or abstraction beyond the one text painting we did). There was lots of freedom for the final project, but I felt it was not as productive as it could have been because we were trying to push ourselves beyond still lives without actually having had any instruction in other subjects. We also only did 4 paintings before the final project (a series of 4 paintings). That being said, I'm not sure how to get past all of these issues in a reasonable time frame given the time constraints of undergraduate courses, especially as we are all so busy with our other classes and commitments. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class budget should definitely be more. As a low-income student,  I was misled on how much I would have to be paying for the class. The materials fee, I thought was for my own materials. Instead, it was for the class budget and that money can only go so far. Yale definitely should have been able to contribute more, so my paying over 200 dollars in order to do the bare minimum for color mixing and brush strokes was discouraging. Also, this 200 dollars was a lot to handle, as that money usually goes to helping me pay for shuttles home and other necessary purchases like this. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is that the professor made sure to individually talk with each student during each class and check up on their painting, while also giving many tips on what could be done to improve painting skills and technique on rendering certain objects or micing color. A weakness is time. Oil paint was the main medium and because of that, it felt like there was never enough time to completely finish a piece. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to people who are interested in painting if they have time in their schedule to devote to it. It does take quite a bit of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely as long as they had the time to dedicate to it wholly and I would especially recommend it to seniors who have already fulfilled requirements and want an enjoyable class they can take credit D and not have to stress over. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who already have a background in art because the students who thrived the most throughout the semester were those who already had  knowledge of either painting or drawing. ",
            "\u00a0I have reservations about recommending this course. In my opinion there was not enough technical instruction in the oil medium and in painting techniques (for context, I had never used oil paints before and this was my second Yale art class). Even by the end I felt that I was still mastering things as basic as color mixing. We only made four paintings-- a black and white still life, a monochrome still life, and a full-color still life, all before sharply changing direction and making an abstract text painting-- before the final project, a series of 4 paintings inspired by works at the YUAG or YCBA. I felt that I was out of my depth especially during the final project, since many of us chose to paint subjects like landscapes or figures that we had never had any instruction in painting during the course. Even with the limited output, there was a significant time commitment outside of class, so you have to be ready for that and excited about spending a lot of time in the art studio-- oil painting is just very slow! I also felt that Sophy was not a very present instructor. She made interesting comments during critiques and was very helpful with color mixing when asked, but a lot of our class time was spent doing independent work without a lot of constructive technical feedback from Sophy. I did enjoy the presentations we did about various artists-- they gave me a lot of new perspective on recent art movements and the breadth of possibilities in painting. It should also be noted that it is very expensive to take this class-- in addition to the materials fee charged by the registrar, I spent upwards of $200 on required supplies. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because it really helps students develop their understanding of oil paint and how to use. Also, students do not need to have any experience in painting or art whatsoever to take the course, as long as they try, the experience is very fulfilling! "
