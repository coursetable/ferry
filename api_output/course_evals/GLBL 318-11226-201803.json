            "\u00a0Great overview of the economic past, present, and future of China!! ",
            "\u00a0As an Econ EAS double major, this is THE class (it double dips into both major requirements so heck yes). I think I learned really high-level stuff about what's going on in China. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of how China's economy has developed since Mao, the economic issues facing the country right now, and how China must move forwar policy-wise ",
            "\u00a0Learned about the future of China's economic development and whether it will collapse or excel as it rebalances its economy to a consumer led society based on spending and not saving. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course, I am now able to read any news article about China, which comes up very frequently, and understand what is going on. Before I typically shied away from these types of articles/discussions because the topic of China's economy seemed so foreign and complex. This course did a fantastic job of helping me better understand the global economy at large and helping me understand the true interconnectedness of countries of economies today in a way that none of my economics courses prior to this had. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the challenges China's development trajectory created and the strategies China is taking/should take to address them. The class also provided insight into China-US relations. ",
            "\u00a0How to apply economic concepts to a real world analysis and to study a case in detail, how to consider an argument from all angles ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of what historical elements led to where China is today, and how those factors shape its trajectory moving forward. It applied macroeconomics learned in other courses to the specific and very unique case that China is. ",
            "\u00a0Everything you could possible want to know about China and the future of our world.  This class takes on big concepts and leaves you with a much greater ability to assess and analyze topical news about the two largest nations in our world (by annual GDP). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the current political climate in China and U.S.-China relations. The class was incredibly relevant and provided an overview of the ongoing trade war, even helping to explain how it began in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about the current problems in China and the many ways China can overcome those problems and transition to the Next China. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the direction of China's economy; I was able to develop my analytical and factual recall skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the economic challenges China faced over the past century, and now moving into the next century. I learned about cultural, political, and economic factors and the challenges they created for the PRC. We learned how these challenges were addressed successfully, and even unsuccessfully. I learned a lot about China, socialist market economies, and developmental economics from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Youll learn about what changes China needs to make to grow sustainably into the future. Highlights include a talk from Markus Rodlauer of the IMF. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Really one of my favourites at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about current issues with china ",
            "\u00a0Improved my ability to look at academic works related to international economics. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed learning about China's development on the macro level. It was a very interesting course to take! ",
            "\u00a0This course greatly helped me contextualize current events within a context of Chinese economic development over the past ~75 years. Additionally, I really appreciated the depth and breadth of the content that was covered, as well as interesting guest speakers and incredibly knowledgable TAs. Not only do I feel significantly more well-read on issues regarding China, this course helped me thing about global macroeconomic trends more broadly. I am very happy I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very valuable insight on the interconnectedness of global markets, and wildly increased my knowledge on China as an actor in the world stage. I appreciated the different perspectives, free from the bias that so often infiltrates dialogue on foreign nations. "

            "\u00a0Somewhat of a bias from the professor, but great class for any interested in learning more about China's economic state ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You get exposed to a lot, so if you're a student who knows nothing about China, this is a really great class for you. \r\nWeaknesses: If you are either a really committed Econ or EAS student, this class might be really frustrating at certain points. We kind of circle the drain around a lot of topics (urbanization, innovation, labor-saving growth paradox, social safety net) but then the class doesn't really end with any call to actions. The class is neither really econ intensive or China intensive, which makes sense as it is also crosslisted across so many dept. and schools, but I found that kind of frustrating. I felt like I was ready to go more into China's social and economic structure but we kind of sat at the top. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Roach reiterates things a lot which really helped and I liked the way he structured how the lecturesfit together. I would have loved more discussions on the readings, though, because I think presenting opinions more in-depth that might complement or contrast Roach's take on things would be enriching. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Roach takes an interesting approach to the development of China and there are definitely a lot of concepts that I learned which I had no knowledge of before. However, he is very China biased and it is obvious in his teachings and lectures. Further, you could probably take just the first half of the course, up to the first midterm (maybe even less), and take away all you would need to know for the final and the class. The biggest takeaway is that China is saving too much, spending too little, and he spends the semester emphasizing that point in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0For the small discussion on the financial system in China, it could help to have a bit more conceptual explanations for those who do not have a finance background. This was only the last half of the last lecture, so not hugely consequential to overall understanding in the course, but still could be helpful. \r\n\r\nBesides the incredibly relevant content matter and superb organization of this course, The Next China's biggest strength was in how it emphasized main themes and used those as a routine framework for learning. ",
            "\u00a0Roach knows more about the subject than probably anyone. The material is sometimes presented a little dryly, though. There were way too many readings - no way you could read them all. Section was miserable and not helpful for understanding the material better.  Roach has the sections set up so that half the time is presentations on material somewhat relevant to the week's topic but not directly. I would rather have more time to go over the actual material we learned so we could understand it better. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength is Professor Roach's streamlined thesis on why China is the way it is. He hits the points he has determined to be most key over his career quickly builds out his theoretical framework to the class. Since he has it down to a science, this leaves time to talk about modern developments and this semester focused a lot on the contentious US-China trade war. \r\n\r\nA weakness is that it assumes a lot of prior knowledge, in both economics and China, and students with a background in both understand what Professor Roach is saying right away while other students may be struggling to follow. There could be some more primer materials at the beginning of the course, in order to get some students more up to speed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the lecture slides were posted after each class and provided a comprehensive and effective way to study for tests. While there was a lot of material to cover, it was all very interesting and relevant for today's political climate. Weaknesses were that lectures could at times feel a bit repetitive and Professor Roach did not do an amazing job at explaining all of the topics in detail. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that the lecture slides are very comprehensive and well made and you needn't go to lecture. The sections cover a lot of material and the teaching fellows are great and are always present to answer questions and provide feedback. Lecture can be very dry and boring. A lot of Chinese students take this class and they obviously knew most of the material before taking this class and contributed the most during section. The class is not curved though, so that does not matter as much. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was great, it incorporated a lot of current events as well as historical references. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Lecturers just get very dry and repetitive. More engagement and more changes to the class are warranted. Reading over all the slides at the end is really interesting. Readings are good as well. I think Roach could do better by moving through some topics faster, combining lectures, and please introducing more subjects. ",
            "\u00a0This class is very interesting and the lecture meetings are very brief, which is a relief. Section meetings are useful and not that time consuming either. Readings are interesting but not totally needed for every class, although doing them adds substaintially to ones understanding of the material. Some problems with the class include a fairly heavy pro-China bias. Roach will occasionally present data that distorts the actual facts of the situation, so take his lectures with a grain of salt. ",
            "\u00a0It gave really great tour of some overarching topics and painted a very accurate picture of China's current and future economic prospects. Really enjoyed how Roach tied in current trade war events with the class! ",
            "\u00a0Could be a more holistic perspective, not just pro-China ",
            "\u00a0Roach is so knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and relevant, however there were a lot of reading some ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting, although at times it got repetitive in lecture. The guest speakers were also interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Roach knows a lot but lecture can feel repetititive ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized and setup to give students the chance to interact as deeply with the material as they wish to. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-structured. ",
            "\u00a0Gets a bit repetitive over time, far too many readings to realistically read ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent analysis of China's strengths and the changes it must make.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough emphasis on the severity of China's struggles/the changes it needs to make (slightly pro-China) ",
            "\u00a0Halfway through the semester, it did get very repetitive. And although I can see why sections are important for a large lecture class like this, I didn't find that section was all that useful, because there weren't any additional insights I got from section that I didn't get from class.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the readings were too dense, and most people couldn't finish reading all of it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Roach's lectures are very fun and engaging yet very thorough. I was very impressed with the quality of section discussions as well. I wouldn't change anything. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved with a wider view of the political environment in China, especially as it changes so rapidly. There is great attention constantly payed to the economic actions, but those are often analyzed without appreciating the greater general political context. "

            "\u00a0Yes!! Great elective for an econ major ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but you have to be prepared for what you get. If you're new to China, take it. If you're an Econ/EAS double major, take it because it'll help you get classes out of the way and you'll probably learn SOMETHING. But if you're already really well versed in China, just know that you'll probably get kind of bored in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yesif you have an interest in China, trade, international economics, etc. It's important stuff to know and will continue to be important for quite a while. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, but if you're looking for a deep economic dive into China this is not it. For an econ course, this class was more so like a poli sci lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are even  remotely interested in China and not an economics major, I would recommend taking this course. China comes up in the news all the time yet it still treated as kind of an exotic place, and this gave me much better understanding of the future direction of the country and made it feel less foreign. Now when I hear news updates about China, I actually understand what's going on. The course may start a bit slowly and a bit dry, but that's just so you can gain context for the rest of the course. Soon enough you will dive into present-day issues such as e-commerce and Fintech and technological innovation that are incredibly relevant and interesting. Don't let the amount of reading deter you from taking this course- Professor Roach will emphasize the main points enough in class that it will become digestible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're looking to have a better understanding of China and/or a chill econ credit. There's not much week to week work besides readings, which a lot of people don't do or you can do the ones you find interesting. Midterm + final was pretty chill, just go over lecture slides and know the big themes + supporting details. The paper was kind of a pain (15 pages). ",
            "\u00a0Pretty hard Econ credit. Would advise again if you have an otherwise heavy course-load for the semester. It's definitely interesting and you will learn something but it's definitely not super exciting. Still, definitely more useful than a lot of other classes. There were way too many readings - no way you could read them all. You don't need to, but it gets awkward in section. ",
            "\u00a0It's pretty good in that it's a straightforward class where you'll learn plenty about China, its history, its economy, politics, society, and its future trajectory. For my part, though, I didn't find myself walking away with the human engagement--discussion, passion, quirk--that makes a Yale class truly special. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but they should have some existing interest in China and its economy already. There is no need to be an expert going in, and discussion about China and understanding how much it has changed since we were born is something extremely interesting and everyone could benefit from having more of. Professor Roach has spent a career observing and analyzing this, with great access into many of China's top leadership, and it is a great way for China novices to experts alike to hear his take on the situation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it!!!  The class is really not much work and is incredibly satisfying in the better understanding you will have of our world today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have never taken a macro econ class before, and I really loved this one. Highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would take this class if you want to learn more about the complicated relationship between the United States and China or if you have an interest in modern Chinese political history. The class was very interesting and made use of a number of different graphs, charts, and other visuals that made it easy to follow along. Professor Roach is an expert in the field and it is clear that he knows what he is talking about. All around solid class - 15 page paper was a lot but shouldn't be too much work if you can start it ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning about China or who might want to work in China after graduation. China is an up and coming economy, so for anyone interested in global economics really, this class is a must take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Definitely. Professor Roach is an amazing teacher with extensive background in the great Asian Area. The topic is also extremely relevant to the current tensions between China and the US. ",
            "\u00a0YES!! Papa Roach is the BEST! Super smart, affable, and really amazing dude. One of best professors I have had at Yale. Beyond that his experience working in finance and economic analysis in Asia, and specifically China, make him a leader in the field. Super nice guy, and really a great professor and mentor to have. If you want to learn about Chinese economics, he is the guy ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this class. The material isnt that difficult despite the heavy reading load, and Roach is a good, concise lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! Especially if you're an econ major who's interested in how China will play a part in America's growth. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it is a topical course ",
            "\u00a0No because a large portion of the class depends on your previous knowledge of China. Without this base, discussions in section become confusing and it is easy to fall behind. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course presents an amazing opportunity to learn from one of the leading experts about a very relevant topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Especially Econ majors looking for a n elective that is useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting and very relevant, everyone should know whats going on with China ",
            "\u00a0The material is pretty interesting, although lecture can get repetitive at times. The midterm and final are fair, and the paper was pretty fun to write. You don't really need a strong econ background to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you have any interest in Chinas economy. Its really interesting and a p gutty Econ elective. Only grades are the midterm, paper, final, and section. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - crucial topic with wide-ranging implications. Roach is an expert. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very good course ",
            "\u00a0Yes - China is the next frontier, it is important to develop a deep understanding of it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes; you get a very good understanding of US-China relations and how China has become the superpower it is today. It's a very topical subject, and Professor Roach does a great job summarizing the findings and keeping the topics up to date. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, particularly to other economics majors interested in getting a better grasp on current macroeconomic issues. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a fascinating topic, and with the growing exposure of the souring of political relations with China, the economic ramifications of opposition only grow more important. "
