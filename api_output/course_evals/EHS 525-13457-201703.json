            "\u00a0I think that the course is fine, but I think that we should receive course credit for it.  The course took a lot of time for zero credits.  I also found most of the lectures to be outside my area of interest.  Rather than take this course, I would prefer to read articles and attend lectures about topics that are closer to my research. ",

Also, the students were asked to give a lecture on a specific subject, which was a good chance for students to dive into a specific case, also, this format effectively trained the ability of presentation. \r\nWeakness:\r\nWhen a student gave a lecture, the participation of other students were reduced, since for the topic the presenter give, needless to say he or she understood it very well since she or he had made some preparations on that, however, the topic or the knowledge for other students is a little bit ambiguous and hard to understand.

I wish instead of hold biweekly journal clubs, we could have more speakers to come and talk about what they are passionate about, and what is the outlook on many domains of EHS. ",
