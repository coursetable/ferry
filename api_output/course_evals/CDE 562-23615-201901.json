            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Breadth of material covered \r\n- Engaging and diverse homework assignments \r\n- Discussion sections were conducive to understanding the material at a deeper level \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Would be helpful to reflect on our own dietary assignment ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The structure of the course was really great and interactive: such as having lecture and then having a smaller discussion. The topics are also very relevant and up to date with ongoing news. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great intro class to nutrition and chronic diseases that covers topics from nutrition Epi to policy. The weekly discussion sessions truly reflect the class material introduced in lectures and provide student opportunities to express their thoughts and insights. The interactive class activities bring in many new aspects and facts related to the food industries and other areas. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- course was very organized and stuck to the plan on the syllabus. The assignments were useful to my learning, not at all a form of busy work. Course topics were engaging. I liked the structure of having a 2-hr lecture once a week, followed by a 1-hr discussion. \r\n\r\nSuggestions for improvement- I wish there wasn't such a heavy focus (almost half of the semester) on cancer and nutrition.  I would've preferred to cover more with the chronic diseases that didn't receive as much time in the second half of the semester. \r\nI also would have liked to have had some synthesis at the end of the semester over what constitutes a \"healthy\" diet, beyond just what current nutrition policy is.  I also think it would have been interesting to investigate the underpinnings of popular diet fads at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great overview of the big issues and topics in nutrition as it relates to chronic disease. I left the class feeling like I understood the major NCDs better as well as the nutrition related causes and potential options for improving outcomes. ",
            "\u00a0I think what this course lacked was the capability of making students think critically. I think there is value in learning the history and current environment of Nutrition Epidemiology. However, as part of a public health school, I think more practical assignments that would force students to think critically and apply knowledge of regulation and the current disease climate to make theoretical policy. The exam questions were very much recitation of memorized facts, which was somewhat disappointing, considering there isn't much that can be gotten out of that besides facts. Guest lecturers were interesting and provided good insight into specific applications of Nutrition and disease. I think more can be done to get students to truly apply themselves in the course and to think critically (maybe designing an epidemiological study would be an exciting exercise to take on. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic course that covered a wide range of topics under the umbrella of nutrition and chronic disease. ",
            "\u00a0The material is somewhat interesting but lectures are dry. Leah tends to read right off the sides which makes wanting to be in lecture difficult when I could just go over the slides on my own time. Other than that she is very nice and the grading was fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - comprehensive and cohesive course content and structure \r\nWeaknesses - too many different chronic diseases covered. would be more useful to focus on less in more detail ",
            "\u00a0This course presents a plethora of published research with lackluster study designs and insignificant findings. This course has the opportunity to revolutionize the minds of public health students, but its busy-work erected syllabus does not reflect that. "

            "\u00a0Leah is great! She is so knowledgeable and well-prepared for each class. She encourages class discussions. And she is always open to students questions and feedbacks! She provides study guide and sample questions for the exams so we can really learn something and do well in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Leah is an excellent professor. She was receptive to questions and available to her students.  \r\nShe is skilled at presenting research in narrative form. This was much more engaging than solely focusing on the nitty-gritty details of one study after another. I liked how she made the course topics relevant to our everyday choices around food and to current nutrition policy. \r\nI appreciated the way Leah prepared us for exams, providing students with topics on which to focus their studying and running through a mini review with students in class. \r\nShe created a welcoming classroom atmosphere. ",
            "\u00a0Leah was a great professor. Her lectures were well constructed to provide a strong foundation in a topic as well as more detailed examples of concepts to enhance our understanding. She was always available to students for extra help and clarification of course materials. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Ferrucci was a nice instructor, being very considerate to students and showing concern for student's understanding of the course material. I think the only improvements to her instruction could be to increase the challenge of the class. Also, examinations into the current and future applications of Nutrition Epidemiology would be an interesting lecture to give students ideas about what is being done or what is the future of the field.

            "\u00a0If you're interested in how nutrition affects chronic disease and the current state of nutrition recommendations, I would definitely recommend taking it! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to students who are interested in nutrition and health in general. This class provides so many facts as well as common misconceptions about foods, dietary supplements, and food labeling. After taking this class, I am more aware of my nutrition status and eating a healthier diet now.  And a fun fact is that I started to read the nutritional facts labels when I go to the grocery stores now. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting topics. Expectations are straightforward. \r\nThere are six assignments, and a final/midterm. \r\nThe tests cover a lot of information but are fair. \r\nLeah is a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student if they were interested in nutrition and health. The class is a good course in demonstrating healthful nutrition principles on a base level. On the whole however, I would say this class came out more like a nutrition class than a nutrition epidemiology class. I wish more public policy application would be integrated into the course ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to a fellow student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this class. The content is important and the course leaves you with an understanding of the role of nutrition in many chronic diseases as well as ways in which efforts to reduce the harmful effects of malnutrition are currently being implemented. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. This course has the opportunity to disseminate knowledge about the needs of communities made vulnerable. Students should be equipped with information about communicating healthy and cost effective meals to populations with little resourced systems working against them. The basis of nutrition-related chronic diseases is foundational, however, this course makes no attempt to elevate beyond this rudimentary pedagogy. "
