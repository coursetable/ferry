            "\u00a0I learned how to really have discussions about topics I might not have agreed with. I also learned about movements I would not have thought existed before. ",

            "\u00a0Somatic education is relevant to healing processes and should be incorporated in therapeutic methods as much as possible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned somatic education and movement of the body through motion. ",
            "\u00a0How to teach and learn material in an incredibly engaging and interactive manner ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning more about the human skeletal system, I also learned a lot about the field of somatic education- a field I'd never been exposed to before. Through this, we learned about new methods of injury prevention and new ways of thinking about the human body. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about my own bodily awareness and about somatic educations regarding its founders and principles. ",

            "\u00a0The course doesn't really have a focus. This results in very vague ideas for papers and discussion questions that were only topically used. However, the professor is really nice, and you really bond with the other people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: student-directed, independent learning in a cool subject. \r\nWeaknesses: too much weight on the quizzes and projects/essays have little to do with in-class content. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very free flowing. The learning was not rigid which was one of its best features. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the engagement of the class in the dance studio which allowed for movement.  I wish we spent more time reviewing the parts of the body in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength- Very knowledgeable, easily accessible, and kind professor. Very hands-on class, each day is different and fun.\r\n\r\nWeakness- Schedule changed a lot from the original syllabus ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that it is always interactive. There's never a dull moment, and being a small class you get to form relationships with your classmates. ",

            "\u00a0Yes I would. This class is great to take as an incoming first year. It gives you experience with reading responses as well as getting to learn fun material in an interactive environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was something different than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely professor is great ",
