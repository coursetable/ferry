            "\u00a0Knowledge about market-based solutions to environmental problems, application of such theories in past, present and future environmental issues. The course was thought-provoking and challenged me to question my own biases and worldview. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my researching skills, as well as my reading comprehension on academic papers and how to write a paper myself. In addition, thanks to the class I was able to dig deeper into all the literature that is available on non-state market-driven systems that exists related to the Green Building industry. ",
            "\u00a0How to critically assess private sector efforts to address environmental and social issues; how to read, analyze, and comment on political science articles related to corporate social responsibility, and the importance of remaining problem-focused in assessing the impact of CSR/private sector interventions in the provision of public goods like environmental health. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The theories and knowledge used were well-aligned with research-based projects, but I would have liked to see more interrogation of theory when applied to real-world organizations and issues. ",
            "\u00a0it aligned in a 100%. I am sincerely very thankful that I took this class, as it was the most related subject to the topics that I came to learn at FES. ",
            "\u00a0This class was different than I expected; it was a bit less structured than I anticipated, with discussions sometimes veering off track and the class agenda very loosely defined (if at all) ahead of time. It was also more rigorous intellectually, and prompted deeper engagement than I'd experienced in other classes. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The organic nature of our conversations was incredible once we got going. The conversations where we had the critiques of the other students' reading responses were less productive but did make sure that we all got an opportunity to voice our thoughts. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Engaging class discussions, due to Professor Cashore and my peers\r\n- Very interesting and insightful readings\r\n- The theories covered will be useful in my research going forward \r\n- Professor Cashore's office hours were useful \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some of the readings per session were too much because irrelevant readings were assigned, which ended up not discussed\r\n- Structure of class discussion could be improved, since many theories or viewpoints were sometimes left unaddressed\r\n- The final paper could easily be replaced by a project work since there were few students in the class - the deliverable could have been a policy review, recommendation etc. \r\n- The syllabus could be finalized and readings posted as soon as possible, for personal planning and organization \r\n- Feedback on reading responses could be given back earlier ",
            "\u00a0I think that the biggest strength is Ben, as he is incredibly knowledgeable about the topic that he teaches, and he is always willing to give you advise on your research or provide you with extra material to read. What I would say that could be improved in the class, is that oftentimes we divert from the main topic. Even though this results in very interesting conversations, I think that keeping the focus on the topic of discussion would add more value to the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: important perspective; good readings; thought-provoking class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: disorganized; too many classes had to be rescheduled; readings and assignments were not clearly communicated in advance, and kept changing throughout the semester  would suggest improving the organization of the class and maintaining the structure of the syllabus from beginning to end, rather than making mid-semester adjustments.

            "\u00a0This class is a lot of readings and a large final project. If you don't have a background in political science the first half of the semester can be incredibly challenging to follow. However, it is worth every ounce of energy I put in to it. Cashore is an engaging and enthusiastic professor who has changed the way I look at these types of issues.  The second half were case studies that were geared to what the class was interested in so we had some lively discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This is a theory-heavy class but could be useful for understanding the complex dynamics of market-based solutions to environmental issues, especially if you have prior experience in the practice of environmental problem-solving. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent class. It is a lot of work and readings non-stop, and there are reading responses every week that need you to fully understand the topic of the readings to either write the reviews, or to comment on your colleagues reviews. It also requires a lot a discipline to carry on your independent paper, which is 30 pages long. ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to think deeply about the CSR issues addressed, and would be helpful to have a political science background; also, Professor Cashore is brilliant if a bit scattered, but worth seeking out to discuss class materials and your term paper  he is a great resource and really valuable perspective to have at FES.
