            "\u00a0It is the second-semester junior studio and it depends highly on who you get as a professor. Our designs were focused around food which was cool! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to develop a more productive workflow ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broader understanding of the scales of design, particularly relating to food. ",
            "\u00a0Above all, this studio brought the form-finding methods explored the previous semester to bear on projects which were explicitly social in nature. For the first time, we were made to grapple with the issue of program at a variety of scales, as it relates to cultural history, politics, individual and collective experience, utility, and community. The variety of projects also enabled students to explore a variety of new ways of making and drawing, which will certainly prove priceless in future studio work. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Incredibly dedicated teaching team that was most importantly open to how we wanted to think and find our own methods of architecture making, clear direction and instruction with concrete suggestions for moving forward, incredibly encouraging with students, thoughtfully constructed and thought provoking prompts\r\n\r\nWeakness/Improvements: 1. Workload could be incredibly taxing at times (although this was in part due to rescheduling & snowstorms). But it would be great to find a way in which that could be managed. 2. The jump from room to a whole programmed building was quite big - maybe an intermediate assignment? Or a more defined program for the room? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Learned how to think about architecture and my work in a constructive way, and also learned many \"hard\" skills along the way. The TFs and Surry were a great team, and I felt that I could always get help or feedback when I needed it. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Organization of projects, understanding what good work looks like. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very intensive course. A lot is expected of you in a very short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Small class size and multiple opportunties for detailed feedback \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: weekly deadlines that were only assigned days before assignments were due ",
            "\u00a0The course was really helpful for me in terms of understanding design and my strengths within it, however I think it lacked in the application of design in an architectural setting. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness, in my opinion, was the lack of a precedent study. Designing our first large, institutional building, I think we all struggled to know where to begin when it comes to issues of scale, and how to organize a plan, and learning the tools, tricks, and strategies that past architects have used on similar projects through precedent study may have been incredibly valuable to this end. "

            "\u00a0As usual, studio depends on the critic you get. Surry is amazing - you will learn so much from him and actually have a teaching team that wants to work with you through the things you are interested in, is willing to put in as much time and dedication as you are, and are there as teachers. This is what studio should be like. ",
            "\u00a0Workload is a lot. Do not take it unless you can handle it and unless you are in the design track of Architecture. ",

            "\u00a0Most definitely would recommend. By far the best studio we've had and Surry is great. Jack and Amanda, our TAs, were also amazing and super helpful, nice people. Great course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student under the understanding that it was slightly less architectural than expected, but otherwise was a really interesting class. "
