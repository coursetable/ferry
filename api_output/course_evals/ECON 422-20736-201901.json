            "\u00a0The course becomes quite boring after the first few weeks. The main focus of the course is neuroscience, not economics. I found it really hard to even see the relationship between what was taught in the classroom and economics. Students' main focus throughout the semester is their research proposal and the lectures are completely unrelated to this, so after a while they become pretty boring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: chill workload, if you get your work done you'll be fine in this class, Prof Levy obviously knows a lot about this field, the material is also just inherently interesting\r\n\r\nWorkload: can be a little hard to engage in the class sometimes, not sure if just because my class was filled with spring semester seniors trying to get their 400 level credit ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the course!! Halfway through, they made the psets less technical and more comprehensive, which was really the right choice for a course like this (only a few people know anything about neuroscience). I would say maybe assigning small groups to present on the papers we read each week, instead of discussing in a giant group, would perhaps be best; I know the course was larger than expected, but that would be my suggestion for the future to let everyone engage. ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of potential, however, since it is listed as an economics class, there is too much science. If this course was able to relate more to economics, it would be more engaging for the students taking the course ",

            "\u00a0You will learn how to write effective research papers and also how to read them. You will also become a lote more familiar with how research is done (techniques, methods etc.), which is great. I think the lectures could have been a little more engaging, but I was overall very interested in the course. I also got a lot of feedback on how to improve, which was great. ",

The readings were a bit hard to understand sometimes but that comes with the territory. Thought it probably would've benefitted from a no-laptop policy, seemed like most everybody was just on their ;aptops constantly, not paying attention at all. ",
            "\u00a0This course features really interesting lectures and a very creative final assignment.  The only weakness of this course might be that some of the problem sets (based on often opaque neuroscientific papers) are pretty challenging. "

            "\u00a0YES! Take this course! Best econ seminar ever! However, you should be interested in behavioral econ or neuroscience, or else you might find it boring. It's a really reasonable workload - readings, about one pset every week and a half, and three paper proposals with a presentation - but reading the papers takes a couple hours if you don't know anything about neuroscience. Dr. Levy is also amazing! She really cares about everyone, and is probably the only Econ professor I've ever had that actually listened to our midterm feedback and improved the course (the psets were wayyy too technical for people with no science background, but she adjusted them accordingly so that if you took time on them, you could do really well). Overall, really amazing course! If you're at all interested in neuroscience, even if you have no prior experience, you should take it! ",

It is really interesting and very different from most classes in the Econ Major. Professor Levy is great. She cares a lot about the material and is super approachable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. As a cognitive science major, I thought the course gave me great insights on how to conduct research and how both economics and neuroscience come together. You may sometimes get lost during lectures, but if you pay enough attention all the material is manageable. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you're really interested in neuroscience. ",

            "\u00a0yes! ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Very fascinating class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Professor Levy is so knowledgeable and a very effective lecturer, and she is incredibly patient as well. One of my favorite classes at Yale, hands down! ",

            "\u00a0No, this class was hard to sit through. I never felt like I left the class having learned anything interesting or useful. ",
            "\u00a0Great senior lecture. It's light on work, but the material is challenging enough to keep you interested. You get a good understanding of how the brain works (at least when it concerns decision making). The final paper is very interesting to write. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend. Super interesting stuff about valuation and choice, as well as neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0I would.  It's much more of a neuroscience class than an economics one, but it is a great way to gain exposure to a field that will dramatically impact the work of economists going forward. "
