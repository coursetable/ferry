It needs to be a much longer course in order to really gain a firm understanding of how the law effects public health decisions, however, given how wonderful of a professor Shelley is, she still makes it very worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my favorite that I took this semester. As someone without any kind of background in law or policy, this was a great introduction to thinking about legal determinants of health and the legal tools that can be used to address health problems. The course also provided a great opportunity to learn about the legal approach and way of thinking about what is possible within the existing framework of the law, and how that framework could be altered. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the topics and case studies, and learned so much every week. This is fantastic course that I think is important for public health professionals, but I also think it has better prepared me to be a thoughtful and informed citizen. Be prepared to put in the time working through the lengthy reading lists each week, but if you are willing to do that what you get out is well worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: instructor, the information that we gain, the activities and the final project\r\nweakness: easy to not cover enough during class time because there is so much content which can make truly digesting and learning the content challenging ",
            "\u00a0This was an incredible course. It was very technical and at times it felt rushed, but that is only because Prof Geballe wanted to give us everything she could. I really learned a lot that I believe will be helpful in informing my future public health work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course and feel that it was a valuable addition to my time at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class at YSPH. It relates to public health obviously, but allows you to take a realistic view of what is going on in the world, and the country, and how what we are doing at YSPH can help fix some of the problems. I loved the class discussions, and learning through Shelley and everyone's experiences. There are a ton of readings, and if you don't really pay attention and get a good grasp on the law stuff early on, it is a bit hard to follow all class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the professor is amazing, and it was the most truly \"policy\" class at YSPH that I have taken. It exposes you to a the legal language and key legal topics in health. \r\nThe weakness is that there are far too many readings for it to be manageable on a consistent basis. ",
            "\u00a0Public Health Law was my favorite course at the YSPH. I also learned a tremendous amount from this class, which I cannot say the same for most other classes I took at the YSPH. Although the weekly readings took me 15-20 hours to complete, I learned so much from them. I appreciated how the professor indicated which of the readings were required and which were optional. The classroom debates and role plays were also very thought-provoking. However, the class size was way too big, and the administration should be ashamed of not providing us the education that we deserve and are paying thousands of dollars for. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course, but definitely had a lot of reading. More contact hours might be needed because sometimes not all of the material was covered in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is an AMAZING course and Shelley is by far one of the greatest professors at YSPH. My only critique is that there is just too much reading. While the course is outlined to cover a wide range of topics, there is just too much reading, making it hard to fully absorb everything. If there was a way to maintain the scope of the course but assign the readings more efficiently, I think I would have gotten a lot more out of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Challenges you to think about public health from a new perspective, there's room with the final project to think about how you would leverage the law for a subject/cause that you're passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Students learn a lot in a short amount of time, engaging discussions and topics, extremely knowledgable professor\r\nWeaknesses: Biased towards one train of thought which made it difficult for those who did not have those opinions to speak up in class, a little too much reading to the point where students couldn't really even complete 1/3 of it\r\nImprovements: Have reading reflections solely sent to the professor and TF and not to everyone in the class (This way, students can be more open about their opinions.), make conversations a little more open to other opinions ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is an INCREDIBLE professor. She is so knowledgeable (not to mention such a badass lawyer with incredible litigating experience) and clearly loves to teach. This is a mammoth course that she pours her heart into teaching...the result (which she fully acknowledges) is a LOT of reading and work. But it's worth it. Totally worth it. A superb primer into public health law, expertly taught for a non-law student audience. ",
            "\u00a0Sooooo many readings but do it for Shelley!! ",
            "\u00a0This class was the hardest and the most rewarding I have ever taken. It truly changed the way I look at things, made me think harder and work harder than I have before, but truly made me want to deliver the absolute best work possible. It is a LOT of material, and the workload is high, but it's fascinating and applicable. I know that there has been some controversy about capping, but really it's essential that this class be small, as it's highly interactive and has a lot of written work and presentation. This class does an amazing job covering the basics of law for people who have no law background, applying it right away to public health, and covering a massive amount of subjects, all very relevant and interesting for public health students, regardless of if you're planning on going into law. I feel truly lucky to have taken this class with Shelley and Chris. ",
            "\u00a0It was a cool class! I wish that it was a year-long course so I could better understand the different concepts and tools. Sometimes the information felt overwhelming and I am not sure that I grasped everything to the best of my ability. ",
            "\u00a0A really great course for an introduction into law and how law can be used in public health. Not enough time to go over everything in class each week, so lengthening class to 3 hours instead of 2 or adding a discussion section would be useful. So much to learn and not enough time! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: instructor and TA were both really great in class, classes were informative and PPT slides were wonderful, enjoyable readings, group/class activities were fun and engaging. Weakness: too little time to cover all the material, wish we had more class time, a smaller class might be better for discussions ",
            "\u00a0While a lot of work, the course made us all think about public health in a new way. It was fascinating and disappointing at times to see where we are now and what has happened in the past legally. However, most of all, I think we can all say that this is one of the only courses at YSPH that teaches us ways in which we can all affect change in public health. How do we translate academia to practice? This course certainly helps build that foundation especially for those who want to go into public service, advocacy, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! Our readings and the lectures were interesting every week. I also enjoyed how topical the class was. We were always discussing the laws we learned about in the context of recent and pending cases, which made the class even more engaging. The lectures at the beginning of each class giving us a rundown of the important topics covered that week were helpful. The reading reflections were helpful in directing our focus given that the reading load was considerable. I appreciate that Professor Geballe gave us questions to think about as we completed the readings each week. I also think the group and individual discussions helped reinforce the concepts we were learning about.  My two suggestion for improvement is that I wish we had more discussion time, and I wish we got a mid-semester evaluation with our grade up to that point to see how we were doing in the class. ",
            "\u00a0AP-\r\nProbably the most I've learned in a single course in all of my 4-years in graduate school; I began with a poor understanding of US gov and non-existent understanding of law but left feeling capable of conversing in basic \"lawyer speak\". I developed a true appreciation for how law has shaped and continues to shape public health. Shelley carefully structures the course to touch on a broad variety of topics in PH Law. She is such an incredibly invested and incredibly responsive professor.\r\nI will be honest in stating that I probably did spend more hours on this course than 3-4 other fall courses combined and that the immensely rewarding understanding of law was likely a result of such hard work; Shelley's hard work throughout the course inspired me. Through the first 6 sessions of the course, I did find myself discouraged at missing the larger narrative during many lectures despite completing readings; but as the course progressed, the course was structured to foster both \"big picture\" and the minutia. Class debates were a great resource for furthering understanding.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Shelley is one of the most brilliant, caring professors I've had-- an incredible resource. I would highly recommend this course to all MPH students (AP included) who have an interested in understanding law and is capable of spending some more time in this course than the others. A HUGE help during the second half of the semester was when 3-4 of my colleagues split some of the readings, each completing brief abstract-style summaries such that the weekly 200+pgs of assigned reading could be better distilled for reference.\r\n\r\nAnother tip for students: coming up with a toolbox project earlier in the semester will be FAR easier, as it would give a more practical lens to learn how legal tools can be applied. ",
            "\u00a0Pros: Unique skill set in understanding legalese, amazing course if you want an introduction to law\r\n\r\nCons: Overwhelmed with the amount of material given on a weekly basis ",
            "\u00a0This was one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. It gave me a new lens from which to view my work, put all of my public health work into a broader legal context, challenged me to think critically, and gave me many new tools to address public health problems. I would recommend this course and instructor to anyone at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! Would love it if a rough draft of toolbox were due earlier, but other than that no suggestions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nGreat overview of how law and public health intersect in a variety of ways (i.e. through the three branches of government and different types of law)\r\nToolbox project allowed for a great critical assessment of how the law works pertaining to public health\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe class goes over very complex topics in law quite quickly ",
            "\u00a0The course had so much richness and depth, it would be better suited across two semesters.  Given the sheer amount of reading and some of the work needed for class assignments during the semester, it would be helpful to assign summer pre-reading. I think the New Public Health Law chapters are accessible and could serve this purpose. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The group discussions were great. The reenactment of the Flint water crisis proceedings was an awesome way to bring the law to life. \r\n-- The PowerPoints were thorough and in general the curriculum was well-thought-out. The guest speaker was great, and the student presentations were interesting to learn from. \r\n-- The content of the course was relevant, and we talked about current as well as historical events. \r\n-- I gained a new appreciation for the effects of law on our everyday lives from this class.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- While the Law School has large amounts of reading as the norm, I found that in this class I skimmed everything and retained little. Readings should be no more and no less than needed to understand some central concepts. Hard choices should be made by the professor, TA, students, and/or random lottery to arrive at between 2 and 4 mandatory articles a week, with optional additional readings. This is the right amount to inform a vigorous classroom discussion and solidify a memory in a students mind. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there were a \"lab\" for this class, which allowed us students to talk with Shelley about current events and health law in general. Otherwise, I think the class is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was really great. I learned so much and cant even begin to comprehend all of the knowledge and skills gained. The course content and instructor have a very difficult job of going through a lot a lot of material in a short amount of time. The weekly reflections and assignments really helped me to think critically.  I see issues in public health in a new light after taking this course. \r\n\r\nMay have been helpful for at least some components of the toolbox project to be due earlier in the semester. Like a prospectus or the introduction. ",

            "\u00a0Shelley is one of the best professors I have ever had. She maintains her knowledge on the law, keeps up to date with anything related to public health law and makes sure to share that with her students. She encourages everyone to not be intimidated by the material but rather ask questions and engage. She is a wonderful resource and mentor. Nothing to improve. ",
            "\u00a0Shelley is a fantastic instructor. Her knowledge is seemingly limitless and she brings so much passion to the course that she shares with students. She provided great insights and examples from her own career in law as well as current events. She truly cares about all of her students and works so hard to make the class valuable and enjoyable for everyone. She is one of the best professors I have ever had. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent, and impressive knowledge base, \r\n\r\nweakness: would have appreciated learning law and some of these topics on more middle of the road perspective. Some topics were heavily left leaning including opinions that were encouraged and taught in class but I felt that sometimes the bigger picture was missed. Conservatives or all republicans in general are not the enemy and sometimes Yale can feel like a bubble which is an issue especially if we consider how Trump got elected and that in the end the majority of the country does not hold these liberal views which is why I believe it is important to be taught a balance and an awareness of the country as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot sing Prof. Geballe's praises enough. Not only is she incredibly smart, well-versed in the material, and organized, but she genuinely cared for each and every one of her students on a personal level and our growth and learning in the course. ",

She will email you articles that she thinks relates to your topic areas in her free time, and is always available to discuss questions or concerns. For someone that was not law-knowledgeable at all before this class, I learned a lot. However, it did take me a few weeks in order to understand the concepts and connections. The only thing I may suggest is the bring a public health lens a bit earlier, to understand where the law can go and how. ",

I couldn't believe how quickly she provided feedback on everything from assignments to reports in the news to questions that came up that day in class. She must put in 40 hours of extra time a week at home just on this course. ",

I worked harder for this class than I probably ever have ever because I wanted to give her nothing but quality, thorough work (also because it was fascinating, of course). She asked us to think hard, but was with us every step of the way. She read through every single write up we sent, and gave timely and enthusiastic feedback. She's very accessible when you need help or advice, despite being and extremely busy woman. You can tell she values her students and truly wants them to leave the class with more knowledge and skills. I think it will be extremely hard to find another professor that can fill her shoes! ",

She met with each of us to talk to us about our final project and about our general career interest. She takes time to get to know her students and to help us in any way she can. The fact that she had an end of the semester dinner and got each one of us a book we liked meant a lot. In addition to being a great lecturer, she is always open to help us with any questions we had. She was also understanding when extenuating circumstances arise, which I appreciated a lot. I have no suggestions for improvement. ",

Discussed a wide array of topics in law, usually beginning class with an overview of the current legal climate. Truly appreciated the lack of cold-calling throughout the course (of which I was terrified!) but would appreciate if there were a way to incorporate more student engagement during the earlier portion of the course.\r\nDuring a few of the weeks (particularly earlier in the semester), the readings become somewhat burdensome and overwhelming, given that I often felt lost while going through them. Shelley's handouts/summaries are immensely helpful, and as someone who had a hard time distilling the variety of concepts in the copious readings, it would be even more helpful to have had these summaries earlier during the week.

Often these are the most memorable moments of lectures in students minds years later. Memory tends to stick to the most emotionally salient, narrative-based moments in lectures, like when the professor advised the Yale students who were quarantined, or worked on a free speech case, or stood up for all that was good and right in the world, etc.\r\n-- The professor encouraged student participation, and made topics relevant. She spoke about her own areas of expertise, and also spoke eloquently and enthusiastically about a range of important topics.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- The professor is so enthusiastic about the material, and so accustomed to synthesizing large amounts of law literature, that she forgets that students are often starting from nothing when it comes to law  sometimes simplifying and picking a few crucial concepts to focus on, rather than trying to cover too much at a time, is more effective for students learning.

            "\u00a0This class provides an overview of the areas of law and their influence on public health. This includes the courts, legislature, and executive/agencies. In addition we covered how first amendment protections relate to free speech and the information environment, as well as case studies in public health. I highly highly recommend this course to anyone looking to understand this important determinant of public health, as well as to become a more informed citizen. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. I would want them to be aware of the workload, but it can be manageable at different levels of commitment. Ultimately, you get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to a fellow student. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you are able to! I know the pre-requisites may change, but try to take this course! It gives you a completely different perspective than the other classes at YSPH, and can help you to not only find your passion, but learn the possibilities for change using the law. ",
            "\u00a0If you are willing to put in the appropriate effort to really understand public health law and engage with big issues, this is a great course that exposes you to a new world of health policy. ",
            "\u00a0Highly, highly recommend! But be prepared for LOTS of readings and classroom activities. Also, fight the administration to make this class smaller. ",
            "\u00a0Split the readings up with a few of your classmates to make it more manageable! It really is a great course, even if you don't have a law background. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, but I would say be careful to not take on other highly demanding courses. Leave yourself time to fully throw yourself into this course material ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Because of the course material and the way this class was structured, this has been my favorite course at YSPH. It challenged me to work extremely hard, speak up in class, and question my previous ways of thinking. The law is a very powerful tool in making public health changes, and I would recommend this course to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of work/readings. Only take this course if the rest of your courseload is light. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of work but so so so worth it. Taking this class from Professor Geballe is NOT an opportunity to miss. ",
            "\u00a0Great and interesting material, just a lot of work so be prepared ",
            "\u00a0If you have a chance to take this class, DO NOT pass it up. I had zero law background and still got so much out of the class- it's completely designed for people with zero legal experience. It's hard work, and a large time commitment, no question. There is a lot of reading with weekly reflections, and the final project can be a real undertaking. I would recommend starting to collect notes and things on the final WAY earlier than you think you need to. The work is completely worth it, the material is fascinating and very relevant to public health of all kinds, and Shelley is such an incredible instructor  - there is so much to be gained from this class. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! It will definitely be challenging but overall it is a great critical thinking course. ",
            "\u00a0This is probably the most work you'll do for a class at YSPH, but it is so worthwhile if you're hoping to learn how the law shapes health in different public health areas. If you put the effort in, you'll learn more than any other class at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0It's a difficult course with a lot of readings, but worth it because you gain a lot of useful knowledge and a solid foundation about public health law. Would recommend to everyone who is interested in this topic. The instructor and TA are also wonderful and very helpful for any questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches students how to translate what they know of public health issues to how it plays how in the law and how to use the law to affect change. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to all public health students. Every public health students should have at least an introductory understanding of the legal systems that undergird the state of public health work in the United States, and this course teaches this. I would recommend this course to students who have an introductory knowledge of public health law or to those who plan to go to law school as well as to those who have little to no experience in this field.  Both groups of students will gain general legal skills and knowledge from this course, and they will also gain knowledge specifically in public health law. ",
            "\u00a0AP-\r\n\r\nIncredible overview of law, although at the expense of many many long hours. However, Shelley's incredible investment into our class (her largest yet ~40students) inspired many to continue to work harder. Earlier on during the semester, I did occasionally regret enrolling in such a time-intensive course, but as the course progressed, I had no regrets at all. For future students, I would highly recommend [1] early selection of toolbox project (a lens through which law can be more concretely explored) and [2] dividing some of the readings amongst classmates willing to compose brief reference summaries. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of the most important I have taken, as well as one of the most challenging. I would recommend it to every public health student, and would tell them to make extra time for it because it will be one of the most useful they will find at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of public health law. ",
            "\u00a0Public health law is a sampler course that allows public health students to become familiar with the US legal system.  It also provides a foundation for understanding legal terms and provides us with critical tools to consider for future advocacy. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in understanding how law shapes the realm of public health. This class is very helpful for those who might want to do any kind of policy analysis in future  and really everyone, because every person should have some basic knowledge of the law. Enjoy the in-class discussions, debates, and reenactments. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn so much about the law in a health context and so much beyond that from Shelley. ",
            "\u00a0This  course is a must take for students interested in the intersection of public health and law. Be prepared to work hard and read a lot. Its not an easy course but was extremely rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to a fellow student. The material is great though. "
