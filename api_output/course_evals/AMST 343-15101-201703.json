            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH in this course-- I understand the racialization of Islam on a much higher level, and I feel much more equipped to combat anti-Muslim rhetoric. The readings we had were fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to articulate arguments about latent and manifest Islamophobia. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to apply the concept of racialization to a variety of different situations. I also learned a great deal about the history of Muslim American life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to take nothing at face value, to not accept what is conventionally deemed truth as truth, to question the powers that be, to take into account biases before forming conclusions and opinions, and to articulate well formulated grievances on texts that are essentially problematic. Moreover, I learned to do all of these things in the context of the real world and see the great extent to which society and people (from people in positions of power to ironically Muslims themselves) racialize Islam purposely (for economic and political gain) and inadvertently(by speaking within preconceived structures that reassert them). Not only did this course prove that this problem exists, but by the end of the course we were able to discuss possible courses of action to adress/tackle the problem, which of course could be another class in and of itself. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to think critically about Muslims living in the United States, providing contexts on their history, sociological background, and other aspects of Muslim life in the United States. It taught me to think through the lenses of race, sociology, and post colonial theory. It taught me how to write research papers and use primary sources to make an argument. "

            "\u00a0Since it was so small, everyone was very engaged, and we often paired off into groups and did activities, which was great. On some of the weeks with a lot of reading, it may have been helpful to have ideas about what to focus on. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. We read fascinating articles, both theoretical and more applied, and I learned a lot of facts in addition to ways to think. My one suggestion would be to have the professor give slightly longer introductions at the beginning of the course to frame the classroom conversation, and also to make the discussions a little less factual. The class (by its nature) had students at many different levels, so this might be difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course was the Professor. She guided the classroom discussion in a way that ensured we truly understood the readings, the biases of the author, the surrounding discourse in academia, and the relation to our own experiences.Another strength was the 10 minute  presentations we were each assigned to do. These presentations were designed to make sure we covered the breadth of human experience in the course and learned as much from each other as we did from the  readings. I certainly think it accomplished this goal. Many of us unknowingly well exceeded the 10 minutes allotted to us because we were so entrenched in the topic we were presenting on.\r\n\r\nIf there were a weakness, it would be the difficulty of meeting with the professor outside of her office hours. This was to no fault of her own because she traveled to and from campus from Harvard. She also always gave the option of a Skype call and made sure to meet with each of us one on one before the end of the semester.  I just wish I got the opportunity to speak with her more in person throughout the course of the semester because her work is equally interesting and incredible. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very well structured in terms of readings and class discussions. I appreciated the recent publications and themes of the classes. I liked the way the professor presented readings and engaged the class in an in depth analysis of it. \r\n\r\nI thought the midterm was a bit too long for a midterm paper and I personally think group projects tend to be difficult because only one person in the group does alll the work. I also thought some of the group projects took away from a more in depth discussion of readings. "

            "\u00a0YES! Wonderful course, I would even take it again ahah. ",
            "\u00a0I would and have recommended this course to everyone as it was by far my favorite course. I am not sure it will be offered again, but if it ever is, don't hesitate to register for an intellectually challenging but incredibly rewarding semester. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class if you want to learn about Muslims in the United States and more generally about critical race theory and post colonial theory as they relate to minorities in the United States!! Professor is super nice and helpful. "
