            "\u00a0This class was much more interesting and much more engaging than most classes at YSPH.  It covers broad topics related to refugee health and includes real life examples and guest speakers working on the front lines of refugee health.  The readings, lectures, and class conversations were thought-provoking.  The only weakness I would say was it was a little light on the epidemiology part of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Course was fine, but it was a humanitarianism course, not an epidemiology or methods course. I have NO idea why it's coded EMD; its very misleading. It was weird that reading reflections were due on Monday for a class on Thursday, particularly because they didn't get graded until months later. (Speaking of, he had his grad TF grade the reflections which was weird for two reasons: a) she was subjectively grading for friends and peers and b) Kaveh read through them every week, but still make the TF go through and grade them, which she didn't get to until weeks and weeks later). Kaveh didn't really teach the course- he either had guest lectures or had students present the material, which is handy if you don't want to lecture yourself. It often felt disorganized; things were graded late, assignments were unclear or not explained, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Kaveh was a great person and very enthusiastic. However, I didn't like the format of the class with so many student presentations. I didn't learn anything from them, because they just summarized the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great discussions, really interesting guest speakers\r\nWeaknesses: Never really felt like an epi course ",
            "\u00a0This course had a lot of guest speakers that were informative and brought in new and interesting topics. The weekly readings were stimulating and engaging. Overall I thought the course structure matched the material nicely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The guest lecturers, classroom discussion that engages in critical thinking regarding issues that are not exclusive to public health, strong emphasis on ethics, as well as the relaxed classroom environment . \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I am not a fan of the student led presentations on the classroom materials, to me it seems that because the readings are required for the reflections it seems a little redundant and may trigger additional anxiety to students who have to present. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this course. We covered incredibly interesting topics and the format of guest speakers or presentation calls with experts whose readings we read for the week was engaging, riveting and helped us understand the topics a lot better. The student presentations were very helpful--for some weeks it would be helpful to have the instructor cover the topics more as well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We had great in person interviews and international skype interviews!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Feedback on our homework was given very late even though it was worth a large portion of our overall grade. ",

            "\u00a0Kaveh is easily one of the best instructors at YSPH.  He is engaging, thoughtful, and really cares about his students.  He is a great instructor, bringing concepts from the classroom and showing how to apply them to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0Kaveh is a very intelligent, dedicated teacher who is passionate about his subject. He takes the time to listen to students and address their concerns, which I really appreciated. It did sometimes feel like teaching wasn't his top priority - or maybe he just has a very laid back style. He didn't do much lecturing himself, leaving it to guests and students, and the logistics/administration of the class was often disorganized. I know for a fact he demanded too much from his TF, who, by the way, had only audited the class before. ",

The topics that were selected for the course were very interesting and relevant to the course, current geopolitical climate and humanitarian conflicts taking place around the world. He covered crucial skills needed for conducting research with vulnerable groups and the ethical considerations we need to think about each time we approach research in such volatile settings. He provided excellent feedback on the class assignments and the research proposal. I thoroughly enjoyed having Professor Khoshnood as an instructor, and am incredibly grateful for the lessons and skills I learned in this course. ",

This class is engaging, interesting, and useful. It was one of my favorite classes in my two years at YSPH.  I looked forward to going every week. ",
            "\u00a0IMPORTANT: This is NOT an EMD or an epidemiology course. This is a discussion-based humanitarianism class suited for SBS and people who are interested in global health in a very qualitative sense. If that's your jam, you'll probably love it. Relatively high workload, with reading reflections due every week and a massive writing project at the end. Classes were taught either by guest lecturers or by students assigned a topic to present on. There was virtually no mention of methods, epidemiology, certainly not anything related to EMD. If you're looking for an insightful, qualitative, discussion-based small class on global health and humanitarianism, this is for you. If you're looking for something that has to do with epidemiology or anything else quantitative or methods-based, I beg you skip it. ",
            "\u00a0The topics were interesting, but they weren't taught well. I probably wouldn't take this class again. ",

            "\u00a0This course is in essence about how we can conduct viable research in areas where the opportunities for doing so are difficult. There is a strong emphasis on the ethics regarding this type of work and the course itself is very unique to YSPH in that it brings in speakers from many different disciplines including military and business. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class if you want to learn more about the refugee crisis and what type of work is being done to help millions of individuals. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for learning about refugee populations and the repercussions of the displacement of people as the result of violent conflict.  It does require many weekly reading reflections but they help make sure you're prepared for class discussion.  Also, be prepared for investing significant time in the research proposal. ",
