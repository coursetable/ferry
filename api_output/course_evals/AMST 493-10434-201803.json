            "\u00a0This was an ideal introduction to writing a year-long thesis. I learned library skills, argument mapping, and research best practices. I also finished the semester with a little under half of my written thesis complete. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar kept me on track and held me accountable for all my research and writing throughout the semester, which I definitely needed in order to maintain steady progress on my thesis. It was also helpful to have an outlet to talk to other seniors experiencing similar challenges in their work and share writing and research insights. ",
            "\u00a0Worked on my thesis! ",
            "\u00a0This course is very helpful in formulating research questions and developing a research methods. Though everyone in the course is working on totally different projects (which makes it interesting, too), the skills are universally applicable. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the course were its built-in working and writing sessions throughout the semester. These helped me stay on task and actually take a stab at writing my thesis, even when I still had a lot of questions about it. Some weaknesses were the mixing of project-based and writing-based students together. As someone who is writing their thesis, I enjoyed hearing about the cool projects being completed. I am not sure if the project people felt the same. The divide was less stark that I imagined reading reviews, I just think my project friends might be better suited in a separate class. ",
            "\u00a0The writing deadlines were extremely helpful, and the weekly check-ins with the class were an effective way to hold people accountable and encourage a consistent stream of engagement with our projects. ",
            "\u00a0Having a separate course of Special Projects in the Intensive American Studies Major would be the first and only step I can think of for improving the course. Simply put, our (students doing Special Projects) needs and interests are often totally different from our peers doing traditional academic projects. And it's impossible for LiLi to accommodate both. ",
            "\u00a0I think it's strong. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n1) If this seminar were graded, I am sure that my senior essay simply wouldn't get written. It is SO CRUCIAL that we had this first semester to wander and explore and trip over ourselves without any penalties. For example, the first 2-3 page assignment was pivotal. I remember feeling disappointed and disgusted with what I made after I submitted it, and a grade would have only solidified and cemented those feelings. If the paper had been besmirched with a grade, I would have been reluctant to return to it. But leaving it ungraded also left it subject to change --the paper didn't feel frozen at mediocre.\r\n2) I loved the pacing of the class -- and the fact that we could adapt it based on what we needed and couldn't have foreseen (for example, Lili's request for half of our final paper before the end of the semester) \r\n3) I loved being able to cobble together 2-3 page attempts for the 8 pager -- it really helped me believe that I had more to say than I thought I did and that I might end up writing this paper from the inside out, tacking back and forth between writing the analysis and firming up the framework around it.   \r\n4) Lili's abundant generosity, her willingness to meet regardless of how incoherent I feel.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for growth:\r\n1) I don't want us to shy away from getting close. I wonder if it might be helpful to have a conversation in which we ask each person what they want from this potential community, how they foresee it dovetailing with the other communities they are part of already. Granted, perhaps not everyone like explicitness and clarity as much as I do, but at the same time, I think the group will only cohere if the majority of people want it to. "

            "\u00a0YES! I am writing a year-long thesis and am also a FroCo this year. This seminar kept me on top of my writing through paced assignments. I really do recommend this course for seniors in the major who want to complete Yale with a deep dive into a subject area of interest to them. Please consider joining this class, even if you do not have a concrete topic for your thesis. ",
            "\u00a0Working on a year-long project is incredible and an invaluable opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this coursewhich means, I recommend doing a yearlong thesis. It's very rewarding and the course teaches you the skills and keeps you on track without being overbearing. "
