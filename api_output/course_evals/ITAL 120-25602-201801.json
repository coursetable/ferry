            "\u00a0I learned more about how to breakdown the Italian language word by word to figure out meanings and tricks with tenses. ",
            "\u00a0Italian grammatical structures ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot of grammar, and improved speaking. ",
            "\u00a0I become much more comfortable with written Italian and feel like my grammatical understanding of the language has been greatly expanded since L1. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like this course finally gave me the grammatical tools I needed to feel confident about my Italian abilities.  We covered an incredible amount of material throughout the semester, and I improved my writing and speaking dramatically as a result.  I am finally able to converse with real Italians and actually have them understand what I am trying articulate.  This course also offered a window into Italian culture in general, including a screening of La Traviata and readings from Boccaccio. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me increase my understanding of Italian, after taking L1. I gained knowledge in reading, writing, and speaking Italian, which I will continue developing through future courses. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths include how it uses VHL and many exercises to make sure we understand the material and how it incorporates Italian culture. Weaknesses are that while tests are standardized, the quizzes and length of VHL is not, so some students get harder work than others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the style of teaching\r\nCon: monotonous at times ",
            "\u00a0A lot of grammar taught, could be spaced out a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0L2 could be improved by creating more time in class to practice the language orally. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course is just the sheer volume of material it manages to effectively cover.  You really feel like you understand the language at a fundamental level after taking this course.  The primary weakness though is that, given how much material the course covers, exams are a constant weekly source of stress.  Perhaps this cannot be avoided though. ",
            "\u00a0The course is time consuming since the online homework takes a couple of hours, and is pretty fast-paced in comparison to the first semester. So, you have to put in the work and be dedicated, in order to see results. There are sometimes issues with the website and technicalities that could be improved to better this course. \r\nA strength of this course is that you will learn a lot by the end of it. "

            "\u00a0Yes because the Italian language is very interesting to learn as it ties in with other languages, and this level incorporated movies, conversation, politics, and more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes; Italian is a good language to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you are passionate about learning Italian, most definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  You develop your writing skills through short weekly essays, discover the inner workings of important grammatical structures in Italian, and have a chance to converse in Italian with other students on a daily basis.  You leave this course with a true grasp of the Italian language. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. We had to take it anyway, this year, to receive credit for L1. Still, I found it manageable, and fairly fun since you work on conversational skills and get acquainted with your peers. "
