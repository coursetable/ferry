            "\u00a0Details on theater companies across the country; access to conversations with professionals in the field; specific exercises/techniques that can be applied to mediate complicated situations in community engaged theater. ",
            "\u00a0This class introduces the ideas and origins of community-engaged theater or community-based art, and teaches students about several of the leading companies/organizations doing this kind of work across the US, such as Roadside Theater, Sojourn Theater, Urban Bush Women, and Albany Park Theater Project. Not only do you learn about these companies, but you meet with them face-to-face, as the head organizers and directors of these groups often Skype into class for conversations about this work. While learning about and talking about this work, you start making connections and engage with the community around you doing this kind of work and practicing the tools needed to engage. ",
            "\u00a0Community Engaged Theater was definitely a lacking area in the THST curriculum prior to this course: I had never gotten to engage on an intellectual, historical, or practical level with what this type of theater encompasses, and this course manages to pack in so much. It's incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a deep knowledge on the complexity of how to engage in community theatre and the diversity in its practices all over the country. I was able to reflected on why and how we can engage and the skills used to do so. ",
            "\u00a0The way we got to engage with Community Engaged Theatre in this course can be broadly categorized into three categories: through theory, practice, and dialogue. Theory: we got to read and reflect on Boal's Theatre of the Oppressed and Jan Cohen-Cruz's Local Acts and think through how the notion of community engaged theatre might have shifted or developed through the years, getting a sense of its history and thinking through what that meant to us. Practice: we got to develop our own community engaged theatre projects and try to implement them with our classmates. Dialogue: we got to speak to practitioners and both hear them speak about their experiences and also ask them specific questions relating to their practice. "

            "\u00a0Fantastic content, unpredictable structure (but understandable because it's new) ",
            "\u00a0This course was such an important introduction to this kind of work. A core piece of this work is teamwork and sharing resources between others working on community-engaged theater projects, so the ability to talk to these organizers from across the country face-to-face was very inspiring and helpful. The two core readings and paper for the class were also very insightful, not only to the sphere of community-based art as a whole, but to your own journey in understanding this work as well. Though the class often became embroiled in longer conversations about the philosophy and perhaps ethics of this work, these discussions were what we needed, and the class is very flexible in that way of meeting the students and their understanding and needs halfway. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the project part of the class could have developed into something bigger, but I think it's so difficult to build something from the ground up - that almost needs to be a separate course... ",
            "\u00a0I found the first half of the course to be slightly less productive than the second. I sometimes felt like we weren't using classtime well. For instance, when we had readings assigned for the course, often we would end up taking the time to read them in class anyway before getting into the discussion. I understand that if not all the students (or most of the students) had done the readings it would be hard to have discussions but to allow this only seemed to encourage more people to not do the readings in future instances, which just prevented us from diving right in and having the discussions that we could only have in class with each other when individual work should really have been done outside of class. I really enjoyed the various exercises that we explored in class that were relevant to the topic of community engaged theatre (like walking your life, the expert game etc.) and wish we could have done them more. Perhaps a different space might have been more conducive to this as well. \r\n\r\nSpeaking to the various practitioners for the second half of the class was immensely useful and I appreciated that we had the time to debrief with each other after as well, sorting through our thoughts on what they had said. The way Shilarna organized our reflections on that section of the class was also very helpful for this process. \r\n\r\nI appreciated the practical component of the class even if our project didn't fully take off the way we had hoped it would. It was great to have the space to try things out with classmates who were fully there and where you had each other's support. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first time this course was taught, so there were a few kinks to be worked out organizationally. Overall, however, it is essential that this course continue to be taught in Theater Studies at Yalewe need it. I already know that next year's class will build on the work of ours and the class will be more streamlined. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Very engaging and intellectually/morally/emotionally stimulating.\r\nWeaknesses - the structure of the class allowed everyone to share their thoughts freely, but sometimes this made the conversation go off into tangents driven by one or two individuals who have strong personalities and drive the conversation in one direction. A little more guidance from Professor Stokes in such moments would have been helpful. I also felt like personal opinions dictated too much of the conversations, and we did not take enough time to actually discuss the views and theories of the theorists we were studying. "

            "\u00a0YES, if they are willing to have a changing/non-strict structure. ",
            "\u00a0This class would be great for anyone interested in using what they know about theater, communities, storytelling, art, and people to create something for others, a space in which a voice can be heard and a story can be told. ",
            "\u00a0YES. ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I'VE TAKEN AT YALE. TAKE IT. ",
            "\u00a0Yes in a heart beat. Not only is the course stimulating intellectually but it is also a true joy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! While there were definitely things I thought could be improved on in the class, I am really grateful that a class on Community Engaged Theatre exists at Yale and I do think that if anyone is thinking through related work it'll be useful for you to take the class. The class is definitely still in the process of developing and thinking through itself but is so worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in theater. "
