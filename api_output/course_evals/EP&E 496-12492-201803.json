            "\u00a0This class was one of the most comprehensive, immersive, and challenging (in the best possible way!) experiences of my Yale career. Each case study brought about enormous insights of broader questions regarding the intersection of the public and private sector, contrasting greater overarching themes with context-specific analysis week after week. As an undergraduate, it was particularly enriching to hear from SOM students, since these are perspectives I would likely not have been exposed to otherwise. ",

            "\u00a0The one comment I would make regarding the course organisation was that, given so many possible options for both undergrad/grad students, though the flexibility in assessment types is definitely a plus (and not something I would change), I wish the deadlines would have been made clear at the very beginning of the semester in order to properly plan given similar assignments in other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the material is always relevant, and the guests were pretty cool. I can't really think of weaknesses right now. "
