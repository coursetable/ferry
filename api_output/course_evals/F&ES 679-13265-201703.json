            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of plant physiological processes ",
            "\u00a0Lots of things that are relevant to plants and forests.  Skills are generalizable to other fields. ",
            "\u00a0I learned fundamental plant ecophysiology including plant hydraulics, energy balance, and photosynthesis. I also benefited from reading and being exposed to several topical papers that demonstrated the current state of plant ecophysiological research. Finally, I also learned how to apply this knowledge to a hands-on project. ",
            "\u00a0Learned what aspects of the plant and environment to measure when considering trees-mostly- in their habitats and how to measure these things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more quantitatively about the structure and function of plant vessels and physiology in the context of environmental stresses, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of very interesting things about plants.  I gained some skills with which to analyze plant behavior in different situations. ",
            "\u00a0Learned the physiological basis for many of the assumptions presented in modern literature. It gave me a much better understanding of the mathematics often glossed over. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a greater understanding for how plants interact with their environment, and also the ways humans study them. "

            "\u00a0Pretty well ",
            "\u00a0On some things (e.g., how does water move through plants?), I feel way more comfortable. On others (what do the different hormones/secondary compounds do?) I am still fairly in the dark. I think that for a first pass at plant physiology it was decent, but I wish we'd been a bit more systematic and seen more clearly the lessons/takeaways. ",
            "\u00a0As expected, I increased my depth of knowledge of plant ecophysiology. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a little more quantitative than I would have liked. I think I also would have benefitted from more context for the material (the course often felt like it was structured for someone with more experience in the field than me). But overall I got what I wanted out of it. "

            "\u00a0Strength - course was interactive and drew from different experiences (lectures, discussions, field trips, homework, etc)\r\nWeakness - much of the homework from the book didn't align with the lectures, and the homework was more in depth\r\nImprovement - align the homework problems more closely with lectures, and instead of just having math problem sets, create a few homework questions that can be short answer so that student can tie the textbook material with lecture material ",
            "\u00a0In general I appreciated how the professor sought feedback on the course structure. I think the course benefited from his extensive knowledge; lecture was always very engaging. In contrast, the problem sets could have been better coordinated with the lecture material. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Brodersen is aware of these matters and I have faith that he will incorporate improvements and keep what worked well in the following course. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend more conceptual grounding--e.g., a conceptual problem set for each week that makes sure students can answer certain fundamental questions about plant physiology in concise, correct ways. Basically, the midterm, but for each week, with strict word limits, and then go over the answers with either an answer key or a few minutes during the lab. ",
            "\u00a0In general, the course was great. The problem sets in the textbook were frustrating because they required a lot of searching through the text for formulas. It could be improved by problems that are written better and that are easier to relate to real world problems. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter covered in this course is interesting and important.  The instructor presents and explains it very well.  However, the course needs more structure and organization.  This semester felt like a dry run for what will be an incredible course in the future.  Also, the textbook chosen was horrible and should be abandoned immediately. ",
            "\u00a0The course as a whole was fantastic, especially in the later portions in which the students discussed papers and looked to apply them to earlier textbook readings. A better integration between the textbook and outside readings might improve the engagement with the textbook some. "

            "\u00a0Must like plants... a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you connect the quantitative material to the conceptual lectures on your own--and pay close attention/take good notes on the lectures, as, at least in our version, that was where the most benefit was. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend it. I learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Go for it.  The instructor is incredibly knowledgeable and can very effectively convey some of that knowledge to you.  If he's still assigning readings from the Jones textbook, don't waste your time with them.  But do take this class and encourage the instructor to give lectures and explain things thoroughly, you won't be disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Reach out to the instructor to discuss your goals and needs. I know he is actively refining the class (this was the first time it was taught), and made an effort throughout to try to accommodate students. "
