            "\u00a0I learned about different ways to parse history. For the first time, I've started to examine authorship and historiography. This class allowed for growth since the use of classic works of fiction/influential texts influenced our learning and perspective. With thanks to Professor Gaddis' books, I also personally learned a great deal about the Cold War even though it is merely a minor subtopic within the class. ",
            "\u00a0I started thinking of history as a discipline that has various aspects. The writing assignments helped me develop my writing skill. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of the discipline of history. A solid introduction to History at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I better understanding of history and the flexibility of the discipline. When it comes to history, all is DEFINITELY NOT as it seems. There so much to learn, and Gaddis is a great guide. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the different philosophies behind history. This course was a nice introduction to how historical thinkers convey their ideas. The class emphasized the balance between imagination and archives, perception and truth in the study of history. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking to learn the history of any particular period, don't take this class. However, in this class, you'll learn about why we learn history, how we utilize our knowledge of history and above all, what exactly does history teach us. Also, you'll get to read some of the most incredible reading materials you would never have touched if Gaddis didn't make you too. ",
            "\u00a0The skills and insights that I developed during this course are unequivocally beneficial. You learn about how to approach history and how to approach stories. You learn about the strengths and follies of primary documents and also of secondary sources. Nothing is perfect. You learn about how history can have countless interpretations and nobody has the right answer and the right way to think about it. The course sort of bends your idea of what the \"truth\" actually is because someone can look a certain way zoomed in, but big picture it can look entirely different--- and vice versa. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed how I thought about history. It has ensured that in the future, I will love history even more but approach with a lot more skepticism but also more respect. I learned how to step back in my thinking and ponder my assumptions. I learned how to read history for the experience, rather than for the detail, and how to appreciate history in non-textbook forms. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to hone my critical thinking skills and synthesize several sources to draw my own conclusions about the course material. ",
            "\u00a0My view of my place in, as well as the nature of, history completely changed. As for skills, I learned how to look at archival materials for the first time as well as how to make historical research less dry through the use of certain rhetorical devices. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to assess a field of study's strengths and weaknesses both from the perspective of a researcher within that field and from the outside. ",
            "\u00a0The course promises to discuss what history teaches, but it also helped me get past some preconceived notions of what history IS. The course focuses beyond the mere facts of history. Instead, you learn about different historians' intent, different methodologies to history, different ways how a historian sees the world, and how all of this can be applied to the rest of your learning and everyday life. The course itself was surprisingly creative-writing heavy, so my skills in that department also improved by a lot. Professor Gaddis doesn't care about traditional essay structure - as long as what you're trying to communicate is clear, unique, and creative. ",
            "\u00a0Chronology is only a very little party of history. History can teach so much, and I learned that history inherently contains biases and can be viewed from many different perspectives. My way of thinking about history, and life itself, changed in this course and I feel that I now have a more informed approach to viewing the past and present reality. ",
            "\u00a0Learned an extensive amount about how to approach understanding individuals and different moments in history "

            "\u00a0A strength of the class is its intimate conversations facilitated by Professor Gaddis. Class discussion comprised the majority of all classes, but never became derailed/detracted from a main focus, because Professor Gaddis moderated the conversation, making sure to always resurrect a washed over point that he saw vital to our discussion at hand. \r\n\r\nA weakness of this class is that reading assignments often include reading multiple books at once. It would be preferable to have less books assigned at once, as it is easy to mix parts of different books in one's memory. The reading is definitely a lot and at times it would become stressful to read as much at one time as was required. ",
            "\u00a0It is an interesting course. The reading list made me read faster and more critically. ",
            "\u00a0This is a bit of a mixed bag, but the writing assignments were often not very related to the readings. I personally found this to be a positive, as it was hard to know what was coming next. ",
            "\u00a0Less reading - a lot of what we read was not ~about~ history methodology, but to prove a point: \"see, history CAN be small\" \"see history CAN cover the entire world.\" I think I got the point when I read the title and introductions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the book syllabus and in-class discussions. Reading Tolstoy's War and Peace and Macaulay's Motels of Mystery, among others, was a pleasure, and our class discussions did well to make the material interesting, light, and applicable to everyday life. The writing assignments are also amazing! Prof. Gaddis gives us the opportunity to display our strengths in the written word. He is full of wonderful stories, shedding light on both classical and modern dilemmas, while giving all of his students the chance to contribute to the class discussion.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the class may benefit from a refocused book syllabus. I think that some of the novels, like Doomsday Book, were tangent to the purpose of the class and could be substituted for more impactful works. I most enjoyed the beginning section on the classics and War and Peace! ",
            "\u00a0Strength is definitely Gaddis himself. \r\nI don't think it has any significant weakness. ",
            "\u00a0The class is almost completely consists of doing the reading and then coming in and discussing the reading. Kind of look a book club but with one of the most famous and prolific historians of all time. That's definitely a strength because it's fascinating to see what he thinks on a book or an essay. I think the weakness of this course was just when in terms of how much reading there was at a given time. Poor reading (most likely having not done the reading) leads to poor discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. I'd perhaps improve the pacing of the readings to where we get a bit more time to read War and Peace (perhaps starting earlier). ",
            "\u00a0The course is very engaging and the material is interesting and topical. However, the reading load is particularly heavy, which is discouraging and causes many students to give up on the readings entirely. There is also a disconnect between the reading, the discussions in class, and the writing assignments. ",
            "\u00a0A really excellent course - confusing at times, but by the end of the semester I felt like I had received a complete package, even if I wasn't entirely sure what it was. I recommend it not only as a seminar on history but as an exercise in critical thinking and reflection. ",
            "\u00a0This is the least \"seminar-y\" seminar course I've taken so far. For some, that's a strength. For others, a weakness. Professor Gaddis is an incredible conversationalist; he's great at helping bounce ideas around the classroom and helping students through particularly difficult or confusing concepts. That does mean that a lot of the conversation is directed AT him rather than towards other students in the course. You're in a class led by an incredibly accomplished historian, but sometimes it feels like multiple individual conversations going on at once rather than a unified classroom discussion.\r\n\r\nAnother pro/con (depending on your viewpoint) is the readings. This is an incredibly reading-heavy course. We often had 200+ pages a week. (War and Peace especially will be difficult if you don't know how to divy up your readings ahead of time). When the reading was less page-heavy, it was very idea-dense. There are a lot of scholarly articles that Professor Gaddis likes to assign. Be prepared to commit a lot of time to those if you want to UNDERSTAND what they're actually talking about. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that I felt like I could always have my voice heard in the class and that I got to hear how my peers think. This course is very involved in discussions. It's also amazing to be able to be taught by Professor Gaddis! It could be improved by shortening the reading load and maybe having the students speak more in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the material and the instructor, who was very engaging with the material. Weaknesses were sometimes the bulky readings that we did not end up discussing thoroughly. The class moved very quickly. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if s/he were a self-starting student. Professor Gaddis is such an amazing professor that its a shame to encourage a student to join the class if s/he weren't planning to do many of the readings, keep up with homework, etc. I have this opinion since I feel that Professor Gaddis' course is structured in such a way that it is possible for students to choose their level of engagement with course material through how strong of a relationship they decide to establish with class texts. Thus, encouraging students less interested in working independently and reading volumes of text wold be a bad idea.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend this course based solely on Professor Gaddis' teaching style and the ability to read so many great texts in a classroom setting. Bottom line, if you don't mind all the work for the class, it's definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It allows you to think of history in a new way. Professor Gaddis is great; the readings and essays he assigned are also fun. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a good excuse to read War and Peace, yes. If you want to have a class with an excellent professor, yes. If you want to think about history from a new perspective, yes. If you want to do some crazy writing assignments, yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you can get in, take it! But heads up: SO MUCH READING. You will also grow as a student and thinker. At the end of the day, no pain no gain! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student, especially as an introductory history course. You get out of the course what you put in: if you read the books and pay close attention in class, your knowledge of history and the world will greatly increase. Prof. Gaddis is very knowledgeable and has a lot to offer any potential history major. \"What History Teaches\" is not a class but an experience -- an experience that I was lucky to be a part of! ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! ITS AMAZING! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who thinks they have an interest in history. The course is a great way to learn about how to think history through and how to approach it. So, if you don't know as much about literal history as some of your classmates, that's ok. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class will challenge all your previous opinions on history and on thinking in general. Professor Gaddis brings up really interesting questions and has insight you don't want to miss. The essays are quite fun as well. It will be a lot, both in the scope of the questions asked and in the length of the readings. However, don't let the readings scare you away from this class. There were a couple weeks of the class that are a bit too theoretical to truly comprehend, but the rest of the course really makes you reevaluate how to think about and what to do with the history you've been learning all your life. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because it was the most intellectually stimulating class that I took this semester and I believe the content is unique and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would - if you win the lottery, absolutely take this seminar. I can't necessarily say what you'll get out of it personally but I know you won't regret it! ",
            "\u00a0If you're at ALL interested in majoring in History at Yale, or even if you've just always liked history but don't necessarily want to major in it, this course is essential. You're going to take a lot of history courses here; this course helps deconstruct what those courses teach into the very basics of the profession of history. It's an incredibly useful foundation for continuing with history, literature, or even political science (Warning: Political scientists are Prof. Gaddis' nemeses; be prepared for a gentle roasting if that's your intended major).\r\n\r\nOf course, it's not for everyone. There's a lot of reading that you have to do if you want to meaningfully participate in classroom discussions. If you already have a heavy course-load, this may not be the class for you. You'll get what you give. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course to another student, but I would warn them that there is a lot of reading material. Sometimes it was a little bit too much and I struggled to complete it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are into history!!!! And are a fast/good reader. "
