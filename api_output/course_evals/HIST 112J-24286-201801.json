            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of fugitives and freedom-seekers related to the U.S. slave trade and its legacy! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about runaways in early America, along with some of the philosophy behind archives today, as well as how to create a database online. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I developed a much more meaningful understanding of slavery in the 18th and 19th century. I learned much more about the logistics of where slaves ran to and what they ran from. I feel as though throughout this class I began to understand more about the history of runaway slaves in an engaged, interesting way. "

            "\u00a0Amazing course, no improvements needed. ",
            "\u00a0An hour and fifty minutes is a long time...even if it's just once a week. It's hard to stay engaged that long. Class size was also a little large. ",
            "\u00a0It should have been a smaller class and there should have been more involvement on the part of the professor. Readings were interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0I loved how each week, we looked at a different topic involving runaway slavery; I thought it was really cool to study one thing through various different perspectives, and build upon previous discussions that we had earlier. I really enjoyed the final project; I thought it was a cool way to tie together everything we had done this semester. The one way I think the course could be improved is if the class size were slightly smaller; I really enjoyed the discussions we had in class, but I think they would be better if the class weren't so large. ",
            "\u00a0Class presentations and lectures were great. The class project was a lot of fun. ",

            "\u00a0Definitely keep seminars small ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings for this course, and I think the weekly reading responses were a good way to stay on track, but the size of the class made discussion difficult. I think it would have been in the professor's benefit to convert it into more of a discussion/lecture hybrid. Also, the database project was very cool, but I almost wish we had started it earlier, so our final product could have been more developed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting project, useful in getting students to think about clich topics in new and creative ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A bit loose in subject matter; too large of a class size for a seminar-style to really work well. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the only obvious weakness to this course was the fact that it only met once a week. I think that if this course were to be offered again It should be offered more days a week. "

            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to anyone interested in the digital humanities. This class offered an in-depth look at runaway slaves, the experiences they had, and the communities they formed. Professor Yannielli was really passionate about the subject, and the class discussions were always interesting (albeit a bit slow sometimes). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. I really enjoyed the readings each week and the discussions we had, and the course changed my perspective on how we study history. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Take it if you want to learn about the actual content of this course. Don't take it if you want to improve your writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was incredibly interesting and engaging! One of the most unique classes I have taken at Yale, Rogues will definitely be one I remember. ",
            "\u00a0I think with a few improvements this could be a great course. The material was very interesting, and the workload was very chill. The only problem was that there were way too many people for it to be a seminar, so discussion stagnated, though this got better once we began working on the database project. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who looks to gain knowledge of slavery from a new perspective, and gain insights that they had previously not been exposed to. "
