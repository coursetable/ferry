            "\u00a0After taking this course, I feel much more capable of understanding the concepts in setting up and analyzing fundamental statistical tests, particularly in comparison to my undergraduate intro to stats course. Now, I feel ready to set up simple experiments and use basic statistics to analyze the results. ",

            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this course. Jonathan is an excellent teacher, who bends over backwards to make stats accessible, interesting, and memorable. I had some background in stats from my undergrad, but it had been a long time, and I was actually disappointed at how little I remembered from that time. I don't think that will be a problem again - Jonathan's course went deeper, I was decidedly more engaged, and the work helped ground it in a way I hope will last. I feel that I am coming away with a strong foundation in introductory statistical analysis, and will likely take additional stats course while here at FES (with Jonathan if possible) to further deepen that understanding. ",

            "\u00a0This course represented my first comprehensive introduction to statistics. I've now developed some competency in data and trend analysis methods and techniques, with a moderate degree of proficiency in the use of a new statistical software package (Minitab). The course has also provided some insight on some research methods and tools that I may be interested in undertaking. ",

The lectures and problem sets,  as well as the final project, created a nice balance between knowledge intake and hands-on application. ",

My understanding of statistics was very perfunctory prior to taking this class, and the class provided a thorough overview of the statistical methods that can be utilized to determine relationships. ",

            "\u00a0This course taught you the concepts and reasoning behind statistical tests, compared to my undergraduate statistics course, which was much heavier in the math and where I didn't walk away with any big-picture understanding of why and how to use certain statistical tests. Therefore, in this way, this course surpassed my expectations by making me feel more competent than I had previously. ",

ANOVA was new to me. During the class, I realized that I had remembered some of the material, so some of it wasn't additive to my learnings. ",

            "\u00a0There is a strong emphasis placed on learning rather than evaluation. I felt like this focus enabled an environment where long-term knowledge retention was placed over short term retention. ",
            "\u00a0Jonathan is very engaged with students, both in class and during office hours consultations. I'm glad he recorded the classes and made those recordings available on Canvas; all instructors should do this. ",

            "\u00a0Jonathan has the course down pretty well, and he really makes time for his students. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Reuning-Scherer explains concepts very clearly, and I definitely benefited from his engaging teaching style. I was very satisfied with this course. However, one weakness I would comment on was the grading system. I was sometimes caught off guard by my homework grades being lower than expected, and it seems to be because I didn't fully understand what was expected for our answers. This could be made clearer going forward. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and lectures are engaging. Learning objectives and assignments are all clear. The TAs are accessible and knowledgeable, but occasionally did not seem to be on the same page in regards to homework expectations (i.e. what key points to include for full credit). I also feel that probability could be covered at a higher level in a shorter time span in order to leave more time to practice regression and ANOVA with real data. While understanding probability concepts is essential, the practice questions and specific applications did not seem necessary for the rest of the course. But perhaps I felt this way because I had recently taken a statistics course that covered probability extensively. ",
            "\u00a0The course strength is the professor, who is engaging, fun, and provides students with all the tools necessary to learn stats. The TAs were also incredibly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly none, this was a well designed and executed course, and one got the sense that Jonathan has honed it carefully over the years. ",
            "\u00a0Jonathan's teaching style is so great and engaging! It's a great survey course for statistics. \r\n\r\nAgain, I would have liked to see a bit more rigorous/mathematical approach to stats for those of us who want to pursue stats/data analysis in our careers. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the props and prices, especially the light saber pointer.  Challenging material was made more accessible. ",
            "\u00a0The course content may be considered heavy, but Jonathan's delivery is organised, simple and charismatic. The problem sets are also well aligned with the course content that further assists in student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the needs of the students were met with the two versions of the class. Maybe one thing that has room for improvement is the speed at which the professor speaks in the normal class. ",
            "\u00a0I would have been more engaged if there were a reason to come to class - i.e. quizzes. I just didn't get as much out of the videos. But I realize that's more on me than the professor. ",
            "\u00a0It seemed there were some inconsistencies in the grading standards among the TFs, and that was unfair to some students depending on which TF graded their homeworks. The grading should be more standardized. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the class is a little too fast ",
            "\u00a0It's very engaging and fun. I like the connection to real life research studies and topics. I think the homework could have been harder...I didn't do well on every assignment because I thought that they assignments were graded very nitpicky. I don't care too much about my grades though so tried to focus on the larger concepts above the individual grades. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the professor did a very good job covering many topics in a relatively little amount of time. I learned a lot and did not feel overwhelmed by the information which should be credited to Professor Reuning-Scherer for his organization of the class. Overall I really enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0If lectures could be delivered at slower pace. ",
            "\u00a0Required use of SPSS or R--although Minitab was easy, it doesn't seem useful at all. ",
            "\u00a0Once I switched into the flipped course, I became much more engaged and successful. I think that having an element of practice with support is incredibly valuable to this course. \r\n\r\nJonathan is a great teacher, but his in-class lectures move far too fast for a first time stats student. \r\n\r\nThe probability segment went especially quickly and felt impossible to succeed in as a student with little background in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0All of the resources made available (video replays, video explanations, tutors, TAs, office hours, multiple texts, preprinted notes) is certainly the strength of the course and it unparalleled by any others in that regard ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include Jonathan's teaching style and his organization of the material.  He clearly has put a great deal of thought into preparing each lecture, and he makes sure to transition between concepts logically and make connections to previously discussed material.  Additionally, the generous availability of the TAs and Jonathan's willingness to answer questions even when stopped in the hallway of CSSSI make the course a rarity among FES in that in this case it is clear the professor really is invested in student learning.

Data analysis is increasingly important in all fields and even those who do not need to perform analysis themselves should have an understanding of the applications and limitations of statistics.
