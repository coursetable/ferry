            "\u00a0Comprehensive survey of the theory and practice of data visualization. Super interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0The theoretical framework for designing data visualizations, justifying design choices, various visual idioms to choose from when designing visualizations, as well as practical coding skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js, which is a JavaScript library specifically designed for making interactive visualizations for the web). ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to data visualization and learned how to make several different visualizations using d3. I also learned about human perception and psychology in reference to data visualization. ",
            "\u00a0None. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight on the intricacies of data visualization, ranging  from optimal uses of screen space to data as a means of conveying a narrative. In addition, I learned Javascript, HTML, CSS, SVG, and D3. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the numerous procedural methods invented in the early stages of computer graphics and their relevance in today's technology. ",

            "\u00a0I learned how to use D3. I learned many detailed techniques about visualizing data, along with dos and don'ts when it comes to creating a visualization. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my programming skills in JavaScript and HTML. I also learned quite a bit about how to program with d3. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use D3, the Javascript visualization library. This is an enormously useful library to know and is powerful. I see myself using this library to develop awesome, custom visualizations in the future. I did not know Javascript before this class, but it was easy enough to pickup through the course. \r\n\r\nThe other major skillset you learn through the course is how to *think* about visualizations. While this may sound obvious at first, there is a large amount of empirical research and aesthetic considerations designers have to think about when designing data visualizations. In a sense, you learn how to become a product managerarticulating user needs, developing features around user needs, and building a design framework. This is an invaluable skillset for those who want to work in software engineering or management in a tech company. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about d3, you will be able to make really cool visualizations. Also learn a lot about visual theory which is so so useful. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging problem sets and interesting material -- I definitely gained a solid grasp of D3, which is a super important skill for anyone working with data. Weaknesses: 9am is brutal. Not many people showed up to lecture on a regular basis. Midterms should be more than just rote memorization. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the coding part of this course is generally interesting but it can get a bit tedious, especially with the data transformations and preprocessing that you need to do before you start drawing your diagrams. Usually this involves a lot of JavaScript coding to compute the things you want, but considering the fact that JavaScript isn't the most intuitive/well-designed coding language out there (in my opinion) this part can get frustrating sometimes, although it's not necessarily intellectually challenging.\r\n\r\nWhat I disliked the most about this course is the grading scheme and the exams. The exams are worth 25% each, and there are 2 of them. The homeworks (6 of them) are only worth 30% total. The remaining 20% is \"participation\", which is basically answering extremely short/easy questions in the reading material assigned for each lecture. So yeah, 20 out of 100 points of your final grade is for free, but it feels terrible to think that ALL of your hard work on the homeworks isn't worth that much more than 1 exam (mind you, the homeworks can take quite long, and workload gets heavier than, for reference, CS 223 sometimes). The feeling gets much worse when you see the exam, where Rushmeier would give short-answer questions like \"in XXX figure in the book, the author mentioned 3 words, one of them is ABC, what are the other two?\" or \"what are the four bulletin points listed for XXX topic from XYZ paper?\" The grading is loose on the exams but I still felt it would be much better to increase the weight of the homeworks (ideally to > 50%, like most other CS classes) because given the present format and content of the exams they feel pretty pointless and don't justify 25% weight each. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best CS classes I've taken at Yale by far. The subject matter was surprisingly fascinating. Professor Rushmeier taught extremely well and made me excited about the subject matter. She was really approachable. I think the only weaknesses was that the exams weren't super controlled so I saw multiple people cheat during them and the 9am time meant lots of people missed class (their loss). The psets were very enjoyable as well, super fun and very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0This course was poorly structured. There was no overlap between the assignments and the lecture. The lectures were also incredibly boring and rambling. The tests were way too difficult and there was no communication about the grading scale/curve (which is disappointing when the median score is less than 50%).\r\n\r\nOffice hours needed to be more consistent. The TA would not respond to emails and the professor only had one hour per week she would meet. ",
            "\u00a0The courses strengths lie in the professor. Classes were structured with informative powerpoints that gave context to the coding assignments we had. Lectures were engaging and interactive, and tests were comprehensive of the material included in readings, lectures and assignments.  Given how much we cover in the semester, exams were rather difficult, and I felt at times that it could be too demanding, but I they pushed me to absorb and think about the concepts in a broader context when approaching specific problems the data visualization I had to do for homework. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that the strengths lie in the exposure to the numerous techniques for creating graphics that students are exposed to through the readings. However, there was no formal instruction on how to use Maya and Blender to implement these techniques, which were required for the assignments. I beleive that I could have accomplished much more on the midterm and final projects if I simply knew the basics for using the techniques. Also, lectures were repetitive and focused exclusively on the readings. While having presentations on the assigned readings were helpful, it felt as if there was not as much instruction from the professor herself. Much of the learning is on a student's own, which can seem overbearing at times. ",
            "\u00a0Very challenging course with a high bar for computer science discovery at the beginning. Maybe having a more gradual learning curve could facilitate understand and engagement ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great homework that encourages design thinking\r\nWeakness: the lecture content can sometimes be too abstract, and the exam is too focus on reciting ",
            "\u00a0The course's assignments prepare you with various forms of visualization and you will become familiar with basic plots.\r\n\r\nBut you won't learn much about those fancy graphs. I wish there could be case studies that discuss more complicated visualization idioms. ",
            "\u00a0I really like that the course is really hands-on and dives into creating visualizations right away. I also like the reading responses since they ensure that we keep up with the material, especially since so much material is covered in the midterms that you cannot just cram for the last couple days before a midterm. \r\n\r\nI don't know how to feel about the textbook. On one hand, it seems really comprehensive, but on the other, it seems like the information it contains tends to be repetitive (they tend to follow certain basic rules but just presented in different ways). As a result, the exam mostly had to do with memorizing bullet points more than anything else. But then again, this might just be the nature of the field. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments were pretty interesting and fairly entertaining. I think lectures would have higher attendance with a later class time. The lecture slides could sometimes use a little more text and clear structure. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- Problems sets really teach you how to design visualizations and use D3. The assignments are the right length and difficulty. I enjoyed the homework assignments quite a bit. \r\n- The pre-lecture discussion questions were great to help you think about the material before lecture.\r\n- The textbook was very well written and was a great resource for understanding the theory behind data visualizations\r\n- Reading were of a reasonable length\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- 9AM lecture was hard for many students and attendance was sparse as a result. (The room was mostly empty during lecture and then full during exam day.)\r\n- The first exam had some obscure questions about things that had been mentioned orally in lecture or appeared on one slide. The second exam was very fair and did not have these kinds of questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was a bit dry, but very predictable since it came straight from the book. The coding assignments themselves are sometimes confusing but fun. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely (assuming you don't already know D3). Interesting material and you get to learn a totally new data visualization library while also improving your HTML/Javascript skills in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want an easy-ish CS elective. This course isn't easy workload-wise since the homeworks can take quite some time, and the coding part is very mechanical but JavaScript isn't hard to debug once you get used to reading error messages from your browser console. D3, which is the JS coding environment used for this course is also EXTREMELY WELL documented on github so it's not hard to find reference. Intellectually this course is much less challenging than other CS courses; you simply have to memorize stuff from the book to pass the exams, and Rushmeier is very lenient in grading the exams. In the end, though, all the stuff you memorized isn't super useful and I have already begun to forget.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you want a better perspective on the application of computer science or the practice of computer graphics, I think there are other CS electives out there for you. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The subject matter is super interesting and useful. You learn a mix of CS, design, psychology, and perception. If you can make it to lecture, you'll learn a lot. Professor Rushmeier is a really good lecturer and very fair as well. ",
            "\u00a0Never. It was boring, and I didn't learn anything. The exams were incredibly difficult and there was very little support for the problem sets. Steer clear. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student who wishes to learn the basics of web design and how it fits into the issue of presenting data to consumers in a convincing and effective way. This course has opened my eyes to opportunities for the intersection of computer science and art, and as a Computing and the Arts, this has been an enlightening experience for me. Even if a student does not have an artistic background, this course is still wonderful for investigating the complexities of web design and finding comuputational solutions that translate to visual efficiencies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. These are useful skills and taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in data vis but the course could be better designed ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Learning design theory/visual implementation of data is such an important skill that is often overlooked. ",
            "\u00a0I won't recommend this course if you are not super into data visualization already. The lectures are not very engaging, and the textbook is very verbose and uninteresting to read. \r\n\r\nIf you have a particular interest in visualizing data on a website, take the course. The class is Javascript-based, so it might help with your web project. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! I have talked about this course to most of my friends, since I just loved it that much. I think the coding part is not actually that difficult even if you don't have much experience prior to this course - as long as you put in reasonable effort for each assignment, you should be fine. I enjoyed the creative aspect of this class, since the assignments tend to be more open-ended than other CS courses. \r\n\r\nIf you enjoy making pretty graphs and learning how people perceive them, then definitely consider taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone looking to understand what makes a good visualization. Professor Rushmeier is very caring, and she clearly takes pride in her teaching. There were 6 major assignments, two non-cumulative exams, and twice weekly readings. The assignments are pretty cool, and they are very doable. I might not recommend taking this credit/D/fail since the assignments are such that you either spend the time and do well or skip and do very poorly. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. This was the first year it was taught and it was already one of my favorite CS courses at Yale. I hope it will only get better in the future. This one of the rare opportunities in the Yale CS department to take an elective that a professor is both a leader in their field and an excellent teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to any CS student. Great insight into visual theory which will probably come in handy if you are building applications that real people will use. "
