I don't understand what the professor is talking about in class. She usually sticks to small unrelated stuff and ignores very important side of the course. You cannot depend on her to explain your concerns or questions every time you point out. If you want to study after class with PPT, unfortunately, you cannot do that. Because the PPT is not clear at all. SOME WORDS ARE OUT OF BOUNDARY! You can not fix that even you really want! There are tons of typos in the PPT, including important definitions, like A is bigger than B, the professor will sometimes label it as A is smaller than B. FULL OF CONFUSION!!\r\n\r\nI have to point out that in our homework, the professor provides us with a word document for questions. The fonts of the questions are not consistent! Some words are bigger, some are smaller, and AGAIN YOU CANNOT FIX IT. I guess the professor just copy paste some document made by Latex.

The lectures were incoherent, and the professor, while nice, would often veer into long ramblings that did not make the material easier to understand. The homeworks were long and the TA sessions were so rushed that it was clear that you needed to read the slides on your own to understand anything (and even then the slides were too dense to make any sense of). I can honestly say that I could not follow what happened in this class and neither could anyone else. I think only one person would ask questions on a regular basis, and he also always seemed confused. Also the class should have been in either SAS or R, not both, as it was too hard to follow two languages at once. ",
