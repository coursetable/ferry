            "\u00a0The course perfectly matched my expectations. The individual tutoring sessions as well as the lecturers invited on a bi-weekly basis all helped us better synthesize and write about complex scientific topics. ",

I discovered that someone had written about similar topics as I did and it would have been great if I could have connected with her to discuss our ideas together. ",
            "\u00a0The only improvement I'd suggest is a slightly more systematic editing process, where the editors are reinforcing general principles of good writing in their comments. Having them say things like \"The way you use numbers here may confuse readers\" or \"Your word choice should be more precise\" could help writers internalize advice, rather than sort of revising ad hoc without taking away lessons about how to write better. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very organized and provides different tools to help/guide our writing (writing exercises, online guidelines, guest speakers, etc). I really like that the instructors encourage us to visit writing tutors within Yale. ",

            "\u00a0The class required many drafts before a final draft, which gave me the time to edit my article appropriately and feel proud of my work. There weren't many classes, but we had guest speakers any time there was a class. The guest speakers were all very interesting and useful for people pursuing science journalism, but I would have liked to haven taken some classes to talk about our own articles to each other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: practice writing and it looks good on your resume. Weaknesses: editing process is a little disorganized, with different editors having different opinions on the same piece which ends up being confusing. Workload was more than 1 credit worth. ",
            "\u00a0the meetings weren't useful for developing writing skills, but it was good to hear from other professors or professional writers. ",
