            "\u00a0This seminar was very interesting and will definitely teach you history you have never learned about! Prof Echeverri is great at picking readings that highlight non-traditional historical narratives and underemphasized people/events. ",
            "\u00a0How to develop critical thinking skills and make nuanced arguments regarding history ",
            "\u00a0The course gives a thorough overview of the revolutions of the Atlantic World (American, Haitian, and Latin American), and also provides students an opportunity to explore the various resources available at Yale for studying primary sources. You are able to explore documents at the Beinecke, learn how to effectively find sources on Orbis (the online library database), and also explore primary sources through other resources at Yale (e.g. the manuscripts in Sterling, the microforms in the Manuscripts and Archives Library, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the American Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, and various Latin American revolutions that occurred in the end of the 18th and start of the 19th centuries. I also learned about the similarities and differences among these revolutions. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class because it pushed me to think about history in new ways and make connections between events that I was more familiar with, like the American Revolution, with events I wasn't as familiar with, like the Haitian Revolution. We talked a lot about flaws or possible biases in the primary and secondary sources we read, which was an interesting way to look at historical works. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better analyze historical documents and examine them for bias. I also developed a better understanding of the Haitian and Latin American revolutions and the ways in which the issues of race, slavery, sovereignty, and colonialism shaped them. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned how to critically analyze primary sources from different perspectives and this allowed me to experience sources in different lights than I was able to before (and to even see their faults, something I had never had the opportunity to really do before). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The biggest strength was Prof. Echeverri! She is incredibly nice, extremely intelligent, a fair grader and amazing at leading discussions. She is clearly an expert in Latin American history and a natural teacher. I cannot recommend her highly enough! Even if you hate history, just take the class to have her! The workload was fine, some weeks reading was a bit heavy, but nothing too crazy. The papers aren't very long and can be tailored to your interests, so if you hate writing them, it's at least partially your fault. ",
            "\u00a0We rushed through Latin America in about three classes. I would've liked to discuss it more ",
            "\u00a0The course has a fair amount of reading that ranges from 30 to 100+ pages per week. However, although it is a seminar, you do not have to do all of the readings to be able to participate during class. However, if you want to get the most out of the course and learn about the American revolutions in depth, then I would recommend doing all of the readings. Not only does it help when writing papers, but it also allows you to get the most out of the course. The course has 3 papers in total (2 shorter ones and a final paper), and all of them are very manageable. Professor Echeverri is definitely a fair grader, but do not expect to learn how to write through this freshman seminar. Professor Echeverri is truly an expert in this field and is able to really spur in depth discussions during class. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a seminar, which really helped to cultivate/encourage discussions. The professor would assign reading to do before each class, and during each class, we would discuss what we had read and how it related to other works that we had already talked about. We also had a 1 pg response due each class based on the reading, which kept us on track. The amount of reading really shocked me at first, but halfway through the class I got used to it and found it to be pretty manageable, even if it was more than I was used to. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading in this course, sometimes we were asked to read 200 pages over two nights, which at times made it feel like a push to get through the interesting material instead of being able to absorb why it was so interesting. The strength of this course was the discussions. Professor Echeverri was great at making the discussion interesting and using everyone's ideas to push the conversation to the next step. Everyone was very engaged with the material, and she made it feel very acessible. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, it's an amazing seminar with an amazing professor and I wouldn't change anything. Discussions are fun and readings are interesting (actually - sometimes there is really a lot of reading but if you are able to do it, it winds up worthwhile). "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! As I mentioned earlier, Prof. Echeverri is amazing and the content is really fascinating! It's a perfect introduction to seminars at Yale, and anyone who wouldn't love this course is crazy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fantastic teacher ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Even if you are not a history major (I definitely am not, I am most likely STEM), apart from learning more about world history and becoming a more well-informed \"world citizen,\" the course exposes you to all of the incredible resources that Yale has to offer with regards to research. You have the opportunity to access the same historic primary sources as some of the most distinguished historians in the world -- many students at Yale never take advantage of these opportunities, but by the end of this course you will definitely feel fully comfortable accessing and utilizing these resources in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in the revolutions that occurred in Haiti and Latin America during the end of the 18th century and the start of the 19th century. We also talk about class structure, Europe's situation/leaders at the time, the different revolutionary leaders, the events leading up to a revolt, etc. The class does not focus a lot on the American Revolution since that topic is usually covered in depth in high school. Some nights there are a lot of readings, but if you are interested in the material then it shouldn't be too bad. The class also teaches you how to request and analyze primary sources at the Beinecke, which I think is a very useful skill if you are going to be a history major. 2 of the essays we wrote required us to use primary sources. If you are interested in this topic in history, then go for it. If not, then you might find it to be a bit boring because we did a lot of readings and learned about the revolutions in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great introduction to a history seminar. I felt like I had a good connection with the professor and lots of chances to speak and listen to both her and my classmates. I had a chance to do a historical research paper, but she held our hands a lot and gave us feedback on the rough drafts and prospectus of out essay. The workload is fairly high, but consistent with reading responses every week, which makes it pretty easy to keep up with the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Echeverri is able to connect ideas through an exploration of revolutions throughout the Americas which allows students to understand history from both the perspective of the revolutionaries and the imperial powers that they revolted against. The readings are super interesting and explore revolutions that you may not always have the opportunity to learn about in other courses. ",
