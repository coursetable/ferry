            "\u00a0The professor and TA's don't give feedback after they graded your exam. All of the exams have free response questions and points are deducted for no reason. This is a course will little teacher engagement, at the very least, a few comments on the exam would be helpful. ",

John Bargh was very respectful of his students' time and his careful organization of class material contributed to that. Professor Bargh clearly had identified the rhythm/style of teaching that worked best for the course contents.\r\nWeaknesses: Making the class more interactive, assigning a group project (or even just a research paper!) might help liven the class up and encourage more communication between students.

Professor Bargh is obviously very experienced with teaching this course, and does a good job presenting lecture material. I also really appreciate the testing format with 3 midterms - it evenly spreads out studying and is an effective but relatively stress-free way of absorbing the material.\r\nI think that the format of the lecture slides leaves a LOT to be improved - the poor font and background color choices, the often very small and nearly illegible font and the odd bullet/list formatting makes it very hard to take notes or even follow what is otherwise an excellent lecture.

It's only 3 non-cumulative tests (multiple choice and short answer) which are pretty easy as long as you've gone to lecture and read the textbook chapters (about half the questions on the test come from the textbook so you have to read it). It's a great CR/D (although you might end up wanting to convert) and also a great 5th class. The concepts are super relevant to everyday life which makes it fun and interesting to learn about. ",

In this way, since students could contribute very little, student learning wasn't put at the forefront and was not very engaging. Courses like Yarrow Dunham's Intro to Psychology, which had exams as well as reading responses, was more engaging despite being a lecture class. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend if you're looking for an introductory psychology class that won't require you to have any background knowledge! I think I learned some interesting things. Plus there's no time-consuming busy work, just 3 in-class exams that you should do well on if you just read the textbook closely enough. It's a good fifth class. ",

The topic itself is reason enough to take the class. It's really straightforward and you'll gain important insights into the world around you. ",
