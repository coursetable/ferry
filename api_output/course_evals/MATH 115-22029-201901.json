It could be improved by holding more helpful review sessions that show examples of the different topics that will be on the exam while also explaining how to do the examples. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. One strength is that the tests are very fair and not designed to trick students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well thought, solid curriculum, the assessments were challenging but fair\r\nWeakness: A lot of content felt crammed. Possibly felt this way because my session met T Th instead of M, W, F. ",
            "\u00a0There werent many weaknesses to this course! Math is always tough to teach, but I really appreciated the way the course was taught and the way the exams were structured. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: my smaller class made it easier to reach out to my teacher for extra help. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the tests were significantly more difficult than anything we ever did in class. They often went beyond what could be expected making it hard to do well. ",

The problem sets are appropriately challenging, and if completed with sufficient focus, they act as good practice for the exams. The only suggestion I have is that feedback from the problem sets would be better received if they were graded a little sooner. Overall, this class was very well run. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the structure and my professor. I enjoyed how the material was taught first by online videos, exposing us to the new material before the material was taught in class. I also think my professor, Kevin Hart, did an excellent job teaching the course. He explained the course material in a very clear manner and provided the class with further resources for practice. The only weakness of the course was that the online quizzes were given on new material and often difficult to understand (but even this was remedied by giving students several chances to retake the quiz).

            "\u00a0Definitely. It teaches you to think through math critically and conceptually. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students. The concepts discussed are generally very visual and applicable to the physical world. It is difficult, but appropriately so.  After mastering the techniques through sufficient practice, this difficulty is seen as a positive. It becomes an obstacle conquered. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The course content was very engaging and so was my professor. The class was one I looked forward to and one in which I enjoyed learning new material. "
