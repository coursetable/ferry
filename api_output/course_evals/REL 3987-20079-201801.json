            "\u00a0Tracy has been such a blessing for our Practicum group.  She has been so open and supportive of each of our ministries, and she has created an environment where I've felt totally at ease.  Her reflections on my ministry have been so helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Enthusiastic, encouraging, non-judgemental, made our time together fun. Focused on relationship building. ",
            "\u00a0His knowledge and compassion and insight. Our group was wonderful because of his leadership. ",
            "\u00a0Good man. Who taught us about life experiences in the parish. \r\n\r\nGood man all around. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - valuable experience we could reflect on and from. \r\nWeaknesses - a bit too unstructured time in practicum. We could have investigated significant questions and common problems in the expanse of open time but did not. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: (i) very supportive of the group, (ii) genuinely nice person, (iii) tons of experience, knows everybody, generous with her time and support.\r\nWeaknesses: (i) I personally might have pushed people a little harder.  It's a fine line to do that and also be a supportive voice, but I think she might have taken a little more risk here.\r\nOverall: great.  I like her a lot.  Would reach out to her in the future for help. ",
            "\u00a0Alison was amazing. Her care and support of us was obvious and appreciated. She really helped make practicum a more enjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0He scheduled and organized our sessions well, facilitated discussion well, and was affirming, kind, welcoming, and insightful. More push back/constructive criticism would have been good. "
