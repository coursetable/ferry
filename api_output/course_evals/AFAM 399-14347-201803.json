            "\u00a0Since this class lies near the target of where my academic interest converge, I highly appreciated essentially everything that the class had to offer.  Although I had thought of several of the topics before taking the seminar, I was able to discuss them with other people and be introduced to readings that would powerfully re-articulate them (e.g. Adrienne Rich) and expand upon them in ways that I had not considered.  For example, Cedric Robinson is now probably one of my most influential authors owing to the way in which he manages to radicalize and extend the potential of Marxism by subverting several of its central assumptions and its historiography.  Where certain classes might assign long tracts of esoteric text that I force myself to scan with my eyes for hours on end and (perhaps) take notes on them, I would find myself taking extensive notes and writing down entire block quotes because I wanted to keep what I had learned for my own sake.  Rarely have I been given readings that I could read again for the rest of my life and would remain both relevant and thought-provoking.  On a more practical note, I feel that my ability to articulate my own thoughts has tangibly improved since taking the course, both in being able to express them to others and having the readings and the instructor able to expand upon others' arguments. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fascinating class that gave us the space to understand how capitalist logics of profit, efficiency, and property are intimately tied to the regimes of western colonialism in the Americas, Asia, and Africa. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the intersection between capitalism and systems of oppression like slavery, immigrant labor and domestic work. I learned a lot about capitalism and the way it functions to create and reproduce race. We traced this phenomenon from pre-Antebellum to today. I've taken several classes on critical race theory and racial inequities but none have made me think about the macro ways in which race operates. This course is densely packed with a ton of information. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read dense material thoughtfully and was forced to realize that rereading a sentence three times is sometimes just what is required to understand the information. ",
            "\u00a0I now understand how this capitalism system functions "

Rarely have I been given readings that I could read again for the rest of my life and would remain both relevant and thought-provoking.  As for areas of improvement, the main change I can imagine (and this is probably my own preference more than anything) is a slightly different direction for certain class discussions--in particular, for the final class meeting.  Aaron quite rightly affords us a great deal of power in guiding class discussion, but the often unanticipated reflexive pessimism of under-30s in late capitalism might have made some discussions more disheartening than intended.  For instance, the focus of the last seminar meeting was to imagine alternatives to capitalism, but I sensed the conversation quickly becoming lopsided into a general consensus that capitalism and white supremacy are too persistent and adaptable to be dismantled, which seems to defeat the purpose of the class and of any resistance to anything whatsoever.  I believe that this could have been an area of intervention by Aaron to balance the conversation, but it might have been a result of factors beyond his control. ",
            "\u00a0The class connected these themes over a broad history, beginning with colonial violence and the transatlantic slave trade, with the capitalist ideologies that exist in contemporary American society.\r\n\r\nIf anything were to be improved, I wish at some points Professor Carico was slightly more hands-on with discussions. He gave a lot of space for students to speak what they thought in a space where we were all treated as equals (which was a nice anti-hierarchical relationship to create) but at times the more extroverted individuals in the class could easily take hold of the conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This course had an amazing syllabus and Aaron is clearly very knowledgeable. However, students in the class clearly had varied levels of engagement - in part because some had a lot more experience with critical race theorists and abstract texts. So class discussions could be difficult to sit through as it seemed like two or even three different conversations were being had at the same time. The other weakness of the course is that the texts are very dense and can be hard to understand and Aaron uses language that doesn't always make the texts easier to understand. All in all, this course because of the syllabus and Aaron's deep understanding, has more strengths than weaknesses but it could benefit from a more cohesive group of students - cohesive in that students are on a somewhat similar knowledge level.

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to absolutely anyone.  It forces you to question any assumptions you have about capitalism and its accompanying systems of domination and exploitation, which is a precious resource at Yale where well-meaning people are funneled into doing things that are (a) utterly ineffectual or (b) actively harmful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the reading list of this class provides many eye-opening perspectives that give new vocabulary for students to articulate the political, economic, and social actions occurring in the world around us. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course! The syllabus and Aaron are amazing. Even if the class dynamic is lacking as a seminar, this class is definitely worth it because you'll learn a lot separate and apart from group discussions. Take this and prepare to have your mind blown. You will leave with a whole different perspective on the world. I promise. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a searing critique of our economic system that needs to be heard. ",
