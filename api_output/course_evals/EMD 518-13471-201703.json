I have never taken a class like this where we have the opportunity to discuss the biology, epidemiology, sociology, and ethics surrounding infections disease. The class discussion are interesting and informative. The homework assignment are relevant and promote learning. I don't see an aspect of the course that needs to be changed. ",
            "\u00a0Even though n=8 as a first-year, this was by far my favorite class at Yale. The material was extensive, covering STIs, HAIs, global infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and more. As an EMD student, you are enamored by the material for AT LEAST one of those units. It has greatly influenced my future research interests, and the notes were very helpful. Additionally, the class was incredibly engaging (the most out of any class I have ever taken), and it was a joy to attend. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, lectures were interesting, exams were fair, homework grading was a little nit-picky ",
            "\u00a0In a semester full of disappointing classes, this class was a diamond in the rough.  This was the only class that I looked forward to going to and learned a lot from.  It was very engaging and useful.  I really enjoyed a the topics of discussion and looked forward to our discussions in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class was fantastic! I learned so much this semester and enjoyed doing it. I wish I could have spent 5 hours a day in this course rather than taking any of my other classes. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I think this course did a great job of addressing the main global public health issues surrounding infectious diseases. It provided some historical information on each infectious agent and was very focused on trends in infectious disease over time and in diverse populations. I would classify this course as the centerpiece of the Epidemiology of Microbial Disease track because it truly did focus on what the track title describes. The class was very discussion-based in nature and prompted students to think critically about ongoing issues. I think one issue with this class however, is that it was mainly an epidemiology course but tried to squeeze in some info on the biological basis of disease. I feel like this was not emphasized very thoroughly however, and would do better to be split into a different class. PID1 would perhaps be more aptly named \"Infectious Disease Epidemiology\" because this was where 95% of the focus lay. A separate biology/biochemistry based course on biology and chemistry of infectious agents and pathogenicity would complement this nicely. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class of the semester.  Every session focused on a new pathogen which kept things interesting.  I truly cannot think of anything that would improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0By far the greatest strength of this class is the instructor.  Dr. Pettigrew made lectures interactive and posed critical thinking questions throughout lecture.  I gained an understanding of complicated infectious disease concepts because of her as well as the ability to ask better questions about why things happen the way they do in infectious disease epidemiology.  I liked the way the course was organized with lectures devoted to one specific disease/pathogen/concept. ",
            "\u00a0I love love loved this class! There was such a broad range of infectious disease topics covered that every student had a chance to find (at the very least) some lectures extremely interesting. Dr. Pettigrew encouraged us to all think critically about public health problems at hand and to try to approach these issues from a variety of perspectives. I thoroughly enjoyed this class. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of infectious disease, logical progression of concepts. Clear and easy to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-explored topics in depth\r\n-very interactive \r\n-lectures mixed with discussion\r\n-discussion was encouraged and allowed more in-depth exploration of relevant topics\r\n-exams were fair and tested main ideas\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-some discussion felt off-topic and thus some class time felt wasted \r\n- class sometimes went over time, making it difficult to make the next class, but this is more of a scheduling conflict ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was great and I highly recommend it if students are interested in infectious diseases.  The course was structured very well.  Dr. Pettigrew was very engaging.  The course was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. The material was wide ranging and tied in beautifully with what we were learning in epi and stats. The slides were perfect at being informative but not listing every single point, which kept us engaged and taking notes and listening. This was a really discussion based class, Dr. Pettigrew often asked us what we thought about an issue, or to answer a question based on what we thought or knew and then went over what she had put down. I have a background in microbiology, but a lot of this wasn't repeat information for me because it was very tied into the big picture of microbiology public health, and epidemiology, instead of being focused on the straight biology or medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course. Learned a lot ",

            "\u00a0This course was excellent. I was very engaged in the course which offered very interesting readings and allowed us to dive deep into topics on a number of different pathogens.I appreciated the inclusion of discussions in the course as it was only class I had this semester that did so. I looked forward to going to this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing. I learned quite a bit in the class about super fascinating diseases. Dr. Pettigrew is a fantastic instructor. She presents the material very well and I love the lecture/discussion format. Her exams and assignments are fair and allow us to fully demonstrate what we have learned. I wish the class had not been in Winslow because I was often cold or somewhat uncomfortable. ",

            "\u00a0This is a very strong course because it relies heavily on student engagement in the conversation and lecture. If it were not for this constant engagement, I would not have learned as much as I did. I strongly believe that more Yale graduate courses should be styled this way with an intimate lecture that relies on students completing the required readings and then participating heavily in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent survey class.\r\nTiming of lectures got a little confusing with course matter running over into the next class, but I suppose that's just a natural limitation of incorporating discussion into the class and overall it's not a big deal at all. ",
            "\u00a0This course was my favorite by far this semester.  The review of each infectious disease was interesting and extremely relevant to the EMD concentration.  I was excited to complete the readings and attend class each week, and the homework was appropriate to the themes and content of the course. "

I love how she promotes class-wide discussion that allow students to learn from each other. She has made this class so enjoyable because of how she presents real world problems with real world solutions and real world challenges. I feel more prepared to enter the field of public health now because she has encouraged me to approach a problem from all angles. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses at all, an all-around fantastic instructor. She is incredibly smart to the point where it might even be slightly intimidating, but responds really well to any and all student questions. Her lecture style is very engaging, she does not have favorites, and her passion for infectious disease is infectious (no pun intended). Even while covering a unit she isn't enthusiastic about (Staph aureus), she still makes the unit a ton of fun. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is a great instructor. She is very engaging with the students and strives to get everyone involved. Also, she listens well to students' responses and gives each one a good deal of consideration and comment. She also poses poignant questions about the public health implications of each topic and prompts students to think from a public health professional's perspective about what the best course of action would be in a given epidemic crisis. She does not water down the complexity of these issues, and is sure to consider economics, ethics and politics when evaluating them. \r\n\r\nThe one thing that I was not completely satisfied with were the biological explanations. I think that, in many cases, they were oversimplified and glossed over in such a way that was frustrating for those with a background in these areas. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Pettigrew is what made this already interesting subject matter all the more enjoyable to learn about.  Her sense of humor and personality were infused into the lecture which made the hour and twenty minute sessions fly by.  I appreciated how her class was a mixture of both lecture and discussion and that she was open and responsive to the various perspectives that students provided.  She clearly cares deeply about the subject at hand and it not only shows, it is infectious. ",
            "\u00a0Like I said before, Dr. Pettigrew was excellent.  She is the best instructor I had this semester and wish she taught more classes.  The only issue I had, which was virtually out of her control, was that a few students tried to answer every question and took away from others' ability to take a second to think about the answer and come to a conclusion ourselves. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing professor! Led very interesting class discussions, gave clear and engaging explanations of concepts, considered different perspectives. Needs to slow down a lot though. She mentioned at the beginning of the course that we should tell her if she's going too fast, but every time someone would ask her to go back to the past slide she seemed annoyed, so it felt like a better idea to just try and keep up instead of saying something. I think it would be useful to cut down the amount of material covered in each lecture, because she seemed to always feel the need to rush to cover everything and usually had some slides left over to catch up the next lecture, etc. So each lecture started with the end of the past lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-very interactive, she really encouraged discussion and her stories and side notes were very interesting and at times entertaining\r\n-She really pushed the students ways of thinking and to think more comprehensively in terms of real life situations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-does tend to talk faster at some points, though this did not severely impact my learning ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Pettigrew was very engaging and very fair.  She was willing to provide final exam options to relive student stress, but I worry this may have given some students an unfair advantage over others.  Dr. Pettigrew learned the name of her students and cared about their education. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Pettigrew is without a doubt the best professor I had this year. She's extremely knowledgeable, dry and witty, and approachable, but you can tell she means business. She asked more from us than just sitting there listening; we had a lot of group discussions and she asked us a lot of questions. She didn't just read straight off the slides, she knows her stuff and made it a dynamic and engaging class. I truly enjoyed learning from her. ",

She was also very helpful in office hours. ",

She is extremely open-minded and personable, which creates a very comfortable and accepting atmosphere. I have great respect for her and what she says and I believe the class felt the same way. The only suggestion I have is that she takes a little more time to go over biological mechanisms/pathways. ",
