            "\u00a0This course was very thought provoking about the type of leader I want to be ",
            "\u00a0An amazingly unique understanding of what leadership is, what it entails, how leaders are made. The class is firmly based in some very philosophical ideas around leadership and gradually builds towards more tangible real life examples. By forcing students to dig deeper inside themselves, it forces them to make an effort and look from a different perspective at what makes a great leader and how by striking the right balance between delegating and taking on responsibility and accepting initiative one can attempt to become a change-driving leader. ",
            "\u00a0How to review decisions to draw crucial leadership lessons every day ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into how to better learn from people outside of my field by being in a learning environment with people all across the university campus. I was able to move my understanding of leadership away from merely anecdotal to practical, situational, and adaptable understandings of how to lead when leadership is needed in various environments. ",
            "\u00a0Team building, meaningful applications of history, communication, presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount throughout this course. I became better at thinking on my feet, at presenting my insights, questions, and thoughts, and I became more confident in both these tasks. More importantly, though, I learned about myself. Not only as a leader, the areas I need to grow in and work on, but as a friend, a partner, and a person. ",
            "\u00a0I have some really solid takeaways that are quite personal. The course is meant to be a personal reflection exercise, and I did find some key insights in the process that I value. I don't think I necessarily picked up any skills, but some interesting personal concepts and a lot of history about the Civil War. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about how I would address crisis, failure, diversity, etc. The most beneficial portion of this course was accumulating my thoughts from the readings, discussions with classmates and instructors, and field trips to write the failure and leadership philosophy papers. ",
            "\u00a0Ways to be a more effective leader in the future ",
            "\u00a0I developed an insight into challenges I will face as a leader, both tactical and moral. Through the shared experiences of my classmates, I had the opportunity to learn more about possible ways to face these issues, and we learned from each other's mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0Leadership in ancient and modern times, analytical approach to leadership ",
            "\u00a0I had no engagement or exposure to many of the examples of leadership we discussed (starting off with Plutarch) which I am looking forward to learning more about in the future. Understanding the different skills leaders from history employed given their contextual environment in which they operated made me realize leaders need to continuously self-assess their situations and adapt as appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0The insight I got from this course is deeper than this evaluation will be able to assess. It is an incredible course. I learned how to self-evaluate, how to recognize even the small moments in every day situations that present themselves as opportunities to lead. I learned that leadership is a conscious choice. I learned how to participate in a \"Situation Room\" and what kind of energy and maturity it requires. I learned the non-academic aspects inherent in leadership that I hoped to when I set out for graduate school. I practiced and improved my writing. ",

            "\u00a0I personally did not like the 2 semester format to the course, I feel like it detracted from my focus on the course ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- General McChrystal and his personal effort and involvement in the class including candor and real life stories\r\n- Openness and willingness to share, disagree, challenge without the fear of offending or being offended\r\n- Students in the class\r\n- Guests\r\n- Readings\r\n- Forcing students to take a really deep dive into what leadership means to them and what kind of a person do they want to be\r\n- Active and constructive feedback culture both among students and between students and lecturers\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Some classes lack structure and the discussion tends to go off on a tangent\r\n- Gettysburg trip - not really a weakness but given so high expectations it felt somewhat disappointing\r\n- The fact that the class was spread over one full year - would probably be better in the old one-semester format ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: college/grad/professional school diversity\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: times during the year when classes very spaced far apart made if difficult to stay plugged into the work and leadership learning state of mind \r\n\r\nImprovements: more feedback between students on each others leadership potential and qualities, more consistently spaced meetings while still keeping it over an entire year ",
            "\u00a0Course is really well done. I would have liked more simulation experiences like the Cuban Missile Crisis. ",
            "\u00a0It should be 1 term, 2 terms were way too complicated. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course achieved its objectives very well. I thought the combination of seminar classes, field trips, and happy hours allowed us to maximize what we got out of the class. I enjoyed how the course was set up and all of the readings and class discussions in particular. I do think the course should be a full year, but I think more meetings would benefit the group. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Discussion style. Diversity of students. Informal team building exercises. Simulations (more of this, please). Some great readings on the list (Team of Rivals, Why We Can't Wait)\r\nWeaknesses - \r\n1) The schedule is not great. Long periods without meeting and then 1 week with three sessions - none of which directly relate to one another. It could feel jarring. If that is inevitable, I would prefer to have the 3 sessions/week thematically grouped so that sessions are continuous and feel less disjointed. Some topics really needed more than one week - Team of Rivals was a massive book, 2 hours was not enough time to unpack it! Also, the optional movie nights were not really constructive. A better way to bridge the absences may be to have team building exercises, trivia nights - anything engaging.\r\n2) I think the syllabus/readings need updating. There were weeks where the bulk of the reading was not covered, and felt out of date. In general, discussions about books/chapters were far more fruitful than about articles. I would cut most of the latter and add more of the former. \r\n3). More access to instructors or some feedback. At the end of the course, I don't know if the instructors knew my name by my face to be honest. It's a small class, and the instructors are at the table with us. But they feel quite far away and inaccessible still for most of the students. I think it would be valuable to have some intentional space for conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the instructors are good and ask provocative questions.  The simulation at the McChrystal Group HQ was great.  The reading list was also very good. \r\nWeakness - sometimes having the class so spread out made it challenging.  During \"Leadership\" weeks where you had three classes, it was almost intolerable.  But then sometimes you wouldn't think about the class for weeks at a time.  I wish there had been better/more opportunity to engage with the instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really great opportunity to learn from two outstanding leaders with interesting experiences\r\nWeaknesses: the year-long format was not particularly conducive to us getting to know Stan and Chris, which is a reason why many students take the course, though it did help with class cohesion; if the course continues to be a year long, I would suggest a greater balance in workload between the two semesters (two 12 page papers in one semester vs. 2 shorter papers in the other semester was a bit skewed); too heavy a focus on military history and leaders; class composition could use a bit more diversity in terms of professional experience, schools, and nationality. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the diversity of experience brought into the class. I also enjoyed how Stan and Chris led seminars, posing challenging questions and ensuring we all got an opportunity to share. One weakness was the difficult of chaining lessons together due to the spread out schedule. ",
            "\u00a0The idea to split the course between 2 semesters is not a good idea. Bring it back to how it was - one focused semester. ",
            "\u00a0The opportunity to bond with our classmates early in the course during our trip to Alexandria was an incredible catalyst for developing close relationships throughout the course. \r\nThe course was split with two 10 page papers in the Fall and 2 4 page papers in the Spring, it might be a better balance to go 10 and 4 per semester. There are additional classical examples of leadership that could provide additional context to the Plutarch readings--Thucidydes History of the Peloponnesian War, Gates of Fire (not a classic but could serve as a modern interpretation of classical characters), etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: A unique course taught by exceptional leaders themselves. This course demands a lot of you, and in return, when you meet those demands, it provides you with the powerful realization that you have the capacity to meet those demands. The readings are great. The trip to DC and Gettysburg are unforgettable. Brings people together from across Yale. The comments they provide on the papers are extensive and extremely helpful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a year long for the first time, which made it difficult to maintain class cohesion during the long breaks in between sessions. McChrystal was able to make it to maybe half the sessions? I thought that was a major bummer.  My class this year had almost no racial diversity (no african americans.. which made for what some us thought was an awkward set-up while we spoke about the need for more diversity in the board room, in silicon valley, etc.) Not sure how to fix this since the application process seems to be blind, and rightly so.

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to a student that would like more of a military perspective on leadership ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have ever taken, and it's not close. A must-take ",
            "\u00a0This is THE leadership class at Yale. If you are not afraid of a lot of hard work and fancy a challenge of taking a deep look inside yourself perhaps even of facing some questions you might not want to answer about yourself - then go for it. Remember to always be on time and always be prepared and always give it your best. This class will teach you to respect others' effort and to give them your best effort in return. A lot of work, a lot of hard questions but so worth it. However, if you are hoping for some slacking and easy time - this is not a class for you. You've been warned! ",
            "\u00a0Yes as you have the opportunity to meet and befriend incredibly influential people in this course that you would have not otherwise had the chance to get to know. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Taking this class was the best decision I have made while at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you make the most of it. This class is only valuable if you make it valuable. At the end of the day, you won't have anything concrete to show - it should be an exercise in self-reflection in the context of historical case studies. You have to buy in to the value of that process in order to find it useful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  The personal reflection that this course required I think it essential for people who want to make a difference. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0If you get in definitely take it. Some weeks can be a lot of reading, but if you plan ahead it's not difficult to manage. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended to students with a military background ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This class offers a great opportunity for students from across the university to get to know each other, learn from each other, and develop with each other while discussing a great topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. No other course that I am aware of offers the kind of learning opportunities this one does. "
