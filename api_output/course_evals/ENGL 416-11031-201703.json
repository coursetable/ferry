            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the social context in which the literature of the latter half of the twentieth century was produced. ",
            "\u00a0In such a small seminar, I felt comfortable participating in class discussion. I was eager to contribute to our conversations about the texts because I felt that everyone approached the class with a similarly high level of engagement. I was exposed to a diverse group of authors that challenged my conception of what it means to be a British writer. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of the changing attitudes in Britain since World War II, Britain's place in the world, responses in literature to geopolitical and economic changes, interaction of form of literature with function and reception, understanding of unique relation of colonies to England, acquaintance with far right developments in England and questions of belonging or lack thereof. I also became a better writer with the guidance of Professor Phillips and by reading texts in part with the perspective of a fiction writer. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course with incredible syllabus. You'll read one book a week and it's enjoyable work. Class discussion was interesting (but likely depends on the people in the class), and it basically felt like an advanced book club, where you read cool books and get to talk about them. \r\n\r\nYou'll become better at thinking and discussing more recent British fiction with its interactions with history, race, class, and gender. This class made me more aware of all the nuances associated with \"Britishness.\" "

            "\u00a0I wish that (given this is a senior English seminar) we stayed closer to textual and line analysis, rather than historical context. \r\nI also would have loved more literature from the past two decades, to get a better sense of current British literature. \r\nThe title is a bit misleading  the course focuses on a number of kinds of literature, including poetry and plays, not just fiction. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Phillips was great at framing the context for the literature we read. I think there should be more secondary reading and more books from the twenty first centuryit is a contemporary fiction class, after all. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course! The segments into which the class is thematically arranged work really well; the texts are amazing; Professor Phillips is excellent. I wish that we could have read one or two more works. I liked the amount of background context with which we approached each text and also the inclusion of technology into our classes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the course had an incredible syllabus with a diversity of British writers and a nice mix of genres. Class discussion was interesting and chill, so I never felt too stressed or too bored by what we were doing. The workload was actually pretty good for an English class--mostly reading, a presentation, and a short midterm paper and a final paper. \r\n\r\nThe only weaknesses I can think of are that 1. the final paper took forever and is not for the faint of heart - 20-25 pages is MASSIVE. and 2. the class discussion completely depends on the makeup of the class. I'm glad Professor Phillips gives many opportunities for students to lead discussions, and most of the students were interesting speakers, but I can imagine how this could become a problem in weaker seminars.

            "\u00a0Yes! Its imprtant to have a view of English literature since 1950. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to both English majors and non-majors. The syllabus includes a wide variety of texts from across the globe and offers a wholistic view of contemporary British literature. Class discussions were always fruitful and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class and whatever else Professor Phillips teaches. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Fantastic syllabus and reasonable workload (but beware of the final paper - it's enormous). You'll read one book a week, which is the best kind of homework. Class discussion was interesting (but likely depends on the people in the class), and it basically felt like an advanced book club, where you read cool books and get to talk about them. Professor Philips is great and took us out to dinner once. He's a great discussion leader and very respectful of students, which made the class so much more enjoyable. Highly recommend to English majors and non-majors alike. "
