            "\u00a0I felt like I learned much more about the different elements of fiction, how they operate together, and how constructing each of them is complex. ",
            "\u00a0Got the opportunity to write short stories! ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me how to write fiction. I had never written creatively before taking this course and the entire program allowed me to develop a process for developing non-academic prose. I also learned how to engage with a writing workshops and write constructive criticism for my peers. Perhaps most importantly, and also most surprisingly, this course introduced me to an excellent body of short story writers! I reveled in the opportunity to read the likes of Rachel Cusk, Raymond Carver, and Flannery O'Connor. What an absolute joy. Professor Spargo has constructed an excellent syllabus that allowed me to hone my skills as a writer and a reader. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about how to write fiction and how to read it carefully. More than anything else, I've gained a better understanding of the mechanics of short stories -- the way that plot is structured, how characters are introduced and developed, the role of foreshadowing, setting, etc. I definitely improved my writing overall and also learned about several new authors whose work I had never read before. ",
            "\u00a0This course serves as an invaluable introduction to some of the best short fiction and to a workshop environment. Really fun class! ",
            "\u00a0I gained many skills from this class since it was workshop-based, including how to craft components of a fictional story like a consistent point of view, or at least keep it in mind while constructing a story. "

            "\u00a0I wish there was more opportunity for revision, and honing in on a particular piece. ",
            "\u00a0strengths -- workshop structure enabled critical thinking about peers' and own work; weakness -- how non-peer stories were discussed; could have been a more sizable portion of the class ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course. There's little I can say in the vein of criticism. I learned a lot and got a lot of out of the class. The professor and the syllabus are both very strong. Professor Spargo is brilliant. The readings, exercises, and longer assignments are stellar. If I had to think of an area of improvement, it would be the workshop itself. At times, conversations could stray from the text. Students also had a tendency to echo each other instead of submitting new ideas. This is perhaps more an issue of the class composition and less about the way in which the class is run and organized. However, I always found that speaking one-on-one with Professor Spargo was far more helpful in improving my writing than engaging in the workshop process. Workshops felt most effective when Spargo was in control of the conversation; discussions could often derailed when members of the class began speaking in long monologues, often concerned with small details of little consequence. That being said, I assume that writing workshops are generally challenging to facilitate and I generally enjoyed the opportunity to learn from my peers. This point aside, I enjoyed this course immensely and couldn't recommend it more. ",
            "\u00a0We spent a disproportionate amount of time workshopping student stories. I would have liked the workshop portion to be more organized -- at times it felt rather hectic, and it almost always seemed to go on longer than it needed to. I would definitely have liked to spend more time discussing the stories we read by outside authors. \r\n\r\nAside from that, I thought the course was structured well. Our readings weren't overwhelming and were always useful. Two stories and a revision felt about right. The short exercises were generally useful, though I wish that I had received feedback on them. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the workshops went on for a really long time. We almost always ran over class time. I think it would be better if the professor had a strict time limit for each workshop. I also loved this class so much and wish I could have done even more writing--maybe it should meet twice a week? ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that all students got an opportunity to revise their writing based on very, very detailed feedback from other students. This feedback, combined with the skills we learned from analysing great writers writing, really improved how we wrote and how we thought about writing. The only weakness is that we had to print so many pages each class. "

            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0yes bc Spargo is great! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class! I had never written creatively before enrolling in this course. Throughout the semester, I grew as both a reader and writer of fiction. I'd also recommend taking this with Spargo. He's excellent and will challenge you in fresh ways. He's extremely critical and won't tiptoe around bad writing. However, he really wants his students to succeed and will support your growth as a writer and will be very helpful along the way. He always makes himself available for students and is an excellent resource for anyone hoping to improve their creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in learning how to write fiction, ENGL 245 is a great course. There's a fair amount of work since you'll be reading student pieces and stories by professional authors every week, and there are several short exercises along with the two short stories. But you'll learn a lot if you put in the necessary effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's really fun. The readings are great and the workshops are engaging. It will push you to write, but it's not overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, regardless of your major. Thinking about writing fiction will challenge you in many ways, because you will  realise how difficult it is to conjure a whole story entirely from scratch. You will see tangible improvements in your creative writing and how you approach it. Also, you will love the Professor, who is incredibly charismatic and makes the classroom a very positive environment for workshop discussion. "
