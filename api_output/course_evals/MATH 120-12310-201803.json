            "\u00a0not much, as I had already learned multi in high school. ",
            "\u00a0Multivariable calculus; lots including but not limited to vectors, double/triple integrals, line integrals, surface integrals, integrating over areas/volumes, etc. I think my professor in particular taught in a way that made me think more fundamentally about why the math works in the way that it does (especially geometric illustration/interpretation/meaning of integrals) rather than just \"here's the formula,\" which was great. ",
            "\u00a0Math 120 is a very fast-paced and hefty course. There is a lot of material covered, which I found to be very difficult, however, my professor was incredibly helpful and the coaching program was very dedicated. ",

            "\u00a0Our professor was really kind and approachable which was definitely necessary. This also won't apply to most people but this class had a lot of parallels with my physics class and I had an easier time in physics because of that. However, I have one major grievance. Whoever controls MATH 120 enrollment allows in people who have already taken this class in high school. There were first-years in my section who would come to class having already learned everything we were doing that day. Some kids would sit there and ask questions about complicated proofs and things like that (weird flex but okay) while I was struggling to follow the example we were doing. The average for both midterms was an 85...that's really high for a STEM class. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly psets are the greatest strength of the class, in my opinion, they provide a good opportunity to review and crystalize information from the lecture. However, a semester is a very short amount of time to teach material this complex and difficult, especially for students like myself who placed into 120, but did not take any multivariable calculus in high school. I struggled a lot in the course, but I never really felt like it was due to a lack of mastery of the material that was in 112/115. If I could suggest anything, it would be to make a two-term sequence option of math 120, similar to how math 112 has a 110/111 two-term counterpart. Ideally, it would be for students, mostly first-years who place into 120, and feel confident in their knowledge and skills from single-variable derivative and integral calculus, but would otherwise be overwhelmed when thrown into a 120 class in which most of their peers have taken multi in high school. A two-term sequence would be better suited to ease them into their first math course at Yale, providing a more appropriate pace for students who are ready for the material of multivariable calculus but haven't already seen it before. We should recognize the fact that it isn't just the students placing into 112 that would be benefitted by a more academically supportive two-term math sequence, I know it would've helped me immensely. ",
            "\u00a0Well-taught, not too crammed or rushed material, not too heavy of a workload although could be just a little heavier for more review, excellent support from professors who held many review sessions but the peer tutor information (and other course information; I wasn't aware Ximera which was very helpful even existed until the last moment) was not very easily found due to the way the Canvas site was designed. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material which is useful, but, because of that, the course is also really fast paced so you have to concentrate for the entire class or you will get confused. It is in small classes which makes it easier to ask questions when you do get confused. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very fast-paced, and many of the students (unlike me) I found to already know most of the material. If there was a way to slow the pace of the class down, that would be good. I do appreciate the kindness of all the professors in trying to make sure the students understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course as is. P-sets could be shorter, they were repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0There was a great lack of feedback in this course which made it very difficult to recognize a lack of understanding and improve on the topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a surprisingly broad array of topics in a short time period. I feel the early topics were very well covered, but due to time constraints, the topics in the last three weeks or so felt fairly rushed. ",
            "\u00a0Very good in terms of resources and additional help available for the course. The Ximera modules made specifically for this course were incredibly helpful and useful for both learning the content and practising for exams. \r\nCould be improved if all sections of the course received handouts and lecture notes. These were given out only by certain instructors. "

            "\u00a0No. This course needs work. Like it needs so much work that someone from the YDN wrote an article about it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course only if it is a prerequisite. It is not fun, it is not engaging, it is not targeted towards making you understand something. It appears as though the aim of the course is to make the students familiar with integration by regurgitating formulas. I have an intuition that I will soon forget everything I've learned in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty much only if it's required for your major. It's not a class I would take otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0It depends if you want to learn multi or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but it depends on which professor. I would highly recommend my professor, and probably Sudesh after hearing all the rave reviews. The professor makes a huge difference in the quality of instruction and how well one learns the material. Make sure you remember at least how to integrate by parts and integrate by u-substitution, and trig derivatives, and you're good to take the class. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a great entryway for people interested in Math at Yale, but who didn't receive too much exposure to math in high school outside of Calculus AB/BC. Not a rigorous math class though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very good foundation for multivariable calculus, and the sheer number of students enrolling in it means there will always been resources available for help and practice. "
