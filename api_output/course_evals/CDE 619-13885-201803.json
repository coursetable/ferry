            "\u00a0The topics on homework assignments are good and thought-provoking but lectures are convoluted and spend a tremendous amount of time going over equations and derivations rather than proper application of the models. I wish the homeworks were actually graded and that the course focused more on them. The statistical programming language used is GLIM which is challenging to read/interpret so I really wished there was a TA or someone to translate or review homework assignments in R or SAS. The lecture material just does not translate well to actual assignments or applications and the final reflected very little of the material. ",
            "\u00a0It was really cool to see how a lot of things I took for granted in Epi I and Epi II were \"proven\" in Epi III using biostatistical methods, and then evaluating those results with a grain (okay, more like a bucket) of salt. But I think a lot of the material went over my head, especially since the premise of the course was that most of the material wouldn't crystallize until months in the future... And I wish our homeworks gave us more space to be skeptical about data analysis and interpretation. ",
