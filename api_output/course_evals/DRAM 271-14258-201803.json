            "\u00a0The work for the class took a couple hours. That was great. WIsh there was more guidance. ",
            "\u00a0I preferred the majority of the workload being focused on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I would encourage Joey to split the class into groups himself, just because it makes life a little easier for everyone to not have the do the dance of not wanting to hurt people's feelings.  But the final project was a useful exercise. I almost wish it was spread out a little more with feedback given along the way so that the last class isn't just a festival of digging through the budget and pulling out each thing. It was certainly useful, but a little exhausting at times. I think maybe having a halfway point where we pitch a basic idea and get feedback would help us have a more polished presentation at the end. "

            "\u00a0It was generally scattered. Not having online access to materials is a huge problem. ",
            "\u00a0The class felt relatively fluid in how we moved from topic to topic, so the organization of the class felt secondary. I do wish we had access to some of the materials electronically, such as PDFs of some of the documents or including all of the details for the final project on the Canvas website. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the course was good. The materials were not shared on Canvas and were only available in class in print form. ",
            "\u00a0All good! I think a little more planning on how long each thing is going to take would be good. I loved going into the budget in so much detail but I felt like we lost some time on other subjects. "

            "\u00a0Joey is a really interesting, experienced guy, and I found him very engaging. However, he could definitely use some instruction/development on how to create a syllabus / ensure learning. ",
            "\u00a0Joey teaches by storytelling, which was helpful when learning about an industry I have little knowledge about. I did notice at the first class session that Joey spoke at the class for 45 minutes before having the students introduce themselves - I would have appreciated introductions happening at the start of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Joey is a nice guy with a lot of energy. He has a lot of knowledge about commercial producing to share and I appreciate that he made room for discussion in one class because he tends to talk at the students for most of the lectures. ",

            "\u00a0When we met the two advertising professionals in New York, I was disappointed that they didn't ask us to introduce ourselves. They talked for nearly two hours without knowing who they were talking to. We learned mostly anecdotal things about the marketing and advertising for A Gentleman's Guide, but I didn't learn tactical things about marketing a commercial show. ",

            "\u00a0I wish we had more time to go through the budget and recoupment charts and could have even a blank template to work with for the final project. It was good to see and work with a commercial budget but it was tricky without knowing the terms of the Broadway union contracts and the current market rates of things since Gentleman's Guide is now an older example. ",

            "\u00a0I understand not wanting to share budgets online, but I think a blank template could go a long way. It would also be easier to set the Saturday class in advance of the semester so that supervisors and students could accommodate a Saturday class well in advance. ",
