            "\u00a0Over the semester, I learned about volumes of revolution, improper integrals, sequences, series, parametric and polar functions. The class covers much of the material from AP Calculus BC but much much faster! I took AP Calculus BC and did well in it, but still found the class quite fast. ",
            "\u00a0I barely learned anything that I did not know from AP Calc BC ",
            "\u00a0Calculus of integrals and series probably took up most of the course.  Though most of my actual learning for these topics came from youtube videos. ",
            "\u00a0I took Calculus AB in high school, so my first instinct was to continue on with Math 115 because it is equivalent to a high school Calculus BC class. I did not realize that a lot of people in my class had already taken Calculus BC or even Multivariable Calculus. In the beginning, I thought I had made a mistake in taking Math 115 because everybody seemed to already know the topics being taught, but I soon realized I had made the right decision. To me, Math 115 was a good combination of review and challenging new topics. Of course, I had to do extra studying to be on board with the pace of the rest of the class, but it was well worth it. The weekly problem sets at times strained my energy and patience, but it is doable. I also learned (through connections with other Math 115 students) that not all teachers have equal teaching skills - I, fortunately, had a great teacher who could connect with is students while keeping the class on the right track. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a great refresher on topics covered in BC Calculus Whig was helpful since it had been a year since I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0Eh, just basic stuff you'd learn in every other Integral Calculus course. Not sure what else to say honestly. "

            "\u00a0I felt that this course had a lot more weaknesses than strengths. The teaching is pretty poor, and the flipped classroom doesn't work for a class of this type. There are a few professors out of the sections who are good. ",
            "\u00a0There were very few strengths of this course. Professor Landry was great, and super accessible. He made the class worth the time.Also, the tutors were very helpful. The class itself, however, was awful. The flipped classroom idea is an awful one. The videos are intolerable and get so frustrating to watch. By the end of the class, I couldn't handle watching them even on double speed. More often than not, they don't help answer the questions on the quizzes due before each class. The psets are unnecessarily long, and the exams are very difficult. On certain occasions, even the instructors talked about how the exams were unnecessarily difficult. If you have no prior calculus experience, this class will require a lot of outside studying. Overall, only take if you must and be prepared to not enjoy the class. Also, avoid watching the videos if possible. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that the flipped classroom model did not work because a 10 minute video could jot accurately convey an hours worth of material. Often, a question in the quiz would not be covered in the video, so I would have to look to the internet or the textbook to answer it. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom is a huge weakness for this course. There are virtually no strengths. ",
            "\u00a0I wasn't a huge fan of the flipped classroom. I felt that the videos were not helpful, and didn't give a comprehensive introduction to the material, which made it harder as the knowledge became cumulative throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I really disagree with the use of the \"flipped classroom\" to teach this course; even the teachers disapprove of the videos shown to the students. I feel that if the teachers had more liberty to teach the course as they pleased, then the students would be able to grasp a greater understanding of the subjects taught. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are in the schedule and pattern of the psets, that once you find a method to complete them, on your own, in a group, or using the resources available, it is manageable. However, some weaknesses are that the tests are not an accurate reflection of all that was done during the course of the year. This year especially, many of the instructors mentioned that the tests were harder than before, yet we were still graded as harshly. With the size of the course, it is sometimes hard to get direct feedback, as well. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped class format was a little difficult to work with. The videos weren't that helpful, so most of the classes were pretty much lectures, which was a lot more helpful in teaching us the material. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the flipped class format, though not everybody did. I think some more lecturing time in class would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Discontinue the \"flipped classroom\". ",
            "\u00a0This course was great but I was not a big fan of the flipped class. I felt like the material was covered much better during the classes than in the videos especially since sometimes the videos were almost entirely unrelated to the quizzes offered and ended up just wasting time. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of professors in this course could be improved. A couple of the professors that taught review sessions were difficult to understand or not effective teachers. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of the course are really the weaknesses of the Calc classes in general, regardless of the teacher. The exams are just really hard and the graders are NOT generous when it comes to partial credit. This makes it hard to feel like you understand the material and sometimes make you doubt that STEM is for you, but trust me, everyone feels the same way you do. But the the strength is that you WILL learn Calc, you just won't feel like it. "

            "\u00a0If you don't have to take this class for your major, do not take it. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you must.  If you have no prior calculus experience, this class will require a lot of outside studying. The material moves very quickly and topics I spent months on in BC, we spent a week on. The videos are awful and the flipped classroom idea is entirely ineffective. I hope they will change the format of the class soon. The exams are also pretty difficult and sometimes unnecessarily so. Overall, only take if you must and be prepared to not enjoy the class. Also, avoid watching the videos if possible. They will just get more and more frustrating. Recommend reading or skimming the textbook which has some useful tips and is generally helpful for concept learning. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this course if you need the math credit, need this level specifically, or know you already have a grasp on the material. The course moves quickly, and not everyone is at the same level of knowledge in math. ",
            "\u00a0Take 115 if you have to, it'll be a lot of outside work to actually study and understand the material. There are a bunch of resources to help you if you struggle, so the class is doable. ",
            "\u00a0It's important to learn these calculus skills, but it's not a particularly enjoyable class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although even if a student places in Math 115, I would make sure to have a very solid understanding of Calculus AB topics because the course moves extremely quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great math course for people who are not very well versed in calculus but still interested in it. ",
            "\u00a0Umm, most people who take this are STEM majors that need the pre-req. On that note, I can't recommend for or against this course. Everyone in it just has to be in it, plain and simple. "
