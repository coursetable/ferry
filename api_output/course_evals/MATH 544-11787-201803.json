            "\u00a0I learned about the basics of homology and cohomology theory. I got much more familiar with topology in general, and also with algebraic tools such as basic homological algebra. ",

            "\u00a0I loved this course; professor Minsky was excellent, and lectures were always useful to understanding the course. One change I might make is to go through more examples in class and do more proofs at home, as prof Minsky is particularly good at drawing nice diagrams and explaining examples. I did find discussion of proofs in class useful, but overall I'd be fine with more key pictures and ideas of proofs being explained in class with details left to the student, and more class time going through particular cases, as those were my favorite parts of class. I would also recommend possibly going a bit faster so we could cover cup products in cohomology. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been nice to have had prompter feedback on problem sets, and (I think more importantly) an extra problem set on cohomology and the Poincare duality. ",
            "\u00a0The course was generally very well taught, with useful examples mixed in with the more difficult formal material.  The one weakness is the lack of feedback; multiple problem sets were handed in with nothing returned, making it harder to study for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well organized and very well explained. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were amazing. The instructor did a great job working through definitions and theorems from first principles, together with the class. The organization and presentation of each proof is very clear. Examples are very reflective of tricky parts of a theorem or definition. The instructor is very generous with spending time with students and talking through ideas in class. \r\n\r\nGreat class! Can't think of weakness. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was excellent. The problem sets were just the right level of difficulty. I think the course could have been improved if lectures had gone somewhat more slowly. It was hard for me as a student who hadn't seen the homology/cohomology material before to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall, except that the schedule can be more stable: we experienced a few make-up classes towards the end of the semester, so it is a bit tough then. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, especially with Professor Minsky. Algebraic topology is a great starting point not just for learning about topology, but important constructions like cohomology which show up all the time in higher level mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would. The material is very interesting and fundamental, and especially if professor Minsky is teaching it this is a great course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. It's hard, and the graduate students are obviously taking it extremely seriously, but the material is exceptionally beautiful (sometimes even fun!) and Prof. Minsky is great. Doable if you haven't taken the undergrad course, if you put a lot of work into it. ",
            "\u00a0If a student has taken the undergraduate topology course, enjoyed it, and wants a challenge, I would recommend this class.  Only the most exceptional students or those with some topology background will succeed here. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great elective for a person interested in math to take.\r\nYair Minsky is a great lecturer and teacher, an excellent artist, and has a very strong command of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially when Yair is the instructor. The content is important: it introduces tools that have application in many branches in mathematics, and the lectures are clearly and enlighteningly presented. "
