            "\u00a0This course provided broad exposure to a wide variety of literature and opportunities to dissect individual texts in a clear and concise way. I also liked how we had the chance to learn from our peers/apply our understanding of philosophical methods through the usage of writing correspondences. Additionally, the final assignment was outlined in clear terms and we were given ample time and feedback to execute our final deliverable. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well structured and clearly presented. All the assignments were effective in allowing us to engage with the course material while also giving us a chance to develop our own writing and argument skills thanks to the extremely comprehensive and constructive feedback from Prof Dotson, which we received for all assignments. Prof Dotson also adapted the specific content of the course to suit the deficits of the class (determined during discussions in the first two weeks of classes) which demonstrated flexibility and a willingness to meet us where we were at. There were no weaknesses. I left each seminar feeling invigorated and excited to engage the following week's readings. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course and any course by Dr. Dotson to students at all levels, especially students in African American Studies. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. This class engages thinking on a level seldom required in seminars. We were exposed to and engaged with philosophers and knowledge systems that seldom make it onto syllabi - it's refreshing. But aside from that Prof Dotson takes the time to teach advanced reading and argument skills that are rarely constructively taught and developed by other professors. "
