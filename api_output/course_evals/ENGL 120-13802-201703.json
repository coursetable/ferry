            "\u00a0Not only did I build up a portfolio of writing that I'm truly proud of, but I also have a set of tools that I can use for the rest of my life when writing - whether that's cultural criticism, satire, or portraying people around me. ",
            "\u00a0Unbelievable course. Learned to read, write, and think in exceptionally different and unique ways thanks to Professor Strebeigh. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about writing different creative forms and got a read a lot of work by famous people. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be an incredibly close reader and mimic great writers' styles in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0My writing definitely improved with this course. I learned a huge amount about college writing and I learned a lot of skills and tricks for writing. I think it was a great course to take early to learn some of the basics of writing and give me a solid foundation. I think my reading of essays also improved, and I was able to dig deeper into subtleties that I had not realized before. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first writing class I took at Yale, and I had never before been asked to think about writing (both my own and others') like I was in this class. \"Reading nonfiction for craft\" was a skill I didn't even know existed, but this class does a fantastic job of teaching it. The feedback we all got on our own writing was amazing, too   Professor Strebeigh is so incredibly thorough and thoughtful in his suggestions and edits. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to work on a new type of writing - snappy, \"New Yorker-style\" nonfiction. We learned techniques by deeply examining how other writers have employed them. I learned to incorporate drama and surprise into essays on a range of topics. ",
            "\u00a0Much improved writing skills, even as someone who viewed themselves as a good writer in high school. ",
            "\u00a0From this course, I better learned what makes a modern essay exceptional. I learned how to write in a way that appeals to a large audience, and when I read other essays, I now know what an essay includes that makes it exceptional. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very effective at providing an overview of creative non-fiction from a writer's perspective. Prof. Strebeigh provides an extensive \"toolkit\" of tricks and techniques to use in writing all different kinds of modern essays. But perhaps more importantly, this class will teach you a very simple and effective technique of reading which can be applied to all kinds of writing; namely, as Prof. Strebeigh himself summarizes, \"if this is what you've got to do, what have you got to do?\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many writing skills, along with close reading skills, in many different areas of non-fiction writing. My writing in general improved as well, and the way we learned to look at what you need to do to be successful at any given type of writing can be applicable to any other type of writing. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me all of the key tricks that I need to craft a powerful, resonant piece of writing. It also pushed me to try different genres of writing. Classes demanded that I be absolutely present and think critically. One of the most important things I learned in this class was how to effectively build off of others ideas in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 helps you hone your writing skills by taking apart published pieces (eg. Orwell, Gladwell, Woolf, and old and modern New Yorker pieces), analyzing what the authors did, and then implementing those techniques in your own written pieces. The discussion sections of English 120 were the most entertaining I've ever had so far at Yale. Not only were the seminars filled with very insightful analysis of essays, but also they were filled with inside jokes and much laughter. 120 teaches you to pick apart, understand the pieces that go into writing, and then taking those pieces and reshaping them into your own draft and then final. It's an unbelievably helpful course to anyone who loves writing. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Small class size, broad range of essay types covered, and a high level of feedback from Professor Strebeigh.\r\n\r\nPotential improvement: All in all, this course is excellent. It would be helpful if we could read our peers' essays after they're graded and turned in, rather than just reading workshop ones. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Absolutely everything but most of all the teaching I received from Professor Strebeigh, as well as very interesting course material and engaging assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0The seminars are very engaging, but the one problem is that we would be assigned, for example, 10 readings but would only get through the first paragraph of the first one (exaggeration but true). We spent a lot of time doing VERY close readings. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to a lot of great writing and pushed me to think and write and new and original ways. However, I thought the criteria for each writing assignment was a bit vague and abstract, which could be a result of the fast pace of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was well-structured and followed the plan very well. I liked how we got to write different types of essays to practice every type. I also really enjoyed the workshops because I felt like they were extremely helpful. I don't think there were really any big weaknesses. I think that a strength would definitely be that I got a great amount of feedback that really helped me improve my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly can't think of any weaknesses  the structure of the class is perfect (more reading in the week(s) leading up to a draft week, fewer readings in a writing week). The pacing works really wellthere were a couple of essays that had a slightly faster turnaround, but I never felt particularly rushed (and we had one extension we could use). The actual content of the course is fantastic. The readings are fun and completely manageable in terms of quantity. ",
            "\u00a0This course is wonderful if you want your writing to become more clear and compelling, no matter what topic you're writing about. I received in-depth feedback on all of my pieces in a timely fashion. Class work itself involved deep analysis of texts which were almost always very fun and easy to read. The classroom was collaborative and supportive, but Professor Strebeigh does a great job of pushing students to strongly support their claims and develop complex analysis. In terms of weaknesses of the course, I don't have much to say. Sometimes I felt frustrated that we read several pieces for each class, but often only discussed one or two. However, the pieces themselves were very enjoyable to read and the reading assignments were hardly excessive, so I wouldn't really count this against the course. ",
            "\u00a0Extraordinary amount of feedback on every draft and finalthere's no way you get through this course without learning a lot about the way you write and how it can be better. ",
            "\u00a0The course is particularly strong in the way that it exposes students to different subjects. In doing so, students can discover their interests more. The course's weakness might be its very fast-paced style that doesn't allow students to ask questions during the seminar. Because the professor asks questions of the class so fast and controls discussions completely, it's easy for a student to get lost in the conversation, especially when the student can't ask questions during class. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 as Prof. Strebeigh taught it is exceptionally well-organized, with a manageable (and fun!) workload and a focused, yet varied breadth of styles of writing. Sometimes I wish each genre was a little less limited and there was room for a little more experimentation/freedom. ",
            "\u00a0This was the best course I've taken so far. The readings were interesting, and every day in class was engaging and thought-provoking. The feedback we received on essays was copious and INCREDIBLY helpful and thorough. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was the writing that we did outside of class and most of all the extremely thorough  feedback that Professor Strebeigh gave on our writing. I enjoyed classes but sometimes felt that they became redundant by the end of the term. Most of all I enjoyed the college teas that related to the writing we did in 120 and I really appreciated the 120 professors advertising those. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that you are exposed to many different written works and you are able to take techniques and knowledge from each of them and then combine them in your own essays. The discussion sections are also both fun and beneficial because together, you and your classmates and professor can dissect each of the published essays that you read in class. Another strength is the workshop portion of the discussion section, where each student has one week in which they print out one copy of their own written piece for each member of the class. For about 25 minutes, the class discussion is geared only toward helping the student author improve their work. \r\nOne weakness of the class is that you really need to be on your game at all times throughout the semester with this class. You are producing a final piece about every two or three weeks, with a first draft due date in between the finals. With this timeline, you need to be hitting deadlines pretty often, which can be difficult considering the creative aspect of the essays. If you are feeling writers block or a lack of creativity, this class can be hard. That being said, your professor and the essays will work to inspire you, and more often than not, I was able to find something to write about. It's a challenge, but the pay off of this class is enormous. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, and with all my heart. This class was my favorite class all semester, and one of the best classes I've ever taken. At the beginning of the term, I almost dropped the class because I didn't quite understand Professor Strebeigh's teaching/discussion style, but I am thankful that I stuck with it. The level of feedback he gives you on essays is truly amazing, and you come out of this course a much better writer than you could've imagined when coming in. This is the staple writing class at Yale, and for good reason. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, especially with Professor Strebeigh. Unbelievably rewarding and fun course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but just know it's hard to get a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is not afraid to put forth a lot of effort writing several essays in a short amount of time. It depends on the student's commitment to english. ",
            "\u00a0I think that if the person is planning on doing something English or writing related I would definitely recommend the course. I think that the course mostly focuses on personal writing and of course reading other personal essays, and so for someone who wants to write articles it's extremely helpful and beneficial. It also teaches broad writing skills that can be applied in many forms, but I feel like other writing courses could be more beneficial to people looking to major in other areas (science, math, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Take 120! And take it with Professor Strebeigh if you can. This class will change how you think about nonfiction writing in every way possible. The readings are fantastic and almost uniformly interesting (think New Yorker, NYT Magazine, Joan Didion, Virginia Woolf, etc)  I did the reading for this class for fun when I was procrastinating for other classes. The pacing and structure of the class work perfectly  5 essays (2 drafts each) with increased readings leading up to a draft week and then fewer readings during a writing week.  \r\n\r\nIn every class, you'll focus on one or two readings and you get to really pick apart what the writer does to make it \"work\" this is both super interesting and really helpful in terms of your own writing. You're encouraged to play around with techniques you identify in the readings in your own work, and at least in my experience, you feel yourself getting more comfortable with them as you go on.\r\n\r\nThe feedback you get on your writing is incredible  Professor Strebeigh is just so thoughtful and thorough. He'll give you a page or two of single spaced notes for every draft  only take the class if you really want to put in the work for every piece of writing, because I'd imagine you'd feel pretty guilty if you didn't.\r\n\r\nGetting to read your classmates' writing during workshops is also super fun, and even more so if your class really meshes like ours did.\r\n\r\nFor me, this was a life-changing course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who is looking to improve their non-fiction writing (or narrative-style writing more generally). Professor Strebeigh provides students with extensive and thoughtful feedback on each piece. I also found the workshop aspect of this course to be extremely helpful, as it allowed me to receive feedback from not only Professor Strebeigh but my classmates as well. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE, ESPECIALLY WITH STREBEIGH! It has been my favorite course at Yale, even if I haven't consistently gotten As on the papers. It's just so enriching; you learn how to appreciate compelling writing (there is a bit of a New Yorker fetish) and try to adopt the techniques. I had amazing, super-engaged classmates, and Strebeigh was always on top of things. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the work, although very demanding, is good, meaningful work. Students will feel accomplished after this class because they have pushed themselves to think more meaningfully. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of those courses that will teach you, for the rest of your life, how to read and think about and even write a non-academic essay. Professor Strebeigh is a wonderful teacher with a very well-defined method, which essentially consists of trying to find out how the author is tricking you. My only caution would be, if you're looking for romantic ideals like writing essays that are \"true\" or \"important\" or \"meaningful\", look for another teacher. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Take this class. Best class I have taken so far and you will learn so much. The skills you learn are applicable both to non-fiction writing and to any other area! Incredible class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Everyone should take this course. More than anything it is a course in understanding and appreciating good journalism which is a skill that all should have. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class in a heartbeat to anyone who loves to write -- in fact, I already do! The class is an enormous creative and technical challenge; sometimes you are being scrutinized for a single word in a single sentence. But this is all to help you improve your own writing - and improve you will! "
