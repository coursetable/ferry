            "\u00a0Close reading skills, close analysis of text as well as big picture understanding ",
            "\u00a0I learned to explore the structure and themes of texts such as Petrarch's poetry, Don Quixote, and Madame Bovary, as well as synthesize the way that those texts interact with each other and fit into a larger canon. ",
            "\u00a0The actual course was wonderful  great selections and interesting lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I was introduced to many great works of literature in Western Canon and had the opportunity to close-read selections under the guidance of my professor. Additionally, I learned how to write a stronger English essay. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about literature and how it progresses through time ",
            "\u00a0The main skill I learned was close reading. Last semester, I really focused on looking at overarching themes, but this semester I focused on language, syntax, rhyme scheme, etc. to glean deeper meaning. "

            "\u00a0Too much reading (esp for Omeros) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learn a lot, read fun and extremely good books, learn about a lot of Europe and where our idea of what is Western comes from \r\nWeaknesses: needs more women and POC representation, at times we go too fast (but that said it is tough given a course of this style ",
            "\u00a0The small seminar discussions worked really well when they were left to roam freely, less so when they were more structured by the professor, but sometimes that was needed. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were great, but sections really depended on your professor. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was the texts on the syllabus. Many works were very enjoyable to read and to discuss in class. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was that the course was very fast-paced course with lots of assigned reading materials, which made it necessary to skim the readings at times and not be able to enjoy the texts in their entirety. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the book selections. Maybe assigning less reading for Proust so we can absorb what we read would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the big strengths of second semester DS Literature is how diverse the curriculum is (especially when compared to the first semester) and yet how many currents of thought and similar themes we can trace through the centuries. It's a very different experience from the first semester, where we have mainly Greco-Roman works, then the Old and New Testaments, and then skip 1300 years to Dante.\r\n\r\nI personally did not like spending spending 2 weeks on Paradise Lost. It's a very complex work, but that extra week could be better spent on something else considering how little we actually got done with the work. I also feel like the readings could be cut a little bit. We didn't read the middle books of Omeros; I feel like a similar thing could happen to Paradise Lost. ",
            "\u00a0The close reading was very interesting and Prof. Manley was very knowledgable. However, the seminar was more of a lecture, and it was hard to interject with student opinions. For this course to be improved, this class should be student directed with some professor intervention. Nevertheless, the material for this course was very interesting. "

            "\u00a0Of course. DS is so so so so so worth it is absolutely awesome, you have great peers and great teachers, and you get a lot of feedback which helps u get better ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if the student was more interested in seeing how a wide range of important texts fit together in a conversation, less so if they were particularly interested in digging deep into a text like Paradise Lost. The former can lay an important groundwork for the latter, but I left the course feeling as if I could have dug a lot deeper into every text we read, which is the tradeoff of a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think that DS is wonderful; every Yale freshman should consider taking it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken DS first semester, you should totally stick around for the second semester of literature. I enjoyed it so much more and in such a deeper way than the first. It seems like the works that we read second semester just hit a different part of the heart and the mind. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because the reading material was very interesting. "
