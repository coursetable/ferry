            "\u00a0This class takes a very interesting approach to economics and history, analyzing how both influence each other. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned about several topics important in the growth of European countries after the first Industrial Revolution. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various aspects of European economic developments, including technological changes, fertility, mortality, patents, etc. Each class covered a new topic, so that no topic got old. I learned how to apply basic economic models to better understand what we were learning, such as Solow and Heckscher-Ohlin. We learned to critically interpret data from papers, but I'd say the class felt much more like a history class than one focused on economic modeling. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a way of analyzing and questioning historical data as well as historical narratives in a way other history classes have not taught me. This course focuses more on the reasons why something happened and the underlying assumptions of a certain occurrence than the actual events themselves (though these are still attended to). I learned more about both industrial revolutions and the courses of Britain, Germany, and the United States during these periods both regarding the directions of their general economies, militaries, industrial capabilities, banking sectors, insurance policies, and political policies (less so), as well as others. ",
            "\u00a0This class teaches short form analytical writing through three page paper assignments where you analyze an article from an economics academic journal, as well as more quantitative psets that cover main concepts in economics. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to challenge 'common knowledge' we have about historical events, and use economic analysis instead to investigate these claims. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor, interesting readings and discussions\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: problem sets not very incorporated to class discussion ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Guinnane, despite his many quirks, is a great lecturer. He is very engaging and clear.\r\nWeaknesses: This class is kinda weird. I think it prevents students from enjoying the class. You are presupposed to be very resourceful. Prof. Guinnane wouldn't answer any course-related questions via emails. He writes all these course-related documents that he uploads to Canvas, but wouldn't tell us that they exist in class.  The problem sets essentially don't count anything in the grade, but you need to write 3 papers that summarize other papers, the value of which remains a mystery to me. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is Professor Guinnane's lecturing style, which is very engaging. I also enjoyed covering a very broad range of topics. The readings were interesting and not too heavy. The midterm and final were very fair. One point of improvement could be that the three summary essays were weighted heavily (40% of the course grade), and it seemed like success on these essays depended more on familiarity/experience writing an economics paper rather than skills gleaned from taking the class, so it would have been nice to have a little more guidance and feedback on these essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by having more clear guidance before the midterm and final in terms of practice exams. I know Professor Guinnane doesn't like to give relevant practice exams because he believes it would give away part of the exam, but it is quite possible to do this, with a multitude of questions to be asked and only a few of them showing up on the test. Professor Guinnane was probably the greatest strength of this class, as he was very clear in lectures and in describing the readings. Although sometimes the readings could be dry, the discussions in class (we only had 8 people) were very good and he did a good job of engaging everyone. This is where I got the most out of this course. Also, the grading was very unclear and although he provided solid feedback on assignments, nobody really knew where they stood in terms of their final grade. This was all despite his very fair and generous policies of being able to drop one pset, count the worst paper as 10% instead of 15%, and having the midterm and final grade weights change depending on how you did individually. ",
            "\u00a0Its a bit hard to see the big picture until you get pretty deep into the flow of the course. At first, it seems like disjointed, inconclusive theories for a lot of random stuff that happened in the time period. The more you go on, the more you realize that while the content is important, the method of analysis and way of thinking about historical events is the true value of the course. Also, the psets are different from mainstream in that theres often no right answer. It depends on the assumptions you make and how you argue them. I wish this wouldve been made clearer before the first couple of psets. The midterm, too, had a poorly designed question that contradicted itself. To rectify the mistake, the professor assigned a seemingly arbitrary number of points to each student for that question. The final was a lot better designed, I thought. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures, and the lecture outlines that the professor gave out in advance. I would suggest the problem sets to be more relevant with the material we cover in class; the more mathematical/technical part of the problem sets were not covered at all in class. Some of the problem sets' topics were not covered at all in class, and they seemed to be more like puzzles rather than testing our ability in economic analysis. "

            "\u00a0This class was very challenging, but completing it was extremely gratifying. The topics discussed were interesting and Professor Guinnane is an amazing lecturer ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this class if you don't feel crazy about european economic history. This class is not set up to facilitate students' learning. If you feel like something is not right, drop this class before the deadline. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this class! Professor Guinnane is really engaging, and we learn about a new topic every day. I never felt bored in this class. The readings are interesting and the class is very well organized. I think learning about economic history is very important for all economics majors, and is something we don't learn about enough in Yale econ classes. It was really cool to actually be able to apply economic models to real data/ history. Professor Guinnane may seem intimidating, but he really wants students to succeed. Regarding the work load, this class is not a gut. There are assignments due almost every week, but if you put the work in to do the readings and papers, you will get a lot out of the class. If you are looking for an Econ elective that is more focused on history than models and is lecture-style, than this is a great choice. ",
            "\u00a0If you are really interested in economic history, especially pertaining to European history, definitely take this class. It offers you a new way of thinking about history and economics, questioning data and documents in a new way as you go along. The readings that stuck with me the most and the ones that I got the most out of were the ones that I had to write a paper on (even though this assignment was tedious, Professor Guinnane was correct in saying this exercise really works). This class challenges other economics classes by being more explanation-based with several correct answers rather than being about working around a set of assumptions. The only thing is that I am still unsure of what grades he gave our whole class and it didn't help that the economics department curve made no sense with 8 people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to students, especially those with an interest in the history of how the modern world came about and an understanding of how contemporaries dealt with the contentious economic issues of their day. This class also provides a decent history of ideas within 19th century economics. ",
            "\u00a0No; it was hard to connect what was covered in class with what was asked in the problem sets. I appreciated the regular assessments, as well as the uploaded answers to the problem sets, but it was hard to judge our standing in the course throughout the semester. "
