            "\u00a0I developed my comprehensive view of world economy in relation with foreign policy, and I think it is extremely helpful ",
            "\u00a0Skills:\r\n- Reading and critical analysis\r\n- Basic understanding of different economic approaches and global affairs ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me to understand how and why great powers often achieve their diplomatic policy goals and exercise larger influences over other countries by employing economic methods, instead of turning to military tools or annexing others territory, through focusing on the global history in the recent few centuries. The course gave me knowledge not only on historical cases of Western countries like Britain and Germany but also on those of China, India, and Japan. The course also enabled me to make comparisons and find similarities between past events and the current shift in global power games from confrontation by military means to competition by economic means. ",
            "\u00a0The historical preview offered in the course has provided a deep understanding of how the economic interests of states have shaped the decisions made by these governments. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The topics are very interesting and the workload was not very heavy.  I didn't find any weakness by far. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting content, good size to generate critical discussion; particularly enjoyed student presentations\r\n\r\nImprovement opportunities: Fewer books / more time spent evaluating each book to allow for more thorough read; go deeper on some topics instead of covering so much time but not going deep ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The course covered a wide range of historical cases in Europe, the Middle East, South Asia, and East Asia (and used a book written by a South American author). The focus of the course was not only studying past events but also analyzing implications for todays context. \r\nWeakness: Nothing ",
            "\u00a0The reading list was imposing and presented new historical facts that were missing from my education. "

            "\u00a0Yes, since the course is from both a economic historical point and a foreign policy side, which made it extremely interesting. Most of all, the instructor was excellent. I absolutely loved it ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course to all the students who seek professional or academic careers in international relations, such as mater students in Global Affairs. This course benefits both those interested in general global history since the 18th century and those focusing on todays geopolitical competition between big powers, especially the U.S. and China. This course was one of the best courses among what I took during my two-year study at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Anyone who is interested in understanding the economic reasoning behind wars, aids, national leagues, and the interplays of today's politics, then this course will help them, significantly. "
