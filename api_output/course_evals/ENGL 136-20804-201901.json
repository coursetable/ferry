I learned the history behind some of the great Gothic novels and also gained insight into the components that make them so great.

            "\u00a0strengths -- great books\r\nweaknesses -- the guest lectures weren't very engaging ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging professor and interesting readings. You actually want to do the work in this class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs were not that great. Everyone in my section received almost no negative feedback on our assignments, but our grades turned out terribly. Additionally, there were multiple times when the TAs instructions on an assignment differed greatly from the professor's instructions. \r\n\r\nThis course could be improved by getting better TAs. While grades are not everything, I feel like my TA discouraged my section as we were not good enough for high marks but received no feedback on what to improve. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fun, but I personally felt annoyed by the group discussions; they felt a bit pedantic, and I think that I usually take lectures when I want to engage with the material mostly via absorbing what the (brilliant) professors have to say, and want to take seminars when I feel like the material works better in understanding via discussion. Full disclosure, I often felt thrown under the bus when we broke into small groups in lecture to discuss because I hadn't read all of the material for that class, but that was because I privileged other classes in which I knew I'd have to discuss! ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths of the course are the readings and assignments. The lectures were fairly interesting, but I often found myself leaving class wondering \"What was the point of that?\". Towards the latter half of the semester, Professor Klemman began writing the agenda and the board which helped as well as the final summary of the class connecting all the themes at the end of the last session. ",
            "\u00a0It covered a wide variety of novels, essays, and engaged the student. There were movies and video clips to keep us interested. I liked the style of lecture and the freewrite at the end of each one to talk more about the discussion topic and think on your own. Sometimes there would be a lot to read in one week but it became more manageable. Maybe spend more time in smaller groups in class. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is that sometimes Professor Klemann would assume we all had the same hardcover copy of the book and would state a page to turn to, but most of us didn't have that same version or were using a PDF, so it was difficult to find the correct location (even with control f). Otherwise the class was very strong! The reading list, the creative final project, and Professor Klemann were all strengths! I really appreciated that Professor Klemann let us listen to the audiobooks because this let me do my readings while at work! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in the great reading list and professor as well as the varied prompts for the papers. The greatest weakness of the course was lack of time - I felt like we weren't able to devote that much time to some readings in lecture. I also think we could've spent less time on some writing skills. Overall, I just wish this course was a seminar instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lecture that has section to follow up. Very interesting topic and reading list. Engaging professor.\r\nWeaknesses: heavy reading. Lectures did not always seem completely in tune with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0There were some great times during the first half of the course where the professor would move around a lot and be very animate and have the class constantly breaking up to speak in groups which really helped me get comfortable with something I was not used to. But sometime during the semester, both of these things became rarer and I wish that was not the case. Without these things, the course seemed less exciting in a way. ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent lecture style writing course, and I think that the works that Professor Klemann has selected are all fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0There is not much engagement with the texts outside of the lecture if we choose not to write about them in one of our four assessments. I did enjoy the breadth of gothic novels that were in the syllabus though. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is definitely the reading list. The works we read were all soooo interesting and absolutely incredible and entertaining. They were all absolutely a joy to read. The unique papers were also really great. I loved that the papers were based on things we didn't dive deeply to in lecture because it gave a lot of freedom to write about something you're really interested in and to broaden your knowledge even more. The creative writing assignment at the end of the class was also a great change of pace and a really cool way to wrap up the course. I thought the lectures could have been a little more interesting though and less focused on close reading. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be sometimes hard to follow. Sometimes felt as though they jumped around from one topic to another without a super clear point. Very good course overall, interesting insights into the novels and a really passionate professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: diverse, interesting lectures; keen writing tips; great, thoughtful TFs\r\nWeaknesses: more discussion of films; more short stories / \"typically\" famous works ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course was more interactive and wasnt a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The texts on the syllabus were a strength, but the way in which the class is taught could be greatly improved. Sometimes the lectures did not apply to the readings, which made them less engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes not enough time to discuss the texts in length, personally not a fan of the creative project at the end ",
            "\u00a0Its suepr strong amd no weakness ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that Professor Klemann does actually care about what she is teaching and has many smart and helpful ideas, however they were actually hard to implement. I think that the TAs did not have the same vision for the class and the disjoint between lecture and section made me think this class could possibly be better as a seminar. Overall, I found the assignments to sometimes be misleading in terms of what we were being graded for, and feedback was unclear. I also do not think that all the books selected for the course ultimately contributed to what I was supposed to actual learn in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Too much material for the allotted time. The course could be improved by focusing more on each text and giving each book more time and discussion because as it stands, the material is quite interesting but many things are rushed/skipped over to get to the next book on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Reading literature, writing ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is a great introduction to the Gothic genre, and the professor is super engaging! The assignments were also structured to challenge you in interesting ways. One small way to improve could be to ensure that all of the works we read are actually discussed in sufficient enough depth, because we skimmed over a few. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures are always entertaining, combining video clips, book passages, and class engagement. Dracula and Frankenstein are must-reads; Get Out is a must-watch. Writing assignments could be easily tailored to students interests. Section was a wonderful, lively place to discuss the texts each week.\r\nWeaknesses: I did not enjoy The Monk that much... but honestly, I think that is the only weakness I have to report ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting, but had little to do with the assignments. The books were also engaging, and I wish we spent more time on them or read fewer books. "

            "\u00a0If you are looking for an interesting course and a fairly nice and fun writing credit, I would take it. However, if you care a lot about your grades, you may want to reconsider unless there are new TAs hired. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really fun class to take if you're interested in horror or Gothic literature. The lectures are interesting and the workload is manageable enough to offer access for those who don't normally engage with literature or writing. If you're an upperclassmen English major, you might find the material and lectures, at times, a bit boring; but I actually think that, in a lot of ways, it was refreshing and helpful to go back to the basics in terms of literary analysis and writing! ",
            "\u00a0For sure! As someone who rarely takes English classes, the class was very accessible and provided so much new information to me. Also, the ability to revise your final paper really gives you a chance to improve throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because it is such an interesting topic with a teacher who is really engaged in the course material (and TFs who were awesome in section). I love how different it is because it didn't just focus on gothic literature, it was horror and terror in general, so we watched Get Out and wrote an essay on it. It was interesting to see how each gothic trope tied together and throughout time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  It was a very interesting class with a great reading list. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good course to take if you are interested in the readings and are willing to commit to the high level of readings per week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was super fun and engaging! It was nice to actually enjoy my readings for once! It's also a great class for pre-meds because it gets the Hu credit for Yale but acts as a second english class for recommended pre-med classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone else who's interested in the books on the reading list and learning new ways to write. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. The topic was interesting, fun, and different. The professor was fantastic and accessible. The readings were diverse and well chosen. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. On a basic level, the syllabus, professor, and TFs were outstanding. The course material was extremely interesting and each TF was well engaged and focused on the student's learning. I learned so much in this class and truly feel that it was a necessary class for me to take as an English major. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. I think that Gothic literature is an exceptionally interesting topic, and if you are looking for a course that will improve your writing, then this is a great choice. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as a great writing credit that is taught by a knowledgeable and engaging professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student mainly because it's so unique. The assignments are just very different from any other class I've taken at Yale, and the reading is just very entertaining in general. The genre is very intriguing, and it makes you see horror or anything gothic in a very different way. It's definitely been one of my favorite classes at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really enjoyable course taught by a professor that was clearly passionate and knowledgeable about gothic fiction. I was really interested in the way different tactics we learned applied to classes outside of this (analytic reading, ways to create horror/terror, connections to a broader context, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a writing credit. It is certainly not an easy writing credit, but I think it was more interesting than a basic essay writing course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who want to read interesting and new works of gothic fiction, and receive specific instruction about writing essays. This course is really great for a person who wants to read a lot of material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is so interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No, as an English major, I wish that I had taken a seminar to fulfill the requirement. ",
            "\u00a0I would, it is a great writing course and literature class for non-majors ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0No. I really wanted to like this course and was excited to take it but ultimately found that it was disorganized and hard to engage with. There was nothing particularly challenging about this course, it was more suited for someone who has  never taken an English class on a college level or a first-year student. It does not seem to be representative of a Yale class, and it was not stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, interesting stuff. Not a hard class and the books you read are good classics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",

Youll engage with some texts that are wildly fun to discuss, write papers (and a creative project) on topics you enjoy, and even make new friends who share your literary interests, due to the peer interaction components of the course! ",

            "\u00a0Yes. I learned a lot and it was very fun to learn about horror. The reading materials were also very good. ",
