            "\u00a0Great instructor, amazing level of class! ",
            "\u00a0My sight-reading and transcription abilities developed exponentially. When I listen to a music piece, I effortlessly analyze it. I definitely have a better insight to music. ",
            "\u00a0Fundamentals of music theory, both notational and aural. Improved in sight reading and hearing intervals. Basic harmonic analysis and part-writing. Experience with composition. ",
            "\u00a0Although you will learn how to read music given no prior music experience, many students in this class already knew how to read music, but these students were in the class to learn more about harmonic analysis and music theory. You learn basic music theory (your standard AP Music Theory course). ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of minor and major scales, Roman numeral notation, and part-writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic music theory, including how to read music, form different types of scales, form different types of chords, recognize cadences, analyze harmony at a very basic level, and write melodies, harmonies, and bass lines. ",
            "\u00a0Basic elements of music theory - how to read notes, key signatures, etc ",
            "\u00a0Comprehensive introduction to fundamentals of music theory and composition including notes, intervals, key signatures, roman numeral analysis, and extensive composition exercises. Improved sight singing and ear training skills. Good balance between teaching of more mathematical fundamentals and background on different stylistic compositional paradigms. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I think it was a great class, given that I had no prior experience and never played an instrument before towards the end it was very hard to keep up. Very challenging and I am so glad I took the challange and got to learn some basic music theory! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Low pressure environment to learn and practice music theory, wide range of topics covered at an intro level. Small and fun.\r\nWeaknesses: Wide range of skill levels coming in, thus making the course difficulty hard to calibrate. ",
            "\u00a0One strength in this course is the opportunity to learn basic music theory if you did not learn music theory in high school. Another strength in this course is the flexibility of what to learn: you can learn aural skills, composition skills, and knowledge of different genres of music (in John Klaess's class, we emphasized western music and American vernacular music). I did not see any real weaknesses of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed that this course is taught section-by-section, so learning can be tailored to each group of students. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job providing the fundamentals of music in an understandable way with plenty of practice and application with real music.  A major weakness of this course was the amount of worksheet homework that was assigned in the first half of the semester.  I, and most people in my class, spent several hours on some homeworks, even though we all understood the concepts.  There were just a lot of pages of practice exercises assigned, and I don't think that many practice exercises were necessary. ",
            "\u00a0It went at a fast pace which had its pros and cons - main weakness was the busy work with the exercises from the textbook - it would take up to 4 hours on some nights ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-structured, very well-taught as small (~10 students) twice-a-week seminar, good combination of fundamentals and more creative compositional instruction, John Klaess was informative, understanding, and overall great professor. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: good pace for a person with some music theory background (like me), but could imagine that the pace is almost impossibly fast for someone with no background "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you are interested about the fundamentals of music - I highly recommend this class! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! The world of music is a whole different world that requires a different set of skills to master. Not only being able to understand music but also to create music (the part writing and composition projects towards the end of the semester) is very satisfactory. ",
            "\u00a0A good intro music theory course to formalize notational knowledge and add to intuition for harmonies. Probably best for those with some experience because likely there will be other students who have experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. If you have no knowledge on how to read music, this class is the only class that will introduce you to reading music. However, this class will move very fast for you. If you know how to read music, but have never taken a music theory class (or you did not learn much in the class) then this class is the perfect pace for you, and you will learn about harmonic analysis and part-writing too. If you already know music theory, I would recommend shopping MUSI 110, but also shopping MUSI 210 and 218. However, this class can also be useful to those who know music theory anyways because, in the case of John Klaess, you learn about other types of music, such as shape note music, American vernacular music, and other world music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Its a well-done introduction to music theory, and contains lots of useful information. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to enjoy music at any level.  Even if you don't plan on playing music, I suggest you take this class because I believe anyone who wants to enjoy music in their life should have a basic understanding of music theory. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in learning basic music theory - if you have no experience, this course will be a lot of work ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to any student at Yale! As someone who sings in a performing group on campus, this class was a great way to review and expand my theory and knowledge and understand the music I was performing from a compositional perspective. Would also recommend to any non-music majors/performers who are just interested in gaining an introduction to the more component elements of music (with the caveat that the class does move quite fast and is typically composed of at least half students with musical background). This class was a great intro, well-taught, and ran very smoothly. Convinced me to take more music theory and music history classes at Yale! "
