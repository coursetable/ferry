This is a great class to consider if you want to go into consulting or if there is a specific client you wish to work for in the future. Class does not meet every week and I was able to use that time to get ahead in my project milestones for the course. Guidelines for the presentation and report are helpful and clear. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses - NDA signing process was a nightmare. It took one month to get everything straightened out for some teams.
