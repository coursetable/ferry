            "\u00a0I felt like I gained a good grasp of the kind of thinking required of Philosophy and some aspects of philosophy that I might be interested in pursuing in the future. It was a good survey course! ",
            "\u00a0Philosophical analysis, exegesis. How to compare philosophers. ",

            "\u00a0The syllabus is wonderful as it includes a healthy mix of moral and physical philosophy accurately representing the progress of the timespan it covers. The paper writing is helpful as a means of organizing and expanding upon the ideas in class. I do think the physical philosophy becomes tedious if it is not connected so some real world considerations. Two months of \"is this a table?\" feels worthless if not situated in the context of their day or ours. ",
            "\u00a0The course is wonderful, but it shouldn't abandon analytic philosophy just as it's starting to get going. ",
            "\u00a0I felt it was a great course, perhaps more guidelines and hand-holding through the semester would have been a good thing. Especially with regards to the expectations of the essays. ",
            "\u00a0It doesn't make that much sense to study the philosophers chronologically as philosophy develops atemporally. For instance, studying areas or schools of thought makes more sense. For example, we could read Plato and Iris Murdoch one week after another and they would be in great dialogue with each other. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the books we read, the lectures were great, and the classroom discussions were also good. The latter could have been improvedI feel like it would have been better for the professor to actually teach us more rather than letting us try to figure everything out on our own. That said, the professor often did do this. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend DS as a whole to another student, however I think the lack of context and depth of discussion make it the least engaging of the triumvirate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Philosophy will make you smarter. Being pummelled repeatedly by so many successive philosophical approaches will make you more resilient. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0As with all DS courses, only take if you're an excellent reader. The main thing I took away from this class is an understanding of what's expected in philosophical writing, though I still don't feel competent in it. If you're ready for the work, you might have a fulfilling experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Fanastic course to build foundation in philosophical thought. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this courseI feel like more of a human being after having learned from these dead philosophers and my world is so much bigger. Plus, it is a part of DS, which has so far been the highlight of my Yale experience. "
