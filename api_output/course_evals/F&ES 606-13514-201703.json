While it's true that a model is only as good as the thought that goes into building it, I I would have appreciated more direct guidance on the logistics of building a model. Overall I'm glad I took the course, I just got different skills out of the class than expected. ",

I wanted to learn how to think like a systems modeler and how  critically analyze models; however this did not happen. One major takeaway I got was about the different archetypes for modeling which was great but most of the class focused on reading that would have been useful if we had a greater knowledge of modeling. This class was very theoretical and philosophical, not something I thought an FES class would highlight as I expect much more applied classes. ",

            "\u00a0Strength to discuss modeling with smaller class size directly working with Professor Saxena. Would love to have worked on our final project model for much more time during the semester. Also would have been useful to do more modeling in class. ",

            "\u00a0The course readings were excellent and made me think differently about complex systems and interdisciplinary work. However, the weekly assignments were not a good strategy to teach us how to use the modeling software. The final project seemed rushed and tacked on to the end of the semester, so the course could have been improved by building off the projects and gradually creating a model throughout the semester. This would allow us to troubleshoot technical difficulties while still working through the fundamentals of building a complex model. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class, and provides a wonderful overview to systems theory and system dynamics. I would say that the theoretical components of the course were certainly the strong points. The practical component of the course, learning to use Vensim, was more of a weakness. I realize that balancing theory and practice is extremely difficult in the context of course, something that was discussed in class. One way to approach the balance might be to hold additional lab-style sessions in the use of Vensim, especially for using more advanced features. Additionally, I think that theory and practice could be better bridged in the course by including many more case studies of system dynamics being applied/in action. The vast majority of the readings were strictly theoretical, and I think there could be fewer theory based readings (Sterman is great, but I wouldn't mind reading fewer of his pieces which all start something but after a while). What if each week included 2 theory readings and one case study? The case studies would have been really helpful when it came time to create our own models, but because we had read hardly any case studies, it really felt like we were reinventing the wheel. Doing my own research for the final project, I found plenty of case studies from a variety of disciplines that could have been compellingly incorporated into the course. ",
            "\u00a0Too much theory and not enough modeling practice. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe a bit more time in the modelling process in Vensim after the break ",
            "\u00a0The course unfortunately was split unevenly between the dual attempt of teaching the theory and providing adequate assistance with learning the necessary programming of vensim. One potential way to off-set this could be to structure the vensim component as a separate lab, or to spend the course entirely focused on student's final projects. The teaching of the vensim program was daunting and often required outside assistance. This left the TA overtaxed and thankfully was remedied by some students who had competency in the program, and were willing to work with others. Although often times the ability to \"play\" with a program can provide insights, when tasked with delivering specific outcomes this is not an acceptable request to make of students with limited time. The final project should have been more prominently featured in the course development so that each progression could be applied towards it, the abruptness in which it was approached was jarring. Even more so for students who had struggled with finding the time to get even basic levels of competency with vensim. ",
            "\u00a0Every week we had a problem set based on modeling. These were \"plug and chug\" style and did not teach us to think as modelers. Instead, mini-puzzlers each week would have helped us learn how to think. For example, a class \"bonus\" was to model gun control. This would have been a useful actual assignment that could have been discussed to see how students modeled things differently and the strengths and weaknesses of the differences. We were told we would start from the base of modeling and rise up throughout the class- this did not happen. The problem sets were very simple and the formatting did not encourage critical thinking. We did not even discuss the problem sets in class so there was little learning from them- they became more busy work. \r\n\r\nThen, our final project included much more complicated modeling which we were not exposed to during class. The final project seemed out of reach based on what we had been taught and was frustrating as opposed to drawing together the skills we had learned over the semester.\r\n\r\nI would suggest spending less class time on theory that has little context for first time modelers. At the beginning of the class we were told that 1/3 of the class time would be spend discussing modeling- this did not happen. I would recommend spending at least half of the class time with this. \r\n\r\nA strength of the class is Alark has real world experience with modeling and discussed some interesting projects he has done. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: readings, class discussion, theoretical aspects. Alark fosters a great discussion in his class and also assigns relevant, interesting readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Final project was rushed. We should have been building on the final project throughout the length of the semester. Sometimes, we didn't follow up enough on the readings through in class discussions (the canvas discussions aren't enough). Need better connection between the readings and the lectures, as well. Finally, problem sets should be modified to simply build on our final project models. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  easier and intellectual\r\nweaknesses: not very practical ",
            "\u00a0Great weekly readings but the weekly exercises were tedious and did not facilitate much learning. The final project was interesting but I didn't feel there was enough time to satisfy the depth of the challenge with my knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - I believe nonlinear thinking to be important for anyone working with sustainability. I think the theory of systems thinking and complexity was an excellent part of the course. It demonstrated the scale of our problems and the necessity to expand our solutions to them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I felt as though there were gaps in relating the theories to the software. The course's lectures were heavily focused on the theories and not the software. This sent me a message that the theories were more important to the course than the software. However, the final depended on the software. I felt that there was there was a mixed message there. ",

However, this class tried to cover too much material and although the professor realized this during the class, did not adapt. ",
