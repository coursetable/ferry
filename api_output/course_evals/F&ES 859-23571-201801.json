            "\u00a0Lots of conceptual knowledge about the law and natural resource laws, how to read a case study ",
            "\u00a0Gained a strong understanding of natural resource land and history, as well as the legal theories that these laws are based on. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of the landscape of natural resource case law and legislation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about laws governing public and private land management. ",
            "\u00a0More knowledge on environmental law, case law, and theory. More experience with thinking through legal problems and justifying action or inaction through the law. ",
            "\u00a0Very thorough overview of the major points of American natural resources law with a focus on administrative law. Good overview and analysis of most of the agencies involved in natural resources management at the federal level. \r\nVery important knowledge and insight into the armature of law underlying the American natural resource management system. ",
            "\u00a0Learned tons about specific cases, agencies, and also how permitting for projects occurs. ",
            "\u00a0For me this was my first introduction to Law in general, so this course taught me a lot about how the law system works and important cases that have shaped environmental law throughout history. I learned about the main thought processes and modes of reasoning in law and how that produces thematic outcomes in Nat Res Law. These insights will help me greatly with my forthcoming career in land management of the American West. ",
            "\u00a0I learned everything I know about law and policy from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I've never taken a law course, so the materials and way of thinking introduced to me in this course were totally new. I learned how to read law cases and extract relevant information, make connections between different cases, and think critically about how the law shapes environmental issues and vice versa. The course material is mainly devoted to Natural Resources Law (essentially anything the EPA does not deal with), and as someone who's about to go work for the US Forest Service, I really appreciated this introduction to natural resources law and how it informs management.

            "\u00a0Pretty well ",
            "\u00a0These were largely in line with what I was thinking the class would cover, though I would have liked a bit more on the substantive regulatory laws established and their construction/application. ",
            "\u00a0Well. ",
            "\u00a0Very well and exceeded expectations as a course ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class, I got exactly what I expected out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I had expected it to include more discussion of federal law regarding private lands, and how federal law governs actions on private land as well as on public land. Also expected more on the state-level law. Had expected some coverage of civil legal liability issues. But overall yes, wonderful content and I came away with a lot of insight and knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well with my expectations, I only wish we could have had a real introductory law workshop for those of us who had never taken a law course before. That would have helped us received the course readings and discussions more fully. ",

            "\u00a0More consistency with the syllabus. I took this course primarily because I was assured, twice, that there would be a unit on fisheries, and unfortunately there was not. However, on the topics that were covered, the professor was clear and engaging, which I appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Verchick is incredibly inclusive and a wonderful teacher. That said, I think at times the lectures went a bit off topic and could have benefitted from a bit more structure rather just open discussion from the class. ",
            "\u00a0The topics covered are very interesting to students interested in law and natural resources, but I think more support could be given to non-law students with respect to reading and understanding cases. Perhaps smaller assignments with feedback along the way versus one large final. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was in the breadth of topics covered and the strength of the professors professional experience. The weakness was that there was not always enough time for discussion of the laws and their efficacy (which is not really a criticism of the course because it is the necessary trade off for learning the laws so well). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Instructor was fantastic and his lectures were always quite engaging. The cases that we focused on were very interesting and I appreciated the depth of analysis.\r\nWeaknesses: Course overall was mostly geared towards law students. The discussion and assignments were pitched at the law students' base of knowledge, meaning that FES students can end up feeling very underprepared.\r\nThe weeklong negotiations workshop really didn't come together for me and I would have preferred to just have regular class instead.\r\nSome intermediary assignments would have been useful and would have defrayed some of the stress surrounding the final exam. Only class I've ever taken where 80% of a course grade based on a single submitted item. ",
            "\u00a0Not really many; he has good readings, good powerpoints, and lectures dynamically. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Great professor\r\n- Accessible to all levels of knowledge\r\n- Comprehensive overview of Nat Res law in US\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Assumed basic knowledge of law process sometimes ",
            "\u00a0I really loved this course. I thought it worked well for FES and Law students. The only improvement would be to have a few extra classes for FES students explaining the basics of law. ",
            "\u00a0I think a little more targeted classroom discussion would have been help, and less tangents on stories such as Jimmy Carter and the swamp rabbit. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course! Professor Verchick was engaging, accessible, and thoroughly understood that half the class was FES students with little law experience. The readings were manageable, and the expectations for the course were very clear. \r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the course was the negotiation exercise we did before spring break. I thought it was a great way to break up the lecture pattern of the course. It was also good for me because I didn't participate much in class, so it forced me to participate, engage more fully with the material, and apply what I'd already learned to an in-class exercise. Plus it was just really fun! "

        [
            "\u00a0Be open to learning about anything. Talk to a law student about how to read case law, if you don't know already. ",
            "\u00a0Very good class, but it would be important to have strong personal organizational skills and to not get lost in the somewhat scattered course structure. ",
            "\u00a0Recommend. I learned about issues important for environmental managers that I didn't even know were at play. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great but Prof. Verchick was an integral part of its success so it is hard to opine on what it would be without him. ",
            "\u00a0If you don't know anything about the law, expect to be doing some catch-up, but it will be worth it. Everyone at FES who plans a career in policy should know the material covered in the class. Note that a lot of the good parts of the class experience this semester were attributable of Prof Vercheck's fantastic classroom skills, but he was only here for this one semester (as a visiting professor). No idea what it would be like with a different instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Read more about law before the course! ",
            "\u00a0Seek some basic background knowledge of American law practice and tips for reading law cases before you dive into the class readings. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class if you are interested in anything to do with Natural Resources. ",
            "\u00a0Take it! You will learn so much! Professor Verchick is a fabulous instructor - he makes the law accessible and fun.\r\n\r\nMy advice would be DO NOT skimp on the readings. I had grand goals to do each reading twice, and take detailed notes on the cases we read. Because I'd never taken law before, I wanted to give myself as much of a head start on studying for the final exam as I could. Of course, the realities of grad school life took over and I failed in this goal and I had to cram a bit for the exam. Because the final exam is the only graded assignment, it's easy to fall behind on the reading until it's too late. Don't do this! "
