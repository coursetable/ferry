            "\u00a0Greater conceptual understanding of post-war and contemporary art, also now can recognize many of the works we looked at in class ",

            "\u00a0An overview of (subjectively) important movements and artists after 1945. Sort of a survey of this period, but reaches into contemporary art which is pretty interesting. However, the end result feels like we touched on a good number of pieces without really delving into more detail about them, which was a bit disappointing. ",

            "\u00a0It was definitely a little dry. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are engaging and informative but very dense. Section should be held in the museum and focus on close looking, instead of discussing readings. ",
            "\u00a0Great speed ",
            "\u00a0Key topics and flows were generally logical and easy to follow. However, the more recent topics/ movements seemed less chronicle and not as straightforward to understand as the earlier movements (e.g. abstract or pop). ",
            "\u00a0The course does a good job at introducing major movements in modern art in the U.S. post-WWII. It is engaging and the readings were helpful and interesting. I do wish that it focused a little more on the modern art movements outside the U.S. so that it is not that US-centric. ",
            "\u00a0The class is pretty comprehensive and covers topics that include various issues and agendas in the contemporary art community in addition to specific art works. However, I felt the lectures often lacked a overarching framework that tied everything together. There were lots of description and interpretation of individual art works and movements but not much explanation in how they stand in relation to other works and their place in the larger timeline. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Visits to the YUAG during section\r\n-Section deep engagement with pieces that we were not able to spend a ton of time on in lecture.\r\n-Organized lecture schedule\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Unclear expectations for major assignments\r\n-\"Brain Dump\" assessments\r\n-Rote memorization of hundreds of paintings for midterm and cumulative final exam ",
            "\u00a0Lecture language was too esoteric - seemed like every sentence had to have at least a four syllable word! Made it hard to grasp material when it was spoken and it was easier to just try to copy down exactly what was said. Pace very fast. Strength, though, is Rosenberg's deliberate inclusion of minorities in the overall art narrative and the thematic aspect of the lectures. His feedback was also good. "

I came out knowing a lot more about the different art movements and artists than I did going into the course and I can finally not feel like such a fool in modern art museums. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a general survey of contemporary art it's not a bad class to take but I wouldn't actively recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting if you want to hear about relevant pieces, but also felt like I could have just read a textbook about this period. The course was heavily supplemented by its well-selected readings, which provided a lot of the background that Professor Rosenberg brushed over in class. Without the readings, I would not have gotten nearly as much out of the course as Professor Rosenberg tends to ramble a lot and doesn't always seems to have a point when he discusses a piece. If you're willing to a least skim the weekly readings, then its worth taking - otherwise, you can just read selections from the class textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, especially with Professor Rosenberg. This was one of the best classes I took in my four years at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0This course is great for students who excel at rote memorization.  If you can memorize hundreds of paintings and their date and creator before a high stakes midterm and cumulative final exam, this is the course for you.  If you are like me, and you are horrible at rote memorization and \"brain dump\" assessments, find another course to take. ",
