Through translating French texts into English, I developed a better grasp of the differences between French and English syntax. We also wrote commentaries to our own translation, and composed a parody to one of the texts we translated. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are undoubtedly the variety of texts you translate and Professor Waters is amazing. No weaknessss! ",
            "\u00a0I think this class is well-structured. Prof. Waters didn't focus too much on translation theory, but rather shared with us her experience translating as we workshop-ed each of our translations. I greatly appreciate that. "

        [
            "\u00a0Quite an informal class and fun and bizarre. Professor Waters is very funny. This was my only class on Wednesdays, and I always looked forward to my Wednesdays because this class was consistently relaxing and weird. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely if you have any interest in translation or want to tackle some great contemporary French literature. I would definitely recommend it ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Translation was fun; you get to know other members of the class and Mme. Waters is awesome. Please take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely will recommend this class to other students who are fluent in both French and English. This class provides the chance for a close reading of literary texts, besides allowing you to try being a translator. "
