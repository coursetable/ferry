            "\u00a0I improved my paper-writing skills and worked on drawing connections across thinkers. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of the Western tradition of philosophy and the viewpoints of major thinkers who operated under this tradition.  I also learned how to perform philosophical analysis of an argument and write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a solid understanding of the latter half of the western canon of philosophy. I understood its main philosophical schools and how they relate to one another. My ability to think critically about philosophy also improved. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophy skills: the ability to approach complex problems in different ways, the ability to make arguments about difficult topics, the ability to express convoluted thoughts in at least a somewhat clear way. ",
            "\u00a0I became more familiar with the variety of thought on the nature of reality/existence/the self presented by different philosophers, and came to understand the stable aspects and attempted to dissect the more flawed portions of their arguments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about mind-body dualism, perception, causation, and liberty. I can't say I know the answers to any of these questions, but I don't think that's the point of studying philosophy :) My reading comprehension and critical thinking skills certainly improved. I also appreciated the feedback on my papers because I think they helped me to write stronger philosophic arguments. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills improved most--by far--in writing philosophy essays. That was especially true second semester, after finally getting the hang of how a philosophical argument should be structured. It helps to get acquainted with the second semester DS authors, all of whom have more familiar writing styles. I'm not certain I have a good grasp of their arguments, but that probably goes with the territory. Perhaps making argument maps or writing down the steps of the argument as a class would help with that. But I also did like talking about the arguments in more general terms, which Professor Greco emphasized (especially with the arguments that made less sense, i.e. Hegel's and sometimes Kant's). "

            "\u00a0The authors we discussed are very cohesive and respond to many of the same questions and ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength is that it is a very good program that teachers you a lot.  I would say the biggest weakness is the pace.  It is very hard to move through all of these works so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0The course presents a wide range of philosophers' ideas in a brief amount of time, which is important for a foundational course. However, I think that some of the philosophers on the syllabus could have been replaced with others to make the course more cohesive. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are generally that it teaches insight, it is engaging, and the course material is, quite simply, fascinating. I would say the biggest flaw--not a big one--is the inaccessibility of the philosophers' arguments. Given the lack of secondary sources in DS, it is very hard to read any philosopher and immediately understand them. This also skews opinion in favor of more accessible philosophers (e.g., I think more of the class agreed more with Hume than, say, Hegel, simply because his ideas were easier to understand). Given that, more secondary support tools, even things as simple as hand outs with syllogisms that represent the philosophers' arguments, would make this class better. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is structured very well. I enjoy the weekly lectures and seminars, and think they do a good job of helping students understand the more complex arguments and terminology which can be hard to figure out and then break down when merely reading the texts on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was a great overview of philosophy after Descartes, and I did learn a lot about big ideas in modern philosophy. As is characteristic of a Directed Studies course, the readings could be excessive in relation to what we actually had time to discuss in class, but I knew that when I signed up to take it. ",
            "\u00a0This is a classic DS problem, but I'd like to have the pace slowed down so that we can parse the arguments more. It's helpful to look at the step-by-step process that the thinker goes through to make an argument, and that's not possible to do at such a rapid pace. Taking even 1 or 2 authors off the syllabus would be enormously helpful, to that end. "

            "\u00a0This course provides a great overview of the thinkers that have shaped modern philosophy. The second semester is far more engaging and cohesive than the first. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend with caution.  The Directed Studies program is a lot of work and definitely not for everyone.  For students, very interested in the Western canon I would highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have any interest in philosophy, this course will be a lot of fun and will enable you to better choose more specialized philosophy courses later in your academic career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a fundamental part of DS. It is difficult but it rewards effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think anyone who is interested in Philosophy would enjoy this course, specifically students who have already completed the first semester of Directed Studies, because all of the authors chosen on the syllabus take the arguments and discussions that were being raised in the writings of first semester thinkers and expands upon them from various points of view. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who had an interest in philosophy or had to complete it for Directed Studies, but it's not a course for casual interest. ",
            "\u00a0Of all the DS classes, I would most highly recommend DS Philosophy. At the beginning of the year, philosophy was the most unfamiliar discipline to me, so I learned the most. As far as DS as a whole goes, I oscillate as to whether or not I would recommend it. I found it incredibly frustrating in many ways, but think that I will ultimately be glad that I did it. The pace of reading was quick, of course, but that wasn't what most bothered me--on the whole, I found that DS class discussions weren't up to the standard I would've liked. This could be a stylistic issue, for me: I much prefer discussions to be student-led, sans hand raising, even if it means that we don't cover as much, because we can't cover it all, anyway. My most memorable moments in DS were the times we were able to follow a discussion thread to a seemingly obscure place just because the students thought it was interesting. Interesting purely for the sake of our own curiosity, not because x idea was a \"famous\" takeaway of y author and we should therefore cover it. Perhaps it does go back to the pace of the program, then. Intellectual creativity is often fostered in down time, in the would-be-dead-ends-of-inquiry that don't \"produce\" anything. I got through DS by reminding myself that it was akin to \"playing the scales\" in my humanities education: not exactly fun, but a necessary foundation to my studies. That is certainly a goal of the program, but I'd also like to think that we can design DS in such a way as to not make students have mantras to \"get through\" it. "
