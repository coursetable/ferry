            "\u00a0I learned everything about fish, from their evolution and morphology to just totally weird facts. I feel like I can point to A TON fish and explain most things about their ecological niche and lifestyle. Possibly the best class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that some angler fish feel like bony chicken breasts as well as a lot about major fish orders/families. ",
            "\u00a0I gained in-depth knowledge about a ton of different orders/families of fish. I can now go to an aquarium or seafood store and list a bunch of Latin names, which is a fun, albeit random, skill. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different extant groups of fishes, and how to identify different fishes. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a hands on understanding of fish morphology and diversity, and we also learned some techniques of sample collection, identification and preparation. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0strengths- we covered a large array of fish so I feel as if I got a taste of all the different types of fish there are out there.\r\nWeakness- I wish lab coincided with lecture more, and I wish we covered more marine species, but that may just be because of the peabody. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very memorization-based. This is not good for the learning style of some students. It may help students to have a better outline understanding of how fish fit together under different groups. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the format of the class - hear about the major features of the fish we were going to look at for a little bit, maybe take a quick quiz, then look at the fish until you feel like you know enough about them. The field trips were a lot of fun. I only wish that the skeleton and sorting projects were a little more organized - it would've been nice to get a quick primer on how to identify common features referenced in the keys. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you get to handle a ton of diverse fish up close, and learn about them firsthand. The field trips are really cool too.\r\nWeaknesses: memorization -- but this is true of any EEB lab. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a fantastic lab! Dae-min and Professor Harrington made a great team. My only comment is that the schedule felt a bit rushed at the end (I think in part because the staining took longer than expected), so for future years it might be worth compressing the first half of the curriculum if possible? I loved both field trips and it would be cool to have  done some more work on our collected samples, perhapse a dissection, or attempting the staining our selves. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this. You get so much more out of the class if you take lab, and the lab helps tremendously with lecture. I loved going to class every week and being able to learn about a new fish and now Its cool that I can identify so many. Even if you dont have to take the lab, I think you should because you learn so much more and its a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to a student -- in fact I have been doing so all semester. Definitely take the lab -- you will learn about fish in a hands-on environment and it will help with your understanding in the lecture (you also get to go on some fishing trips!). ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, even if you're not an E&EB major (I'm not.) It's a lot of fun being in a small group of folks just looking at fish once a week and it's by far the most enjoyable lab I've been in. Make sure to go on the field trips if at all possible. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a lab, it's a great choice. Even if you don't, it's a fun way to hang out with fish specimens once a week and get a feel for the vastness of the Peabody collections. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think I got so much more out of the lecture by taking the lab, and it was so cool to see the vast number of fish that the Peabody has preserved. Being able to hold the fish we were learning about was so valuable, and the memorization component of the class was very reasonable. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend as a fun complement to the lecture! Awesome opportunities to talk with Professor Harrington, and the (light) workload is all very useful when studying for the lecture exams. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the course was the perfect addition to the EEB 264 lecture. It both built upon the lecture material with hands-on experience in fascinating ways, while reinforcing the information from each week's lectures. In addition, my experiences with the professor and TA were nothing but positive. "
