            "\u00a0Understanding basic analysis of surface waters and the theory behind different functions and compositions. I think I got a bit of a better foundation in the theory than in the calculations themselves, but that's fine with me because I think that's what will stick with me more in 10 years anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Had an in-depth look into water chemistry and water systems. Learned about equilibrium, thermodynamics, alkalinity, redox reactions, metal speciation, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge on how, given some information about water, to calculate loads of other characteristics about that water. Skills on how to approach problems you feel like you have no idea how to do/seem super impossible at first glancetrick is to fake it till you make it, and hey sometimes you wont make it, but youll have tried your best and learned from the experience. Insights that the world needs more people who care about it, like Prof. Plata, and that Prof. Plata is one of the most wonderful people out there. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different chemistry involved in water. I learned about redox reactions, ph logc diagrams, how to use tableaux tables, alkalinity and more. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. You gain real world experience that enables you to solve problems in the field of water chemistry and oceanography right now. "

            "\u00a0The course seemed a little disorganized at times. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the course. It had a tough workload but that helped develop skills in various areas of academics. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a little disorganized, especially when it came to the midterm and final. It would've helped a lot if we had been given some review problems or at least a list of review topics in advance, but instead we ended up feeling like we were being thrown into the exam with little preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the course. The lectures were very engaging and I felt like a learned a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The content is pretty inherently dry. It was done as well and made as engaging as possible for what was learning loads of equations and how to apply them. More in class time to try to solve problems together would be awesome but obviously that may not be possible given how much has to be taught. "

            "\u00a0This was a good class, and I think some of the quirks of the class (like a 25 page paper for a chemistry class...) are far outweighed by how great an explainer she is and how much she cares about her students. Professor Plata didn't let me get confused or behind during class, it was really one of the more thoughtfully taught/excellent lectures I have taken as an environmental engineer. I wasn't wild about the subject material, but I was able to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to decide between this and Aquatic Chemistry, definitely take this! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. Especially if Plata is teaching it. She could be teaching about why dirt is dirty and it would be the best class at Yale. "
