            "\u00a0I felt that the course focused too much on Statistics, disproportionately to the applications Information Theory has in other domains. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the excellent lecture quality, well-balance between depth of presentation and breadth of material covered, and content/assignment difficulty that is challenging and instructive without seeming cruel. A first weakness is that although the assignments were thoughtful in difficulty, they were overly time consuming --- quite frequently a few problems in each set felt repetitive and unnecessary after the content had been learned from other problems of similar design. Second, information theory has a diverse set of applications to which the second half of the course was primarily oriented, and the class might benefit from more student feedback as to interest in those applications. For example, substantial amount of time was spent on gambling and finance despite nearly no students noting a focus on those topics, whereas other topics like error correcting codes and algorithmic information theory were not covered. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well organized. It covers most of the important basic topics about information theory and offers sufficient exercise, making it a very good math course. ",

            "\u00a0Useful materials were covered, but not very organized. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It is an important introductory course for many related studies. ",
