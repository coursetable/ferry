            "\u00a0A way to critically analyze and discuss how our society thinks about, and regulates bodies--as well as the societal issues that exist regarding bodies that have no clear answer. This class's discussions could really go anywhere and really allowed you to learn from your peers and the professor on how one can think about these very fundamental questions--do we own our body? who controls what can be done to a body and when?--in so many different ways. ",
            "\u00a0Close reading and analysis of papers, how to think outside of the box, how to apply and see concepts in the daily political climate ",
            "\u00a0The course challenged some of my views on things I thought I was very sure of. The seminar allowed for a space to explore some ideologies of mine I thought were set in stone. ",
            "\u00a0So many cool insights into the legal, cultural, social, and political ways we view the body. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about representation of the body in law and generally in society through reading articles, laws/case studies, excerpts from books, etc. I learned how to analyze the body from a new perspective that takes into account history of legislature, social misconceptions, etc., as well as how to discuss  and debate such hot topics in a seminar setting. ",
            "\u00a0This class was super engaging, super fun, and super enlightening on a variety of topics that usually, most Yale students don't get the opportunity to talk about! We talked and read and discussed about so many things: intersex and transgender individuals, disabilities, funerals/burial traditions, zombies, what it means to own your body, assisted suicide, physician assisted suicide - anything and everything that had anything to do with the body was open game. It made for some great class discussion, and we even watched The Walking Dead and discussed everything for our last class! It was just really fun and really educational and made you think outside and inside of yourself. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my close-reading skills with literature. I have never previously been exposed to the law, and this course was a great introduction. Throughout the course, I worked closely with course readings and films. The course also developed my seminar participation skills. ",
            "\u00a0Best course I have taken at Yale so far! Makes you think about life in a complete different way while simultaneously creating a safe space for everyone to share their own perspectives comfortably. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a variety of topics related to the body. I gained reading analysis, discussion/speaking, and writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0Each seminar, we discussed various situations and scenarios that challenged how we think of the human body, the limits of the body, and the implications of how we define and approach the body.   We approached this from a variety of perspectives drawing on lawsuits, philosophical debates, important current social issues (ie. Womens reproduction rights, end of life care, the immorality of solitary confinement, etc.) and contemporary culture (such as the current popularity of the zombie canon).   I am now much more confident to engage in debates and conversations regarding the human body, and, have gained a strong knowledge about important social issues that are vital to the human experience.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Dean L is an absolute gem.  She is an inspirational lecturer, and brings a vibrance and energy to lecture that makes your week infinitely better.  Some of the topics can be relatively morbid, or even gruesome, but it is always fun engaging in such conversations with Dean L.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The course does not have strict deadlines, this is a blessing and a curse.  It can be nice if you are somebody who needs flexibility, but if you procrastinate, you will likely not write your papers until reading week. ",
            "\u00a0This class is absolutely amazing and on-of-a-kind. It is relaxed but engaging, approachable yet critical, and always was a fun and welcoming environment. Dean L ensures that the class is made up of a diverse set of students who all bring different viewpoints and this really shines through in the discussion, as seminar discussions could really go in any direction and were always engaging. The class was amazing and I really wouldn't change a thing, besides offering the potentially unpopular opinion for there to be a bit more structure/accountability. It was a bit of a social experiment to have such flexible deadlines, as it made me realize how reliant I was on structure in my life, students may be able to get even more from the class if they are held more accountable to more deliverables. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dean L is a gem. She makes classes so engaging, fun, and exciting. Every discussion is allowed to go where it goes, and she brings in outside information to tie it all together.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Few. Maybe incorporation of more media, like the day we watched The Walking Dead for our discussion of the origin of zombies? ",
            "\u00a0S: Dean L is an excellent discussion leader, there were very few moments of awkward silence at the table the conversation felt very smooth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing professor who walks the line between facilitating discussion and letting students speak. Really fun group for section. Weaknesses: not really a weakness, but lack of deadlines is such a double edged sword. I kind of wish there was some sort of hard deadline. But she was really upfront about it so I appreciate that. ",
            "\u00a0Only strengths! Dean L is an amazing facilitator of discussions (she knew when to ask questions and when to step away/let us talk), and gave us some very interesting readings for homework that really fueled conversation for the full 2 hours of class every week. ",
            "\u00a0The free-flowing nature of the course is a strength as we talked about what we were interested in, and let the conversation flow - there were many students with a wide variety of backgrounds and majors, but it was also limited to juniors and seniors so it was nice to have that closeness and that intimacy with such a group of people. The writing assignments were more thought-provoking than normal academic essays and I had the ability to do something completely of my own, and that was perfectly fine! It gave a lot of freedom and flexibility to grow as a thinker! And Dean L is just so awesome and sweet and willing to meet anytime, love her! Only weakness was that sometimes there were way too many readings that I didn't get the chance to really delve into some of them as much as I wanted to. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong in its discussions - every class was interesting and very enjoyable. The topics were very interesting and Dean L was an incredible leader. The course was very flexible and allowed students to pursue their individual interests. The class has no weaknesses! ",
            "\u00a0Its perfect! Never change Dean L!! ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful! I loved the variety of topics, and the class discussion was usually great. I liked how the course encouraged everyone to be thoughtful, open, and honest about their experiences and opinions. I don't think that much needs to be improved about the course at all. If anything, I think I preferred the weeks that we had a list of shorter readings to the ones when we had fewer but longer ones. The shorter sources were more engaging and fit better with the style of the class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness was the low engagement from students, something that I think was a crime given the interesting course content.  On the other hand, this course has three main strengths: the fascinating subject-matters and variety of topics that we cover, the students that enroll in the course, and finally, Dean L herself.  The readings themselves were extremely interesting to the point that I would genuinely wanted to read them. After all, who wouldnt want to read about abortion debates, the transgender and intersexual experiences, cannibalism, and zombies (just to name a few)?  Additionally, the students in this seminar all had different academic strengths, which only helped to facilitate interesting seminar discussions, and, they all genuinely wanted to be there.   But the greatest strength to this course was without a doubt Dean L herself.  She created a great seminar environment in which we were able to discuss touchy issues without disrespecting anyone and in which we were able to learn a great deal about the boundaries of the body.  But above all, Dean Ls kindness and consideration made it clear that she simply wanted us to not stress about her class but rather just be engaged in the discussions.  It was a genuine pleasure taking this course. "

            "\u00a0A must take.  This class was unbelievably fun.  The workload is very relaxed, the readings are fun to do, discussion will make you think deeply and critically, and you will challenge and change your perception of the way that we view bodies in every societal context.  Dean L is an amazing human being, and she is an absolute delight to share a classroom with. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! This class is so so amazing. For a senior especially, this is such a wonderful seminar that allows you to engage with interesting peers and an amazing professor on some of the most intellectually stimulating issues that we as a society face. It was a joy coming to class every week and I will truly miss this seminar. Dean L is one of the best people that you will meet at Yale, she is so accomplished, kind, approachable, fun, and makes the class feel like such a welcoming space. ",
            "\u00a0DEFINITELY. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely 100%. This class is super fun. It's really just like a book club where you get together and talk about really controversial/undeniably interesting issues for 2 hours each week. The readings are very engaging, and just an absolute pleasure to grind out when you have any free time. My class was incredibly diverse which was really cool to get different perspectives. With that said, any group of students at Yale is going to be somewhat homogeneous in their line of thinking, particularly if they sign up for the class. Nevertheless, I loved hearing what my classmates and Dean L had to say each week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Dean L is so warm and insightful. She is really careful about picking people for the seminar, so we often had some really great discussions from many different viewpoints. The content is also amazing, ranging from intersexuality to zombies. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! You have to be a junior or senior to get in, and even then there are tons of people interested every year, but if you get the chance to take it, please do!! Dean L is truly amazing, and the workload of readings can sometimes seem large but the mind-blowing discussions make it worth it every week. I walked out of class every week ironically speechless, having learned so much not only about the body but also about the intellect of Yale students and our ability to have very real discussions (about topics like suicide and corpses and cannibalism) in a calm, structured setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. A chill course ",
            "\u00a0YES DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!! Spending time with Dean L has been the highlight of my Yale experience, she is an extremely compassionate and kind person and reminds me of why I chose to come to Yale in the first place. The classes felt like discussions instead of mandatory seminars, it was just enjoyable. This class helped me grow and I am extremely grateful I got the chance to take it. Dean L is someone every person should get the chance to talk to at least once! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would if you are looking for a class to really just let your mind think and interact with other people's thoughts concerning the human body in all different contexts - medical, economic, political, legal - whatever you want! Having a large array of backgrounds makes the class way more interesting. Dean L does give great readings to go off of, and it's a class that I look forward to coming to, and yes, the flexibility and flowing nature of the class may seem intimidating at first, given the writing assignments, but truly, those assignments are not meant to stress you out at all. Think, read, explore, and just write! If you can get into this seminar, it's awesome! (She does limit it to juniors and seniors though) ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student! Overall, the course was so enjoyable - the topics were interesting and I always felt comfortable in class. ",
            "\u00a0Please take this course! Its important to make yourself understand why you believe the things you do! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. It's a blast! The discussion is very engaging from week to week, and topics range from the ownership of organs to medical cannibalism to The Walking Dead. While there is a significant reading load and two essays (5 pages and 10 pages), the discussions and essays aren't always directly tied to the readings (there's a lot of room for sharing personal experiences, insights, and questions that are about the week's topic but go beyond the reading), and the class never feels particularly stressful because the instructor (Dean L) cares a lot about students and is very understanding of busy schedules and academic stress. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! Fair warning, it is an extremely popular course so make sure to do your best to get in. But, please do yourself the favor and try to take it not only for the fascinating syllabus and course readings, but above all, take it for Dean L!! Dean Ls main priority was that we enjoyed her class and actually learned something by the end of the semester. She hand-picked each reading to that each one would be interesting and would also engage us into fantastic seminar discussions.  As a result, I so enjoyed doing all of the readings for this course and would genuinely look forward to this seminar. All in all, this is one of my favorite courses to have taken so far while at Yale. So if you are looking for a refreshing, low-stress class that you will actually learn useful information from, then take this course!! "
