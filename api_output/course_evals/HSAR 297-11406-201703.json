            "\u00a0Gained a lot of knowledge on art during the Dutch Golden Age in general along with specific understanding on Rembrandt's art and what made him so unique. Improved skills in history of art writing and art analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I think that i developed a more comprehensive knowledge or Dutch culture and how artists like Rembrandt and Vermeer fit into it. I truly enjoyed the interesting material with such an engaging professor and actually absorbed a lot of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0In depth knowledge of 16th century Dutch art, and cultural influence upon artists in the field. ",
            "\u00a0informative about 17th century Netherlands from both a historical and artistic perspective ",
            "\u00a0Rembrandts Amsterdam was accessible to students unfamiliar with and well-versed in art history alike. The first assignment - a visual analysis - taught the tools needed to study art, and the final paper allowed us to expand upon those skills using a piece that we chose. I really appreciated the breadth of the course, too. I was worried that it would be too specific, as I tend to like survey classes, but it bridged the gap well. We studied Rembrandt and Amsterdam of course but also looked at broader Dutch artists and culture. ",
            "\u00a0In addition to learning more about seventeenth-century Dutch art than I thought I ever would, this course was a great exercise in art historical writing and visual analysis. Prof. Bass stresses close looking and engagement with primary sources as the first step in art historical work (rather than approach art from the standpoint of theory or from what others have written about it). This is surprisingly challenging, given how easy it can be to research secondary literature on pretty much any work of art, but it is a very rewarding exercise and a necessary skill. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new knowledge of Dutch art from the seventeenth century as well as a specific new knowledge of the Dutch artist, Rembrandt. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a detailed overview of 17th-century Dutch art and culture. I have a much better idea of Dutch artistic styles and trends, and I understand how they intersect with issues of gender, colonialism, and commerce. This course improved my art historical writing immensely, thanks to the detailed feedback I received for each assignment. I am a better looker, and a much better thinker! ",
            "\u00a0This course was consistently interesting and enjoyable throughout the term. It helped me refine my critical thinking in relation to History of Art courses, and improved my writing in a field style (visual analysis writing) that is less familiar to me. The subject matter of Rembrandt and seventeenth century trends in Dutch art caught my eye during shopping period, and I am so glad I took a course on it! It was a great course which I would recommend for both HSAR newcomers and seasoned majors. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about both 17th century Amsterdam and Rembrandt (and his contemporaries). I was able to really deepen my visual analysis skills and broaden my horizons in terms of art I was interested in. ",
            "\u00a0Great course for 17th century Dutch art ",
            "\u00a0Not only did I get a rich and complex sense of the history, trajectory, and nuances of Dutch 17th century art (which I'd previously known pretty much literally nothing about), but I also learned a lot about how to \"read\" and write about paintings in general, which is a skill I will absolutely continue to draw on. Even more broadly, I appreciated that this class got me to spend a lot of time thinking about the techniques of lighting, color, and composition, and I have already begun to incorporate some of this thinking into my work in other disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0The number one thing I learned from this course was the visually analyze pieces of art thoroughly and draw conclusions through the process and technique of the artist. ",
            "\u00a0I came into this course with effectively no knowledge of art history or the language used to describe art. I came out with a rich toolkit of language and methods of appreciation that I will use for a lifetime. I came into this course with limited knowledge of Dutch culture, art, and history and came out with a compelling narrative of artistic innovation and competition that answers some of the central questions of the course. "

        [
            "\u00a0The Professor takes a strong interest in all of her students and is very actively engaged in the class. The lecture  sometimes ran as a pseudo-seminar but elicited superficial engagement from a select group of only a few students. Additionally, several of the classroom policies were rather infantalizing (signing a pledge not to cheat on the exam, signing a pledge to attend the trip, no computers allowed in class). While all of these policies are understandable and well justified by the professor, they eroded the perceived trust between the professor and her students and created an adversarial atmosphere wherein I felt that I was not trusted by the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are structured well and sections are interesting because we actually get to look at art in the YUAG and in the Met. The only thing I would really change is not having two final papers because that plus the final was a lot and felt a bit unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0i think the lectures are a huge strength. theyre engaging varied and straightforward. theres a lot of interesting details and a solid explaination of materials and techniques as well as background on culture and artists. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps it was necessary, but I did not love how the course focused more on the Dutch Republic from a historical perspective before actually getting to the Rembrandt. Sections in the YUAG were great for up close looks at the art. Some of the readings were not especially insightful, but the tests/papers do not really rely on them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bass introduced us to a wide variety of artists and paintings, and the assignments were fair, well-designed, and clearly explained. I only have two critiques: sometimes, the lectures felt repetitive. We might have a topic for that given class (ex. prostitution in the Dutch Republic) and harp on the same argument the entire time. And though I appreciated our field trip to New York, the trip was a lot of effort for just one hour. I wouldve preferred it to be longer or not at all. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Bass has so many fascinating points to make about the works of art she discusses that going to lecture can sometimes be overwhelming. But the lectures are so well organized, and Prof. Bass is such a great storyteller, that they are a joy to attend. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very interesting. The material is presented very well and it ties into sections well also. However, despite the material being interesting, the lectures can be a little dry. ",
            "\u00a0I couldn't think of a single thing that I didn't like about the course. Professor Bass was engaging from the start, filling her lectures with paintings and information that was exciting and relevant to her \"thesis\" of each class. I loved that the structure of the class trained us to understand Rembrandt in terms of the time and place in which he created art. It was also great to have so much perspective as to the role of the Dutch empire in Europe and in the world. The syllabus was also crafted brilliantly.\r\n\r\nAs for the teaching of the course, I couldn't be more satisfied. I loved how organized Professor Bass was -- she put everything on paper, and we always knew what she expected of us. The assignments are rigorous, but we have plenty of time to think about each of them. The trip to the Met was a great addition, too. All in all, one of the best courses I've taken! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the weekly discussion sections which were held in the Yale University Art Gallery and Beinecke Library, as well as the class trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The engagement with the material was fascinating and accessible, and each week built off the works discussed prior to it in a way that aided comprehension of course themes. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bass is an absolute strength in this course. She is so engaged, and really allows for every learning opporunity possible in her course. She makes the effort to get to know each of her students. The one thing I wish to be different was how long we spent at the Met. I wish we couldve been there longer!! ",
            "\u00a0Great course ",
            "\u00a0I really don't have any suggestions for improvement to this course.  I loved it.  The readings, papers, and exams were challenging but manageable, the material was fascinating, and Professor Bass is wonderful and so enthusiastic about the material.  I wouldn't change a thing. ",
            "\u00a0The first half of the class gives you a broader sense of the Dutch Golden Age (so the whole class isn't just devoted to Rembrandt). The last few weeks focus more on Rembrandt's etchings and paintings. There's a really great trip to the Met, but the YUAG also has a lot of paintings, drawings, and etchings that you'll get to explore in depth during section. The visual analysis paper is fairly painless, there's a midterm and a final exam, and a final paper. With the final paper, you get to go more in depth on something that really interests you. \r\n\r\nProfessor Bass is a wonderful lecturer and a wonderful person! Definitely get to know her. Pay attention in lecture. She doesn't let you use a computer, which actually made me more engaged with what she was saying. \r\n\r\nYou don't have to have a strong art history background to enjoy and do well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this was an absolutely fantastic course. The lectures were engaging, the material was fascinating, and I left with a whole lot of new knowledge and new ways to apply it.\r\n\r\nIf I had to think of a weakness, I'd say that I didn't get too much from the first visual analysis assignment, because it was very tricky for me to write about art without making any kind of argument about it, to drawn on details without doing so to any specific end. This made me very worried about the later analysis-based papers, but of course when it came time to use visual analysis to make an argument I had much less trouble doing it. Maybe the visual analysis assignment could be made more similar to later papers by including (even an optional) prompt to make an argument or a series of arguments. This way, we could still get practice visually analyzing, but also get to draw on specific details for specific reasons, which would be less frustrating.\r\n\r\nAlso, while most of the lectures were absolutely fantastic, and much of the discussion of colonialism was progressive and refreshing, there were a few moments when the class touched on race in ways that could be improved. For instance, the suggestion that the two African men in \"Moors\" could be the same person from different angles was worrying, especially since this suggestion was not made about figures in other paintings, and since they had clearly differentiated faces. Similarly, the suggestion that if the reclining female nude was a portrait of an African woman naked it would be progressive was also a bit worrying, given the history of racist depictions of nude African women. \r\n\r\nStill, these are just a few smaller points in the grand scheme of a totally incredible class, and I have faith that the professor was just not aware of the potential connotations of these points she made, and would make changes in the future. ",
            "\u00a0This was a superbly taught, brilliantly assembled course that shimmers with insights and engages students deeply.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is that non-art history students did not have clear expectations for the first midterm, so they didn't know what was expected for a 10/10 answer or essay. It was very helpful to get examples of 10/10 answers ahead of the final, but something similar ahead of the midterm would have helped. "

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student. There are many much better art history lectures to take any given semester. The lectures were repetitive and uninspiring. Many days I left the class confused and unsatisfied. The lectures were generally just the Professor describing a list of images with tenuous connections. ",
            "\u00a0Yes-- lot's of information, but very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course just because Professor Bass is such a good lecturer and so passionate about this subject. It really improves your art analysis skills and makes you think about aspects of art that normally you don't pay attention to. ",
            "\u00a0You must take this course if you have any interest in a true cultural history of 17th century golden age with an emphasis on the development of its artists. One of my favorite classes that Ive taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a great way to understand pre-industrial European art. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course for anyone interested in course subject, especially if you're thinking about majoring in art history. If you don't have any experience or not sure where your interest lies, start out by taking the survey course. ",
            "\u00a0Whether youve taken art history in the past or not, Rembrandts Amsterdam is a great course all around! Professor Bass is excited about the material and eager to teach undergraduates, and sections were never dull. We moved to different places - from the Beinecke to the YUAGs print gallery - every week. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is the best lecture-based course I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a new period and place of art history. It is very interesting and it is an enjoyable class overall. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you are studying art history or not, you should ABSOLUTELY take this class. The Dutch Golden Age is one of the most interesting periods of history when it comes to the study of art. Professor Bass does a brilliant job of illuminating it as such. Lectures are always a joy to attend; this might be the only class I've taken at Yale during which I never wanted to be anywhere but in my seat. The sections in the art gallery are also impactful and rewarding. If you want a humanities class with a medium workload that will change the way you see art, take this one! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, as well as any others also taught by Professor Bass, to another student! The subject matter of Rembrandt and seventeenth century trends in Dutch art caught my eye during shopping period, and I am so glad I took a course on it! It was a great course which I would recommend for both HSAR newcomers and seasoned majors. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you have the opportunity to take a course with Professor Bass, do not let it pass you by!! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student.  I loved it.  Professor Bass's lectures were clear, well-organized, and fascinating; the papers were challenging but enjoyable; the field trip to the Met was wonderful; and the exams and their required images were structured so as to be very manageable.  I have never found studying for an exam so straightforward and enjoyable, rather than needlessly overwhelming.  If you have any interest in the magnificent Dutch Golden Age (not just Rembrandt--all of this incredible and important period) take this course.  It's the best. ",
            "\u00a0I loved it! Dutch art is a lot more interesting than you think, and Professor Bass really is an expert. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student, even especially to someone who has never taken an art history class before. It's a wonderful introduction to the language and techniques of art history without being a broad survey. Rather, you leave the class with a whole lot of very specialized and interesting knowledge about the world of Dutch 17th-century art. The lectures were never boring, the workload was never overwhelming, and we got to spend a lot of time with some incredible works of art. Overall, if you have any interest at all, this class is absolutely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. Professor Bass is an incredible lecturer and really cares about the subject. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. It is a very engaging class and you learn some many intricate thingns about Amsterdam and its artists . ",
            "\u00a0I wouldnt hesitate to recommend this course to anyone with any interest in history of art. It is a fascinating period, taught by a wonderful professsor! ",
            "\u00a0One of the best taught courses I have taken at Yale. A great \"dip\" into art history if you want to learn about the urban history of Amsterdam and the social/economic history of the dominant trading country of the 1600s. You get to see some great art in person and learn helpful tools of analysis to appreciate it. Readings are very manageable, you're only tested on about six papers throughout the class, but the rest are engaging and helpful for analysis. ",
