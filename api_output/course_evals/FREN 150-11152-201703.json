            "\u00a0A much better grasp of grammar; an expanded vocabulary; a new ease with spoken French. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a lot in terms of my French speaking abilities and think my instructor was extremely thoughtful about helping me learn. ",
            "\u00a0I seriously improved my French in this course. I feel much more comfortable with analytical writing and oral expression and I feel more than prepared for my upcoming semester in France. ",
            "\u00a0I gained writing and speaking skills. I also learned a lot from the grammar review. ",
            "\u00a0It was a very convenient, appropriate and interesting follow up to L4 French. Would recommend this course over going to the summer abroad in Arles or other (not the ones in Paris organized by Yale). ",
            "\u00a0Significantly improved my French vocabulary and grammar skills. Learned complex sentence structure. Honed my writing and reading skills in French. ",

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: destroyed my confidence in my French skills and rebuilt them from the bottom up. Gave me tons of opportunities to improve, and held my hand through the process. Fast-paced, but manageable. Very rewarding.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: assigning a 2+ hour film on Wednesday to be watched and processed by Friday is a bit much. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is structured in a very logical way in terms of the grammar units such that it covers a lot of grammar while integrating books and movies. I would suggest maybe spending a bit more in class time on the grammar concepts. (Also, there were a few concepts, such as adverbs, which did not have sections in the grammar textbook, which would have been helpful; maybe if there was a suggested supplemental resource posted on Canvas for this it would be helpful for reviewing.) ",
            "\u00a0Course packet was very well organized, including vocab lists and grammar exercises. Discussions were interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Workload can get too much sometimes but still lighter than L4. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well-structured course that improves every facet of French written and verbal comprehension. More emphasis could be put on pronunciation and oral skills. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if French is your language. 150 is painful and difficult, but it's worth working through. I am so much more comfortable with French than I was a few months ago. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would say it is a great course to solidify some advanced concepts in French. It was quite engaging, due in part to the instructor and in part to the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great way to improve French skills and Madame Sherak is wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course for anyone at a high level of French proficiency and anyone preparing to study abroad in a French-speaking country. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I improved my french skills a lot, and I well intellectually stimulated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think you should take French till L5 at Yale because that classes are very well-organized and segmented for amazing French learning. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you like french then continue to take it! ",
