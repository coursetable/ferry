            "\u00a0I think I have really improved my Spanish! I learned a ton of grammar and am now able to hold a conversation in Spanish. I was really worried about learning in a class taught in Spanish but Sebastian was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the next level of grammar and vocabulary skills following L2 spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a greater mastery of the Spanish language, especially in terms of my grammar skills and oral presentation. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, Ive improved my Spanish grammar and through exposure to reading materials, audio sources, videos, and speaking exercises, Ive gained a stronger grasp of the Spanish language ",
            "\u00a0I gained a significantly better mastery of the Spanish language. Through the class, I was able to experience significant practice of auditory comprehension. Furthermore, I have a much better understanding of Spanish grammatical structure, and my ease of use has greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking skills, cultural knowledge ",
            "\u00a0More Spanish tha is needed to move on to higher level Spanish classes. "

            "\u00a0This is a well developed course, I do not think there is much that could be changed to make it better. ",
            "\u00a0Sebastian was wonderful and helpful. I thought some of the readings were a little controversial especially for native Americans. I think everything in this class was fair but it was a lot of work. I wish there were more opportunities to practice speaking in Spanish outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very large so we didn't get the chance to speak enough. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is its ability to cover reading, writing, and oral skill in the Spanish language in breadth and depth. The only weakness is that no class slots were affected after noon. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job of reinforcing grammar rules through a lot of practice and repetition, and overall does help the student improve their language skills. However, a stronger emphasis on speaking exercises and more relevant reading materials (the stories are very random and arent representative of typical spanish reading materials), so picking stories that are more realistic or relatable might help students gain better insight as well as learn practical words and phrases ",
            "\u00a0Although this may be intentional, the focus of the class was much more on auditory comprehension and comprehension of grammar and vocabulary than actual speaking ability. I think one area of improvement for this class would be greater conversational opportunities and requirements. ",
            "\u00a0It is a strong course overall, but there is far too much busywork. ",
            "\u00a0course is very well taught and organized ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the content of the course is strong, and you definitely improve grammar and writing skills through meeting every day.\r\nWeaknesses - there isnt much emphasis on speaking skills. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are teaching you so you know the language. The weaknesses are the amount of work and class time that are required. "

            "\u00a0You're probably taking this class because you have to, but regardless of that, this class will help you improve your Spanish incredibly if you invest in it. You learn a LOT of grammar, so I would encourage you to get a peer tutor, go to Spanish round table, or grab a meal with a friend who speaks Spanish and speak in Spanish the whole time. It will help with the grammar. ",
            "\u00a0The Spanish program at Yale is incredible. L3 in particular really brings you up to a level at which you can confidently read and speak. 100% recommend to anyone, especially if you can take it with Sebastian. ",
            "\u00a0If someone has to take Spanish I would definitely recommend Sebastian. If you don't have to take Spanish and are not passionate about Spanish I would say that the course is too time consuming and difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, to fulfill language requirements and develop the rudiments of Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course. It truly helps students advance in their mastery of the language and exposes us to a variety of interesting texts. ",
            "\u00a0The grading can vary widely depending on the professor, but overall if youre looking to take a Spanish course at Yale this one is doable. It just has daily homework and meets each day of the week so keep that in mind ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is excellent if one wishes to improves ones Spanish ability. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it is necessary to move on to higher level classes and you do learn Spanish. "
