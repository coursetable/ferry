            "\u00a0Through this course, I learned about Russias previous diplomatic decision-makings in the face of critical moments from the early 19th century to today. The course convinced me that some aspects of Russian diplomacy have continuity for more than two centuries, so the historical understandings are helpful in analyzing the current challenges regarding Russian foreign relations.

            "\u00a0The course is well thought out, it covers a number of topics. It is not taught from a very ideological lens, there's ample room to disagree. The weakness is that the discussion is tricky with 18 people, and the quality of presentations varies. Some are good, some not so good. Perhaps a debate format would be better. The reading list is mostly clippings from secondary sources, so I never felt like I read works about Russian foreign policy. ",
            "\u00a0The course is fantastic and Prof. Graham is a great instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Main strengths are a presentation by a pair of students each week (facilitates broader understanding and academic collaboration) and the breadth of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-structured, interesting readings, coursework is adequate.\r\nWeaknesses: none. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths included the beginning lecture portion of the class that presented the background context, the discussions that the presentations stimulated, and the consideration of the policy-making decisions from Moscow's point of view. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course covered not only the west side of Russia (relations with Europe and the U.S.) but also the south and east sides (those with Central and East Asia), which is compatible with Russias growing diplomatic interest in Asia in the 21st century. / Weakness: Nothing "
