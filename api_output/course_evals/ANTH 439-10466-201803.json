            "\u00a0Best course for African Studies (better than Magaziner's Encounters even). You get a dive deep in African political theory that existed before colonialism, how the colonial gaze and colonialism shaped it after that, and all that is done from an anthropological perspective that strives to not be normative and helps you engage with the complexities rather than join a bunch of incompetents who like to make big conclusions about \"Africa.\" ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to rigorously analyze anthropological texts and how to ask anthropological questions. I also learned about a broad dictionary of anthropoligical authors to reference in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the ways in which anthropology has shaped and understands the African continent, especially Western and Southern Africa. ",
            "\u00a0You learn both content and methodology in this course. Methodology includes both different anthropological methodologies and the attendant politics of said methodologies. Content deals with more structural analyses of Africa, questioning the discourse on Africa as a continent, and dealing with examples of more local and particular anthropological studies. Some weeks might have more of a sociocultural emphasis while others might deal more with politics, colonialism, gender relations, agency vs. structural criticism, etc. Definitely broad in focus but the projects allow for you to explore whatever more specific thing(s) interest you. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my ability to read strategically, write concisely, and write on demand.\r\n\r\nThis was ultimately a class examining how Africa's peoples have dealt with the pressures of a global world. The key insight I gleaned from it was the profound epistemological arrogance with which Europeans, and the West in general, invaded the continent. Westerners simply had no IDEA the profound effect their actions would have on the continent and the cultures of its inhabitants. Some would argue that same dynamic persists up to today, and this class presents several solid arguments for how this might be the case. A good class then, for providing a lens to critique contemporary politicians' response to Africa's challenges. To top it off, you get to spend some time with some really interesting ethnographies. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely well structured. Assignments are fun. Discussion is always guided by Prof Lombard: that means that bs-ing is rarely left out unchallenged. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there are great readings and discussions. I also liked the weekly reading responses and the assignments. I wish the presentations for the final paper and the film discussion had more structure so we could have more fruitful discussions. I also wish we had more of a sense of WHY we were going the way we were week to week. ",
            "\u00a0The course was filled with fascinating readings and topics. However, it was a little hard to see a specific trajectory in the course. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were interesting and the professor was wonderful and very helpful. Overall an awesome course for anyone interested in anthropology or Africa. Seminar discussion was usually lively though sometimes we didn't get to discuss all of the readings or at least not cover them in depth. Professor Lombard was always happy to follow up outside of class and help with your research projects. ",
            "\u00a0The classes strengths lay with the wealth of empirical, qualitative data that it presented in the forms of books and ethnographies. These are primarily descriptive, and provide lots of interesting facts that challenge basic assumptions (as well as more complex contemporary theories) about how people work.\r\n\r\nThe classes weakness lay in some of the older theoretical works the class read. Though interesting, these theories seemed ultimately to ride on a degenerate, rather than progressive, research program. This seemed to be because these theorists ultimately resorted to relying on their accumulated knowledge of the continent to provide an informed opinion, including facts in their argument as illustration rather than demonstration. One reading in particular, from Bayard, stands out -- the author claimed to present a descriptive theory of how Africans interacted with the rest of the world, all in 50 pages. "

            "\u00a0Yes! A wonderful course if youre interested in African studies. Youll not only get to analyze Africa from an anthropological perspective, but will develop broad tools relevant for any type of cultural anthropology. I had never taken an anthropology course before, but this was truly wonderful. Great students, great discussion, and a great professor who really cares about the development of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a wonderful anthropology seminar with a professor who clearly cares a lot about the topic. I also really like that the course is taken by a mixture of undergraduates and graduates, allowing for more experiences and viewpoints to enter the discussion than in an undergrad-only seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! As long as you are interested in doing the readings, you will get a lot out of it. It would be possible to get through the course without engaging the readings too much, so I would only recommend for people who really are excited about the material. I also think it's a great course for people who are interested in anthropology even if they have never take an into anthro course before. "
