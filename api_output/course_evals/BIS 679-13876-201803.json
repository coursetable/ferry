            "\u00a0Although with a name of \"Advanced Programming\", this course is still teaching basic level content. I was hoping the course could let students using those programming to work on some real advanced projects which are more related to real research, not so many homework that you need to follow the instruction from the instructor to get the points. \r\n\r\nI couldn't believe the debugging techniques were never taught during the whole semester. I don't know how students will do their future complicated projects using the programming language without debugging skills.\r\n\r\nStudents need to be very careful to read the instructor's homework description in order to submit an answer that is exactly what the instructor is expecting to get the points. Programming is an art and flexible, so it should be a fun class to do, not afraid of losing points so I have to use the same way as the instructor expecting. \r\n\r\nTaking much longer time to get feedback from the homework, always wait couple weeks to get the grade for a homework. The instructor was hoping to get understanding from students regarding her busy schedule, but I don't think it is a mutual understanding from both parties. \r\n\r\nA timed exam for programming? This is not Hackathon! ",
            "\u00a0This course was fast paced and there is a lot of material covered. I felt like I learned a lot of new skills that I haven't gotten from any other course. However, the midterm and final exams did not seem like a fair assessment of my skills or knowledge or ability to problem solve. Rather, it seemed like a race against the clock. Due to how the course was structured, the midterm was a cumulative exam on SAS, and the final was a cumulative exam on R. Both exams were allotted 2 hours to answer 4-6 questions. 2 hours did not feel like enough time to allow students to show their full abilities. I think that it would be a better measure of our abilities if either (a) we are given 3-4 hours of time per exam so that it is not our ability to type quickly, but our knowledge with the program itself that is being tested. Or (b) if the same format of questions is given along with the cumulative homework assignments and there is no formal exam process, essentially making it a take home exam. I did appreciate the format of the exam questions - it is one thing to know how to code, and another to know how to correct errors in code or make code more efficient. So the exam questions themselves are a good measure, but the time limit does not fully allow students to work effectively, and it means that a lot of points can be lost simply due to time. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is I learn lots of practical programming codes which are useful for my research. The weaknesses is the teacher didn't teach you how to debug and the homework and exam is kind of excess what she taught us. ",
            "\u00a0Class notes are straightforward and very useful to keep. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course. I liked the weekly homeworks because they helped me solidify what we had discussed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great. I learned a lot about SAS and R. In particular how to make my codes reproducible and more generalizable. As a non-biostats student, I think this course will help me program my analysis more efficiently. I think a challenge for me was understanding the applicability of some of the content taught in the R component of the course. While I understand simulations are important in clinical trial design, we did too much of it in the end portion of the course. As a CDE student, I would have loved to learn to program my own regressions (i.e. having multiple exposures and risk factors), power calculations and bivariate analysis code. For example, I would benefit tremendously from writing a code that outputs tables that journals normally want to see like forest plots, or ORs tables, or tables with point estimates, confidence intervals etc. Writing a code that accounted for study design (i.e. case control vs cohort vs clinical trial) and then ran all my regressions would have been more useful for the non-biostats students. While I think I am able to use what we learned to do the things I describe above, having this be class examples makes it easier to understand the material and programming in R. It becomes more applicable to what I am used to. The fact that we did simulations for a lot of the assignments made the course more challenging, and actually led to some of my classmates from SBS and CDE to drop the course. They didn't understand the relevance of programming. The SAS component did achieve all these things as the material was very relevant to what I normally do when I have a data set that I will analyze. I think learning similar dataset management techniques in R would have been more useful for the non-biostats students. I wish the R and SAS classes were provided in separate courses over 1 year where students can engage with their own personal datasets and learn each program pretty in depth. Leaving the course with a code that works for my specific type of dataset would have been fabulous, specially because I work with very large population-based cancer datasets and clinical trial datasets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was pretty good overall. I think some of the material (i.e. PROC SQL) was taught in a very rushed manner ",

            "\u00a0Overall it's a good class. Dr. Esserman is very patient and she explained the code line by line. But the homework instructions should be more clear. Should teach students how to debug their code in class. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course and I enjoyed the material. However, it should be made very clear at the beginning of the class that it is a VERY challenging course and that a comfort with R is necessary to do well. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really useful for practicing the data cleaning and programming, however, the midterm and the final which require writing code in less than 2 hours are really stressful. ",

            "\u00a0The course is helpful.  Material is useful in real world application.\r\n\r\nStrength: clear note, helpful labs, clear homework\r\n\r\nWeakness: lack of real-world project, too strict scoring policy for homework\r\n\r\nImprove: change the big homework into small project, somewhat loosen the scoring policy of code ",
            "\u00a0The lecture itself is once per week, two hours every time. I wish we could meet twice a week and have a shorter lecture so that we can focus more. ",
            "\u00a0Alright class. The SAS component is painful and there are too many assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course covered important basics of SAS and R, but I wished that the exams were assignments instead because in real life we wouldn't really be asked to code under time constraint, especially for those of us with no prior coding background. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is an excellent crash course in advanced statistical programming.  I thought that the 2nd half of the course for R is more organized than the SAS part.  \r\n\r\nI felt that some of the initial HWs for SAS involved so much material that we did not cover or was simple too advanced.  For instance, the 'missover' keyword (or another similar keyword) was not discussed but it was needed for a homework problem.  The course is really difficult for the most part.  But the TF helped a lot of those with less programming background.  I believe learning could be maximized if they were two TFs for extra office hours help. ",
            "\u00a0The R part of the course is noticeably more difficult compared to the SAS part. It would be better if the lab part could provide more examples that would help with the homework. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent. I did not have any background in SAS or R and made a huge improvement by the end of the term. This may be why I spent so much time completing the assignments for this course, but I think compared to the other courses, comparatively there is a higher workload for this course. I think it would be helpful for students to be able to drop the lowest homework grade or to have at least one fewer assignment during the last week of class. Nevertheless, this course was outstanding and worth the effort. ",
            "\u00a0Is a very useful class and I like it. ",
            "\u00a0course was really helpful but workload of the assignments are not the same, some weeks we spend couple of hours studying but in between 3-5th and 9-11th homeworks we spend so much time, plus studied for the final. Especially during midterm and finals week assignments should not be that complicated, or big homeworks might way more than 30%. ",
