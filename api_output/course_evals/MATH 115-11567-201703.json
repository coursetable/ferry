            "\u00a0The course overall is well-managed. Despite the relatively large number of sections and students, I can tell that it is well-run behind the scenes. Information is frequently posted on Canvas and work is due on a consistent basis. I think the idea of a \"flipped classroom\" makes it a bit difficult; our professor just taught us most of the material in class the next day anyway, which definitely helped. The midterm and final review sessions were very helpful. Challenging but good course overall. ",
            "\u00a0The videos that were intended to teach the lessons were not clear and did not help me understand the material. Therefore, I learned most of the material on my own using the textbook and other online tutorials and informational videos. However, I felt like the tests were accurately designed for what we had learned and never felt like we were thrown a curve ball on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course included resources such as office hours and peer tutors, and the availability of practice tests (past exams) before each midterm or final.\r\nThe course could be improved with more examples of problems and walk-throughs of these problems, instead of heavy reliance on proofs or theory. ",
            "\u00a0the course teaches calculus in a very poor way. the topics are made unnecessarily complicated when they can be simplified much more. ",
            "\u00a0I thought learning from the videos first was helpful because you came to class with some background in the topic ",
            "\u00a0The exams gave little room for error. I felt that although the questions were very challenging and tested the students' knowledge, it made the exams very stressful to take. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was great overall. The workload was fair as were the evaluations. I thought the professor did a great job going over the topics, and the homework videos introduced the topics very well. I think the course could be improved by having a part of a class devoted to going over problem sets after they had been graded. ",
            "\u00a0I found that the pace of the class was very good as well as the workload. I do not have anything poor to say about this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that the homeworks and midterms are pretty fair.\r\nWeaknesses are the review sessions for the midterms and finals, which could definitely be improved ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Clark\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Classroom organization/size, teaching method, peer tutors, review sessions\r\n\r\nClassroom organization/size: In the beginning of the year, there weren't enough desks for students to sit down in the class. We later moved classrooms, but this problem will probably pop up again next year so I thought I'd mention it. \r\n\r\nTeaching method: I found the flipped classroom much more difficult than traditional style. The quizzes were easy enough that I could muddle through them without truly understanding the material. A lot of times I had to relearn the lesson from my professor or another student later. Sometimes I would struggle and struggle with a concept the video had explained, then ask someone for help and find out the concept was relatively simple. The lack of examples was another weakness of the flipped lesson style. There were a few times where I wanted another example or clarification on one step, but I couldn't get that because there's a set video and that's it. I'm sure there are ways to improve upon the videos to address these concerns, but really I think the best change would be to return to a traditional teaching style.\r\n\r\nPeer tutors: The peer tutors were not bad teachers, they were just overwhelmed with students sometimes. It's not reasonable for one tutor to give equal amounts of attention to 25 students. I think this could be improved by adding more peer tutors during peak times (night before a pset is due, week before a test) and in the beginning of the year. These temporary tutors would help ensure that peer tutoring is more effective.\r\n\r\nReview Sessions: None of the review sessions I attended were helpful. Sometimes it was because the examples were very simple, sometimes because we spent a long time going over one or two concepts and didn't make it to the rest of the material. I think review sessions could be more useful if they focused on the most difficult problems that we would face and detailed all of the common mistakes associated with solving each type of problem. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom setting is the worst way imaginable to teach a class. It makes it impossible to receive help when first learning new concepts, which is the most critical time to ask questions. During class, it was also difficult to have questions answered because there would rarely be time to address everyone's questions, so I also felt like going to class was not a good use of my time. The only good thing I can say about this class is that it rewards students who already know the material or who are good at self-teaching via the videos and textbook. ",
            "\u00a0I disliked the flipped classroom teaching style. I thought it was an ineffective way to learn, especially if you had never been exposed to the topics learned in this course. The online quizzes took an extraordinary amount of time for something that had no impact on our final grade. The practice exams given to us were way easier than the tests themselves, and lack of clarity on the grading process made this class even worse. I think this class could have benefitted from mandatory sections. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the flipped classroom style of this course. This allowed us to first be introduced to the concepts individually, then we went over things students were confused about in class. This forced students to engage with the material more which I thought was conducive to better learning. The Canvas quizzes were helpful but frustrating if one did not understand the concept immediately. I think that there should be retrys of the quizzes after one has gone over the concepts in class. Hints on the quizzes would be helpful if one has attempted three times and still does not get the question correct. In addition, I think that after the quizzes are submitted, we should be able to see the proof or a walk-through of the problem for future reference. ",
            "\u00a0Math has never really been a strong subject for me - I have a hard time with conceptual questions, so the exams were extremely difficult for me. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt like the videos we had to watch before class Because they rarely represented what was actually going in class the next day, and was just very simple examples of what we learned ",
            "\u00a0Course is taught through a sequence of online videos, most of which are very poorly done and too shallow. The quizzes provided dont seem to give any real insight to the matieral because they are too simple compared to the much more advanced homework problems. Class generally meets two to three times a week and ranges from 25-35 students. Lectures tend to re-teach the material from the videos because the videos dont describe the information in enough depth. In short, be prepared to do a lot of reading from the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a great job of teaching a conceptual understanding of the content, e.g. the relationship between Riemann sums and integral calculus. \r\n\r\nHowever, I think the course would be better if it had more detailed explanations of how to solve problems, in particular in regards to methods and steps, e.g., strategies for solving difficult problems rather than just for setting them up. \r\n\r\nFurther, I found the flipped classroom structure hard to follow. The prep videos were very basic in their explanation and complex in their examples, so they were hard to follow. The textbook required prior knowledge/explanation to understand. Some students, including myself, simply learn better in the classroom. I think this course would benefit from having at least a few sections offered in a non-flipped style. \r\n\r\nFurther, at some points, this course was very fast paced. At other times, we spent a lot of time on easy content. Time allocation could be better. For instance, we spent a lot of time on Riemann sums at the beginning of term (a fairly simple concept), but little time learning Taylor Polynomials (a harder topic). ",
            "\u00a0The TAs did not know the material exceedingly well ",
            "\u00a0The videos were poor on quality and the sections lacked engagement. ",
            "\u00a0I did not like that the deadline for the videos is 4 am. If you extended the deadline to 10 am, students would have time to wake up and watch it and be more prepared for the class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty good. Decent balance of work and lecture. Sometimes long homework sets though that took awhile to complete with other coursework. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It's very important if you plan on pursuing any math-related career, and it's definitely a leg up from high school BC Calc. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend my specific section to any other student. I did not get anything out of the in-class time and often left class more confused than before. If a student were to take this class I would advise them to be prepared to learn essentially all the information on their own as the videos were of little help to me as well. ",

However, if any student is not required to take this class, they should not take it because it is poorly taught and too much work for too little of a reward. For students who like to ask questions as they are learning and learn best through practice, this class is not structured to accommodate that. Until it becomes a regularly taught course, I cannot recommend this class to anyone who is not absolutely required to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. Yes, because at the end of the day, you will have learned more math. But no, because I believe this course can and should be improved upon. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in the economics or math majors. This is not an easy class, but there are definitely harder math classes out there. ",
            "\u00a0If it is required for a major, yes. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, probably not (other courses are probably more intellectually stimulating, and there are easier/funner QR credits). ",
