It does not explain the material very clearly and does not include examples that actually demonstrate how a certain topic or decomposition method can be applied to a problem. There are a lot more recent textbooks that are much better at explaining the course material and have clearly worked example problems in each chapter.\r\n\r\nHowever, I thought lectures were pretty clear and better organized than the textbook, which helped.\r\n\r\nThe exams in the course are often too long (especially the midterm, though this was rectified slightly with the final). They also have a section of problems where students must \"construct a matrix\" that satisfies certain properties, and while these problems are reasonable in theory, they often require arbitrary guessing and lucky application of certain matrix principles. I think that these types of problems don't accurately reflect students' understanding of matrix properties because they require a lot of guessing and luck with finding the right principles to apply. In the future, if the instructor wishes to continue to put these types of problems on exams, he should also include practice \"constructing matrix\" problems on the problem sets to expose students earlier to this type of problem. I think these types of problems are particularly difficult on exams because students don't have any exposure or practice with this type of thinking, other than a handful of practice problems on the practice final. \r\n\r\nI also wish the course focused more on the application of matrices, as such is indicated in the course title. The class focused heavily on theory and didn't really focus on the application side, which was a little disappointing. ",

I think it could be improved if we got more of a sense of real-world applications to data etc., not just problem solving without a real-world context. I also think that it was difficult to prepare for the exams because the problems we were given were often very different from the problem sets and exams--they were fair and on topic, it was just hard to prepare for the types of questions we got. The exam practice questions were very simple and the problems on the tests complex, so even if you understood the material it was difficult to prepare for how to go about the problems. ",

            "\u00a0This course was unclear and poorly taught. The material itself was not very challenging, but I lacked an understanding of how various concepts related to each other and how to apply them to more than basic problems.

            "\u00a0Gilbert Strang's textbook (the one used for this class) was terrible. It had so many typos, incorrect answers in the back of the book, and unexplained examples which was especially annoying in a class that emphasizes computation.\r\n\r\nYuchen (the professor) was very good. He gave the necessary examples in class, but unfortunately I didn't attend class enough to benefit from it.

            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of material which is great. However, I believe that it would be better if we spend some time talking about the theory and the geometry so we better understand the computations that we carry out. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the TF and the weakness was the disorganization of the professor. He did not do a good job of explaining key concepts and jumps in logic he made. The exams were not well made. Making better tests and spending time answering questions and actually engaging with the class would be some ways to improve. ",
            "\u00a0The course' textbook, Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications 4th Edition (2006), was a great resource to supplement (and some times substitute) the often confusing and hard to follow lectures. A second weakness of the course was the structure of the first midterm. The time allotted for the exam in relation to the difficulty and length of the exam's content led to the failure of many students to even finish the test. While I believe it was not the intention of Professor Liu to put his students in that position, I think the Math Department could have and should have offered him, a first-time professor, more support in teaching the course. ",
            "\u00a0I know this is specific to the specific iteration of the course I took this past semester, but the discussion sections seemed to be this course's greatest strength. The graduate student TA, George Linderman, was wonderfully helpful and always explained concepts from class in much greater detail than Professor Liu. George's passion for the subject was plainly evident, and even a bit contagious; he really helped me enjoy the course.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses: the name of the course is \"Linear Algebra with Applications,\" so one would expect that there would be more to the class than just the applications. That much was true. One would also expect that the theory behind those applications and algorithms would be emphasized so that students would understand the meaning behind the rote calculations instead of hastily mentioned and then never brought up again. That was not so. Coming away from the course, I remember all the kinds of decompositions and processes we learned, like Gram-Schmidt, normalization, QR decomposition, SVD, LDU decomposition, and so on, but it's much harder, if not impossible, for me to appreciate the value of those applications of linear algebra.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I fail to understand the reasoning behind Professor Liu's prohibition of calculators on exams. It's quite obvious that we're not being tested on our arithmetic skills, so what's the point in forcing us to do Gaussian elimination by hand every single time? If he suspected that we would use calculators to get the exact answers to every single question he asked, asking us to show our work in detail would have sufficed; no calculator I know of gives step-by-step solutions as opposed to just spitting out an answer.

The following resources helped: The course' textbook, Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra and its Applications 4th Edition (2006), was a great resource to supplement (and often times substitute) the often confusing and hard to follow lectures. Gilbert Strang's MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra Lectures on MIT OpenCourseWare (on YouTube) can arguably replace most lectures altogether, however one shouldn't skip class because a course eval told you its possible.
