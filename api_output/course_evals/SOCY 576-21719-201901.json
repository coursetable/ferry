            "\u00a0This course is most certainly a specialty course, and requires a lot of background knowledge of social theory. I think that the student engagement would be improved if the students were either given the opportunity to review foundations like Durkheim and Weber and Marx, etc... or that there was a prerequisite required to take the class. It would make a great series with social theory and cultural sociology. I think this would bring the engagement up higher. Also, more structured facilitation for discussion would be helpful. "
