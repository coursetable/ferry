            "\u00a0I learned basic microeconomics very easily. Tolga gave many opportunities to review with him and he allowed us to ask any questions. So, I was never concerned with asking a question if I was too embarrassed. He made it very easy to learn the material by telling us exactly what we needed to know. ",

            "\u00a0Analyzing the behaviors of consumers and firms ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I developed skills to better understand economic modeling and theory, providing me with useful insight into consumer behavior and market structures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic economic principles and equations to better understand consumer and firm behavior. "

            "\u00a0The strengths are that he reinforces the concepts well and makes the mathematics very easy. Also, theres a Friday math session that was very helpful in asking last minute questions or reinforcing tough concepts. The office hours were always informative and always helped answer the psets. I can think no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Tolga is a beast ",
            "\u00a0The seminar-style of a course such as this one also benefits the student greatly since it allows them to build a relationship with the professor and feel as if their voice is being heard. In addition, lectures are posted online which allows you to keep the material fresh in your mind. ",
            "\u00a0The concepts presented in the course were always engaging and there was never a dull class. The professor and peer tutors were always easily accessible and very helpful. However, I wish we had gotten more practice problems for revision for the midterm and exams, specifically for essay questions. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar version of the course had a great vibe and provided ample opportunities for us to ask questions or go over illustrative examples. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if youre too afraid of tough mathematics, this is the course for you. I tried doing the Econ 110 seminar and I found that too hard as I had never experienced any economics and it felt very fast. I believe anyone could do well in Econ 108. Just out in the work and try to learn the material. He also tells you what questions are exactly on the exam, so you know how to prepare. Overall, one of my favorite classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, mostly because of Tolga though ",
            "\u00a0We're all consumers and may be producers in the future, so I think that this course will benefit anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for people who have never taken econ and want to explore the field. While I don't foresee myself continuing much further into economics, this course gave me useful insights into the nature of the markets and firms that dominate our current epoch. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend taking the seminar version of intro econ. Tolga is a great guy and he cares about making class fun. His memorable examples will definitely help cement the concepts for you. Things move fairly quickly so if you're bad at math like I am, I'd definitely recommend reading the textbook. "
