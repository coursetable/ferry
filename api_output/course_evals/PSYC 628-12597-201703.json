            "\u00a0Overall the class was interesting and discussions were engaging. I would have appreciated more review of parts of the brain and their major functions in the first class, or at least a review of the parts that were highlighted a lot in the readings. Although the instructor touched on this, I would have appreciated a bit more connection of parts of the brain with different functions relevant to the class material. Other than that the course was really great. I enjoyed all of the activities that helped demonstrate different phenomena. Discussion topics got more interesting every week. I especially liked the \"social\" decision making topics. Also, the game we played on the last day was fun! I have confidence that next time it will go smoother and would recommend it again. "
