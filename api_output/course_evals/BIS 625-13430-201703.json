The only suggestion that I have is that there were a couple of problem sets in which the material covered in the problem set was presented in lecture after the problem set was due - ensuring that the problem sets closely follow lecture material might have been helpful.

            "\u00a0Course was okay in the sense that the material was easy to understand. The homework took too much time because too many problems were given and the code was not taught adequately at the start of the semester. \r\nThe course did not teach SAS to students who had not taken the pre-requesite at Yale, although the description indicated that no prior experience was needed. The final project was okay. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was below average. \r\n\r\nStrengths:\r\nThe course was strong in how it was laid out, with material building in a logically sequential manner. The professor and TAs were all approachable and helpful in one-on-one interaction. Homework assignments took a reasonable amount of time to complete. There was some effort to amend the class based on participant feedback.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThere were unclear expectations as to the pre-requisites for students. It was not specified that prior SAS experience was required, and yet the course was structured as if all students were proficient. This should have been explicitly stated in the course description. The lectures were overly theoretical, with little application of concepts outside of the homework assignments. The lab sessions were often not useful outside of the slide deck, which contained the SAS code needed to complete homework assignments. Questions during class were not encouraged given the lack of clear responses and the tone of responses, which seemed to question why we did not know the answer already. Feedback on homework assignments were vague, often without any comments.\r\n\r\nBased on the comments above, I think the course could be improved in the following three ways:\r\n1) Specify that prior SAS knowledge is a pre-requisite in the course description. \r\n2) Provide more examples of application of concepts in class and in the lab sessions.\r\n3) Provide more detailed feedback in graded homework assignments.
