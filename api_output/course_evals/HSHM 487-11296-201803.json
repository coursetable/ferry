            "\u00a0I came to think about medical technologies and their relation to constructions of disability a little bit more seriously. Broadly, I understood disability was constructed, but I was grateful for this course's focus on chronic illness. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an incredibly knowledge of the array of disabilities that are present within our world - as well as the fact that disability is very much a socially-constructed category. I also learned about disability rights and activism measures throughout the years and the steps that still need to be taken in order to actually achieve equity for people living with visible and/or invisible disabilities. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about disability history, what it means to be disabled, and how disability is perceived in society ",
            "\u00a0I had no knowledge of disability studies prior to taking this class. I gained a lot of very important information about how disability frameworks can be used to critique various ways of viewing, understanding, and structuring the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of disability (mostly in the U.S./Western countries) from the late 1800s to modern times. I learned how to write a longer paper (~20 pages) and a secondary source analysis. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course requires so much reading; it is a bit overkill. I was very interested in the subject, but was so rushed to read all the work that I ended up not learning a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting topic but too much reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength is that it is a good intro-level course for students who have never thought seriously about disability. However, I felt that the greatest weakness was that there was so little attention paid to race or queerness in the syllabus. I would have liked to see those themes, particularly in intersection with disability, explored. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were definitely the wide array of topics we covered - as well as the various forms of disability covered. I also appreciate how Dr. Elder was willing to take student input into consideration when choosing readings. I cannot think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0S: interesting content, interesting readings, great feedback given on assignments, paper deadlines along the way were helpful \r\nW: some class discussions did not flow as well as others, maybe we could have used the questions written by students in a more direct way in the class, maybe rearrange the weeks to have some topics/modes of thinking come before others ",
            "\u00a0The course schedule was very organized and published early on. It was relatively easy to know what to do from week to week. The deadlines for the paper, while early, were reasonable and helpful for getting the assignment done in manageable chunks. Perhaps having a complete draft due a day or two before the final draft would be helpful in making sure students have time to edit and revise, but I know that the final draft is due during finals season so it might be an issue with time for some people. Also, the topics and the readings were generally interesting. Having a short assignment every week (writing discussion questions) made me engage with the material more. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I felt like the material/direction of the class could feel unclear at times. In class, it was sometimes difficult to know if we should engage with a source as an academic work (analyzing the structure, citations, etc.), a purely historical piece (compared to other historical events), or something that could be connected to phenomena we see today. The discussion felt a little one-sided at times because, both in the class and in the readings, there seemed to be a narrative thread of disabled people \"versus\" caretakers, doctors, the \"normate,\" etc. and authors/students \"siding\" with the disabled people on every issue. (While I enjoyed seeing such positivity for disabled people, I also would have liked more nuance in the discussion.) I also think that re-evaluating the workload and pacing of the class would be good. Towards the middle/end, assignments seemed to pile on without a reduction in the usual reading load every week, which made it difficult to finish everything. I also feel like it would have been good to take short breaks in the discussion and to prioritize some discussion of assignments, expectations, desired direction for the discussion, etc. in class over just purely discussing content. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very well organized and the readings were really engaging. At times discussion seemed kind of regimented by reading, and I wish we had incorporated the discussion questions more explicitly into our conversations. "

            "\u00a0Fine class, just a lot of reading. Interesting topic. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who has never thought about disability in a serious way before, but not to students remotely versed in the social construction of disability. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I came in with the goal of learning more about disability in its various aspects and did just that. I can now talk a lot more confidently and informed with the people in my life who may be living with disabilities or dealing with disabilities in the world from day to day. Also, I became a lot more conscientious of the representation of people living with disability in the media. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes - like other modes of social critique, disability studies is an essential tool to understanding power structures and identity ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I feel like how much you enjoy this class will be dependent on what kind of person you are and who you take it with. In the semester that I took the class (perhaps because of the specific group I was with), it had a strong social justice-y vibe. I know that some people really enjoy that sort of class environment and that others would probably want a more nuanced discussion. Either way, though, you will definitely learn a lot of interesting disability history and read some awesome, thought-provoking content. The 20-page paper and relatively early deadlines can be daunting, but the pacing of the final-paper-related assignments makes it so that you won't be doing everything last minute, which is nice. That being said, in the middle and towards the end, the workload gets significantly heavier from writing assignments on top of the usual readings. "
