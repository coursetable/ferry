            "\u00a0Learned R, became a more critical reader ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of things that are huge gaps in the undergraduate PLSC program: namely, experimental design, how to write a literature review, an entire literature about descriptive and bureaucratic representation, etc. Most of all, I think I learned what it takes to do experimental political science. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about empirical statistical data; basic statistics mechanisms; how to analyze social science papers; how to write a social science empirical research paper ",

            "\u00a0Discussion driven class in which people came from a myriad of different levels/experiences; discussions felt undermoderated but were nonetheless interesting. The Prof. was trying to push people which was good, but not everybody knew where we were being pushed. Could have used more structure or some discussion slides or something. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is Professor Fang. Without a doubt, he might be the smartest professor I have had during my four years at Yale. You can ask him a question about any PLSC related topic and then hell just relay you 45 relevant articles. His expertise is essential to helping students with their projects, and he is able to give constructive feedback that is both stern by affirming. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the topics covered are incredibly interesting. The rest of the PLSC department doesnt really ground itself in experimental researchbeing more focused on political philosophy and observational studiesso its really cool to see this play out. I also appreciated that given the PLSC departments lack of scholars on race, gender, and ethnicity, that Professor Fang made it a point to highlight these areas. \r\n\r\nMy biggest critique of this course is that it is too ambitious and high leveled for a one semester undergraduate course. To be blunt, the undergraduate PLSC program does not prepare students to understand statistics methodology or experimental designand Professor Fang did not take this into account when designing the assignments. The goal of designing a project, collecting data, and writing a full research project is not something that most of us were equipped to do, and as a result I think that most of us felt really lost and behind for most of the semester. Because of these methodological gaps that students have, we didnt get to do justice to each weekly reading, and it occasionally felt like there was just too much content without enough direction. \r\n\r\nI think that this course, in order to be its best, needs to be fundamentally retooled and sold as a PLSC methodology course, which the department currently lacks. Professor Fang could teach a yearlong senior capstone, or do a class in the fall that prepares seniors to do independent research for their theses in the spring. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend the course with the understanding that there is a large final project, and there is a steep learning curve. Prepare for class and understand that you need to do more than skim the readings for the broad pictures! ",
