            "\u00a0The course covers a great variety of topics with application cases. However, the lectures can be better organized for more cohesiveness, and some aspects (especially derivation and understanding of the equations and conclusions) could be explained in greater details. Also, the exams attach a little too much importance to memorizing contents. ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a lot of theoretical topics, and helped us build up a more rigorous foundation in statistics/biostatistics. The slides were clearer than the textbook, since the latter was a little old-fashioned (not necessarily in a bad way). The workload was moderate and appropriate. This course would be even better if more intuitions could be given on top of the theoretical claims - since it can be difficult but helpful to develop intuition based on so much algebra. ",

Workload for this course was just the right amount that I practiced enough with having too much burden. \r\nThe only thing I dont really like was that we had two exams this semester, while it used to be one exam and one final project. I hope to work on a project so that I can apply what I have learnt to real word problems. ",

You do need to think over and over to get better sense of what's going on. And I hope the instructor can put in some of his chalk proof into slides as well. "
