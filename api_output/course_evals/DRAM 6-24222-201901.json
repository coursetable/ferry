Nahuel was brilliant and led an informative and engaging discussion whereas Ashley led a group that actively discussed but with what often felt like no structured purpose. \r\n\r\nIn the main lecture, this balance did not exist on any level. Paul presented in full lecture except the first lesson on the first day of fall semester (which was the best class lecture he had). ",

The essay assignment this semester did not lend itself to the study of theatre history or the developments within, rather it focused on the dramaturgical analysis of a script of choice. Which then begs the question -- is this a theatre history course or a dramaturgy 101 course? ",

On the other hand, Ashley rarely if ever mentioned / referenced the readings. ",

            "\u00a0I think the video lectures are a good idea and were a great resource for people who were ESL or just had learning styles that make it difficult for them to absorb information audibly. The video lectures give people the opportunity to pause and take more useful notes. \r\n\r\nI think going forward the way in which the PowerPoint lectures are used could be reexamined. Right now they are clearly being used as a visual aide meant to accompany the lecture, where pictures or images offer context for what is being said by the speaker but offer very little informational value on their own. The PPs are the primary resource students use for studying for the exams and, in my experience, finding the pertinent information in the slideshows can be difficult because they weren't designed to be independently informative but to be an auxiliary lecture took. I would like to see the use of these PowerPoint to be re-examined because I think with the speed of the lectures many people dont have the opportunity to take very detailed notes and therefore rely on these slideshows for review.

It's a difficult task being the shortage of lecture time he has to teach 4000 years of history over the myriad of cultures, which results in unfortunate things being omitted or breezed over like covering 1000 years of Japanese theatre in one day, but I appreciate that to give more time to one subject means to take away from another and I cant imagine, going through the course, what i would eliminate from the syllabus.

However, the lecture moves a mile a minute and the powerpoint offers up entirely different information making it near impossible to take effective notes during lecture. Depending on which TA you get will determine whether you are able to take effective notes during session to make up for the lecture. Paul posts the power points on canvas but they are extremely difficult to follow without the lectures because of how he puts in multiple slides showing the same information... He also refuses to give out his lectures unless the students are english as a second language / foreign students. If Paul is going to continue his format and lecture style, I honestly think he should write a textbook for the course so that all students can have a chance to feel adequately prepared for exams, lectures, and discussion.
