            "\u00a0MUCH firmer grasp on the language than when I walked in! I have become a closer reader and become much more familiar with the grammatical strcutures of Greek thanks to how Alex structured the course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much more complete and technical understanding of Greek grammar, and a capacity to efficiently read Greek prose. ",
            "\u00a0This class is an excellent mid level Greek class. I was able to dust off my introductory Greek knowledge, gain familiarity with the grammar and vocabulary I'd already learned, and practice copious translations by reading Plato and Herodotus. I think my skills have improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Review & solidifying Greek syntax & common vocab, very brief survey of styles and contents of Plato's dialogues and Herodotus; the kind of class where growth is invisible throughout most of the term, but then you realize by the end of the course the facility with which you can read Greek prose. ",
            "\u00a0My Greek improved exponentially in nearly every respect while taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0How to read Greek prose. ",
            "\u00a0I tightened up my knowledge of Greek grammar and syntax. I also got to read and get aquatinted with some amazing and important texts of Plato and Herodotus. "

            "\u00a0The course was extremely fair because of the way that it was taught. Alex did an incredible job really making the expectations clear and creating examinations that would genuinely help me test my own knowledge on the material and would prepare me for the midterms. I think that the only weakness was the weekend assignments. While is absolutely fair to have weekend assignments, I wish that they were scheduled on the syllabus so that I could properly prepare. Some weekends (including family weekend) became overwhelming with an extra assignment due Monday that was assigned on Friday (and was expected to be revised at least once in the span of those days). ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely incredible - I'd venture to say perfect. The course balanced interesting readings which furthered my skills at reading Greek prose with helpful grammar exercises which solidified my knowledge of Greek grammar. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent next step for the Greek beginner. It helps to solidify the concepts learn, add new layers, and practice with \"grown up\" Greek texts. I don't really have much by way of suggestions for improvement! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great material, accessible pace. \r\nWeaknesses: Taught by a grad student. We should have read more Herodotus ",
            "\u00a0Personally I think there could have been more breadth to the kinds of prose we read, but that was more due to popular demand than anything. I did enjoy being able to read two works of Plato and see how different the styles were. ",
            "\u00a0The course is rigorous and fast paced. I loved the speed and the need for discipline. I also loved the texts we read. It would be great to read the symposium as well! "

            "\u00a0Yes! This is a good course for students both coming out of GREK 125 or out of the L1/L2 sequence. The course will give a much firmer grasp of the grammar and will give more practice with synthesizing information from the early Greek courses.\r\n\r\nThis might not always be the case since the teacher is typically a rotating upper-level graduate student in the Classics department, but I would be prepared for the class to be some work. Because there is such an emphasis on the grammar portions, it is good to set aside the appropriate amount of time to do the learning well the first time grammar is tested. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to improve their Greek, and read some incredible Greek prose along the way. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to a Greek student! It's fun to dive into the texts and work on the grammar along the way. It's a lot of work, but it always felt like productive work. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, do it if you're in the process of learning greek at Yale. It's not an exceptional class, but it's an important step, and will improve your understanding of the language. \r\n\r\nThe texts covered vary slightly from year to year. This year we read Plato's Crito, parts of Book I of Herodotus, and the first half or so of Plato's Ion. \r\n\r\nThe quality of the course will vary with the grad student who teaches it. \r\n\r\nDo not expect to be doing much real thinking about the texts your reading: the class is focused on mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Great class, great introduction to Greek prose. Make sure to keep up with the readings, memorize vocab & grammar early on, and you won't have trouble. Reviewing last night's readings in the morning before class also really helps. Alex is very reasonable in his assignments & his grading. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: if you want to read Greek, to learn how to read Plato and Herodotus, and eventually even Homer, the course is a must. "
