            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is having a well organized and planned course that can teach effectively Spanish to beginners. By making students work on all skills of the language and continuous assessment, it has improved students' language level. Improvement can be for example having native speakers come for a day and challenging oneself to fully speak in Spanish and other methods to learn the natural flow. ",

I think a weakness of the course was that we didn't do nearly as much reading and writing as I felt we needed to do. I struggled much more on the reading and written exams because it isn't as common in class. Maybe having some more written worksheets would be much more helpful. ",

I took pictures of the homework schedule on Day 1 and was able to follow that schedule with revision for the rest of the semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Attending this course every day (M-F) weakened my engagement, so maybe a M-T or MWF course would've been better for my motivation to attend. ",
