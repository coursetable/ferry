            "\u00a0I learned how diatonic music is based in and builds on pentatonic music, I learned how to think about and analyze harmony, and how to think about musical relationships in a more profound way. This course fundamentally restored my faith in the music department and makes me excited to take more music classes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to compose simple compositions using harmonic chords. I learned about pentatonic and diatonic scales, all the different chords, and other things such as transcription and sight-singing. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I developed my skills in music theory through composition and real-life examples. I also gained more confidence in my ability to compose music. ",
            "\u00a0I found this course to be quite magical. We learned about elementary principles of music, but from a folk standpoint instead of the traditional elitist European classical musical approach. There was heavy emphasis on shape notes, how parts interact with one another, chord analysis, and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned way more about the pentatonic scale than I thought possible. I learned how to write four part harmonies, and the more advanced music theory necessary to write decent sounding compositions. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of harmony in composing and singing. An appreciation for American hymn music. ",
            "\u00a0A note for all of these reviews: This is not actually the 210 curriculum. It was an experimental theory class. \r\n\r\nI became a better sight reader, gained a better understanding of melody and harmony. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths of the experimental section include singing together extensively and using unknown vocabulary to describe how musical phenomena work before translating them into actual music talk. Some of the concepts had to be drilled in my head via Canvas quiz though, so I wish there were a more engaging way to pick up those concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class could have been more structured, and sometimes concepts were introduced after we experimented with ideas. However, the professor facilitated a very nice seminar because he was very fun and engaged with every student. ",
            "\u00a0I loved that this course was arranged in a way that made learning new theory topics seamless with composing. At the end of the semester, when looking back at everything I had learned, there were things that I had not realized I had actually \"learned\" because the learning and practice process was so seamless that it felt like information I had always known. I also loved ",
            "\u00a0This course was an experiment that got added to the list of courses near the end of the reading period. The only thing I could say that would needed to be improved is the way material is passed out. Instead of loose collections of papers, it might be better to distribute it in a more organized fashion. However, this issue will be fixed by next time since it was just an experiment this time. ",
            "\u00a0This course was one of my favorite classes I have ever taken at Yale, but only because it was the \"experimental\" section with Professor Quinn. I had so much fun singing every class and the time during class always flew by. The concepts were always a paradigm shift from the traditional 210 class, which was exciting.\r\n\r\nThe class was pretty unorganized, but that's not surprising given the experimental nature of the course. I felt like we could have moved at twice the pace, especially in the beginning of the semester. There also wasn't much feedback for any of our work. ",
            "\u00a0Very open and accepting classroom. Never afraid to ask questions. Material very interesting, but often confusing. \r\nPerhaps having a dictionary of terms with examples and example excercises could be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of practical applications (ie singing, sight reading, working with the understanding that rules are fluid). It is exciting to work with music outside the classical cannon, and to work within a framework that does not require strict adherence to rules.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think that never receiving any sort of feedback (whether that be a written comment, grade, etc) was not best for our growth as learners. I think hearing criticism of our work and positive feedback would make the course feel more like we were accomplishing something. Ideally, every assignment would have some sort of response. In other classes, this takes the form of grades, but I understand that might not be best for this type of work and that written responses are more time consuming for the instructor. But I think having some sort of feedback is really important. \r\n\r\nI felt like sometimes we got stuck on one idea for a very long time and that felt stifling like we weren't really moving forward. \r\n\r\nI wish we did more transcriptions.

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend Ian Quinn's experimental section! It was really nice to have the theory knowledge I had turned upside down and then right side up again and exist in a more solid way. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student! It was enjoyable and informative, and was a great introduction into composition. ",
            "\u00a0I would 110% recommend this course to another peer! The workload is definitely manageable and Dr. Quinn makes the material enjoyable and he's a guy that everyone loves. The course provides you with an opportunity to learn about a form of music you otherwise might not get the chance to do again. I simply loved everything about the course. It was certainly my favorite course of the semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have a chance to take the experimental section with Professor Quinn, do it!!!! After speaking with students in the other sections, it seemed like ours was way more enjoyable with less workload. Your mind will be blown every class with the concepts Professor Quinn presents. You learn the same concepts as the other 210 classes, in a way, but from a perspective that is entirely non-traditional.\r\n\r\nThe repertoire (American vernacular) is also much more applicable to modern music than 18th century European music. That being said, if you want to study that body of music, then you may not want to take this section. For example, I think I am much more prepared to write in modern styles of music, but I wouldn't be able to compose in the style of Mozart. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for daring, inquiring students who aren't necessarily classical music-bound. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would take it over normal 210, especially if you're a singer. I anticipate that course will be much better organized in the future. and it's a really great experience! "
