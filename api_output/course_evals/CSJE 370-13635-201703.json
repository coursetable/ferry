            "\u00a0This course challenged me to combine classic learning skills like reading and discussion of material along with creative projects. ",
            "\u00a0I explored my perception of color and sound and explored how vivid my senses are. I also reawakened my ability to make, invent and create from the materials around me. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many techniques to reconnect my hand to my body as a creative instrument. I valued the assignment which encouraged a unique solution and out-of-the-box thinking, and I was re-trained in how to work collaboratively with my peers. "

            "\u00a0The course is very strong. The only improvement may be a more clear syllabus with attached readings. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths are that, in a way that is consistent with the focus on a progressive education, the course aims to genuinely engage students and get them excited about learning and exploring the material. It allows students to take an active role in their own learning and shape their own experience. There was rarely any work that I was not excited to do. The assignments got me outside my normal thought patterns, and I valued that a ton as a central part of a liberal arts education.\r\n\r\nI think the weaker parts are the lectures on the history of progressive art education. Especially towards the beginning of the class, the readings seemed a bit imposed and did not necessarily fit with the idea of learning by doing and and a curriculum co-created with the students. While recognizing that having eye towards the past is crucial for understanding the present, I would have liked to read more in depth about art education today and think more about how we could apply this class's lessons about education and human learning to our current education system. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the flexibility of Fritz with the material and how each conversation went. There was a lot of hands on engagement and chances to build off of each other's ideas. Sometimes, the 3 hours felt too long, but we also did cover a lot so I can see why it was that way. "

            "\u00a0This is the best course I've taken at Yale so far. It combines many different approaches while focusing on developing our own creativity and engagement with the material in a very fresh way. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you're like me and you had little art background coming into the class (which is perfect for this!), it's a great way to give yourself a new lens through which to examine the world. The process of taking the class also helped me to reexamine my thoughts on my education more generally, including why I am motivated and excited to do some homework assignments but not others and what types of classes I can take to continue to engage my brain in different ways. If nothing else, it's a very chill, fun class where you put in as much effort as you want to. ",
            "\u00a0If they want an art class, yes. I think it's pretty niche, but if someone was interested I would certainly encourage them. "
