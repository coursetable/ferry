            "\u00a0I thought this course did a good job in providing an overview of the many places where psychology and the law intersect.  After taking the class, I feel like I possess a greater understanding of the legal system at large as well as an in depth understanding of many specific topics (related to psychology). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the different psychological processes involved in the criminal justice system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to analyze court cases, as well as several legal terms and many psychological concepts that are in effect before, during, and after a trial. There were many wonderful discussions in class and the material was presented in an easy-to-understand way. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the legal system in so many different ways! ",
            "\u00a0A wonderful appreciation for how different aspects of abnormal, clinical, and forensic psychology impacts the law, and various interesting cases demonstrating this! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the justice system! ",
            "\u00a0Psych 330 have me a completely new outlook on the legal system. It allowed me to apply what I had learned in my previous psych classes, to the legal system, and understand all of the ways it was flawed. It also helped me to better understand human nature, especially as it pertains to ideas of fairness, justice and morality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how clinical psychology interacts with legal processes - specifically areas like eyewitness testimony, lie detection, jury selection, incarceration rates, prison demographics, etiology of crime, and imprisonment, to name a few. I gained a better understanding of how the law works and how it is different from research. I learned about problems with legal processes (for example, bias and rehabilitative efforts). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a significant amount about the law and its intersection with psychology. Honestly, this course was extremely interesting and if you're considering going to law school, this is an amazing class. "

            "\u00a0Professor Lockhart was very engaging during the lectures and provided a lot of interesting video and media materials to compliment the topics we were learning about.  Though the midterm and final counted for most of the grade, they required us to do case evaluations which I thought was a good way to test our knowledge from the course.  Overall, the only way in which I think this course could really be improved would be having the final/midterm count for less of the grade and having some sort of project/paper instead to count for a portion of the grade. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were too information-heavy; a lot of the information was already in the reading, so I feel like we could have taken advantage of the time to do something more interactive. ",
            "\u00a0The material is really interesting and the readings are good, but the course wasn't set up to facilitate learning at all. The lectures were not very organized, and rather than applying our knowledge critically in exams, we had to regurgitate all of the course material in the context of specific case studies, graded basically on quantity of studies cited rather than quality of our responses. The take home final exam was 15 pages single spaced, and we were only given a week to complete it. I would have rather had the \"thought questions\" reading responses so that I would be more engaged throughout the course and so that the midterm and final could be shorter and more focused. ",
            "\u00a0The course has several strengths, including the content taught, the method of teaching it, and the interactive discussions of cases. There are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful lecture course that will keep you engaged and intrigued throughout ",
            "\u00a0This class was not conducive to student learning, and reminded me of a high school class on basic psychology in law, in which plain PowerPoint slides and a textbook dictate the structure of the course. Student engagement was minimal at best, and I found that I did not learn anything from this class that I could not learn (in a more succinct fashion) from a basic level book on psychology and law. ",
            "\u00a0This class was presented very well. It developed in a very linear way, and in a way that facilitated learning. Lectures followed closely to the textbook, and Professor Lockhart was great at explaining concepts in a way that was easy to understand, and enjoyable. Overall this was a very interesting look into a realm of pyshcolgy I previously had not had the opportunity to explore. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were quite boring. Even though it was a small class there was no real interaction within the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting material! lectures are great - informative and entertaining at times. Breadth and depth of material is also good. I like the small lecture format.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the weekly thought question would have been better as opposed to the super long midterm and final. Capping the class at the original size probably would have been better on both sides - though I found the midterm and final really interesting and kind of fun to complete, they were both incredibly time-consuming in terms of material I had to specifically look for and cite. I can see how the original size/format of the class would be beneficial - splitting up those questions into weeks would have been better and kept me really engaged the entire semester.  Also that gives more opportunities to improve/factor in other things for a grade as opposed to basically just 2 things making up your semester grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely amazing and the professor is super cool. The material is delivered in an interesting and engaging way and every lecture will have something that'll shock, surprise, or blow your mind. ",
            "\u00a0The final was horrific. Expecting 15 pages single spaced (which, for the record, is longer than the senior essay requirement for psychology) in less than a week, particularly a week that is very busy in general, was a lot to handle. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to psychology majors especially who are at all interested in the legal system!!! The material was really interesting and I feel like out of the courses I have taken at Yale this was definitely one of my favorites. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student unless they are willing to spend 50 hours on the take home midterm and close to 100 hours on the take home final. For these tests you have to delve deep deep into the topics and even then you might still get a bad grade. The lectures are pretty redundant but they are interesting (for the first time you hear them). A fairly good survey course of psych and law but you need to be willing to put in a lot of time to get a good grade. A lot of the final grade is also based on attendance so if you are not good at going to class, this may not be the test for you. I would have preferred in class finals over the take home finals because they literally took sooooo long to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Not if the take-home midterm and final are the same-- it's not a satisfying way to learn and it's not worth it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is absolutely worth taking if you enjoy psychology, and like to watch court case/law shows. The professor is wonderful at tecahing, and you will have a great time learning and discussing several court cases. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This class was so interesting and engaging. I recommend this to anyone with an interest in psychology or the legal system. Really even just all citizens! You learn some really important stuff ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this gem of a course! Its wonderdul and youll learn a lot and be intrigued.  Im a graduating senior and this is the best class Ive taken! ",
            "\u00a0I would- the work is manageable just a midterm and final, both were long, labor-intensive take home exams but at the end of the day they weren't too bad.  You get a lot of info from lecture so doing the reading isn't super important to facilitate your learning of the concepts but the readings were really interesting, especially Minds on Trial. ",
            "\u00a0Super great insight into criminal law and the biases that implicate the every day nuances involved in criminal law. Professor Lockhart was so wonderful to learn from, I enjoyed her enthusiasm. ",
            "\u00a0For several months, I have been trying to come up with the right words to explain this class. But now that the time has come, I cant help but be succinct:\r\n\r\nThis class is terrible. It should not be taught at Yale, at least in its current format. It was a class that I was extremely eager to take in January, but now stands as the greatest disappointment of my Yale College career. The reasons for such a harsh review are detailed below:\r\n\r\n1. Class sessions consisted of the professor reading from a basic black and white PowerPoint slide, with little supplemental information, interesting anecdotes, or student engagement of any kind. \r\n\r\n2. The studies cited throughout the class were largely drawn from 30-40 years ago, and there has clearly been a large amount of research done in these areas since then. But there would be little evidence of that in any of the PowerPoints, and there was no work referenced past 2014, from what I can remember. \r\n\r\n3. There were several instances in which the professor presented factually inaccurate claims about crime statistics, diagnostic criteria, and other critical aspects of this class. I know this because of my consultation with several other people with first-hand knowledge of the things that were talked about (incorrectly) in class. \r\n\r\n4. The professor was, on several occasions, at least implicitly racist. In class, there were several mentions of African-Americans as the blacks, and there were several questions on the take-home final that contained information about the criminal in question being black or an immigrant, in which that information had no bearing on creating the right response to the question. \r\n\r\n5. The professor also cited, with a nostalgic tone, a time at which psychology was at its best, when ethical implications and IRB approval was not considered, and psychologists were able to run unethical studies on human subjects because it got results. \r\n\r\n6. The two grades in the class were a take-home midterm, in which instructions on how to complete it were minimal, and a take-home final, which was 15 pages single-spaced in the middle of reading period. That kind of workload in such a concentrated, busy period is unreasonable to expect from students. \r\n\r\n7. The discussion of the law portion of psychology and the law was limited compared to the psychology portion, and the professors lack of experience in the legal field evidenced itself in broad, sometimes inaccurate descriptions of legal terms. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, I cannot stress how much I recommend avoiding this class, at least in the format in which I took it. There are several fundamental problems with the teaching style and presentation of content that left me disappointed every Tuesday and Thursday for an entire semester, and I would ask that this class not be taught again without serious consideration of major changes to how the class is taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to anyone interested in law and or psychology. Each lecture discussed topics very relevant to the modern day criminal justice system, and were very engaging. Professor Lockhart was an amazing, engaging Professor and person and made coming to each class enjoyable. Absolutely take this class if you have the opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! I loved this class - it's a great class to learn about one of the practical applications of psychology, and it is a good thing to know more about how the legal system works and how it is flawed. We all have to do jury duty at some point, so it's just interesting to learn more about all the different ways cases have gone and how you can frame them to an advantage. I liked the small lecture format - that's how I prefer to learn. My favorite section was probably about how to present a case to a jury (the story format) and how that applied to the OJ case. I also find all the empirical studies interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. It's extremely interesting, the professor is very engaging and cool, and the lectures will shock, surprise, or blow your mind every class. The workload is not bad, 20% is participation and then the rest is a take-home midterm and final which are very do-able. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class! All the topics were super interesting and Professor Lockhart is so clearly knowledgeable and passionate about her teaching. Her enthusiasm really comes across and the workload wasn't bad at all. "
