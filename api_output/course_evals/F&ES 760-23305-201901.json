I have gained greater insight into the considerations of sensitive conservation and I also had the pleasure of listening to a broad variety of different perspectives during the seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Options available for conservationists hoping to act rather than be paralysed by overthinking! ",
            "\u00a0A clearer understanding of what is involved in setting up conservation plans and the complicated nature of putting these plans into action in an international setting. I learned to think more critically about conservation measures and also how to think more holistically about what is going on. ",
            "\u00a0Learn how to work on a team that had different working styles than myself.  I learned about interesting conservation work globally through renowned conservation scientists and guest speakers.  I learned about 4 very specific conservation problems through students conservation problems. ",
            "\u00a01. Stakeholder engagement across competing claims on conservation sites\r\n2. Planning conservation projects at different scales eg species, habitats, landscapes and biomes\r\n3. Planning and executing team projects\r\n4. Using case studies to explain key concepts and meanings of conservation practice ",

            "\u00a0My takeaways from the course generally aligned with my expectation, although I did expect to go deeper into the topics than we eventually ended up going. ",
            "\u00a0A little less theoretical than I expected, and the readings didn't always speak to each other, but I learnt a lot more than I expected from the combined experience of my classmates and professors/TA, and from working on the case study ",
            "\u00a0I expected to be learning a lot about specific cases and getting into the weeds with different situations, and I think that definitely did happen. ",

            "\u00a0Very well,\r\n\r\nThe course enabled me to know what approaches and tools conservation actors are using in different countries/ contexts. I also learnt about visioning processes for NGOs and how that evolves with new challenges and mission statements. However, I would have loved to learn more about new and innovative conservation approaches given the emerging challenges. ",

The only qualm I had is that there were times I thought certain students monopolized the conversation, but I think this improved over the semester and I'm not quite sure how Amy and Bill could have prevented this. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is well structured and brings together a diversity of viewpoints. There are several ways that it could be improved. Firstly, the professors could try to limit their airtime and instead give more space for conversation over controversial topics or sharing of personal experience. The selection for the course is rigorous to ensure that students with a rich set of experiences are able to attend the class, and there should be a platform for students to share these experiences. There was a lot of sharing that I felt could have been done. The course could also improve by going deeper into the provided material. Can the controversial aspects of these topics be summarized in a short sentence / question that the class discusses and relates to their own experience? A lot of the time it felt like we were skimming the surface of the topic at hand. ",
            "\u00a0Not a lot of integration between case studies and the readings/discussion topics, Not enough interaction on the discussion board, shorter lectures and more discussion time? ",
            "\u00a0I think Amy and Bill's experiences are definitely strengths. I enjoyed the discussions we had in class. I think the semester case study projects were important but I think narrowing down the problems more and connecting the groups immediately with people on the ground who are working or thinking about these situations would be incredibly beneficial and make the whole process seem more meaningful, instead of just a thought experiment for the group. And it would also make the group feel like they were working towards something instead of putting this work into a case study they are not involved with and then that work not going to anyone who might find at least some of it useful. I think the powerpoint lectures could also be made shorter to allow time for more student discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I would change the time of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n1. Case study approach\r\n2. Having external practitioners to present their work in class\r\n3. Class discussions and the environment they occur\r\n4. Approachable and inspiration faculty\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\n1. I think course materials should be structured to draw on more recent publications\r\n2. i think class discussions should be better guided eg having guiding questions "

However, if you've been engaged in it for a while, it might not meet your expectations or where you are at when thinking about conservation. ",
            "\u00a0Might want to take it together with the tools class if you're looking for more specific tools...?\r\nAnd for the readings getting the big picture is probably enough rather than a line-by-line reading! ",
