            "\u00a0I came in to this class with very little knowledge of economics and over the course of the semester feel I have gained a familiarity with the material and a much better understanding of both how economic models can represent various market and decision making structures as well as the limits of these models. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly learned jargon of different economics concepts, which, while fun to name-drop in colloquial settings, are not developed enough in the class to be analytically applicable.\r\n\r\nSome conclusions drawn from the class were very interesting, in that they will be counterintuitive to most. This class has somewhat lowered the amount I recoil from the thought of unfettered markets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a thorough introduction of microeconomic analysis. I also was introduced to behavioral economics, game theory, and finance. This class taught important economic skills particularly marginal analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Good foundation in microeconomics "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths how closely the course followed the textbook and the amount of support available outside of the classroom (our TA was very helpful). If one felt lost it was easy to get back on track.\r\n\r\nOne weakness is that this class feels like it requires next to no critical thinking. We are always made aware that models are nothing more but models (that are apparently useful, although we never get to see any uses), but never interrogate properly their shortcomings. One can pass well simply regurgitating textbook answers, and will not benefit in class from doing supplementary reading. I think it would be wise for the course to adopt a section that discusses exactly what a model is. For how much the economics profession seems to rely on this concept, it is remarkable how little attention is paid to clarifying it at the introductory level. ",
            "\u00a0The class presentations were great at covering various topics and allowing us to do practice problems with these topics. The problem sets were very fair and were great reviews of the units. The class thoroughly covered the topics discussed in the textbook. I would have like to reviewed challenging problem set questions in class. I would have also like practice exams to be available. ",
            "\u00a0maybe a discussion of modern issues in economics through readings ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: it was a little messy in terms of organization and transitioning from one topic to another\r\nWent a little too fast over some material, not very thorough "

            "\u00a0Consider taking this seminar rather than the larger lecture course if you feel you would do better or be more engaged in a smaller classroom setting. Don't believe any horror stories you might hear about this class versus the lecture. The workloads I found to be generally comparable and you have the option for more personalized attention in class. All in all I would recommend this class but you need to find which option works best for you. I would however recommend taking at least one economics class and this is a great place to start. ",
            "\u00a0Apparently the upper-level economics classes are great, so if you are patient it may be worth it. But for all of those who want to take intro micro to \"understand how the world works\" or something relevant to society, this class in isolation is not what you are looking. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It is a great introductory class for anyone interested in economics, especially because it covers basic economic topics such as supply/demand and marginal analysis. It is also very interesting in how it integrates behavioral economics into microeconomics. ",
