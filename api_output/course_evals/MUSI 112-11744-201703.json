            "\u00a0In Musi 112 I learned a great deal about the history of music and also how to write a concert review. ",
            "\u00a0I have a better understanding of how music and the study of music has developed over the years, and the elements that are involved in analyzing music. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course I developed skills that help me understand music better. I learned how music is put together and how to listen to different music (including music that you 'cannot hear'). Starting with Bach and ending with Hamilton, we covered a wide range of Western styles and composers. This course shows the true power of music and art and goes far beyond studying musical novice. I loved the course and the way it was taught! Some weeks it was the only thing I was looking forward to, and other weeks, when there was nothing I wanted to look forward to, it reminded me of the beauty of existence. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of music in the past 3 centuries and this course provided me with a general overview of the experience of taking music history classes. "

            "\u00a0A solid course, although the name of the course might be a little misleading. I would say that the course is more focused on the history of music than on learning how to \"listen to music\" (which you do some of, but it is not the main focus of the class). ",
            "\u00a0A really great intro class. Not difficult, but I felt like I learned something. I knew nothing about music coming into the class, but if you have a lot of previous knowledge this might not be that great of a class for you. I especially appreciate that Professor O'brien worked hard to talk about composers and pieces outside the usual canon, and discuss how issues of gender and race played into who we studied and why. ",
            "\u00a0Great course all around, take it even if you have 0 contact with music, especially if Kerry O'Brien is still teaching it. The material is interesting and easy to remember if you put it in context. The music varies from baroque of the 1600s to modern compositions made in 2017. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught by an amazing professor. Doctor Kerry O'Brien is the biggest strenght of this course. She created an amazing atmosphere, comfortable for everyone in the classroom. The way she introduced the material and the supplementary readings and listenings she provided, helped me gain a much better understanding not just of music, but the place of music in history. Our discussions focused not only on the importance of rhythm and meter, but on subjects like the place of women in society and music through the years, or what it means to belong to a certain race. Another strenght of the course is that it covers a huge time period which allows you to trace the evolution of music. We also thought of the places and settings a piece would have been performed or the response of the audience. The work load was not overwhealming, and the assignments and feedback were organized in such a way to allow the students to improve. Throughout the course and thanks to the feedback and help of the professor, I became much more comfotable with writing. \r\nIn order for the course to be improved, I think that the department should give more funding for seminars like this one. The point is to listen to music, so it will be great if the class can visit a life performance together. We managed to do quite a bit outside of the traditional classroom setting (like meeting a composer and visiting an anechoic chamber), but this was organized sololy by the professor. The material was evenly spread for most of the time and the professor made sure we had enough time for all assignments. The only thing that can be changed to improve the class is the second test. It covered a lot of composers and pieces which made it a lot harder than the other two tests. ",
            "\u00a0Class meetings are engaging and generally really useful in helping me learn the material. I like that the class size is small, which makes the learning experience more personal and intensifies my interest in the material being taught. "

            "\u00a0A great class to take if you need a humanities credit or if you're looking for a fun class to take during a semester. It's by no means a gut, but if you put in the work you'll do fine. The class is very memorization heavy since it's a lot of history. If you have previous experience playing an instrument, you will have a leg up in this class (although if you do maybe you should be taking an upper level music class). ",
            "\u00a0If you don't know much about music but are interested I would highly suggest! It was low work load (although a lot of memorization). I feel like I can have basic music conversations with people, and have a stronger appreciation for the various types of music. A fun fifth class! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely. Do it. Shop around the different sections though because the teaching style and atmosphere tends to be different, and find one that you enjoy the most. ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite course this semester (and I took some really nice courses). Doctor Kerry O'Brien is amazing! The teaching style is great, and the covered material is diverse and interesting. The course goes far beyound music. If you are looking for a way to challenge yourself intellectually in a non-traditional way, or you love art, or you just want to take a class that you will truly enjoy, this couse is for you. It is a great way for non-music majors to explore music. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Only to those who have had some sort of exposure to music before, since I imagine that picking up this class absolutely from scratch would be challenging at the least, although definitely not impossible. I find that the "
