            "\u00a0I have a very comprehensive understanding of Middle East history and how it effects current issues in the region. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount of information in this class, ranging from the organization and successes of early Muslim empires to nationalist leaders and movements that transformed regional governments and cultures in the Middle East. We also learned a great deal about how the Middle East has influenced  and in turn, was influenced by  European/Western powers throughout history, which also helped me better understand a lot of current American foreign policy. ",

            "\u00a0Learning about the Middle East in this class allows us to look at the past as a way to understand the present. I learned a lot about this region that I did not know before and it is helpful in today's world to understand why events in the Middle East are happening the way they are. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were interesting and well organized, a great class! Expectations about the final and paper were a little unclear - communication could be better. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were wonderful. Prof. Foster is a wonderful storyteller who managed to unravel the complex history of the Middle East so that it was both fascinating and understandable. I liked that he was able to make compelling arguments while acknowledging alternative perspectives, as well as weaving in fun facts and personal anecdotes into his lectures. Prof. Foster was also extremely kind during office hours and very accommodating/understanding when it came to exam grades and choosing whether to write the final paper. The one main area of improvement I can identify is that I wish there was more organization/transparency to the class. The syllabus was unclear in certain places regarding dates/deadlines and expectations for the readings, exams, and final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Don't get me wrong, I loved the material covered in this course, but it really needs to be improved in a variety of ways. There needs to be some type of guided notes for the lectures in digital form given before the class starts. The key terms are presented out of order from the course packet, which make them extremely hard to follow and take notes on...not to mention they differ from the terms on the board. Also, when there is no powerpoint or slides, students lose engagement in what the professor is saying, and if you miss one thing that's said, you have no way to figure it out, especially when the key terms sheet is so outdated. The only possible way to take notes was with a large group of people, and even then it was still challenging because we would have 10+ pages of notes per lecture and not know what was important because we had 2 completely different sets of key terms to study...and then on the final, there were two terms not on either list (SAVAK/Carter Doctrine). Sure we briefly discussed both in class at some point, but they weren't listed on the sheet of terms we were supposed to memorize, which I think is unfair. Finally, there needs to be better proctoring during the exams. People cheat, and it's really unfair to those of us who study like crazy and take the exam fairly. People were constantly on their phones googling during the test and people had cheat sheets/notes hidden in their sleeves/bathroom. Like I said at the beginning, I really enjoyed the material covered in this course, I just think there is a lot of room for improvement. I wouldn't make these suggestions/observations unless I truly cared about this class, which I clearly do. Thank you! ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of reading that was redundant to the lecture so I didn't do it, the terms were written on the board but were often difficult to read so it would have been nice to have online copies (we got them, but just right before exams).  I wish the course packets were available on Canvas because they were EXPENSIVE and extremely cost-prohibitive. Lecture itself was good and informative but sometimes I got lost because there's a vast amount to be covered and I had no prior knowledge so it was my first time hearing about all of it ",
            "\u00a0you develop a very very good understanding of the region through the lectures. However it is sometimes hard to read the key words on the board and if you miss one part of lecture you could be lost for a while ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly difficult. There are so much information that has to be learned, and definitely not enough time to learn and understand it all. ",
            "\u00a0there was much too much reading which resulted in basically none of the students doing any of the reading, but still purchasing the course packets which were also quite expensive ",
            "\u00a0The course is a great lecture; it's very engaging and the structure makes sense! ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting, very well taught.\r\nSlightly more engaging readings would improve the course ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of each of the countries that make up the Middle East. There were a lot of identifications to remember, but they certainly help in developing a better understanding of what was going on at the time. ",
            "\u00a0Broad survey which is good for general understanding but so much information is crammed in and sometimes structure isnt great ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the incredibly interesting and well delivered lectures. Weaknesses are the  9am start time and very expensive course packets with readings that aren't necessary for the exams. I also registered for this course believing there would be optional section on Friday for course material review, but the section was unfortunately canceled later due to lack of funding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT of material from the course - we covered a wide time period of Near East history, but I still walked away having absorbed much of the information. I think I might have gained more from the course if we had more frequent assignments or assessments. At times, it was hard to process the amount of material we were being taught. While more frequent assessments would translate to a higher workload, I think the increase would be beneficial in a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures. So interesting! It's at 9am though, so that was tough. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, a great overview of the history of the region. I knew nothing going into the class, and feel like I could now have a strong conversation about the Middle East. I am not a history major but found the class reasonable and definitely lots of learning. Prof. Foster is a good lecturer too. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class if, like me, youre looking for an opportunity to learn about a region you know very little about. Prof. Foster combines storytelling with wonderful anecdotes and compelling arguments to make a 9am class surprisingly bearable (although 75 minutes of pure lecture was a little rough). This class covers a TON of information, from the life of Muhammad in the seventh century all the way until the present day, so you cover a lot of ground without much time for really delving into some of the more complex and nuanced forces that may have shaped the present-day Middle East. I wouldnt recommend the class if youre looking for a deeper understanding of the Middle East or are interested in a specific region, but this is a good crash course on the Middle East that has made me feel a lot more knowledgeable about the region, as well as comfortable enough to learn more on my own in the future. As far as the workload goes, the class is not too bad  there are a lot of readings, but they arent required to do well on the exams (still, I wish I had put more time into the readings, because the ones I managed to get to were interesting and super helpful with reinforcing lecture material). The hardest part was probably preparing for the exams. Although they were appropriately challenging and graded fairly, there was just so much information that cramming at the last minute didnt work. Overall, I would definitely recommend Intro to the Middle East as a survey course that provides a gateway into understanding a complex, often misrepresented region of the world. ",
            "\u00a0In it's current state, no. If you are lucky enough to take it with a large group of people who you can take notes with, than maybe...but even then, it's still hard. The only way I'd push someone to take this class is if they have someone's notes from a previous year or if he adds some more up to date guided notes to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I had no prior knowledge of the history of this region before this class and I feel like I have a lot more groundwork now to understand modern politics.  However, I easily lost focus in class because some of it was so over my head that I couldn't really grasp it and that's my bad.  A pretty perfect course in terms of structure - lectures cover material in the readings but readings help supplement if you're ~intellectually curious~, one midterm, one final, one under 15-pg paper.  Light workload, but study for the exams because they come around quickly and it's a lot of material to remember. ",
            "\u00a0It is a ton of information but if you take the time to learn it, you will. There is a lot of information presented in each lecture so be prepared. ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. Unless you have grown up learning about the Middle East and its history, it is impossible to understand and know the history of every country. It is extremely overwhelming; the course is no longer interesting or fun because you are just trying to frantically memorize every word the professor says. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Foster's lectures are engaging and insightful. Any student who wishes to learn the fundamentals of Middle/Near Eastern history should take this course. Even if you are familiar with the subject matter, Foster's class will only further your knowledge of it. The course covers the histories of Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel-Palestine, Afghanistan, Turkey, US involvement in the Middle East, and so much more. Take the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0yes! I think it's really important for everyone to have at least a general understanding of this part of the world and this is a great intro survey course to do that ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the Modern Middle East. It is a great basis for learning about many interesting topics in the region. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because the professor is great and you learn about a range of topics that are all relevant to understanding the dynamics of the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but be prepared to work hard and do independent research ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you are sure you can be awake and attentive at 9 am. This is a great course with a great professor, but if you aren't able to take really good lecture notes in preparation for the exams, it will be very difficult to succeed. However, if you can take great lecture notes, review them throughout the semester and memorize the key terms before the exam, you will do really well in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class moves very fast, and you'll have to make sure you're awake for each class and ready to take quick and thorough notes. That being said, you'll walk away with a much better appreciation of the history of the Middle East and the roots of modern-day conflicts in the region. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course.  It was very broad and was a lot of information to cover in a short amount of time which was difficult for me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Middle eastern history is so interesting and Professor Foster offers many perspectives. "
