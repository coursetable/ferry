            "\u00a0David Choi: David was an earnest TA but his own personal views on what he thinks Christianity is often foreclosed discussion about what Christian ethics could be. It was interesting to have section with him though seeing as how I will need to engage in conversation with people who hold fairly traditional views of the Christian tradition. I didn't necessarily trust his judgment in fairly assessing my work though. I also wasn't a big fan of the way he seemed to make assumptions that the students in section embraced the Christian tradition. I could see him wanting to bring a pastoral sensibility to his role as a TA but that is not what I wanted from this class or section. I did not want a pastor. I wanted a person who would wrestle with the content with us. ",

She was able to frame complex ideas to enhance our understanding and she managed to engage an exceptionally divergent group into a cohesive community.  \r\n\r\nHer written feedback was excellent, detailed, critical, and supportive.

            "\u00a0David was the worst section leader I have had. He was not familiar with the subject matter in a way that allowed him to lead a section well; he did not have strong leadership skills that allowed him to lead a discussion group; he was extremely critical on our papers in a way that gave us worse grades than the other TF's sections; he did a poor job in making non-Christian students feel welcome and included in the class; he was very unfamiliar with any ethicists who were not white men. I really hope David is not asked back... unfortunately he ruined this course for me. ",

            "\u00a0Calli gave very helpful feedback on our assignments. It's clear she really spent time reading them and giving constructive feedback. She also helped anchor us within the shifting sands of the class by giving us background information, etc. My favorite thing she taught us was how to take notes on different thinkers for the final. The framework she gave us was extremely helpful for reviewing everything we had read and for organizing my thoughts for the take-home. ",
            "\u00a0Calli Micale prompted excellent discussions in our section meetings. These were lively conversations. I may have been less conversational (certainly less insightful) than some others, who seemed to grasp the material earlier in the course than I.  Calli is an engaging personality, wizard-smart, with a light touch. She kept the conversation going whenever they needed a kick-start. Her preparation for the take-home final was a life-saver. She took us through how to outline the position of a given ethicist: what is the problem? How did the ethicist deal with it?..etc. This focused us on that position, then allowed us to compare/contrast with others.  Her feedback on our two papers was detailed, constructive and timely. I will miss being with her next year. ",
