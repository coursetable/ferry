            "\u00a0I became a much better reader and writer learning from Professor Peters. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt enjoy reading fiction before I took this class, and now I do. Thats pretty amazing by itself, but this class also taught me about what it looks like to consider literature alongside philosophy, historical context, and the kind of awe that Professor Peters brings to each class. This class also taught me what a good seminar looks like. Everyone was genuinely engaged and contributed great ideas that made each class different and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I had read most of the books already, but it  but we still interesting to re-read some of the works and read others for the first time. ",
            "\u00a0A great glimpse into a handful of American literary texts. As Professor Peters said at the start, it's not meant to be a survey; you couldn't teach a survey of satisfactory depth in a semester. We sank deep into the texts he chose and made some interesting chats around the table. It's a shame we didn't have more classes like the first one, when Professor Peters just talked and dropped all sorts of gorgeous ideas into the air, but I guess it was supposed to be seminar. Our discussions were nice too, if not so luminous. ",
            "\u00a0The ability to read critically, and to communicate clearly and persuasively verbally and in writing. In terms of insights, a better understanding of different perspectives on the American experience. And on a broader level, a beautiful interaction with a range of perspectives on the human condition. ",
            "\u00a0An indescribable sense of appreciation for literature, for learning, for school, for reading. Beyond the rich, rich material we read, learning with a small seminar is such a memorable and enriching experience. ",
            "\u00a0I heavily improved my writing skills and feel more secure in my literary analysis abilities! ",
            "\u00a0It was my first English course heavy on philosophy and less focused on writing strategies and style. The most valuable lesson the course taught me was about the value of literature in every field, industry, aspect of life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to analyze and engage critically with important texts in American literature, many of which I had not heard before ",
            "\u00a0The course studies significant works by major American authors and traced the changes in thought and literary style from the mid nineteenth through to the twenty first century. We spent most of our time with close reading, breaking down prose and pottery sentence by sentence, line by line, and word by word. I learned to lay special attention to such small details and mine them for greater lessons about the work as a whole. The time we spent in discussion and writing about the works also was good practice in articulating arguments or interpretations of the things we read. ",
            "\u00a0This course very much enhanced both my ability to comprehend and write about complex texts, but it was not limited to strictly discussing literature. We also looked at literature as it relates to American identity (if such a thing exists),  and we often engaged in animated and occasionally heated debate surrounding the social context and implications of the books. This course renewed my love of literature and reminded me of why I came to Yale to study it in the first place. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: almost everything. Everyone is extremely engaged, the books are fantastic, Professor Peters is incredible. Weaknesses: reading Moby Dick in three weeks (Professor Peters acknowledged this, and there didn't really seem to be a way around thisit was what it was). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Moby-Dick and Leaves of Grass are both phenomenal works. Workload was very manageable. Professor Peters was an excellent professor.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would've liked to see some different works on the syllabus (instead of Dickinson, Pynchon, and Dove), such as Faulkner, Steinbeck, and Toni Morrison.  Our seminar size was a little too big. Everyone would've benefitted if the class were limited to fifteen students. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how Professor Peters organized each class beginning with a short introduction. I also love how many texts we read; even though sometimes it felt like we needed much more time to digest what we were reading, it was always exciting. We experienced many different genres, sometimes even within a single work. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the more we spent class actually discussing and analyzing the works rather than summarizing them, the more engaging the course became. Prof. Peters is also really nice about deadlines and grading and realizes that grades are less important than the learning, which I really appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everyone was engaged and passionate during discussions (I often wrote about them in my personal journal), texts were phenomenal, workload was manageable\r\nWeaknesses: none that I can think of ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS: (mostly) great curriculum, spectacular professor.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: I find The Crying of Lot 49 utterly soulless. If it weren't for Professor Peters' choice to tack on Gilead at the end, it would have made a depressing ending note. ",
            "\u00a0It stood out as a fantastic course. The texts were all different but uniformly engaging, the papers were a blast to write, and the class discussion was actually really useful and enlightening, which isn't always the case with seminars. ",
            "\u00a0Only weakness: we're not able to do the books we read justice. \r\n\r\nStrengths: manageable assignments that are spaced out and interesting, learning in a nurturing and intellectually curious environment ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the structure of this course! The only improvement I can think of is incorporating more POC and women authors, but my professor was very receptive to that and will try to adjust the curriculum for next year! ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum had little to no structure and there weren't very many identifiable themes running through the course. It seems as though everything is just up to the professor and his flexibility. The assignments were quite broad and that was difficult to navigate at times. Although it would have been nice to have been give more direction and told explicitly what I was supposed to take away from the class, that doesn't seem to be the point of a literature seminar and that definitely didn't align with the professor's teaching philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the readings - but I think the course could be improved by including at least one work from an Asian-American author; we talk a lot about race in the course, and so I think it is important to include an Asian-American perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the opportunity to have a small class size with an incredible professor. That being said, with the desire from everyone to participate, our classes felt at times disjointed. With many interesting or diverging viewpoints, i often wondered what exactly to take away from a class period. However, the works we read were fascinating and truly offer so many possible interpretations. The texts are all very important for American and literary history, and the discussions you have about them will continue to offer you things to think about after the class has ended. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is the matter of representation; we often acknowledged in class how difficult it is to represent all the different cultures and demographics in America, but I do think that more of an effort could be made to accommodate diverse writers. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I do believe that the strengths of the course lie in the literature itself because each of the pieces we examined were beautiful, insightful, and unique. The class discussions were a highlight of the course, but the biggest strength was the respectful and passionate treatment of the works themselves. "

            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, and take it with Professor Peters if you can. You read fantastic books and get to discuss them with people who will challenge your perceptions of them. You learn so much from your classmates, and Professor Peters is such a gem. The workload is exactly rightthe amount of reading varies depending on whether you're reading poetry or a novel (the most you'll have to do is Moby Dick, which is admittedly a lot for three weeks), but it was generally not overwhelming. There are three papers, and you can write about basically anything that interests youI really enjoyed them (and you get to rewrite one paper). Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class. Take anything with John Durham Peters. He's an incredible thinker and teacher, and you will learn so much about your understanding of America and most amazingly, how to read. You might think that you already know how to read, but I promise you don't yet. The first day of class began with an in-depth close reading of the course's title: Readings in American Literature, and the class just got better from there. You will read all of Moby Dick, which is much more enjoyable than people make it out to be. You will learn how to appreciate poetry if you don't already. You will experience philosophy in its literary context. And if you're like me, you will be convinced to become an English major. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. The reading list is mixed  there should be more diversity in the later world, but I understand why the first books are what they are. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I would recommend that every Yale student read the texts we read, and the environment in which we engaged with these texts was wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Not the course generally, since seminar quality is so dependent on the professor. But the course as taught by Professor Peters? Absolutely. He's great at guiding discussion without overwhelming it with his perspective, and when he does give his take, the class falls into reverential quiet. He encourages generosity without ever invalidating criticism. This is maybe the best seminar I've experienced at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Regardless of background, comfort with literature, interests, you should take this course. Honestly just a wonderful, life-affirming, and useful course. It's also a fantastic opportunity to receive feedback on your writing and in-class contributions from some of Yale's best professors. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, and take it with Prof. Peters. He brings a fresh perspective and energy to \"old\" texts, which you've heard lots about without understanding why they're exciting. It's a wonderful course to add to your appreciation of literature, reading, and learning as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, gives you a way to think about American literature and write a few essays. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really loved the literary works we read and our class discussion were always very engaging and provocative ",
            "\u00a0It definitely wasn't a traditional English class--but then again, I haven't taken enough English classes at Yale to know what the standard is. This class will force you to be open-minded and push yourself to think critically. Unfortunately, as is with most discussion-based classes, a lot of the experience depends on your peers and how they contribute to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would, because I think that the texts we read are not only interesting but important to the development of American literature. but the quality of the course also really depends on the vibe of the seminar you're in - so shop around. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Yale is known for a strong English department, and American Lit is a great class. It can impact the ways you think about other fields or supplement other kinds of learning. The books lend themselves to creative and fun essays. Its also a great opportunity for consistent discussions with brilliant professors and classmates. The reading can be hard to stay on top of, and for me personally catching up from behind was even more difficult. The works can be frustrating also, especially some of the poetry, but its great to work on something that may not be in your comfort zone with the support of classmates and teacher. ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who can read English and has a passing interest in society, humanity, or beauty. "
