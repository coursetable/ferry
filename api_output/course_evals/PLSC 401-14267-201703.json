            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate African governments, their policies, and their people. I learned the different aspects of African democratic governance as well as the different mechanisms to test whether democracies in Africa truly hold voters to account. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the political systems of various African countries, especially my country case study. I also learned how to better analyze political papers to evaluate their conclusions. ",
            "\u00a0A much stronger understanding of the interplay between African elections and public policy especially the variation among sub-Saharan African countries. A more nuanced understanding of the behavior of voters and elites in contemporary Africa. ",
            "\u00a0Broad survey of aspects of government explored thru case studies of different countries each week ",
            "\u00a0A clear and analytical approach to public policy and trends in African politics "

            "\u00a0Strengths - very rich and detailed readings. \r\n\r\nWeakness's - Poor group discussions for a lot of the classes. ",
            "\u00a0Very good class. You will learn a lot and be challenged in several ways ",
            "\u00a0The course readings were really great (and not onerous) and Professor Seekings is extremely knowledgeable. Obviously this depends on the semester, but the students in the class also seemed to be very knowledgeable/passionate about African politics. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it can feel more lecture than seminar. Also your experience really depends on how much knowledge you enter the room with or if you're new to politics in Africa or politics at all. ",
            "\u00a0A great instructor who is kind and very insightful "

            "\u00a0Content wise, I would. However, the class needs to be better structured to facilitate conversation and deeper thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Teaching style was a little haphazard. There were some good insights to be drawn from the class. Would only recommend if you read the syllabus and are very very interested in the topics covered. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It's a great way to get away from the confining assumptions of American democracy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes take it. It's one of the best African studies classes taught at Yale ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! It's extremely informative but also not unmanageable. Professor Seekings is excellent and two of his PhD students sat in on the class which was also really cool. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!! "
