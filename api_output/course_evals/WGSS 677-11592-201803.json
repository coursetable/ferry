            "\u00a0FEMINIST PHILOSOPHY IS AMAZING. This course helped me wrestle with important topics that I hope I continue wrestling with my whole life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze different philosophical inquiries in their own right, which is always useful; however, what I really learned was how to apply these inquiries to *real* challenges of our day, which was far more useful, fruitful, and rewarding. I learned the fundamentals of feminist philosophy and importantly, how this line of thought interacted with other philosophical areas such as epistemology, moral philosophy, and the like. Following this class, I feel far more prepared to read public commentary on sexism, misogyny, race, oppression, etc. and actually understand what's valid in the concerns, what is illogical, and what is really at play. And even better, given our class discussions, I feel prepared to have these conversations across lines of difference or even with people with whom I expect to agree. I feel incredibly indebted to Dr. Dembroff. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good overview of current debates in feminist philosophy. Some of the debates that were most interesting to me were debates on \"strategic essentialism,\" in political theorizing/organizing, \"dual systems\" theory in socialist feminism, and how different artworks can model different feminist commitments. I loved that we watched Lemonade and Dirty Computer as part of the course. I also was able to work on writing focused and clear philosophy papers of different lengths (always working on that.) ",
            "\u00a0Developed a foundational understanding of feminist theory and how it compares to what is popularly referred to as \"feminism.\" ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the class was great, and I think that the philosophy department should seriously consider adding additional courses with a focus on Feminist Philosophy. I think that Robin gave excellent feedback on essays, and classroom discussions were always stimulating. I learned how to become a better thinker/ reader/ writer/ philosopher. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me about a wide range of topics surrounding feminism--even topics that I didn't expect, such as capitalism. This course was well organized to develop our ideas about feminism and the philosophical debates on important topics, and I appreciated that we could still remain grounded on the real-world applications and implications of our discussions. I gained the ability to talk about feminism (and the many related fields it intersects) in a more articulate way, which was very helpful in organizing how I interact with the world around me. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of basic ideas within feminist philosophy, from earlier theorizing through to the present day. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me develop not only as a philosopher but also as a person. Robin is the best. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was excellent. The class vibe was especially good, which I think is largely due to Prof. Dembroff's attentiveness to discussion dynamics and ability to alter the course of conversation in good and productive ways when needed, while refusing to dominate the conversation (which is amazing in a seminar course). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n+ applying philosophical arguments to real world issues (transgender rights, transracialism, etc.) \r\n+ phenomenal class room discussions \r\n+ great leadership and discussion steering by Dr. Dembroff\r\n+ manageable readings load while still giving us all the important hits\r\n\r\nAreas for improvement:\r\n+ discussions could have benefited from a few more graduate students or philosophy students who could have more easily helped steer discussions with rigorous philosophical grounding, but with guidance from Dr. Dembroff and grad/philosophy students the discussions still felt solid and rigorous (it just might have been easier with a few more grad/philosophy students)\r\n+ I'd suggest adding a couple of sessions or class time to more straightforward \"lecturing\" on some of the philosophical underpinnings of some texts. Some of my favorite moments in class came with Dr. Dembroff would go to the board and outline the basics of an argument and we could then more easily refute, sharpen, or understand the paper in question. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think that there are any weaknesses of the course. I would have liked to read a bit more about how feminist philosophers today think about ideology and its relationship to patriarchy. That being said, I think the fact that we didn't read more about this has to do with the fact that only a few analytic feminist philosophers today are discussing ideology in that way. ",
            "\u00a0Dembroff is a great instructor for the course, and the seminar style is conducive to insightful discussion about the assigned reading. Occasionally, the discussion would be diverted from a discussion of the piece itself towards the personal experiences of some student in the class, which was a little distracting and, later in the course, frustratingly frequent. Though it is hard to impose a rule that every member of a discussion course contribute points that are strictly topical to the reading, perhaps it would be helpful to have a clearer statement at the beginning of the class that discussion points centered around personal experiences should be secondary to discussion points that are a consideration of the text itself. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was great because I really enjoyed the readings. I think that Robin could add a couple of readings on disability studies, or add a couple more readings on how capitalism explicitly affects studies about gender. I really enjoyed discussion sections, and I thought that Robin did a good job fostering a sense of community. There wasn't an air of competitiveness or disengagement; the class was just a place to talk about ideas, which I liked. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the small class size for better discussions and allowing everyone a chance to participate. The various backgrounds of all students helped give us new perspectives and everyone was respectful of others' opinions. The papers chosen to read were great; sometimes, though, for the more difficult papers, it would be nice to have more background material to familiarize ourselves.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not much to elaborate on here.. Even as an undergraduate taking this graduate-level course, I think the expectations were clear and fair. Sometimes I did feel lost during discussion, but it was helpful to ask questions throughout the conversation. Maybe it would be good to have a more thorough introduction on all the papers we'd read throughout the semester, just so I'd have a better idea of what to expect and why these topics related to each other. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussion was wonderful and rich. Readings were brief, which meant we got to engage deeply with the content during each class. I think it might have been helpful for students leading each class discussion to devise small activities or breakout discussion groups around particular areas. Paper comments were thoughtful and grading was fair. ",
            "\u00a0Feminist Philosophy was really engaging. Politically urgent but not dogmatic. Entertaining but still philosophically rigorous. I really loved this class. "

            "\u00a0Everyone should take this course. Because it is boss. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Definitely take this course if you have a chance. Professor Dembroff is a wonderful and very thoughtful professor. This is a self-selecting class for the most part (in terms of philosophy experience and general viewpoints), making for a open, nurturing, and thought-provoking environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! And I have recommended the course and Dr. Dembroff to anyone who will listen. I enjoyed the chance to read a manageable amount of content and then really dissect (1) the whole of the piece and (2) the nitty gritty of its argument. I'm finding that this is rare at Yale, so I tell everyone who is frustrated by the lack of deep and rigorous conversation to take a class with Dr. Dembroff. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The course is a great way to become more familiar with some of the intellectual commitments of feminism (or the intellectual commitments of different versions of feminism). Prior to taking the course, I was only familiar with the sort of \"pop feminism\" of Huffpost and etc., and this course enabled me to clarify what parts of that feminism I agreed with, and which parts I didn't. Also, Professor Dembroff is one of the most helpful and engaging professors in the department. It is worth taking the class to take a class with them. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as an undergraduate, so I can only comment in that regard. I'd recommend this course to someone who has had a few philosophy courses already and already has a grasp of how to read and write philosophical papers. Given that this is a graduate course, it moves fairly quickly and assumes a fair bit of foundational philosophy knowledge, and in-class discussions sometimes referenced commonly read Western philosophers (Hume, Kant, etc.), so the class is best suited for those who have had exposure to philosophical material before. That said, this is probably a moot point, since most people thinking of taking this course are either undergraduates with philosophy experience or graduate students in philosophy or a tangentially-related field. ",
            "\u00a0I wouldI think that all students should have to take a course on gender studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I know this course may seem daunting at first--given the sensitivity to and backlash against topics related to feminism in our society--but it was extremely rewarding and eye-opening to read and discuss about this subject. Although philosophy is not my major/main focus of my studies, I was so happy to have taken this course even though I knew it would be difficult and challenging for me to develop and express my ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is challenging, fascinating, and deeply enriching. ",
            "\u00a0In a heartbeat. "
