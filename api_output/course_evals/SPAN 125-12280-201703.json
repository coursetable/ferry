            "\u00a0I learned Spanish, and a lot of it. The pace is quick, but the class is engaging, and you will have to do a good bit of work outside of class to keep up, but it's well worth it for the gains you'll make. I can have full conversations in Spanish, and I've been learning it for literally only one semester? Amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much Spanish! Speaking skills and writing skills! "

            "\u00a0Strengths - just about everything, but at a fundamental level is all comes down to Profesora Sabe. She is the best language instructor I've had at Yale, and I've taken a language class every other semester of college up to now. She is so, so good at her job, and she is such a passionate and kind woman. She holds you to high standards and expects you to come to class prepared and on time, but she does that because she wants to push you to become better. The way that she conducts class, with activities and games and presentations and cultural exploration, makes the two hours per day pass by so quickly! Honestly, taking this class was one of the best decisions I made.\r\nWeaknesses - really not much to say here. I think the culture sections of the tests and quizzes weren't super productive or beneficial, but other than that, I liked everything else about the course. The textbook is also pretty expensive because you have to buy an online code, if that matters to you. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths are that there's sufficient time every day to actually \"get used\" to Spanish. Between being in class for two hours and doing homework in the evenings, it really is a great intensive introduction to basic proficiency. Also, Profesora Sab is incredible. She has everything well planned out and knows what kinds of activities are both engaging and useful. She gives consistent feedback on your oral and written materials so you can improve. ",
            "\u00a0The #1 strength of this class is definitely Prof. Sab. It is a really intense learning environment, and without her ability to teach the language while also making classes fun and engaging, it could have become overwhelming very quickly. One big weakness of the course is that the textbooks are extremely expensive, and, unlike in the regular Spanish levels, they are only used for one semester. The cost was almost prohibitive for me taking the class, and I don't think that should ever be the case. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that we met for such a long time allowed for a more immersive environment. The class was also able to bond and everyone came out really knowing each other. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Take this class, and you will learn so much and have such a fun time doing it. I cannot say enough good things about Profesora Sabe. There are few people in this world who can do what she does with such passion, talent, patience, and kindness. I feel very well equipped to continue with Spanish in the future! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. Professor Sabe is one of the best professors I've had at Yale. The class is well-organized, fun, and engaging. The two hour class usually feels like it flies by. There's daily homework, but it's not unreasonable. I came out of the class with the kind of Spanish introduction I was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone who wants to learn Spanish really quickly! ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. 2h a day is kind of a big time commitment, and the workload is steady but definitely not overpowering for a 2credit course. Profesora Sab is so patient and dedicated and really does a good job making the class into a community. ",
            "\u00a0If you're going to take Spanish at Yale, this is the way to do it! If you put the time in and care, the course is immensely rewarding. Also definitely try to take it with Sab! She is by far one of the best professors I've had at Yale, and she made me look forward to getting to class at 9:25 every day. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. It was very helpful and a fun experience. "
