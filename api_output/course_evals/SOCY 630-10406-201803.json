            "\u00a0Over the course of this semester, I gained greater exposure and a better understanding about the field of sociology and its methods. I am now able to speak intelligently about different major figures in sociology including W.E.B. DuBois, Howard Becker, Robert Redfield, Erving Goffman, Robert Park and Clifford Geertz and the groundbreaking theories, methodologies, and findings that they contributed to the field. In addition, I saw a snapshot of the breadth of current sociological work through the various guest speakers. Most importantly, I came to understand the ways in which race and positionality impacts sociological study as well as the complicated ways in which race has and has not shown up in sociology historically. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of the history of Sociology, background on ethnographic methods. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a frame-work to engage in ethnography from several perspectives and in several social settings. Also, I learned how to identify my own biases or presuppositions. ",
            "\u00a0What is ethnography and why it is relevant in the social sciences and humanities. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0In my opinion, the course's strength was that it featured various ways in which accomplished scholars have applied ethnography as a methodological within and adjacent to the field of sociology and urban studies. The structure of the course was relaxed but engaging. However, I wished that there was more shape to the class, particularly at the beginning and end of the semester to ensure that the class was operating from a similar framework. As someone who is not a sociologist and does not study any type of social science, it could be difficult to feel fully comfortable in the class or to understand what different guests and professors were talking about, especially early in the semester. Perhaps reserving the first seminar to not have a guest speaker and using it as a chance to knit the class together and go over the history of sociology and its tenants before reverting to the workshop structure for the rest of the semester would be helpful for future iterations of this course. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Professor Anderson was knowledgable and an expert in his field. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the strength of this course is Dr Andersons vast amount of knowledge and his position as a respected scholar in the field of ethnography. Dr. Anderson is able to share information in a way using his words that make sense. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to others students who want to understand the shape of sociology in both a historical and contemporary sense. The course is certainly not a good choice for students who want hands-on learning about how to conduct ethnography or to learn responsible ethnographic practices in the field. Nonetheless, the course seems well-designed for students who want an introduction to sociology and ethnography but might not be ready or invested in learning how to conduct it themselves.  I would tell other students that the course covers a lot of ground but is not overwhelming and that combination makes for a pleasant week-to-week class experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially those who are looking to gain experience with ethnography. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Dr. Elijah Anderson is the G. O. A. T. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would suggest that a person will take this course to acquaint oneself with the diverse world, while appreacting the fact that people speak for themselves. We must seek to understand what they are saying. "
