            "\u00a0This course was an excellent way to explore a seriously understudied area of Spanish Literature. I have gained huge amounts of knowledge, and would feel comfortable talking at length about a subject I previously knew nothing about. ",
            "\u00a0I had previously read much of the assigned readings, but Prof. Valis completed reframed them in the context of women's studies, which was incredibly successful and enlightening. She did a great job of bringing together historical context and gender bias in the readings and assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of some women writers from Spain and read poetry and prose of such writers. I had not explored this area before, so this was a nice subject to have more understanding of. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. It may not be helpful, but I honestly could not think of a way to improve it. It was an ideal seminar. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of potential because the topics covered are very interesting and is altogether a worthwhile course. However, the course could have been structured better as we had to read many things that piled on top of each other but didn't spend enough time discussing them. This created a phenomenon of reading the material but not understanding all of it in depth. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who felt comfortable with reading and writing in Spanish. It would be a lot of reading if you weren't already fairly fluent, but other than that, I would recommend to everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The course material and the historical insights that Professor Valis brought to our discussions were so engaging.  Although challenging, I felt that this class really helped develop my analytical skills and my understanding of the historical context in which these women authors wrote. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I really hope this course gets taught again, because it was such an incredible gift to get to work with Prof. Valis in this way. She's such a badass female professor working with the female voice in writing in a language that has historically excluded female voices from its narrative. Her skills within literary analysis and teaching really shone in this course in a way I hadn't seen them previously (and I've taken several courses with her). Really excellent, definitely take this course! A great L5 option. ",
            "\u00a0I would probably not, and only would if the structure would change because while it is an interesting subject, there were so many pieces that weren't organized well for student understanding, so some parts of the semester were quite shallow. Also, there is a lot of reading for this course so it's a pretty heavy workload. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to another student. The works you read in this class are incredible, and you are introduced to a vast circle of  marvelous, highly talented Spanish women-writers. You learn to closely read and analyze every assigned piece, while also thinking critically of the period/circumstances in which the works were written. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale so far. It's just one of those hidden gems that only a lucky few are able to find. Professor Valis and TF Sarah are such wonderful, helpful people, and their enthusiasm for Spanish literature makes the experience all the better. "
