            "\u00a0I learned how to view a natural environment as a system. By identifying the cooperative interaction between organisms, informed management decisions can be made. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a broad range of ecological topics, starting with nutrient cycling and ending with anthropogenic change. Students learn to read and critique scientific articles and to create an ecosystem budget and management plan. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course and found that it challenged me and I learned a lot. I liked the variety of assignments - readings, group work, individual work, presentations, written reports - interesting and they provided a great learning experience as we needed to master a variety of skills. I liked the substance of the course very much and found it to provide an excellent foundation for the MEM program. Also really enjoyed the two professor approach with two great teachers.\r\n\r\nI learned environmental science basics and intermediate to advanced concepts, critical thinking skills, presentation skills and scientific writing skills. Thanks. ",

            "\u00a0The most salient takeaway for me was how to read and evaluate scientific studies about ecosystem management ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about nutrients and soil chemistry in this course. I also gained familiarity with constructing budgets, as well as an appreciation for how difficult that is. I also learned about top-down controls and human-environment dynamics, though not as much as I did about nutrients and bottom-up controls. Finally, I developed additional skills in reading and critiquing scientific literature. ",

            "\u00a0I had very high expectations for the course, and they were not met. ",
            "\u00a0This course fell far below my expectations. I feel that this class was a total waste of my time. About a third of the way through the semester, it seemed that Mark and Pete stopped wanting to lecture. Instead, they assigned us readings and then in class had us discuss the readings in groups. The last two units in particular were almost entirely taught this way. While discussion in class can be a meaningful way to explore material and share ideas, the constant default to discussion without any guidance from the professors was tedious and frankly no one learned very much this way. I was really disappointed by this course. ",
            "\u00a0I expected this course would focus on the biotic components of the earth system and would complement the physical sciences course. For the most part the course met my expectations, however it went from micro level (nutrient cycling) to abstract and philosophical (humans & nature). I expected to learn more about types of ecosystems and population ecology. Note that I did not take the lab component. ",
            "\u00a0Very high, even more than I could have hoped. See above comments as well. I not only appreciated the material but I particularly appreciated the way the material was taught and the variety of type of assignments and way the in-class sessions were run. ",

            "\u00a0This class was much different than I expected. I wanted to learn more physical/biological/chemistry sciences and instead I mostly listened to my classmates opinions which were not informative. Much of the class felt like an overview of the environmental field when it's pitched as learning about landscape and ecosystem management. I wanted more depth on that and less opinions from others.

            "\u00a0To its detriment, this class tries to cater to students of all prior learning backgrounds. I do not think it should be taught in a flipped format because students with more background end up teaching their peers more than the professors. The scope of the course is too wide and it does not manage to cover any topics in depth. I would have liked to see more lectures by the professors. ",
            "\u00a0Stop with the in class discussions and debates. Please, enough is enough. They were such a waste of time. They were pretty clearly a crutch by the professors that did not seem to want to lecture very much. There was no reason to \"discuss\" an article for 45 minutes every class, then talk about that same discussion out loud. I enjoyed it when Mark and Peter lectured, I was pretty disappointed that they didn't make more of an effort on that front. The course was a little confusingly structured- we talked about carbon and nitrogen cycles for about a month then ended up reading the \"Ecomodernist Manifesto.\" The hard science elements sort of fell by the wayside and it almost became more of a humanities course as it went on which I was really not expecting. ",
            "\u00a0This course should not be taught as a semi-flipped class. Either it should be taught as a traditional lecture, or it should be entirely flipped, and instructors should come up with a meaningful way to spend class time. ",
            "\u00a0The budgeting project was a great exercise. I would have liked to have more guidance in how to go about executing the project though. I enjoyed the writing assignments where I had to summarize and critique academic journal articles. I wouldn't change anything about that assignment. I did not like when we had to break up into groups to discuss articles. I felt that it wasn't very fruitful. I would have minimized the occurrence of that activity. ",
            "\u00a0I found the first half of the course (topics: nutrient cycling, ecosystem change, migration) to be very useful and interesting. The budget and management plan assignments were great and tied together the course material in a way that was tailored to students' interests. I think that the course could be improved with more specific and clearer learning objectives like the physical sciences course. Also, the class discussions could have been structured to encourage more inclusive participation and better dialogue. For example, discussion leaders could have been assigned and questions provided ahead of time. ",
            "\u00a0I think I cover the strengths above. On the how it could be improved side I think there are maybe two things I would say and these are really at the margin in terms of that they would be tweaks not wholesale changes to the approach:\r\n\r\n- explain some of the readings a little more and how they tie to and support the concepts covered in class or through assignments\r\n\r\n- sometimes in class one approach to provoke discussion was to ask students to say which areas they wanted to know more about; I think this is fine but maybe the professors could have also elaborated on or reiterated concepts they felt were most important for us to grasp or focus on ",
            "\u00a0The Instructor assumed everyone had ecology background. Maybe more teaching will be helpful for better understanding of the concept ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps it could be smaller and the professors could spend more time discussing the course objectives. ",
            "\u00a0Too many group discussions with weak engagement. I would have preferred more lectures to expand on the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course excelled in covering a lot of material, mostly in depth. With primary lectures viewed before class, we almost got double the lecture time since class time often included additional mini lectures as well as discussion. The class discussions/debates were a double-edged sword in my book. While it was interesting to break down the new material with fellow students, the debate-style got old after awhile. The group assignments and discussions could have been improved with more time and clearer instructions. Often, our groups weren't quite sure what exactly we were supposed to be doing. Other times, we would spend a long time talking as a group convincing ourselves of one thing, only to find out we were wrong but without enough class time left to dive into the right answer and understand our mistakes. Communication for assignments in and out of class could have been improved overall.\r\nI felt like there was more emphasis and expertise on nutrient cycling/geochemistry from the two professors, and I really felt like some critical social science thought was missing from the final section of the course on human-environment interactions. This was especially apparent during a discussion about agriculture in Africa.\r\nFinally, I appreciated gaining more experience understanding and critiquing scientific literature, but would have found it extra helpful if the literature were coupled with practical case studies of management plans or policies implemented based on that science (i.e. if we could have seen the science in action in a practical way). I think that would have helped us gain practical skills as students in a professional degree, especially since many FES professors are research academics. ",
            "\u00a0Less discussion in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - Mark and Pete talking about what they know. E.g. systems processes and current papers with the basic science behind it. \r\n\r\nWeakness - given the students too much discussion time. Learning from students rather than from the professors. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the way the course material was structured--moving from the foundations of ecology and then later on engaging with how humans impact ecosystems. I actually wish there had been more lecture and less discussion though--I often wanted to hear more about what the professors thought in addition to my peers. "

            "\u00a0N/A - this class will no longer be offered in its current form ",
            "\u00a0Just know that you will not be spoon fed by any means. Which is appropriate, in my mind at least, for this level of course. The one thing I would say is that calling this course a \"foundation\" course may be a little misleading for some students who may expect it to be a little easier or they may expect to be led through the material a bit more than the current approach would imply.\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed the final project work but I think it was pretty demanding and some people may have been somewhat overwhelmed by it but perhaps I am wrong. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend taking a physical science class as it helps to understand part of the ecosystem and landscape class ",
            "\u00a0I generally do not think it is fair to compare courses, but here it goes anyway. Physical Sciences for Environmental Management takes the physical world and makes it understandable and even fun for people who could go on to work in any discipline-- even beyond FES. Ecosystems and Landscapes felt tailored to scientists and managers. There is nothing wrong with this, but it helps to know this before you enroll. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course would be more like physical sciences or bio/geo/chem in an applied method for landscapes and ecosystems. Instead I learned most from the papers I wrote doing my own research. "
