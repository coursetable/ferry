            "\u00a0I learned how to read literature closely and think deeply about it. The course material engaged with really interesting themes such as the nature and constructedness of reality. ",
            "\u00a0We read some classics of American literature (Moby-Dick, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson) along with some more modern, unconventional choices (Ursula LeGuin, Thomas Pynchon, Suzan-Lori Parks). My close reading skills definitely improved from taking this course, as well as my insight into both the different styles and running themes of storytelling. Our instructor emphasized that the class had less to do with \"America\" and more to do with close reading, but even so, I learned plenty about cultural changes and the history of American writing via the texts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to read and digest the rich complexity of the texts we read in this class. I had the opportunity to train my eye to read these texts in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a basic understanding of and appreciation for American Literature as a genre. ",
            "\u00a0The texts selected for this class allowed me to develop a far more nuanced understanding of what constitutes American literature: because Professor Williams largely avoided teaching works within the canon, I this class was far more illuminating than I expected. I also feel that my essay-writing skills improved in this class: we did not only write traditional five-paragraph analytical essays. One assignment, for example, involved reading four scholarly sources on a topic of our choice from one of the texts we'd read, and then summarizing and analyzing each with the goal of putting them in conversation with each other and forming our own opinions, carving out a place for ourselves in a scholarly discourse we found interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a broad understanding of themes and forms within American Literature. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of great classic literature and discussed methods of literary analysis. ",
            "\u00a0We read a pretty solid breadth of American literature, even though the selection was pretty unconventional. I think I definitely developed a better ability to analyze literature as it fits within a wider context of (1) an author's life and motivations, (2) literary movements, and (3) wider cultural movements. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the process and experience of reading, rather than just listing off different periods in American literature, which was what I expected at first. It brought up some very interesting questions about time, memory, and reality. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to read a lot of different works in a short time, and I loved that wide range. Unfortunately, it also meant that we couldn't engage super extensively with each of the works, so it's a bit of a trade-off. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was nearly perfect for me. I enjoyed almost every work (even Moby-Dick!) and the diversity of selection is great. The movies are fun too, if you haven't seen them already. I appreciated that discussion was student-driven, and Professor Williams always had something interesting to add. Weaknesses: sometimes discussion gets down a rabbit-hole and class goes by without getting to the major themes of the text. Also the David Eagleman book didn't seem to have a lot to do with the rest of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Williams brings so much to the classroom\r\nGreat discussion\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nTwo weeks to fully read and analyze Moby-Dick was not enough ",
            "\u00a0The texts on the syllabus are fantastic, and the history of each author/text was clearly communicated. I think we could have spent more time discussing the historical context in which each text was written and how they relate to America as a country. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the wide variety of works explored: we read poetry, a play, and many novels, as well as watched a few very interesting movies. I also felt that Professor Williams encouraged everyone to join the conversations in seminar, which I always found fruitful and engaging. Finally, the amount of work was manageable, with only four writing assignments throughout the semester. One weakness of this course is something that perhaps is impossible to avoid: because there was so much to cover--and of course, the works we read did not even begin to cover the breadth of American Literature--we moved rather quickly through each text. Sometimes I felt that discussion of each work was not as complete as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0This class is required for the English Major, which is why I took it. As an introduction to American Literature, I did a great job suggesting big-picture lessons I imagine I will take with me into other classes. I thought Prof. Williams' reading list was well formulated-- he gave us plenty of time to spend big, difficult texts like Moby-Dick while also making room for more modern texts (Ursula LeGuin's \"The Lathe of Heaven\") and popular films (\"Groundhogs Day\" and \"The Truman Show.\") ",
            "\u00a0The readings for the course are very diverse and well balanced! ",
            "\u00a0The reading list for this course is great. However, sometimes our analysis was somewhat basic. ",
            "\u00a0While I actually really enjoyed the rather unconventional selection of works we read, I wish this had been better conveyed in the course description, as I wasn't expecting to read quite the material we did. Also, Moby Dick in two weeks during midterm season? That just seems unreasonable. Overall, though, we had some really good discussions and I learned a lot about philosophy and culture in ways I hadn't expected to. ",
            "\u00a0All of the assignments were thought-provoking and uniquely challenging without being too daunting. The essays were reasonable in length and expectations. The class discussions made me excited to go to class every time, even if I hadn't finished the reading for that day. If anything, sometimes I wished the class was longer. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course! I loved getting to go to seminar, and our discussions were genuine, thought-provoking, and intellectually challenging. I learned a lot about American literature and just literature in general. Seriously, some of the discussions we had about the nature of reality were honestly mind-blowing. Plus, if you have the opportunity to take the course with Professor Williams, absolutely take it!! He is a fantastic professor with so much insight. He made class hilarious and engaging, plus he was very forgiving and flexible with deadlines and amount of work. Overall a fantastic course taught by a wonderful professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Williams is approachable, funny, and welcomes all kinds of interpretations and criticisms of the works. Class was never boring, although from what I heard of other sections, that's really dependent on the instructor. Do the readings, because the selected writers are great and you learn a lot from differences in opinion within the class. Highly recommend for first-years who don't end up in 114/115. Read Moby-Dick for the bragging rights. The papers aren't too difficult especially if you have experience with literary analysis. Also, follow Professor Williams' band on Spotify ;) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the literature itself is incredibly diverse and deep plus the discussion with fellow students is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Yes its a solid literature course and a good intro to the English major ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- a great intro to American Literature. And I'd absolutely recommend taking it with Professor Williams! ",
            "\u00a0Fun class! Professor Williams is super engaging, and the workload is pretty light.  Not the most in-depth or intense survey of American Literature, but a great look at some of the general themes, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! You will learn so much about American Literature that you never expected. Your analytical reading skills and writing will improve. There are even opportunities to have your essays read by peers before you turn them in, which can be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student if I thought they'd value the chance to read and discuss some of the classics of American Literature in a relatively low-pressure setting. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely worth taking even if you aren't an English major! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, particularly if you don't have a lot of experience in English. If you are an English major, it is a requirement, but anyone can get a lot out of the reading list. You don't get a ton of feedback on your essays, but the class is entertaining and relaxed. There are typically a lot of first-years in the class. It isn't a difficult course if you are already a decent writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you take it with Williams; he's the absolute best! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class even to non-English majors. The choices of literature were varied and interesting, and discussions in this class were always riveting. "
