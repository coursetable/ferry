            "\u00a0I didn't learn too much, to be honest. Except maybe my general knowledge of the science of water increased, which is something, I suppose. This isn't to say classes were boring - they were entertaining and always different, but it did mean we didn't have too much time to go into details. ",
            "\u00a0I really did not learn anything by taking this course the material was disorganized and all over the place and mostly it was students teaching \r\nProfessor Lee was mean to students when they tried to ask questions and honestly quite rude ",
            "\u00a0Gained an understanding of the science of water, specifically of concepts that I'd heard of but didn't fully understand, like fracking! ",
            "\u00a0This was a good general overview of water in all realms. I think the more practical applications of the class like talking about water's role in climate change, pollution, etc is a lot more interesting than the beginning portion of chemistry and astronomy. ",
            "\u00a0Really not much. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of water's vole in a broad variety of areas ",
            "\u00a0I learned a series of different things pertaining to water in every form I could think of: groundwater, tsunamis, exoplanets, public health pipe water, plants, desalination, etc. I also gained the skill of reading primary scientific literature, and practiced giving presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I hadnt taken a science credit at Yale before this course, so the material and style of teaching was pretty new to me. It was definitely helpful to learn more about water  it just kinda seems like something thats generally helpful  and I certainly got better at reading scientific articles. ",
            "\u00a0A familiarity with the \"big picture\" of geology and water; the story of the macro concepts like the origin of planets, all the way down to the micro-level detail of geochemistry. \r\nThe capacity to critically evaluate and critique primary literature articles. \r\nPractice in peer evaluation and responding to peer work. \r\nPractice in public speaking/ leading class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better assess science articles through our weekly assignments. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The weaknesses were that the readings were extremely difficult to understand and the lectures were often unrelated and confusing and the teacher was incredibly rude to students who tried to participate ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: No midterm & no final, just paper, presentation and weekly write ups.\r\nWeaknesses: The week to week topics didn't seem that connected and at the beginning didn't relate much to water. Write up and presentation grading seemed kind of arbitrary in terms of what was a 9 v. a 10. Some of the scientific articles were easy to understand but some were very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Kanani is great, but she needs to implement a no-laptop policy. 90% of the class is just checking emails all day. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very uncohesive. We are thrown so much information each class, which doesn't relate to the information we learned the previous week. The class environment is also very disengaged and the professor was not very encouraging of those who did decide to speak out. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - well facilitated to become an expert in an area of our choosing\r\nWeakness - repetitive structure, grading seemed arbitrary ",
            "\u00a0The setup was awesome! Having every other class run by students was a good idea. ",
            "\u00a0One of this courses biggest strengths is its structure. The format of a Tuesday lecture introducing students to a topic, a reading response due by Thursday, an in depth peer presentation on Thursday, and then a peer evaluation due by next Tuesday does everything possible to facilitate students learning in way that is dynamic, helpful, and interesting. I felt like I would go through multiple iterations of learning things in ways that actually helped solidify concepts in my head. The weekly reading responses are good check-ups and its also fun to watch peers present, and also present yourself. The course has a reasonableif robustworkload, and the grading is really reasonably. \r\n\r\nThe courses other biggest strength is Kanani Lee. Kanani Lee is an excellent lecturer. She is constantly able to meet students where they are at, and impart useful knowledge to them, whether her students are from G&G majors to seniors trying to fulfill their SC credits. I fit into the later category, and I think she was really good at finding analogies and metaphors to make complex scientific topics accessible to the layman. For the group presentations, I appreciated how she spent the time to meet with each partner group in order to talk through any of our issues and potential thoughts. Professor Lee was also super accommodating to me halfway through the semester when I ran into health issues. \r\n\r\nThe biggest potential weakness of the course is that fact that the roadmap through different topics didnt seem particularly logical in anyway that was obvious to me as a student. It seemed like we would go from topic to topic every week, jumping around drastically from outer space to groundwater to desalination, and I didnt exactly understand why. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: structure is really smart (seminar means that folks actually show up, in-class presentations increase engagement), Kanani is an excellent lecturer, syllabus clearly very well thought out\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: grading sometimes felt arbitrary, especially on reading responses (I think it balanced out in the end, but I got pretty good scores on reading responses that I thought werent so great, and pretty bad ones on responses that I thought were much better), in-class presentations can be a tad dull and easy to tune out, especially becuase we knew we werent going to be tested on the material ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nInteresting topics and engaging format. Student-led discussions allowed us to interact with the content in a way that fostered learning. \r\nWeaknesses: Some of the weekly articles were difficult to understand given limited chemistry/geology background. It sometimes felt like the reading load was too dense and technical to foster real engagement with the underlying concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. A great science gut that isn't as boring as a real gut. In fact, it isn't a gut. It's just good plain fun. This is a great class. Especially if you want a relaxed and interesting Science Credit. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not because grades were given arbitrarily and I learned almost nothing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for people who don't love science or quant-based work but are good at reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a science credit, yes! It is not difficult but you will have assignments for almost every class. If it isn't at 9 AM at Watson, then it will be a good class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you're looking for a straightforward relatively easy science credit. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as a senior looking for a science credit, and I definitely would recommend it to anyone else whether they are G&G majors or similar non-STEM people. \r\n\r\nOne of this courses biggest strengths is its structure.

            "\u00a0I tentatively would, but it really depends. The material isnt particularly hard, but this class isnt a gut  theres actually a decent amount of work and its not a guaranteed A (although I doubt the curve is nearly as harsh as other science courses). Material is pretty interesting, but its also easy to tune it out because its 9AM and you know there wont be any tests. It takes some time to do well on the assignments, but if you put in a solid effort, youll be fine. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in water (from any angle: chemistry, biology, geology, astronomy, etc.) this course may be a good match. The workload is reasonable, the grading is fair, and the chance to lead a whole class session in a partnered presentation is a very valuable experience with teaching/public speaking. However, be prepared that this course is very reading and writing intensive. The weekly article reviews can feel monotonous. Some topics will seem very engaging, and others very irrelevant, depending on your background and interests. Professor Lee is vey approachable, engaging, and a good lecturer. In general, if you're looking for a geology or science credit, this is a perfectly reasonable course to choose. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I learned a lot more about water and is a challenging but good science class for non-science majors "
