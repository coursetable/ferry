            "\u00a0This course familiarized me with many important texts from social theory, and helped to develop critical reading and academic writing skills.  It also helped to develop my own ideas for my doctoral research. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a representative overview of major developments in the field of social theory. It had an excellent syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0A deeper understanding of the theoretical influences on anthropology as a discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate the opportunity I had in this course to read new social theory and to reacquaint myself with texts I had previously read. I always got a lot out of discussion and definitely feel as though I learned a lot in this class. Through this course, I also found new ways to read efficiently and effectively, and to summarize ideas and ask critical questions effectively. I also appreciated the inclusion of nonwhite and non-male scholars in this syllabus. "

            "\u00a0The instructor's lectures and suggestions were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps the instructor could anchor the classroom discussions a bit more ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course was the lack of clarity about the different roles of the discussant and the respondent. Greater clarity in how each is supposed to function, and maybe suggestions for how those roles can be taken up, would be helpful in future iterations of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the way discussions were ran in the class. I think having a discussant and respondent begin the class helped to refresh our memories of the text and also prompted discussion well. I was curious as to what other students were interested in and wrote their various term papers on and think it would have been interesting and a useful learning experience to have a session where we all shared what our class papers had been on. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great reading list; strong discussion; the instructor walked us through some important ideas and key points about the readings, which was helpful; I appreciated the opportunities to organize my thoughts when presenting\r\nWeaknesses: No feedback on written presentations; we did not share our presentations with each other or really work collaboratively; sometimes there was too much material to cover in class \r\nHow it could be improved: Have students work more collaboratively on presentations; offer feedback on text summaries/presentations; have students circulate their presentations because they may be useful to other students; offer direction on important places to focus in a text when the reading is heavy; have more discussion about these texts in the context of anthropology "

            "\u00a0Yes, I gained a lot from this course. "
