In high school, you are obviously exposed to American history, but this course provides an environmental aspect that I feel is very unique. ",
            "\u00a0I've never taken a history course before, and I think I expected this class to be more about the environment (slightly more science-y), but I was pleasantly surprised that this class was more of a history course than anything. I felt like I improved my writing a lot in this course we only had one big paper, but between the weekly blog posts and preparing for the exams, I feel like I got a lot out of the course. Other than that, it was just interesting to think about American history in the context of our environmental impact. I also thought of the environment before as just the ecology (like trees and natural landscapes), but I've come to see that it's actually a lot more than that and includes everything like built environments too. While environmental history is one way of telling history, it was also interesting to see the intersection with other lenses (social, political, economic, cultural, etc.) The way our history unfolds is through the interactions of several factors, and it was interesting to think about that. Other than that, I also feel like I am now thinking about current events a little more thoughtfully: how they impact the future, how they mirror the past, how they differ from the past, what themes they reinforce, what factors are in play, etc. ",

Prior to taking the course, I didn't even realize historical essays differed much from any other kind of writing (social science essay, english essay, etc.). Now, not only do I know the difference but I can write through a historical lens! I also obviously learned about American Environmental History and how the environment has been intertwined in American politics, culture, and overall society. ",

            "\u00a0American environmental history provided a comprehensive overview of the relationships of power that existed between humans and the natural environment throughout the entire development of the American state. I found it very important that we critique the different types of narrative arguments that exist within history, ranging from those of colonial violence, American expansion and opportunity, market logics of capitalism, and the demonization or deification of nature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an enormous amount about environmental history since white colonization. I also liked Prof. Sabin's focus on writing and how to write an effective paper.

            "\u00a0American environmental history offered a strong grounding in America's story of interactions between the land and its people, as well as a great introduction to the field of environmental history. Lecture's presented important figures and ways of thinking that emerged over time in American history, and much time was spent in section analyzing primary sources.

This course also played a greater emphasis on research, as it is a writing credit class, and therefore gave me a better handle on the interactions between primary and secondary sources. Additionally, this course allowed me to practice writing a research paper, and how to write an engaging and creative piece. ",

            "\u00a0This class has a lot of interesting material, no necessary changes. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging lectures. Media rich slides maintained student attention. Attempts at class discussions often proved slow and unfruitful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: storytelling aspect of Sabin's lectures, structure of the final paper actually encourages a better understanding of the research process, readings are engaging\r\nWeaknesses: lecture could stand to be about 20 minutes shorter, I appreciated the effort to engage the class in discussion but in a large lecture it inevitably becomes a few voices that dominate the lecture discussion every week, reading load is sometimes a bit more demanding than I would expect from an introductory lecture. Don't love that there is both a final paper and final exam but they are far enough apart that they aren't too demanding ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Prof. Sabin was extremely approachable, kind, and funny. Lectures were great to listen to. \r\nWeaknesses - Grading could seem kind of randomly subjective at times. ",
            "\u00a0I would love to see more information on the powerpoint slides! ",
            "\u00a0Lecture could be boring at times, but overall there were lots of different topics covered. Exams were straight forward and easy ",
            "\u00a0I thought the strengths were keeping interests with videos, breaks, and discussions during class. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be shorter. This would have been a great 50 min course, the longer lecture seemed to drag on.  I enjoyed the course's organization and note handouts.  I also really enjoyed the use of outside material to make the class more engaging: videos, goest lectures, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this was a very good class. The material was engaging, and professor Sabin is fabulous. I really enjoyed learning in the course. However, I do think lectures could be broken up a bit more. They were occasionally slightly monotonous, and I felt given the length of each lecture, I tended to lose focus about 75% of the way through. Perhaps if the material was slightly broken up with more discussion (perhaps two breaks rather than one), it would be easier to follow along. Also, handwriting the notes was very difficult because of the speed at which the material was introduced and discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures were very dry and rehearsed. The only thing that kept me somewhat attentive was the content. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciate how the course was taught chronologically and it felt like we seeing a story unfold. The readings were incredibly interesting! It was a lot of reading every week, but I was always looking forward to reading just because the topics were so interesting and Professor Sabin showcased a diversity of writing styles in his reading selections. (I think he's really reinforcing the idea that there are many different ways of telling the history of something.) Note-taking in class can be a bit difficult just because we can only hand-write and there's a lot of information. Prof. Sabin had a really helpful outline though, but I wish he'd release it earlier (maybe an hour before class), so we could get a chance to preview them and decide what we need to take notes on. (We get them when we walk into lecture, which isn't necessarily enough time to read, so I often scrambled to take notes  because I didn't know whether the information was in the outline already.) ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Sabin is a great lecturer, but there's an impossible amount of readings. I would have engaged way more with the course with quality over quantity on the reading assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lecture notes made it easy to understand what to prioritize and the professor highlighted key themes to take away from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures drag on- this class should really be 50 minutes long + section, not 75. We'd all get so bored halfway through and just text the whole time. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a bit overwhelming, especially at the end of the semester with the paper, final and reading. I think the reading needs to be cut back on or there should just be a final paper and no final exam. A strength was how well organized the class was. The lecture handouts were very helpful and Professor Sabin was an engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0High workload, long class and section ",
            "\u00a0Lecture is just really drawn out. It could be 50 mins ",
            "\u00a0Somtimes lectures dragged on for a long time so more breaks to discuss would be appreciated. Professor Sabin did a good job covering the material and is clearly very passionate. ",
            "\u00a0Sabin is a pretty monotonic lecturer in that every word is given equal (high) passion, and that could be somewhat draining throughout the lectures. Handouts were great, and the paper was generally a positive learning experience. You learn how to BS a 10-12 page paper pretty well. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is very difficult to stay focused for the full hour, 15 lecture and also have a section. It would be better to only have a 50 minute lecture as I think students would be more engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were pretty manageable for this course and Professor Sabin did a great job engaging the class during lecture with songs, videos, and cool stories. The class is 75 minutes though which seemed much too long for the material to be covered each lecture. It could easily be a 50 minute class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the topics of this course interesting; however, I thought that the exams were a bit excessive.  They required copious amounts of memorization, and in particular, the final exam was grueling.  I thought that a better understanding of material could've been demonstrated through short papers as opposed to the two exams this class offered. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Nice way to get a writing credit (one 10 page paper about whatever you want plus some weekly(ish) blog posts), Paul Sabin clearly cared so much about what he was teaching, people generally liked their TA's. The videos Professor Sabin showed in class were always really memorabl and informative. Also, it was really cool to engage with primary sources so much and make our own interpretations.\r\nWeaknesses: First off, the class did not need to be 75 minutes, because sometimes it just felt like Paul Sabin was trying to find ways to fill the time and he often let us go early. I think making the class 50 minutes would make the lectures more sharp and focussed, and easier to learn from and pay attention to. Secondly, there was WAY too much reading, which made it difficult to get anything productive done in section because there was no way everyone could have done all the reading, plus the TA's were trying to balance teaching writing skills for our looming term papers (this is a writing credit, after all!). You could totally get away without doing much of the reading, and often I didn't do much of it because there was so much it was just daunting. Had there been a fraction of the reading assigned, I probably would've made the time to do all of it. Instead, I was too intimidated by the shear volume and ended up doing none of it. Also, the readings didn't need to be as long as they were-- we read almost an entire book about the dust bowl one week and it could've been summed up in like 3 sentences. The readings were barely connected to class, and could've been better connected to what was discussed in lecture if we had time in section to do so, but instead we were juggling 101 things and never really got into much depth for anything. Also, having a term paper AND a final exam was really brutal and kinda cruel, especially because the final was honestly so random and long.\r\nLast thing: I wish we got to summarize what we learned more often, rather than just cramming for a midterm and a final. Like if every other week or something we talked through broader topics and how individual people, events, etc. that we were learning about tied into those topics. That would have really helped my understanding of the material. Maybe section would be a good place for that, especially if we cut down on the reading. ",
            "\u00a0EVST 120 is structured but can be more entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting class and you can learn so much about different disciplines and how they connect with the environment. It was really fascinating to learn about these different events because I did not have much knowledge about American history, environmental or otherwise. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a ton of things packed into one class and we don't go in depth into any one topic. Exams are also really difficult and hard to study for. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the class was well organized and taught for the most part. The Eric Lipton visit was an awesome highlight--very cool to see someone working in the present on reporting environmental news and using primary sources like that in journalism. My main complaint is with the final paper. I think we chose our final paper topics too early. I understand that this was done to break the research and writing process into more manageable chunks, but it was hard to decide on a topic when we had only scratched the surface of the material. I think the final paper should be a synthesis of what we've learned and we hadn't even reached the halfway point. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a manageable workload that engages you with the readings each week through reflective reviews. The content is expansive and presented by Professor Sabin in an interesting way. We also had the opportunity to explore our interpretations of the text through very open in-class examinations as well as a creative research paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Logical flow, Prof. Sabin's hand out sheets, fair and interesting assessments.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes section got a bit repetitive and would have been nice to mix up discussion of the texts with other things. Too much class discussion each class. Either make it a once a week thing or shorten the amount of time given to it. This class could be 50 mins long, and I think better for it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interested reading/subject matter.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were rather dull and lasted too long. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a strength in the course was section, and I thought Professor Sabin's content was clear. However, I found lectures to often be dry and difficult to engage with. I also didn't feel like there was guidance for the final paper, which is unfortunate because of its weight in the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is both a strength and a weakness for the course: environmental history is incredibly broad, and at times, the amount of material being thrown our way was indigestible because of the volume and breadth of topics. I'm not sure how this could be improved given the all-encompassing definition of environmental history. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are just a touch too long. I think we could have covered as much in just 50 mins. ",
            "\u00a0Though I understood Prof. Sabin's intentions when he tried to make the lecture into more of a discussion or conversation, I thought the size of the class made this pretty clunky and inefficient. The same four people who left comfortable talking in front of he entire lecture would participate and the rest of the class would kind of just sit there. I also thought the readings for this class, while interesting, could have been pared down to allow deeper discussion in section, and to emphasize the writing component of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed lecture, but I wish that lecture slides could have been posted online. ",
            "\u00a0The class is nicely organized and you get lecture note printouts for every class, which is really helpful. The lecture can sometimes be a bit dry, but the historical videos dispersed throughout the lectures help break it up. Professor Sabin has a no lapop policy which I personally really liked. It made me focus a lot more in class, which helped when the exams came around. The exams are fair and pretty open ended. The paper is also fun to write and you have a lot of time to work on research and writing for a relatively short paper (8-10 pages), with a lot of feedback and support from the TFs. ",
            "\u00a0The content was wonderful, but the class was too long and made it difficult for the students to pay attention toward the end. ",
            "\u00a0Although weekly writing assignments were successful at keeping students on track, they often fell on weeks with other course assignments - in these cases, it was difficult to attend to both projects with full attention. In the future, it may be beneficial to cut down on the weekly blog posts, or offer the WR credit as an optional component. Either way, this was not necessarily a weakness of the course, and overall the course was engaging. I especially liked the way students were required to take notes by hand - I feel as if I absorbed the most from this course this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the stories that are told to convey the history. Listening to particular snippets of certain Indian tribes or the story of a certain animal or a certain presidential change of power was fascinating and I will not forget the content of the class.\r\nThe no-laptop policy is such a strength to this class. The fact that it was enforced and no one used laptops kept me focused on the lecture.\r\nThis class could be improved by shortening the class period. I understand the want to have students engage, and that's a great part of the course even if many students don't want to speak up, but the class always ended a few minutes early.\r\nI was confused with the grading on the first midterm because for some IDs, the only comment I would receive was \"Great job!\" and then receive a 94, or I would mention a trend-line in American history that related to the ID, and then have the comment \"could have spent more time on this point, it's interesting!\" and receive a 92. These are IDs and I was writing incredibly quickly and budgeting my time in order to finish all of them to the full extent I wanted, and so of course I couldn't elaborate on every single point because otherwise I may not have finished the test! I guess we just don't know the grade breakdown, so I don't know if 95 is the highest grade or not too. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures we're almost all directly read from the handouts, and there was so much reading for section. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was great how the weekly workload decreased so that we could work more on our papers, and how the weekly work contributed towards our papers. It got us thinking about what we were going to be writing about way in advance and doing research early. It made my paper a lot better than it would have been otherwise. I think that sometimes the lectures got a little dry, but overall I think Professor Sabin taught some really engaging material. ",
            "\u00a0The readings, topics and discussions were all chosen perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0Stop quoting racists to end the class or excuse their behavior by saying that they are complicated\r\nSpend less time on grain elevators and more time on people of color\r\nMake the class a 50 min lecture instead of 1/2 an hour bc no one likes partipating ",
            "\u00a0I wished it had more  focus on the twentieth century and government. I had hoped this class would illuminate more about the recent history of modern environmental challenges and types of strategies utilized to solve them. The first part of the class was much more about land use and I felt it could have been condensed. \r\nStrengths: engaging lectures, unique perspectives, good in class videos. ",
            "\u00a0The subject matter was very interesting and the professor listened to our feedback on the course in the middle of the semester- this is how the course was improved! ",
            "\u00a0The course's strength is the information conveyed through lectures, readings, and multimedia (primary sources, videos, songs, etc.). It was an interesting subject, and we were exposed to a different perspective of American history. The weakness was the writing aspect of the course, which was neglected for much of the semester. When it was brought up in lecture or discussion section, the lessons about writing seemed forced and out of place. Many of the guidelines were either misleading or unhelpful. Overall, the majority of the course was excellent despite lacking in the writing aspect. ",
            "\u00a0Felt like lectures could have fit into a 50 minute class rather than a 80 minute class. Appreciated the lecture handouts though and the use of videos and articles in addition to long essays. ",
            "\u00a0The readings of this course can be engaging, but there were at times too many sources or too lengthy sources to feel like I had a solid grasp on everything discussed. The readings and lectures didn't always overlap, but I thought section did a good job of incorporating discussion of the readings into the general discussion of the course. The themes for each week also helped to organize information. The class is a bit ambitious in everything it attempts to do: lecture on a broad subject, facilitate discussion of a variety of texts, and teach important writing skills. While I gained something from all of these skills, the attention given to all of them was a bit scattered. Despite the course being a writing credit, it was difficult to feel like we were doing substantial writing work. That being said, I learned a good amount about historical writing. I also had a particularly good section. Sections were set up to offer consistent feedback, and I appreciated hearing from my TA about ways to improve or expand my thinking. ",

            "\u00a0The first 50 minutes of the lecture are engaging, but the course was too large for the interactive element to work. To solve this, the lecture should be shortened to 50 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: professor obviously loves this topic, broad enough for everyone to find something interesting in it, specific enough to not be detailed. \r\nWeaknesses: The class time itself is a bit long and I found myself getting antsy as the material isn't quite riveting. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized and engaging. The reading assignments were all very reasonable and interesting. I cant think of any significant weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I think the two 75 minute lectures with a section were a lot, but I did think my section was really helpful. I think that 50 minute lectures would keep me more engaged with the material and make it easier to conceptualize different topics as they'd be more concisely delivered. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was organized really well. The topics for each week were well organized into themes, the lecture notes were incredibly helpful, and the readings were also interesting and broadened what had been discussed in class. ",

            "\u00a0Have us the flexibility to write a research paper on a topic that I was genuinely interested in. Lectures were a bit redundant. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was good at pulling information and perspectives from a wide variety of sources and giving a good overall picture of American environmental history. However, I had a lot of trouble staying engaged during lecture, which has not been a problem for me in other classes. I think that the lectures lacked the strong pivoting points that make narratives interesting, which led to a lot of slow periods that blurred together and seemed unimportant to me. ",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting and explores many ideas. I think the final assessment was a poor reflection of the rest of the class. ",
            "\u00a0A big strength was Prof Sabins lecture style. Providing notes to annotate was a fabulous study tool, and beginnig with music made the atmosphere lively ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Summary papers for each lecture were very helpful, good timeline, good attempts to integrate student discussion with a large lecture class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures could be shorter, could have readings that featured a more diverse range of perspectives, sometimes readings did not correspond with lecture material, need for more cohesion overall, more time should be spent focused on later 19th/20th century history, I feel like the course wrapped up very quickly and not enough focus to wrap everything up ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the sections engagement and range of material that we covered. However, I struggled to keep up with doing all of the readings and putting in equal effort into each. "

            "\u00a0As an intro writing credit, intro to the environmental studies major, or just an interesting class, definitely worth taking. Sabin really makes the class about the craft of history and the process of research in a way that a lot of other intro classes don't, and the skills are definitely worthwhile. ",

If you're a big history buff, this course would probably be kind of boring for you, although maybe the environmental lens would add an interesting twist. I personally had pretty shoddy American history knowledge prior to this course, which made it much more educational. Also, this course counts towards Energy Studies! ",
            "\u00a0yes, the course is a great introductory environmental history course. ",

We learn so much about American environmental history (which in my opinion, everyone should know or be exposed to), and this is the easiest writing credit you'll ever do (one 10 page research paper at the end of the semester). Week on week it's also just casual reading responses on canvas that you discuss in class after. You get to do interesting readings and learn about so many different perspectives. Plus there's a field trip in the middle of the semester and Sabin is such a knowledgable professor! As someone who came in knowing nothing about American history (environmental or otherwise) this class taught me so much and I also began to see so many connections with my other classes (then again, I'm an Environmental Studies major, so perhaps that's why). The caveat though is that the exams are difficult and hard to study for. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. It's truly a survey course, so you don't get to explore a lot of the topics further. But it's a good overview of major environmental incidents and historical themes. Prof. Sabin is a great lecturer and professor and makes a 1.5 hour lecture feel more dynamic with music/videos/etc. Most of the grading is by a TF, so it depends on who you have. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! It is a survey course so you don't go into much depth in any subject, but great if you don't know a lot about American environmental history. Prof. Sabin is super passionate and that comes across in his lectures where he plays music at the start and then tells interesting and memorable stories. ",
            "\u00a0Took this class as a writing credit - if you need the credit, it's a relatively harmless way of fulfilling the credit. If you're looking for something that will stimulate your mind, look elsewhere. Honestly sad that as a STEM major it's so hard to get into a writing seminar that you are effectively forced into a lecture class that serves as a writing credit. ",

As a STEM major, this course offered both intriguing subject matter (environmental history truly touches all aspects of our lives) and a writing credit that didn't take over my life.

It's much easier to address the complicated and diverse issues of environmentalism with a strong foundation in the history surrounding it. It was also a good introduction to environmental history and historical writing. I never considered studying history from an environmental lens, but I think it did influence the way I approach environmentalism. I also learned a lot about reading and constructing an argument from primary sources and how to structure a historical paper. For a writing credit, there is relatively little writing. The workload isn't impossible either. ",

The lectures and sections are interesting, although there is a lot of reading and much of the work of the course, especially in the second half, is geared towards the final essay. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, overall, this was a good course. However, it can feel kind of one sided and a little slow at times. This is one of the requirements for the environmental studies major and a manageable writing credit.  The research paper will allow you to choose a topic you are interested in and go deeply into a topic. Unfortunately, I wish that this class was able to more greatly integrate ideas of social justice and racial equality into environmental concepts (ex. Professor Sabin ended our class with a quote from Aldo Leopold without going into the white supremacist, racist ideals Leopold had and the way Leopold treated Native peoples and lands). I think that there should be more clear overall goals of the class and these need to be deeply deeply integrated into every lecture. The class is a little tough because you have both a final paper and a final exam and it is easy to forget what was covered during the first half of the class. If this class was better integrated and had shorter lectures and better readings, I think it would be an important and fun class that every student should take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it covered a writing credit and was very interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who wants to get a better understanding of how people's relationships with the environment have changed over time to shape our current state of the environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I learnt a lot about American history and have largely increased my general-knowledge of the environment. I believe the class has helped me in my essay writing which will help me further in my education. "
