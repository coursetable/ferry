            "\u00a0Learned about how religion, especially conversion, addresses topics such as the Self, history, and agency. ",
            "\u00a0I gained skills in reading and analyzing and synthesizing texts in ways I had never done before in 4 years of undergrad. The readings were probably the best of any course I've ever taken, and I also gained insight into the kind of support or futures I can imagine if and when I get help with the learning challenges that I've mostly ignored up to this point. I learned to trouble every binary and to think outside overly simplistic ways of conceiving of agency, freedom, and concepts of histories that foreclose flexible ends. ",
            "\u00a0Mostly I've just thought about conversion a lot from different lenses. The class was structured so you weren't advancing a thesis or surveying a field, just kind of turning the concept over in your hands and squinting at it until it started to look like different things. Which in itself was an interesting analytical skill to train. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to explore really complex ideas in a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Hard to know where to start on this one, honestly. Things about conversion? I definitely talked about religion in a way that I hadn't before and that felt productive. It was all very theoretical. Sadly, for me, that meant it was sometimes pretty inaccessible.  I have talked with other students and heard similar sentiments, a lot was over my head. Some of the readings were very enjoyable. I wished that this course offered me more of a background in religious theorists whose names I sometimes hear, instead of having the whole focus be on conversion. It felt like the course presupposed that I had knowledge of theory and the methodology and vocabulary of the field of theory that I did not.  Overall, I was a bit confused about why our instructors made that choice of focusing on conversion for the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a broad study of religious methodology  specifically within the context of conversion and conversion narratives. We spent many seminars discussing philosophy concepts such as authenticity and agency within the context of everything from traditional religious work like St. Augustine's Confessions to literature such as Kierkegaard to ethnographic studies on Islamic cassette tape sermons and homosexual \"conversion\" centers. I found the number of ways that the framework of religion could be applied onto the structures of life to be astonishing and fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Professors Khawaja and Inouye were great at pushing understandings in novel directions.  I felt pushed to think differently about the content, and I got exposed to a wide breadth of sources. "

            "\u00a0Very interesting seminar that facilitated many fascinating discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is incredible for its remarkable syllabus, participants, and facilitation. The protocols at the beginning of each class were excellent and really helped construct a thruline through the course. I wish we'd been doing the reading responses since the beginning of the semester. I also wish there had been another writing opportunity before the final paper, because it was pretty hard to just pull that out of no where after having little writing guidance throughout the semester. But truly, this was one of the best courses I've ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the readings could have been trimmed (Kuhn, for instance), not because there was too much but because not all the reading felt relevant to the questions we were developing. I frequently felt pretty lost in the conversations in the first half of the semester, and I'm pretty sure much of the class felt that way too sometimes Noreen or Mie would start developing a thought and before anyone could ask questions, the other would piggy back on that, and then it'd be 9 minutes later and we'd be lost. Pinning the discussion to the Canvas questions helped a lot. Maybe a more up front explanation of what the goal of the class is at the beginning of the semester would help it wasn't that I left the class wanting more guidance, it's that I wish I had given myself more license at the beginning to wander around in the material without trying to predict where we were going with it. ",
            "\u00a0More grades? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting premise, high concentration of interesting people in one room, sometimes really interesting conversation comes out of that. Readings felt focused on a theme. Pushes students to think in new ways.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Often inaccessible. Presupposed a lot of knowledge from students which I at least did not have. Did not give me a background in religious theory or how to talk about it. Unfortunately, talking to Professor Khawaja often left me more confused. Weekly reading responses were not enough to keep the class on track and make sure people came prepared. I worked hard to do all of the readings but did not know how to participate. It was hard to name the subject that is being discussed, and therefore hard to contribute. The seminar room sometimes felt performative. People would \"play the room.\" ",
            "\u00a0At times conversations became so philosophical that it was hard to follow or to feel as though the material was relevant. This was especially the case at times since every week began with a student presentation. When those presentations were well done, the conversation in the class was usually incredible, lively, and relevant. It was especially fun to be in a class of all religious studies majors who were well-versed in religious vocabulary, frameworks, and methodologies (as well as shared ground for humor) which at times made the conversations feel very meaningful while still grounded in the text. However, when student presentations were not well done, class often fell flat because the only alternative when there were not enough initial questions was to go back to the philosophical concepts, which while fascinating had a tendency to stray from the readings and become impossible to follow. Overall, however, I truly enjoyed the class. ",
            "\u00a0My understanding of the course is that it is different every semester/year based on who is teaching it, which is always a yellow-flag to decided not based on the course but the professor.  That can be a strength or a weakness.  In this case the former. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes it is a very interesting course that highlighted many different aspects of religion that I hadn't previously thought of. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would! I might recommend they take it cred/d because honestly I have never managed to work this hard in any course before and I still feel deeply uncertain about whether I did remotely ok. I think it might have been a little more relaxed if I didn't have to worry about trying to pass. But honestly, anyone would be silly not to take a course with Prof Khawaja and Mie if they get  a chance. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really neat class if you're ready to just jump in and get lost in the material and not worry about where you're going with it yet. Of course, the professor and the nature of the class changes every year, so you really should decide whether to take 490 based on the professor. Noreen and Mie were great. If you've got to take 490 for the major, Noreen's a good person to take it with. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0I think a lot of whether this class is right for you will depend on who is in it and what is on the syllabus and who is teaching. Whether you like classes that meet once a week is also important. Consider if you like classes where the work you produce mostly exists in your head rather than on the page. I was constantly interacting with the course, but I didn't feel like I was gaining so much from that interaction. The format of 1 presentation 1 paper as the work structure did not work well for me, but maybe it will for you.  If you're RLST major you need to take this class. Look carefully at the different professors who offer it to decide when it is best to take it because a huge amount will be determined by who is in the seminar room leading the class discussion and deciding on the syllabus. \r\n \r\nThe truth is that this is the class I would complain about to my friends. I often approach professors when I feel that way, but did not feel this class was an accessible space for that. It felt like a portion of standing in the class was determined based on appearing to \"get\" what it was about or at least aiming for, and that confessing that I was confused would be to my detriment. Instead, I kept my head down and did the readings and contributed to the best of my ability. This was possibly the wrong choice in retrospect, I do like Professor Khawaja, but I still feel somewhat disappointed by the class regardless. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who enjoys applying the framework of religion onto themes of colonialism, conversion, agency, authenticity, morality, institutional organizing, and other philosophical questions. This is not a course that gives a broad introduction to religion, nor is it a course that will always be very tangible. But it does teach you a variety of interesting ways to view religious ideas at work in both the medieval and modern world and a fascinating new way of conceptualizing your own perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, though again, it's impossible to make blanket recommendation for a class taught differently every time it's offered. "
