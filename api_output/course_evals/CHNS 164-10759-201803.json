            "\u00a0This course was my first exposure to Chinese literature, so I definitely learned a lot! It was also my first time writing creative pieces in Chinese, so I grew a lot in that area as well. What I found most appealing about this course was that fact that Su Laoshi personally knew a lot of the authors we read, so he would always tell us anecdotes about them--this added such a fascinating layer to our learning and understanding of the literature. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class as you will hear many interesting stories from Su Laoshi. The material may sometimes be challenging, but it is totally do-able! ",
            "\u00a0A better idea of what constitutes good and creative Chinese fictional writing. ",
            "\u00a0-contextual understanding of specific literary terms\r\n-stories and biographies of notable Chinese authors\r\n-chengyu and literary vocabulary ",
            "\u00a0My writing became better and so did my reading. ",
            "\u00a0This course substantially advanced my language skills, particularly in writing. I also gained deep insight into Chinese culture and recent history from Prof. Su's incredible stories. His stories were not just told for fun, but rather to illustrate aspects of the culture that are crucial for anyone seriously interested in China to understand. "

        [
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the variety of the pieces that we read--you could really tell that the selection was carefully curated. I also liked the workload of the class (homework and essay typically due once a week) because it made learning effective but not stressful. That said, I do wish that there was more discussion among the students since it was a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I would appreciate more opportunities to practice speaking. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is definitely the exposure to contemporary literary texts and an increased Chinese cultural literacy.\r\nA weakness is the lack of speaking practice opportunities in class and also the very diverse Chinese levels of the students taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Texts were so difficult that students typically spent anywhere between 15-30 pages reading a particular page. Even after translating the terms, the text was often opaque and challenging to analyze. More guidance and slow, open readings of the text in class would have been extremely helpful. For instance, some authors used 'illegal' or improper Chinese grammar, or often alluded to specific spaces or references in Shanghai that students had no knowledge of. While Su Wei laoshi did a great job at bringing this information to light, reading fewer texts and going at a slower pace would have greatly enhanced student learning, understanding and engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I definitely felt challenged since I'm a heritage speaker who mostly spoke Chinese and didn't write as much unless I was typing. So, I definitely improved.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We didn't talk at all in class it was just Prof Su lecturing... He also seems to favor non-chinese students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Su. He is just incredible. The material was also excellent. My reading and writing particularly improved.\r\nWeaknesses: Not much chance to practice speaking, but class time is limited...and honestly, I'd rather hear Prof. Su share his wisdom and cultural insights than listen to my classmates and myself speaking.

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to another student! I would say that it was one of the least stressful ways to maintain your Chinese level, and you get to express yourself creatively. You also get to become friends with Su Laoshi, who cares so much about his students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it. Even though it is a language class, I feel I also learned a lot about Chinese traditional culture and philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who already has experience reading literature in Chinese, not to someone who has just come out of an L5 language class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes: a great teacher and valuable course which will definitely challenge you, especially vocabulary-wise. However, more feedback on essays would have been greatly appreciated. All students received a score on their essay between 9 and 10, but there were few comments and edits on the actual writing. Instead, Su Wei laoshi would offer broad feedback for the entire class - most times these criticisms were helpful, but personalized commentary would have been appreciated too. ",
            "\u00a0No, because I felt that even though I improved, I didn't get much from the actual topic of the class. I'm sure another Chinese course would be more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is not very hard and your reading/writing skills will advance. I think you'll also really enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0You go through a selection of 7ish? passages from novels by notable contemporary Chinese writers, curated by Professor Su Wei. It was interesting reading those but the passages were short and I would have personally preferred just focusing on 1 or 2 novels and going really in depth into them. Supplemented by biweekly essays where you had a lot of freedom to be creative. There isn't that much of an opportunity to practice speaking though. "
