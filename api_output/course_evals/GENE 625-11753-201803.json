            "\u00a0Lectures were often boring and not engaging. Discussion papers were inconsistent with level of difficulty in how much knowledge in the field one would have to know in order to understand the analysis of the experiments that were discussed. Strengths are that Dr.Lu cared very much about student performance and that professors were very approachable to students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: covered a large amount of the field of genetics. I feel much more knowledgeable about genetics than I did when I first started.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some professors took months to grade our assignments, which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is the discussion sections that allow for engagement and participation regarding class topics. One weakness is the way that some of these were run by the professors, as a couple were very disorganized or focused on only one paper when multiple were assigned. Additionally, many of the lectures were particularly not engaging and unorganized, making it hard to follow along if you were unfamiliar with the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The discussion sections where we went over papers were nice because it gave us a chance to think critically about the topics covered in class. The pizza and debate was awesome! Definitely the best part of the class (and not just because of the pizza)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the professors were very difficult to follow during the lectures and I had trouble learning anything from them (they were either too technical or moving too fast, or a combination of the two). Additionally, some of the discussions were poorly facilitated. They did not promote an active learning environment, which should be the goal of such sessions. Dr. Dimitrova had the best version of the discussion section in my opinion, so maybe other professors should try her style. Another weakness is that we did not get feedback on our assignments until weeks after we submitted it. I understand that professors are busy, but it is difficult to learn and improve if we are not given feedback throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThis course could be improved if we were able to give each individual faculty anonymous feedback after they teach their section of our course. It is difficult now to remember what I thought of the faculty who taught back in August. I would like to give them all feedback so that they can continue to improve their teaching style, however I cannot do so if the only time we get to give any feedback is at the end of the year. Also, some faculty asked us during class what we thought of the course. Please don't do this. We will never answer honestly because it is difficult to give someone in a position of power honest critical feedback in person. ",
            "\u00a0Occasionally, questions might be open-ended, but the grader expects a specific response. \r\n\r\nProfessors were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very rich contents, overview of genetics research.\r\nWeakness: The course speed is so fast, not providing enough details. ",
            "\u00a0Feedback should be provided in a more timely manner to aid understanding. Paper discussions could delve more deeply into the experimental design and weaknesses of the paper, not just the summary. Participation in the discussion could count more towards the grade. The one page limit on homework assignments only encouraged the use of small font and margins; a word count limit on homework assignments might make more sense and make it easier for instructors to read the submission. \r\n\r\nI loved being given the time to discuss how current events (such as CRISPR edited babies and 23andMe) are shaping our responsibility to society as genetics in training. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of repetitiveness in this course due to the fact that a different professor taught each week, but at the same time, it was nice to get to learn from a variety of professors.  I didn't think the discussions were particularly beneficial; they were too large to have a meaningful discussion, and many of these discussions involved walking through each figure of a paper, which wasn't particularly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion sessions are well-organized and the files in canvas system are great. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately, I think the weakness is partly inherent to the course: The course rapidly moves over a wide array of topics and (generally) attempts to move from global perspective to specific cases. I think this is an good approach. The limited time given for each topic means that it is difficult to understand the specific in a meaningful way (integrating into other cell biology/genetics/physiology/chemistry knowledge) when these details involve highly specific/arcane exampleskeeping track of protein names can often become a hindrance. I infer that students are supposed to use their own time to delve into topics of interestthat the lecture offers a brief intro. Given that the homework does not often involve all or even some of the specific cases, there is likely little drive for the majority of students to take this extra time. In this way, this course format could lead to many hours of lost time for these students as they sit through the detailed second halves of lectures. In the end, I think whether or not this issue is considered a weakness of the course worthy of address depends on the goal of the course. I do think that interested students will take the time to explore topics of interest, regardless of the specific details in class. In the end, I think that students would get more out of a course that focuses more heavily on the conceptual aspects and inter-relatedness of topics, alongside declassified specific examples. ",

            "\u00a0The lecturers need help in engaging the student with more effective body language. Merely telling the students that we should ask questions isn't enough to encourage us to do so. They ought to exude a persona best exemplified by Valentina Greco and Jun Lu. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths are that there is an appropriate amount of discussion, lecture, And homework. The weakness is that some of the discussion has 2 papers to discuss and we didnt have time to go thoroughly for all of the papers ",
            "\u00a0More feedback on take home questions. ",
            "\u00a0Having discussion sections was probably the most engaging and helpful part of the course.\r\n\r\nLectures were not especially dense and seemed to usually address topics in generalities. I found this to be less engaging. Didn't really feel that I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0More engagements ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the course mostly provides up-to-date information about genetic studies that can be directly applied to research.\r\nWeakness: discussion sessions were too different according to the professor leading the discussion. It would have been better if there were some guidelines about the sessions. ",
            "\u00a0strength: every teach in this course can give us many knowledge and information about the advanced filed. The take home questions also enhance the knowledge. \r\nweakness: nan ",
            "\u00a0Interesting course, however some of the take home questions were much harder than others. I liked that they were challenging, but one or two took so much time to figure out what we were even being asked to begin with. ",
            "\u00a0This course was well organized and information was always available for students to succeed. However, I felt many of the lectures focused on developmental biology topics that may have not been familiar to all students initially. ",
            "\u00a0Prompter grading of the homework would be helpful. This would allow feedback from earlier homework to be applied to later assignments. I also would have liked more lab techniques to be covered in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the regular discussion sections, I felt they were very valuable. \r\n\r\nI thought sometimes the lectures started from too basic of a place -- not every single lecturer needs to recap mendel! ",
            "\u00a0I felt that many of the lectures were redundant and based on genetic screens or whole genome analyses and I think that the methods addressed and even papers chosen could have been more diverse. Also, I would have liked to learn more about applying classical genetics to modern problems. Some of the lecturers, and especially the course director, were very engaged and I appreciated that. ",
            "\u00a0I would say a strength was thinking outside the box to answer questions. A weakness would be to think of ideas and elaborate on topics that I am not familiar with. "
