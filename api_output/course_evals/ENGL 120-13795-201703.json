            "\u00a0-How to write concise, powerful sentences. \r\n-How to incorporate descriptions into an anecdote to make it more engaging and personal. ",
            "\u00a0Through really diving into the technicalities of my writing, I gained an eye for the very nuanced details of an essay that I didn't have before. It also taught me a thing or two about humility; I'd been pretty confident in my writing going into the course, but Mark taught me that I have a long way to go. Before taking this class, I treated writing as a auxiliary skill to other disciplines, but I realized the power it can have and the entire world of possibilities when it comes to writing a personal essay/op-ed. English 120 also helped me to explore my own feelings through writing, and I've since started to pull together my thoughts by writing them down. I journal now, and that's not something I would've necessarily expected. ",
            "\u00a0I think I learned a lot about what makes good writing, particularly creative, descriptive, colorful writing. This is something that I can sense now when I write, and I think it has also made me a better and more appreciative reader. ",
            "\u00a0I   learned how to give information about my topic through description, \"showing instead of telling.\" I  learned more about grammar, how to insert proper pauses and the importance of not using clichs. I   got some insight about how to write about controversial opinions, the power of conceding, and the necessity of saying things that not everyone wants to say or hear. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced analyzing my own experiences and perspectives and how they can apply and add to real world issues. I also developed stronger argumentation in both logic and appeal to emotion. I learned more effective writing. ",
            "\u00a0Worked on how to formulate well-crafted and interesting personal essays. Also did some critiquing of others' work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more simply and concisely rather than using every big word I know. I also developed the courage to write about things that are more personal, intense, and unresolved. I also learned that writing should be difficult! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write and how to analyze writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to craft creative non-fiction essays. I also learned to write for an audience, and to critically analyze others' writing. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the various techniques used to improve my writing from reading and discussing the essays by writers including Joan Didion, Tim Kreider, and George Orwell. I definitely learned about ways to improve my personal essays, especially in how to keep the reader interested, and showing how I feel about a particular subject by how much details I include. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course gives a broad overview of different kinds of essays. If you're unfamiliar with the genre, it can be a great way to get footing into the style. \r\n\r\nWeakness: This course fails to be either a truly journalistic course of a true literary course. Rather it is somewhere in between, and thus not suited for individuals who see themselves pursing courses (or careers) in one of the above categories. Further, this class can be a little too introductory for people who already have background in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the course. The essays we read were really helpful, and class discussions always left me thinking about how could I improve my writing. \r\nHanding in a paper every week forced me to continue practicing my writing and to be constantly thinking about how could I make a story more interesting. \r\nSometimes I felt I didnt know exactly what to change about my essay to make it perfect. Even after making the changes suggested in the first draft, I felt it wasnt enough. But overall, I enjoyed the editing process. ",
            "\u00a0This course doesn't have many weaknesses. I think I might have preferred to write a few more essays than we did (6 didn't feel like a whole lot to me; I wish I had a bigger portfolio of work to look back upon), but I understand that the English department has been through a lot of trial and error with 120 and that it's probably optimal for most at the workload that it is. In terms of readings, I wanted to see a bit more topical continuity, perhaps through exploration of an entire collection of essays by a single author, but I did thoroughly enjoy what we were assigned. Mark's accessibility and willingness to help you workshop an essay seemed unique to me, though I can't say I have much experience with other professors. Class discussions were always intellectually engaging, and they sometimes devolved into interesting tangents, like the human abilities to think and feel and how much language facilitates and affects them. I loved this part of the class, even if it wasn't necessarily on topic. Mark was an amazing moderator; he always knew how to keep the conversation going if it started to peter out. His insights on how writing works were so so helpful, and I'd 100% take another class of his in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Overall a strong course. I mainly just liked that we wrote a lot, which is by far the best thing for improving writing. I also liked that Mark always let us write about whatever we wanted in the way that we wanted, while also exposing us to many different writing styles through the readings. I thought that was a very effective combination for helping us develop a voice. Though it is possible that we would have benefited from his pushing us to work on writing in styles we weren't comfortable with. Also, I really, really, really loved what we did on the last day of class (going around sharing our favorite excerpts from our own writing and the readings). Made me want to start the course over again.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I thought his comments on our drafts and final papers tended to be pretty sparse, and I couldn't always be sure that him liking something, or not disliking something in a draft, would mean that he'd like it, or not dislike, on the final. I also thought that class discussions were a bit weak. At the beginning of the year I really liked when we'd pick apart our readings and talked about how they worked, and I think it helped my writing a lot. But towards the end of the year we did that a lot less, and it sometimes felt like we didn't have anything to talk about in class.\r\n\r\nLastly, one suggestion, which I meant to mention to Mark but did not get around to, is that I think it could be cool if the day we turned in final drafts we'd go around and do a quick share of something that turned out well in the paper and something that didn't, and how they think they'd address a similar difficulty in the future. On the last day of class, when we shared our favorite excerpts, I found myself wishing that I had known more about my classmates' writing. ",
            "\u00a0The class does a great job at discussing examples of different styles of writing and the balance between letting the student get their own take on the writing and including concrete examples of what writing should look like works well. I   think there should be more time made for peer reviews and more teacher-student collaboration on pieces. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths include its near-universality, as in almost any student can learn something useful in the course. It parallels with the value of a liberal arts education at Yale, since it teaches us how to reflect on our own experiences. It could be improved with more opportunities to workshop pieces. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were super engaging and fundoing them didn't feel like work. I also loved the style of writing we did, and thought the prompts allowed for lots of liberty of personal expression. Depending on how quickly you write, some people might find the frequency of the essays (6 per semester) to be challenging, but I thought it was very much manageable. ",
            "\u00a0I love the breadth of writing styles that we encounter in this course. I think the texts are really well-selected and while each class is essentially the same in format, Mark is really good about maintaining control over the discussion but also allowing it to flow. Its also great to have the rhythm of first draft, then final draft, because it allows you to work on your writing process. The workshop days were also awesome. I would say maybe having more one-on-one editing, maybe with a partner, would be cool! There were some times when class felt a bit one-note. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting I was excited to go to class each day. I think having an essay due every single week was a little stressful and that every other week could be better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-the course pushed me to become a more critical reader (analyzing articles from reputable sources e.g. NYT, New Yorker, as opposed to merely accepting what they say)\r\n-exposure to a variety of nonfiction authors \r\n\r\nWeakenesses: \r\n-instead of going through peer review only once, more peer review would help ",
            "\u00a0Mark is great ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was that it involved both reading about and writing our own personal essays as a way to improve our skills. There was also a lot of feedback received from the professor and my classmates, which helped provide a different point of view that I used to work on my draft. I would, however, have preferred it if I got even more feedback/advice on ways to improve my writings. "

            "\u00a0It depends on the student and their interests/background. Know thyself before ye consider taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I used to think writing courses were not for me because Im not interested in writing fiction, but this course showed me how creative, complex, and fulfilling can non-fiction writing be. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's a great basic way to explore your writing and teaches one a lot about their ability to frame an idea and communicate it. I find myself much more capable of making a cohesive argument on and off the page after taking 120. It may depend on the instructor, but Mark Oppenheimer makes the class super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It definitely improved my writing a lot and helped me appreciate good writing in a much deeper way. It gives you a much better sense of what makes a beautiful sentence/paragraph/essay, which makes reading a lot more fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I   would recommend this course. English 120 can help a student learn about improving writing as a whole, not just creative nonfiction. When writing argumentative essays this semester, I  used techniques from English 120 to make my writing clearer and my argument stronger. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student. No matter what major that student plans on studying for, this course teaches students effective writing and communication skills. It also develops an appreciation for writing and public discourse. ",
            "\u00a0If you like writing, absolutely take it! You are given a lot of freedom to do what you want with the essays. It's a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I think that this is the most applicable type of writing for any student, because youll be able to express yourself and your experiences in an elegant, concise way with your own voice. And you can't get much better than Mark as your teacher! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would i was genuinely enthused to attend class each day and I felt like I learned a lot along the way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's the first English course I've taken but it has been an enriching experience. I've learned to write creatively and effectively, and the assigned articles were fun to read. ",
            "\u00a0yes! took it as a senior math major and loved it ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The class is very engaging and Professor Oppenheimer is a fantastic instructor. I think I've become more aware of how I write when I'm writing and of what strategies I could use to fulfill the purpose of the piece. This is a great class to take for those who want to improve writing overall (it doesn't focus on writing argumentative or the typical academic-styled essays). "
