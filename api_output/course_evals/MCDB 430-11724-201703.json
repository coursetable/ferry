            "\u00a0A broad overview of immunology. I feel like this course gave me a solid grounding for future study, and helped tie together some concepts given in the intro bio sequences. ",
            "\u00a0Broad overview of immunology with an emphasis on adaptive immunity. There are many molecular and pathway details that are taught during lecture, which are good but accumulate over the course of the semester. The topics of the second half are very interesting and deeply applicable to human health and disease. ",
            "\u00a0I began this course with a rudimentary understanding of the immune system and left with a strong foundation and a desire to learn more about the field. Could not ask for any more from a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to think about the immune system as integrated with many aspects of our health. I also gained an appreciation for the development of immunology as a science given the fluidity of definitions and terms. It was interesting to gain knowledge about the importance of the immune system in cancer and the many new implications of this field. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you a very broad and selectively in-depth idea of what the immune system is. Many topics were covered and key details were taught, discussed and analysed in the course. Its as quintessential a biology course could get and I felt like as a biological sciences major, I truly enjoyed the comfort this course gave me. Expect memorisation and expect to get familiar with many genes, enzymes and biological pathways with molecules involved. ",
            "\u00a0I did not know anything about the immune system before taking this course, and I feel like this is a great and thorough introductory course. By learning from multiple faculty members, I was able to gain different perspectives on the field of immunology while still learning core knowledge and also learning about what we still do not know in this field, which was very insightful.

            "\u00a0The biggest weakness is probably also one of the strengths -- every professor only teaches, at most, 3-4 lectures. This gives the class a disjoint feeling, but I really enjoyed getting to see a bunch of great immunologists throughout the semester. It can be hard for undergrads who haven't taken a class like this before. Also, the exams are somewhat tricky -- you need to remember some small details that weren't necessarily stressed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This is a standard upper-level biology course, but make no mistake, it is a graduate course. It allows undergraduates to enroll. The material and lecturers are geared toward the first year immunobiology (and associated BBS programs) students. This does not preclude undergraduates from taking it in any way, but do expect that much of the content and structure of the course will not be like that of other Yale College courses. It is, after all, intended to give a broad overview of the field from the PIs in the department the graduate students will be rotating in. It is a very good snapshot of immunobiology for a single semester and is purported to be for those with no background as well, but it is obviously a much smoother experience with advanced preparation. There are about 10 lecturers who each give talks in their respective fields so if you are not familiar with graduate coursework, do not expect continuity. It is more akin to a series of basic introductory seminars stitched together; it's up to you to make light of the entire story. The TFs are the only ones who really ground you and keep you connected to the big picture, so your success can really depend in part on their commitment to you. As is standard, 70% of your grade is comprised of two exams, so it is integral to your success that you do not fall behind on the material since much of the tested content is highly specialized and specific. Undergraduates are of course graded separately from the graduate students, so that's some relief. Since this is a cross-listed course, I believe that it would benefit the course director and the TFs to understand how undergraduate courses are structured and make an attempt to cater more so to the undergrads as the lowest common denominator. For instance, Yale College policy requires that 30 minutes be added to any final exam for review, which was not observed for this courseexemplifying some lack of understanding of where undergraduates taking the course stand. While it may be more important for graduate students to understand the minutiae of every field, this is very niche information that might come off as no more than pure memorization and luck. As with many courses, it would be much more fair and beneficial to integrate more latitude into the exams so that for example, there is a choice of questions to be answered and/or there are more points available than are graded. Overall, this is a very strong introduction to the field, but the emphasis on graduate education may be a disservice to the undergraduates, which should be addressed through more help and more uniformity. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the professor's go way too in depth in their respective class sessions. This makes it very difficult for students to decide what to study and what not to when preparing for examinations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this class would be way more effective if every 4-5 lectures, the main professor came in and reviewed material we had learned. There is A LOT of material, and because this is a Monday-Wednesday-Friday class, it comes very fast. \r\n\r\nLastly, studying for exams (especially the final) is ridiculous in this class. With the amount of content covered in all of the lectures, you get the feeling that you could study for weeks and still not memorize everything you need to. ",
            "\u00a0The format of the coursework (homework assignments, one midterm, and one final) is not very conducive to learning. While the small number of assessments may make the workload smaller, the small number of assignments makes it more difficult to assess what the important topics and takeaways are from each lecture/week. It would actually be better if there were more assignments/problem sets regularly, so that students review the material often and practice/learn the concepts that are important (as emphasized by problems). ",
            "\u00a0Great course overall, relationship between different lecturers could be worked on perhaps. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the unique teaching format as each specialized topic was taught by a different professor. The TFs were very helpful and accessible, making the course material much more easy to digest. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro course to immunology. Enjoyed what each lecturer brought to the course, and appreciated their insights. Perhaps the course could benefit from a lecture tying everything together so that students can gain a holistic understanding of all the moving parts of the immune system. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the immense amount of information that are shared in a short time that leave you with a good understanding of the immune system and the importance of the field. However there is less time to engage with the field as there are only three p-sets and a lot of material in the middle is only delivered in lectures and it is hard to go into depth. This makes sense because it is an overview course however perhaps the weekly discussion sections should incorporate exercises along with papers and revision. There should be an exercise which forces you to think about the implications of what you have learnt. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course needed less lectures and more chances for review. I felt that the pacing was too fast and the lectures towards the end could have been replaced woth a deeper understanding of the basic immunological principles in the first half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength would be that there are many professors who lecture, each in a different style and each one of them being experts in their lecture topics. Students who are really keen in making use of this specialised teaching technique would really enjoy the course. On top of that, this course ensures you are always on your toes because of the various take home assignments and also a midterm which tests you on the content taught up until the break. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TFs this semester were great. As an undergraduate student (junior), I thought that I would be overwhelmed by the material and the amount of graduate students in the course (although later I found that we were evaluated separately, which I was thankful for). There was a lot of material, but I found that given the time put into it, I was able to understand the main points from each lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: At first, it was a bit disorientating to have a different faculty member every lecture or so. This made me feel like the material was discontinuous and I often had trouble connecting one idea/topic to the next. However, by the end of the course, this was not so much of a problem and I enjoyed learning from different lecturers. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who is interested in immunology (doubly so if you want to do research in an immunology lab at Yale!). It's a tough course, but that's because immunology is a hard subject. It combines many different disciplines of biology into one big mesh of interactions. Every professor is great in their own way, and it's not often you get the chance to take a class like this at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The content is very interesting, just be prepared to wade through an overwhelming amount of material presented in a somewhat fractured manner by multiple different instructors. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - this class provides incredible breadth and depth on a myriad of developing topics in immunology. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the material is fascinating. However, if you are inexperienced in immunology, be wary. There is a ton of info and it comes fast. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course is extremely interesting and highly relevant to human health and disease. That being said, many of the lectures are detail heavy in terms of molecular players and pathways. These are useful to know, but do accumulate over the course of the semester, especially given that the class meets three times a week. The format of the assessments, however, are not very conducive to learning -- there are three take-home assignments (basically homeworks), 1 midterm, and 1 final -- that's all. So the workload is not high, but in the end the coursework format does not encourage regular review of the material, and the small number of homeworks makes it so that it is difficult to tell exactly which topics and concepts are important (and which ones will come up on the midterm and final). In the end, much of the molecular details and complicated pathways do not show up on the exams. Regardless, the instructors are experts in their fields and are excellent teachers. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, great class! Stay on top of the work by reviewing throughout the semester and you will be fine. It's a lot of material so that's really the key to learning in this class. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic survey course for Immunology. The teaching format was unique as each topic was taught by a different professor who specialized in that field. The course had a great balance of emerging topics as well as basic concepts that I would recommend to any student interested in graduate studies relating to Immunology. ",
            "\u00a0Great if you are interested in applying basic biology and biochemistry to an advanced context. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn what the big deal surrounding immunotherapy is or if you want to understand autoimmunity/immune deficiencies, it is important that you go behind the scenes and understand how the immune system works. This course is taught by specialists who teach you how to appreciate immunology and also teach you how to comprehend the complex challenges facing this field. ",
            "\u00a0The class has interesting material but the chnace to apply the concepts learned is scarce before exams making ir hard to absorb material. ",
