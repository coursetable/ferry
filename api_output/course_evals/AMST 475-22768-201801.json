            "\u00a0I read a lot of American Literature I hadn't previously read, and learned about storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the process of adapting work. The small seminar size also gave me the opportunity to be more active in discussion, which helped me solidify or challenge ideas I had about the readings. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting course focusing primarily on the intersection of race and war within American literature. You'll learn a lot about the historical contexts for the novels/poems, and you will also get to read lots of cool books and discuss. There is also a creative component--the final project--at the end of the semester, where you can present something literary in any way you like! "

            "\u00a0Sometimes the class dragged on for a bit. Some of the texts it felt like we were overanalyzing. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this class is that the \"Performing\" aspect doesn't really come in all that much until the end. Up until then it's mostly just an American Literature seminar, but that is not exactly a weakness. The strengths? It's taught by Wai Chee Dimock one of the best professors at Yale. There were a total of six students in it, which made it a very intimate seminar. And the syllabus was dope. It doesn't really get much better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great literature on the syllabus and a nice continuation of themes for discussion\r\nWeaknesses: no real structure for final project, poor class discussion, classes tended to run late. "

            "\u00a0If you're interested in literature or storytelling, this is a great class. I took it as a film major and got a lot out of it. It can be a lot of reading though, and the two-hour seminar can drag on a bit. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THE CLASS. Don't hesitate. If you haven't had the pleasure of studying with Professor Dimock yet, run don't walk to literally any of her classes. If this one doesn't fit your schedule, check out a different WCD class. You won't regret it. The workload isn't terrible (a book/week + assignments), and all of the work feels important and worthwhile. Our class had six people in it, so we could get through a ton of topics in a single class. She gives you so much freedom in choosing your project and so much feedback as you work on it. What an incredible luxury to have one of Yale's resident phenoms go over your work with a fine tooth comb!  TAKE. THE. CLASS. "
