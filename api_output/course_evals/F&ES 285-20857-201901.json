            "\u00a0Foundations of political ecology and how it can be applied to on-the-ground projects like ELTI's work; and that political ecologists define themselves in relation to apolitical ecologists ",
            "\u00a0Understanding what political ecology is, the foundational concepts that underpin it, and several case studies that highlight a political ecology approach.  You learn to identify and use the right language to describe the systems and power dynamics behind socio-environmental issues. It teaches you a new way to think. Science, society, and knowledge itself all take on a different meaning after this class- I now have a critical eye towards everything about the environment that I once took for granted, including the tragedy of the commons, the dangers of population growth, and the value of national parks. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the political complexities surrounding environmental issues and how to think about environmental realities with a new perspective ",
            "\u00a0I had no idea what political ecology was when I walked into class back in January, and even now, I am still very much changing and evolving in how I think about the field and all of its applications. But I know for a fact that this class has transformed the way I think about so many systems, models, career paths, organizations, etc. I have learned a ton about restoration, community engagement, fieldwork, and not only the importance of but the NEED for social science perspectives in everything we do in the environmental field. Lots of critical thinking, analysis, going out of your comfort zone, challenging mainstream ideas and the \"norm,\" and being open to new ideas and ways of thinking/researching/interpreting. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of skills, you really get the chance to practice your reading and writing skills. You read some pretty dense and complicated texts, and while they were all very interesting, they were also difficult. You learn how to break them down and engage with them critically. The professors also did an excellent job of actually touching upon and discussing all the reading assigned, so you always have the chance to expand and check your understanding of the texts. The weekly writing responses make it so you also practice writing a lot. They could be tedious, but I think they help grow you as a writer, especially because you receive feedback for them, and they help ensure you stay on top of your readings. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The applied nature of the class (e.g. linking to ELTI's work, the work of practitioners in the field (in the final project), the field trip), the assignments were well-designed (e.g. reading responses, final paper, class presentation) and well-balanced\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough feedback on the class presentations - at the end of the class it still wasn't a given that we'd understand what is desired from the presentation or what we can expect to learn from the presentations. \r\n\r\nImprovement: More feedback available for the class presentations (but good and prompt feedback for the reading responses!!) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class will teach you how power and control of people manifests in environmental/development issues across the world, which is extremely relevant to people in those fields (think EVST, global studies, pol science, people who want to go into development/non-profit work etc). The field trip to Panama over spring break was a brilliant way of seeing how the concepts you learn in class manifest in the real world - you can't miss it! Plus, having the class half grads made the discussion very fruitful and meaningful - grad students have a lot of experience they can bring to the class. Final projects are self-directed and you can do whatever you want if you choose, or follow one of the prompts. Workload is very manageable in my opinion. Finally, Prof Garen and Prof Doolittle are AMAZING professors and I loved being in class with them. They are knowledgeable, full of experience, engaging, funny and enjoyable to be around. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Couldn't really find any. The only thing I would say to bear in mind is that there are weekly reading response essays to ensure that everyone engages deeply with the material before class; however, this also makes section really enjoyable because it ensures that everyone participates significantly in class and has time/room to digest and learn the material. Also, it honestly is not difficult to keep up with the papers as long as you are disciplined with your time and start the assignments before the day they are due (usually Sunday). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nIncredible subject material (really transformative), wonderful field trip, amazing professors, good mix between FES students and undergrads, good amount of readings and the reading responses push you to really understand them, lots of flexibility with figuring out ways to learn that work for you, accessible professors and teaching fellows.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI think we all left class each day feeling like we could spend another 4 hours dissecting the material.  I'm not sure if this would be possible, but having an extra \"section\" at night with the TF or an extra class meeting during the week would be really helpful to 1) process the readings and 2) delve into our own thoughts, reading responses, applications of the readings, etc. "

            "\u00a0Yes but more highly recommend for an introductory exposure to political ecology/social science in environmental studies! Different people in the class had different levels of expectation/backgrounds so it'd be difficult to challenge everyone the same. ",
            "\u00a0Political Ecology has been one of my favorite classes so far at Yale. I highly recommend it especially to EVST majors, anyone interested in the environment/development/working with large international organizations, or people who want to see how ER&M concepts intersect with the environment. I've taken ER&M classes before, and this class really gave me amazing insight into the way those concepts apply to my field of study; but even if you haven't taken ER&M before, this class will teach you how power and control of people manifests in environmental/development issues across the world. Furthermore, the field trip to Panama over spring break was a brilliant way of seeing how the concepts you learn in class manifest in the real world - you can't miss it! Plus, having the class half grads made the discussion very fruitful and meaningful (but I'd still recommend shopping the class to see if you like your classmates/the vibe). Bear in mind that there are weekly reading response essays to ensure that everyone engages deeply with the material before class; however, this also makes section really enjoyable because it ensures that everyone participates significantly in class and has time/room to digest and learn the material.

Finally, Prof Garen and Prof Doolittle are AMAZING professors and I loved being in class with them. They are funny, full of experience, engaging and enjoyable to be around. Highly recommended class! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you care approaching environmental issues with a complete understanding of what is going on and how it has come to be ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to all environmental studies majors. It will change the way you think and approach environmental issues. It is a very intellectually-demanding class, but the workload is not too bad. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Political ecology is an incredibly important field to wrap your head around, regardless of what you major in--it incorporates so many aspects of social justice, environmental justice, etc. and really changes the way you think about all of the systems around you. It's a tough class, but you have wonderful professors and so much support provided throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class really makes you think and question. It's a wonderful initial exploration into environmental theory, and both professors do a great job of helping guide you along and creating an environment where you can explore the academic questions at hand, as well as think about how you want to use that knowledge.
