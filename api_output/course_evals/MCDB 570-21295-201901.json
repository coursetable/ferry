            "\u00a0It was interesting to learn the applications and industry aspect and compare in to the world of academia. ",
            "\u00a0A general overview of multiple aspects of modern biotechnology: small molecule, natural product, cell and gene therapy, genetic editing, nucleic acid biotech and plant biotech. Also real-life application and patent, venture capital and entrepreneur. ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of my top favorite class at Yale in that the class is beyond its title of biotechnology. I didn't expect I would learn the materials I learned in this class before I registered in the class.  The class focuses on application based on biology and engineering and the instructors and guest speakers are themselves working in a business or a research form on the topics that they are teaching. That makes these class more interesting because I always want to learn how to apply the skills and having these amazing instructors and guest speakers make it easy for me to learn basic skills of translate technologies into the real world. I'm grateful on taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the most valuable knowledge I learned was from the nucleic acids lectures. I think that will stick with me. "

            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that the class starts with the basic foundations on a topic then gets into the application side of biology and engineering. I think this type of teaching is very successful because everything just makes sense and answers the question of why we learned what we learned in class. And I think teaching on the application is the driving force to learn a topic because I would have an idea why I learn a topic. \r\nGenerally, strengths include: well organized, good student participation in class, very effectively discussion section that is established to reinforce what we learned in class and the professors and guest speakers are experts on the topics. \r\n\r\nSuggestions\r\n-I think I haven't really seen a class like this organized and engaging to learn and so I would hope this type of class to be a model for other classes to discuss on applications so that students will have more insight the world around them and potentially start their own business and become an entrepreneur. ",
            "\u00a0The course is not organized very well and the topics could be better. I think we spent too much time on pharmacology stuff which is only one aspect of biotechnology. There were way too many lectures on Alzheimer's. I think it would make more sense to move the foundational materials like nucleic acids and gene editing to the beginning of the semester so other topics can be built off of them. "
