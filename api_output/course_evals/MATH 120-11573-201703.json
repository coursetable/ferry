            "\u00a0Not much ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the varying types of derivatives and integrals that exist. I had to learn how to calculate integrals of functions and vector fields in 2D and 3D over other surfaces. I had to acquire a better scope of the relationship between functions and vector fields in 3D. I also learned how to utilize vectors a lot more and how to calculate extreme values of functions with a constraining function. ",
            "\u00a0The course is relatively quick paced, especially for first years who are accustom to year long courses in high school.  That said, it was definitely structured very well, and students can learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Significantly improved my computational skills. This class requires a lot of them, and by the end you'll be able to carry out complicated integrals mentally in one or two steps.\r\n\r\nAlso improved my comfort with geometry and thinking in 3D space, which are very valuable skills.\r\n\r\nA lot of the material is only relevant if one intends to move into physics, engineering or the like, so the content is not useful for most people, but the skills that one learns by way of grappling with the concepts are not to be sneezed at. ",
            "\u00a0Developed a theoretical understanding of vector and multivariable calculus. Understood proof-based foundations of calculus theorems. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily, I learned how to convert between geometric shapes and numbers, and vice versa, in addition to how to integrate functions and vector fields over those shapes. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of multivariable calculus. Various theorems (Greens', Stokes,' Divergence). Three-dimensional stuff. Line integrals, surface integrals. Plane configurations. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my multivariable calculus ability. I learned to use a variety of tools in order to evaluate line and surface integrals of functions and vector fields. Stokes' Theorem and the Divergence Theorem were particularly interesting and applied to my physics class as well. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive understanding of integrals, from line integrals to surface integrals to triple integrals, and how the three relate to each other within two- and three-dimensional space. I learned the skills of looking at a particular situation and analyzing the best way of solving it (with regards to integrals), using the tools I'd developed over the course in evaluating and connecting such integrals. I learned the real-world meanings and applications of these math processes. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how how to evaluate double and triple integrals through Green's, Stokes', and the Divergence Thereom and about vectors. ",
            "\u00a0Better understanding of functions and graphs of several variables and in 3-dimensions, and an understanding of various integrals (line, surface, solid) across vector fields and functions as well as the relations between them. ",
            "\u00a0Id never taken multi variable calc before, so everything we learned was new to me. I also had to work harder in this class than Id ever worked - I spent a lot of time in tutoring, and I learned to not be afraid to ask for help (a lot). ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of multivariable calculus -- specifically 3D geometry, vector fields, double and triple integrals, line and surface integrals, and various theorems for evaluating such integrals. I learned how the fundamental theorem of calculus can be applied to 3D shapes, and how to visualize 3D shapes using different coordinate systems (polar, spherical) for the purposes of integration. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: The teachers are generally pretty likable and teach the material well.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The course is entirely designed to make people hate math. The way that the exams are graded leaves so little room for error and so much emphasis on raw computing and formula memorization and so little emphasis on learning math as a mindset that it ends up being incredibly unenjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it presents to you all of the information that you will need as you prepare for the homework, the midterms, and the final. Its weaknesses are that information isn't well-covered in class. It's difficult to keep up unless you are constantly asking questions. I normally didn't begin understanding several of the topics until I started to study for my exams. Also, your grade is highly dependent on these exam scores so you have to really work hard while studying. To improve this course, I think that the practice questions during class should be set up like questions from the exams and that you outline steps for students to follow when tackling these questions. ",
            "\u00a0There seems to be massive gulf between the quality of different instructors. The amount of content in the course means we must move at a very high pace, and I am not sure all the instructors are capable enough to get through all the material without losing their students along the way.\r\n\r\nI would also say the lack of application outside of physics is a minus, but some things like Lagrange Multipliers are also present in economics.\r\n\r\nThere is a LOT of help available, so you definitely shouldn't get lost if you look out for Peer Tutors, Office Hours, Practice Problems, Review Sessions etc.\r\n\r\nIt also sucked that so many students in the course had taken Multivariable calculus before, which made the curve quite a mountain to overcome for students new to the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I love the small seminar style setup of the calculus course; it allows for a much more solid foundation for understanding, and the small instructor to student ratio made the course content and class much more accessible to the student. Lots of support (office hours, peer tutors). More practice for the midterms and final (practice exams and problems) would make prep more comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Almost every topic built off of another topic in a more-or-less logical progression. I felt like I got a firm grasp on integrals of multiple variables by the end of the course.\r\nWeaknesses: I'm not really sure how I can/will apply the knowledge I gained in this course in the future (In particular, two-dimensional limits). In other words, I can trust that everything I learned was true, but I don't know how it connects to topics outside of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: I wasn't a fan of the grading system on exams. It unfairly punished students for minor calculation errors, even if they showed a solid understanding of the more important concepts, like the use of certain theorems. That isn't the right way to foster an appreciation of mathematics in someone... a few people in my class learned to dislike the subject over the course of the semester.\r\n\r\nStrengths: Multivariable calculus covers a lot of topics, and somehow the MATH 120 manages to fit it all in. It's comprehensive, and has good pacing. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it is an effective overview of multivariable claculus. I feel that I have a solid grip on the course material overall, and I think that it is very applicable to courses outside of the math department as well. I did feel that sometimes different teachers used slightly different methods or explanations in their classes, so there was some inconsistency when it came to the review sessions, but these were slight and did not negatively affect my experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include the efforts outside of lecture to accommodate students and reinforce classroom learning, including office hours and peer tutoring sessions available. Also, the homework really drilled in the new material every week. Lectures were thorough. I don't know of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the whole grade wasnt basically based upon 3 tests ",
            "\u00a0It was able to move quickly and efficiently through the course material, but I noticed how some professors didn't cover the same material as others, leading some classes to have certain advantages -- the review sessions covered any gaps in knowledge, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- I had a very good instructor who was passionate and dedicated\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Feedback was tough to find and resources were slightly hidden ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-organized and the sequence of learning made sense, but it was so fast. Im not sure if that can be improved though, since a certain amount of material has to be covered in a short time. ",
            "\u00a0The course is somewhat brutal in the sense that 90% of it is determined by 3 massive exams. To a large degree success on these exams is reliant on memorizing several formulas -- one is rarely asked to apply them to real world problems (for example, vector fields in physics). For whatever reason MATH 120 is made to be somewhat of a \"weeder\" course, vastly reducing the number of students who want to study math. I really enjoyed math in high school but MATH 120 may be the last math course that I take at Yale. A strength of this course is the professors/administrators who run it. I was told that math in college would be different from high school because professors would not be helpful and I would probably have to learn out of the textbook. I was pleasantly surprised by Fima's clear instruction, ability to explain complex topics in multiple ways, and willingness to answer clarifying questions during and after class. I greatly appreciated all of the review sessions and practice problems before each exam, and when I emailed Fima about a particular question he always responded promptly, happy to help. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of the course is that a lot of students have already taken multivariable calculus in high school, which puts the students that have not had any experience with the subject at a disadvantage. "

        [
            "\u00a0No. Any of the alternative ways to learn multivariable calculus are highly preferable. ",
            "\u00a0I think that Math 120 is a very challenging course that is doable, but it takes a lot of work. I used to love math in high school, but this class made me reconsider my joy of math. If you need to take a math course at Yale, then try to take a lower level math course. If you need to take Math 120, then you will probably be fine. The problem sets each week aren't too bad, and there's plenty of resources at your disposal to do well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course simply because multivariable calculus is helpful for every STEM major and a lot can be learned in a short amount of time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Not as bad of a class as it is made out to be - if you have a good instructor, that is. The material is not outright interesting, but may be challenging to most. ",
            "\u00a0I would! I love the creative ways to approach different problems that are presented during class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it helped me to think about geometry, numerical notation, and integrals in new ways, and unlike some other classes, I can actually identify specific things/skills that I've learned from taking the course. However, I feel like a person's experience can greatly depend on their grad student/professor, and I had a good grad student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But if you love an intellectual challenge, MATH 230 might be the better bet. MATH 120 is more about learning theorems and memorizing techniques/flowcharts. The focus is apparently more on brute calculation, and not much thought has to go behind solving most of the problems presented in this course. However, multivariable calculus is important moving forward in a great deal of majors, so take this course because the techniques you learn WILL come in handy. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I found it to be an effective course and one that applies to other areas of study, particularly physics in my case. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would totally recommend it. The material is fascinating and the skills you develop are very applicable, particularly within physics and other areas of math. The work is manageable and the resources are plentiful, and to reiterate, the material is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No, because most of the course could be self-taught if you thoroughly read through the chapters. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely! ",
            "\u00a0I would, but I would do this with caution if they havent taken multi before. I was surprised at the amount  of students taking this class as review. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students, being sure to warn them about the grading structure and significant jump from high school math. I found it to be difficult and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0120 will not make you love math, so in that sense it's not a class that I would emphatically recommend someone take, but since it is necessary for so many other classes, it is a good choice. "
