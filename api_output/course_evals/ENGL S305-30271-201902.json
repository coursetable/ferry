            "\u00a0I learned how to write an argumentative, literary paper. I better learned to analyze and narrow in on a topic. I learned how to manage my time accordingly. I developed a lot of insight into the autobiographical narrative and its history. ",
            "\u00a0Skills: Critical reading and writing.\r\nKnowledge and insights: American history from the slavery period to the present, social conventions and changes throughout the years, etc ",
            "\u00a0I developed analytical and personal writing skills. I thought critically about literature as well as social issues. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my close reading skills, and I gained a better insight of the variety of writing styles within the genre of African American autobiographies from the late nineteen century to present day. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I was able to rehearse and develop my literary analysis skills in a genre of writing that I did not engage with in previous academic settings. This course was particularly interesting because of the combination of interpretation of not only a literary landscape, but also a social context. I advanced my manipulation of writing techniques (i.e.: verb tenses, extended metaphors, noun forms) while learning how to approach the seemingly separate subject of xenophobia and systemic racism.

            "\u00a0This course is super interesting and engaging, but it moves extremely fast so you have to read fast in order to keep up and not feel lost. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Professor Mahurin and the content of the course. Professor Mahurin is wonderful and very passionate. The class discussions were very engaging and something I looked forward to. There are not really any weaknesses. The only thing I would say was that the workload might have been a bit heavy. It would have been nicer to spend more time with each text. I am very thankful I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course was awesome! I especially liked our small class size. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the assignments; they are engaging, but do not burden you too much so you can still enjoy the reading. I also liked that it was a seminar because I learned the most from peers during discussions. A weakness of the course is the pace. The syllabus was very manageable during the summer, but I think it would be difficult to engage as much with the readings during an academic year course schedule, and the books are ones that warrant time and attention. The course could be improved by incorporating more peer editing and review for our writing assignments. We would read and break down the texts in smaller groups, but I wished we could also workshop our writing with our classmates also. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course lie in its coverage of the aforementioned two fields of literary and social analysis; the academic texts span a range of not only time period and region but also varying opinions on the oppression of black people.\r\nThe only 'weakness' I would find with this course is the difficulty in articulating what concrete knowledge or skills I have gained throughout the month. For instance  \"what is the point of analyzing these texts? How does the knowledge you learned benefit society?\" are questions to which I cannot form complete answers. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, both the instructor and the material reviewed are excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I think the texts on the syllabus can benefit all Yale students' educations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class was by far the best one I have taken at Yale. I learned so much from it and always looked forward to going. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as I do believe that it has widened my perspective in thinking about the ways in which discrimination is laced into our society. With modern media focusing attention to certain (albeit undeniably important) types of discrimination, i.e.: police brutality, it is difficult to lose sight of other phenomena. ",
