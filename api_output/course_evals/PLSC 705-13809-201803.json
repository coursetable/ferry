            "\u00a0This course provided broad and deep instruction of key concepts in political economy. The problem sets were a fun challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated more political science applications, as well as concrete examples of how we could used the models we were learning about to build our own (even very simple) models. I know the micro foundations are necessary, but more time on how to use those tools to build political science models would have been appreciated - and would have been a good incentive to engage with the maths parts. We got a deep introduction to some political science models (voting competition, distributive justice), but I would have enjoyed a broader introduction to the possibilities of formal models.  \r\n\r\nClasses spent going through existing textbooks or notes were very hard to follow (it was much easier when the Professor was working on the white board).  As an example, the class on Nash Bargaining was the best one we had, it was clear and well-structured. Other classes (the marriage example) were much harder to follow. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were great at making us apply class concepts. And tests followed well (with some tweaks) from problem sets. The class was quite strong overall, though class was sometimes confusing, so the TA sessions were necessary to understand the concepts. "
