            "\u00a0I develop plenty of fundamental music theory and notation skills and completed several compositions what were something I did not expected to have. ",

            "\u00a0I learnt basic concepts in music. The most helpful thing I took out of this class was about composing songs and identifying chords in songs. ",

            "\u00a0I think the amount of information in the course was balanced well with the time we had this semester (with the small caveat that I felt like there wasnt enough new content coming at me at times). One large problem is the lack of standardization across the different sections of this class, from content covered, to genres observed. From hearing my other friends experiences in their respective sections, I felt both grateful and robbed. ",
