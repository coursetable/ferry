I particularly appreciated his attempts to make some of the more abstracts concepts and theories more grounded by asking questions more related to our daily experiences. Anne Marie's in-class input was was also useful for providing alternative perspectives. \r\n\r\nIn the future, if the class size remains reasonably small, it might be good to make other students' reading responses part of the assigned readings. I find that some of our richest discussions came through such dialogue. "
