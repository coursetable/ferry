            "\u00a0I learned about techniques used in bio research and got practice with preparing a presentation based on scientific literature. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to conduct immunohistochemistry and Western blot experiments. I also learned how to stain samples with H&E and other chemicals to analyze different structures under a microscope. I built upon knowledge from the lecture course and applied it in the lab setting. This course was especially useful in visualizing the various cells and structures of different parts of the male and female reproductive systems, including the ovaries, testes, vagina, and uterus, that were also discussed in the lecture class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about working in a biology lab. I improved pipette technique, and learned how to perform a western blot and how to do immunohistochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned very little about reproductive biology. This lab is not especially educational, at least not taken as a standalone course--I cannot speak for when they are combined, since I did not take the accompanying lecture course. The problem sets did map onto the mini-lectures given during lab, but I did not feel like the substance of the problem sets built from one to the next. By a given week, I would have forgotten what I learned the previous week. In one instance a piece of information that was presented as tiny/marginal would be the thing you needed to answer an entire problem (which, if you got wrong, could drop your grade on the Pset by a letter grade). If there were mini-quizzes (even tiny ones, 2-3 throughout the semester), I think we would have felt more responsible for the course information and not forgotten information week to week. \r\n\r\nImprovements could be made if the lectures were a bit slower and better organized. The professors would often speak more quickly than notes could actually be taken on something, so there was no easy way to take meaningful notes, and I would just look at the slides when working on Psets rather than look at my own notes. \r\n\r\nWould not recommend this lab to someone unless they are looking for a class with low workload.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Most of the work and learning occurs while in class, which is nice. The lab homeworks helped to reinforce the ideas we talked about, but were not unnecessarily long.\r\nWeaknesses: There is a lot of down time during the labs. Additionally, some of the homework questions that had us restate the procedures done were not as useful for learning purposes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I felt like this was a great companion to the lecture because it gave me visuals to associate with the powerpoints from class. I found the professors helpful and willing to take the time to explain why we got our results in experiments. I liked the final project for the class as well. There also wasn't a lot of work to be done outside of lab, just a homework assignment at the end of each experiment (so usually every 2 weeks), and while they weren't long or particularly challenging, I felt like these assignments are amongst the few lab assignments that actually taught me something.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes there's a lot of waiting around if we're incubating with antibodies, which can get quite boring if you didn't bring other work to do with you ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very reasonable lab sessions and homework expectations. Interesting experiments with protocols that can be applicable in a variety of settings. Two instructors who are exceptionally knowledgeable and dedicated to the course. A fun, collaborative, laid-back lab atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there was considerable down-time during the labs that potentially could be used to go through scientific papers in more detail or invite guest speakers to complement what we're learning in the class.

            "\u00a0There could be more help provided with the HW but otherwise the course was great, well taught, had a good structure ",
            "\u00a0I wish the homework assignments were worth more points. 1 point off could drop you down to a B. And there weren't that many assignments to begin with. Other than that, I enjoyed the structure of the class and think it worked well. The lectures while we were waiting for our experiments to run were a great idea, and he presentations at the end were fun. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the course, and was especially glad that we had the presentations added to the curriculum. I think the course has more value for students if they have taken, or are concurrently taking, the lecture course. I took the course, and felt more able to understand the mechanisms we discussed than peers who had no experience with the lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This is an easy lab, but it's also an informative one. I felt like I got a lot out of it, especially while taking the lecture at the same time. It's nice to be able to see the applications of what you're learning in lecture in a lab setting. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is an awesome lab--the best lab course I've taken at Yale by far--with very reasonable homework assignments that I actually found enjoyable to complete. The lab protocols (IHC and Western blot, some staining techniques) are standard procedures used in a variety of fields, so it's useful to practice these procedures in a classroom setting. If you enjoy the subject matter (as I do), the class is a great way to get experience in a potential future field of work. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly those with a lab requirement, or those who want to develop stronger lab techniques. This was a great course, and the first lab at Yale I have really enjoyed! The material is fascinating and the labs are as well. ",
            "\u00a0If you want a low workload course in which you do not learn very much (except perhaps if you take it in coordination with the lecture course, IDK), I would recommend it. If you want to learn a lot I would not take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Great option for a bio lab. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course. It complements the lecture very well, and Drs. Guller and Whirledge are awesome (both as teachers and people in general)! "
