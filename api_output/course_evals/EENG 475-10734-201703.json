            "\u00a0Sometimes the lectures were a little hard to follow and missing one key step could confuse you for the entire lecture. However, for the lectures that I could follow they were definitely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were a bit disorganized, although the lecture notes helped make sense of it all. We tried to cover a lot of mathematical concepts a bit too quickly... especially the neural networks and PCA - if we're going to spend time on it, we need a slower, more thorough explanation/derivation to make sense of it all.\r\nThe material is riveting, the problem sets are good - they walk you through concepts well ",
            "\u00a0This course really made me develop an interest in computational vision, and it is well paced with well designed homeworks to aid in the understanding of concepts. Could be improved in that Course content could be better matched with the notes provided in class, as well as a more structure planning of concept delivery in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0strength: there were lecture notes online\r\nweakness: the lecture notes were often incomplete with several errors ",
            "\u00a0I think the subject matter is really interesting and deserves to be taught better than it was. The lectures were not very engaging and though I went to almost all of them I never saw more than about 60% of the class there, which was understandable: the professor went very fast through a lot of math (that we didn't need to know for our psets or exams) and it was hard to follow or focus on.\r\n\r\nAlso, there was little structure in place to help us understand the material-- we were given \"lecture notes\" which were not more than sections of the professor's unfinished textbook, which had sections missing and was very confusingly worded. Also, thought our TA seemed well-meaning, his English was very poor and he would sometimes refuse to explain things to us in office hours or review sessions because he lacked the words to do so. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting coursework, engaging professor, great TA. The homeworks truly taught you the material in a way few classes have succeeded to do so for me.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures themselves were hard to follow, I wouldve failed the tests if not for the office hour study sessions before. Luciano was great, so Im sure if id Gone to office hours every week the course wouldve been easy. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course is that it does not meet everyday. In all seriousness, Zucker is great and really cares about the material and his students. I really appreciated his effort in making the course great. ",
            "\u00a0The material is interesting but the text is a bit confusing occasionally and lecture moves through the material quite quickly. I wish this class had sections that met - it would be helpful for students with backgrounds that are not very strong in this field. The TF was great but he was really the only consistent support but he was stretched a bit thin ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\nGood coverage of the theoretical aspects of CV. Passionate lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nLittle coverage of the more \"modern\" tools used in CV ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are hard to follow, the problems sets hard to understand, and overall the course is poorly structured. ",
            "\u00a0Pretty fascinating lectures and for the most part interesting problems on the homeworks. However, it was often unclear what we had to know for the exams (lecture notes were helpful, but much more thorough that the lectures). ",

            "\u00a0The lectures move very quickly from concrete ideas to abstract math. A clearer transition would help with understanding the relationship of the concepts and math. Section could also help with this. ",

            "\u00a0An interesting course that takes a very interesting approach to computer vision. Although the lectures can be hard to follow at times, the problem sets and office hours really help to clear up the fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you're interested in beautiful mathematical concepts and their applications in the interesting field of computer vision. And if you're willing to put up with slightly disorganized lectures ",
            "\u00a0This is, hands down, one of the most incredible classes I have taken during my time at Yale (and I say this as a senior).  TL;DR - TAKE THIS CLASS\r\n\r\nIf you're taking this because you're a CS major who needs a science credit, it is not the easiest class you could choose. However, Professor Zucker is brilliant and all the biology he talks about that may not make sense at first ties in brilliantly with CS concepts that you'll learn about.\r\nThe class moves fast. Professor Zucker is often 20 steps ahead, and it sometimes feels like he expects the rest of the class to be like that. I am not the most brilliant at math, and while you don't need to do all the calculations he talks about, they help with understanding the concepts very well.\r\nThe way the course is structured is brilliant. The first half, you maybe struggling with the fact that it's a lot of biology and omg-why-do-we-need-to-know-this but honestly later on in the course when he ties it into AI, deep learning, neural nets, it all MAKES SENSE. The biology is an intuitive way of tying into the math, the computer science, and building up on the biology also builds up on the math and the concepts that we're learning.\r\nThere are undeniably flaws - but if you're willing to put in the work, take the class, be willing to ask questions and for help, then it is all worth it. Professor Zucker is brilliant, as is Luciano (the TF, who will help you understand anything you may have missed). The exams and psets are more than fair as well - exams are much more high level, high concept, whereas the psets are on MATLAB and expect you to do some of the mathematical calculations (but lays out the steps for you as well) and helps you really understand the nitty gritty of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I personally really enjoyed this course, but I do think that your opinion of the class is contingent on if you get along with Professor Zucker's teaching style. He's an engaging speaker, but can be disorganized at times, so there is a good amount that you end up needing to read about on your own post/pre-lecture. He also moves relatively quickly through material that can, at times, be dense. Because of this, attending office hours is very helpful. Also, the problem sets were very helpful in understanding the material - I do think that I learned a lot of the material in completing them. I enjoyed the material a lot, but I will say that there is a decent amount of biology, if that's not interesting to you. The course touches on neural networks as well, which, once connected to computer vision, is a good introduction to the applications of machine learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Take it. You get to learn really cool concepts about vision and how vision can be modeled. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student who is even mildly interested in these topics. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely enjoyed the subject matter and haven't heard of any other course that treats the same topic, so I would recommend it because its interesting but warn other students about the poor teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its an interesting class and good science credit if youre a CS major. ",
            "\u00a0I have never been challenged as much by a course in my life. I learned perseverance, courage, and became closer with God. In my search for emotional support, I reconnected with members of my distant family. We had our best thanksgiving meal in years thanks to the sheer difficulty of this course.\r\n\r\nIn all seriousness, this is a great course taught by a passionate professor. It is clearly heartfelt and Zucker is clearly an expert in the field. Genuine intellectual curiosity is a theme of the course, and you can get as much out of the course as you want to. Take this course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely! It is a great class the workload is managable and Professor Zucker is a great lecturer and the TAs are extremely helpful ",
            "\u00a0Good course for a intro to Computational Vision ",
            "\u00a0YES! YES! 100% YES!!! I know in the past the class might have received negative comments, and I hesitated to take the class at first, but it ended up being my favorite class in the semester. I learned so much and understood some materials covered in other classes (linear algebra, AI, graphics, etc.) even more through Prof. Zucker's very intuitive explanations. The problem sets and even the exams are really fun! They really make you think and test your understanding instead of your memorization skill. The TAs, especially, are also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0No, absolutely not. The only reason I took was because I wanted to get a science credit within the Applied Math/CS major. Otherwise definitely would avoid. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. As far as CS electives go, this is a very solid one. The material is interesting and presented in an interesting way, the professor and teaching staff is helpful, and it's not a nightmarish amount of work. ",
            "\u00a0The material is really interesting but the class itself is a bit disorganized. It's very unclear what you do and do not need to know and it's very hard to try to understand everything since a lot of the material is difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. Zucker really cares about teaching. Lectures and topics are really interesting. I thought he presented the material in a very interesting manner and managed to connect a bunch of seemingly unrelated topics. It's a great intro to neural nets, machine learning, neuroscience, the visual cortex, and computer vision/graphics. "
