            "\u00a0Great insight from a career diplomat. Great class to get outside of the academic bubble while still gaining valuable insight into Chinese foreign policy. Great   way to apply what we learn into practice through simulations and scenarios. ",
            "\u00a0US foreign policy to China. How to think, talk, write and ask like a diplomat. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to draft policy memos and get to my point quickly and clearly. ",

            "\u00a0I developed a very good foundational understanding of how Chinese history is playing a critical role in today's Chinese issues. Overall, I found that I could have a very informed conversation about current challenges as it relates to U.S./China relations. ",

            "\u00a0Discussion of the course is lively. Lecture is informative. (I wonder if it'd be also helpful to learn more about the development of  American's foreign policy in other parts of the world outside of China and Asia.) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dave Rank.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the historical portion of the class was too long, in my opinion. We should have gone straight into contemporary issues on the third class or so. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Rank brought in some phenomenal and very interesting guests to speak with us, which added to the substance of the class. I also appreciated the different assignments we were asked to complete and the detailed feedback from Prof. Rank, which helped to improve our policy writing abilities. However, the work load, particularly the reading, is a little heavier than normal courses and could be calibrated better. Lastly, if offered in the future, I'd highly recommend avoiding the Friday afternoon slot! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the professor, David Rank, was awesome. So unbelievably knowledgeable and insightful on the topic.\r\n\r\nImprovements- none to speak of. ",
