            "\u00a0I strongly feel that this course, as a requirement for the global health concentration, could use significant restructuring and updating. \r\nIt should be more focused on skill acquisition to help inform our future work, and less on theoretical concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a complete waste of time.  Having completed the course, I am still unsure of a single learning objective we were supposed to get out of it.  All we did was talk about a different country's health system each week.  There was never any instruction on key concepts we were supposed to learn or any skills we were supposed to acquire.  We just talked about different health systems each week.  The homework required at most a high school level of thinking, requiring little to zero critical thought.  I'm sad I wasted time taking this class.  I did not learn a single thing. ",
            "\u00a0I was disappointed in this course. There was a ton of work for little reward. The days where we analyzed specific health systems were valuable, but a lot of the course was spent on more vague concepts and we didn't get in to as much detail on them. I enjoyed the modeling but would have rather it been much more detailed than the basic reviews we did. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers very interesting and unique material and Prof Hecht has the experience to really give powerful real world expertise in the class. However there are a few areas that need improvement. Many times it felt that we never really were able to \"dig\" into the material at a high level, or get past a surface analysis of readings due to the way that the class was set up. An excessive amount of time was spent on student presentations, and during Q/As several students would consistently dominate them and provide lengthy comments that prevented the class from moving forward. Many of the students did not seem to prepare very well for the class, thus when we broke into groups it was challenging to have a meaningful conversation or come to a consensus. The class would benefit from capped enrollment, as this would allow the students to engage more meaningfully with the material and work better in groups. However I think the most important feedback is that Hecht needs to lecture more and provide his insight and analysis on the material--it is much more productive to hear from him rather than other students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Good course- the material presented is interesting, and the use of guest speakers really improved the quality of the class. ",
            "\u00a0On paper, the course laid out some great learning objectives.  However, the lectures were mismanaged and we spent too much time each week on portions of the lecture that were meant to introduce a topic or take 20 minutes at the most.  I would have liked to learn more applied technical skills related to health system reform modeling and evaluation.  Instead, I feel like I learned more about what the skills are by name but not how to do them. ",
            "\u00a0This was the worst course I have ever had the displeasure of taking. We are talking I would have rather cut off a toe than taken this course. It was universally hated by everyone who took it this semester. \r\nStrengths: None\r\nWeaknesses: the reading load (somewhere between 100-300 pages a week), the weekly reports (if I wanted to regurgitate information to someone I would have stayed as an undergrad), the student presentations (they take up 60% of class time and if I wanted to hear my fellow students talk I would invite them for drinks), and the instructor (old white guy with a savior complex who thinks he can do no wrong and refuses to take criticism). \r\n\r\nI cannot stress enough how bad this course is. My recommendation would be to just throw the whole thing away. ",
            "\u00a0This lecture was poorly organized during class time. Each week we would meet and the first half an hour would be spent on what we did last week and what we should be talking about this week. This in turn set every lecture behind. The student presentations often mirrored the readings and the weekly assignments, making them almost redundant in material, especially when there was a writing assignment on the same week. There was a lot of almost hostile comments made by the professor about our work ethic, timing on the presentations, and constant reminder of the no laptop policy. The two weeks that a guest lecturer spoke were the highlight of this course -- it actually seemed like they wanted to share their real world experience and insight rather than copying one lecture slide given in a foreign language and trying to apply it to this course. Overal, if this was not a requirement of the global health concentration, I would have dropped it. ",
            "\u00a0The professor has accomplished a lot and has been a part of some really amazing global public health work over the years. Unfortunately, the class was very disorganized, which led to us running behind schedule, being unclear on what homework or problem sets were being assigned, and how to best prep for class activity. There should be less emphasis on student presentations (of which we would often spend 45 minutes of the class time on) and more emphasis on lecture and group activities. The best lectures were pulled from the professor's work with Pharos Consulting, because it allowed us to interact with very relevant and current topic areas. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: learning about different country's health systems\r\nweaknesses: way too much readings. there were about 10-12 readings per week with about half of them 50-200 pages each. The amount of the readings discouraged many people from even doing any of them. Also, the student presentations were ineffective. They should've been time limited and kept to only one presentation per class. There were times when the presentations took more than half the class. Everyone was zoned out. We are not paying $40,00 per year to listen to students, the professor should be doing most of the teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: guest speakers (e.g. Gavin Yamey)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- having student presentations every week\r\n- class is too large to accommodate the goals for the class, as a result, was not engaging\r\n- difficult to learn and apply the skills presented, because they were presented very minimally through doing the homework\r\n- difficult to apply to paper ",
            "\u00a0I'm still not sure what the point of this course was. We never actually learned anything valuable/important about health systems and instead just ended up learning random facts about health systems around the world. There was no foundation set to actually analyze health systems and what could be done to improve them. ",
            "\u00a0Not enough instructor engagement ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by having more structured lesson plans, focusing more on technical skills. This course is listed as a credit for my modelling concentration, but I don't feel like my modelling skills have been sufficiently enhanced after taking the course. The discussions were great though, and the guest speakers were phenomenal! ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I can definitely speak more knowledgeably on Global Health Systems and subsequently have a decent understanding of the financing mechanisms health systems around the world implement. This course was beneficial in that respect, but ultimately did not fulfill anywhere near the potential it could have reached for several reasons: \r\n\r\n1) Class Student Presentations \r\n\r\nSometimes 30-40 minutes of the 1 hour 50 minute class would be allocated to student presentations, which were essentially just a summary of the readings. Whilst I appreciate that public speaking and presentation skills are important to learn, thats not what Im paying $60k per year for and having to sit through some pretty bad presentations attempting to summarize things we were meant to have read was painful, and frankly insulting to the intelligence of many of the students. \r\n\r\n2) Group work and Class Debates\r\n\r\nI appreciated the intent and attempt to have debates and group work but ultimately the execution was poor. Firstly, 47 College classroom is just not setup sufficiently well to have effective group work for a class of this size with like 45 people. The result was about 3 people contributing and everyone else sitting around who may as well not have been there, maybe I had a bad group. The debates were basically 2 minute snippets from each group but it wasnt really a proper debate. This would be done much better by dedicating a whole class to a debate activity and smaller groups could have 15 mins each to debate a topic in teams in front of the class.\r\n\r\n3) Assignments\r\n\r\nFound the essay prompts pretty good and provoked some decent analysis. Some other assignments were ok, some were literally regurgitating info that required no critical thinking and to be honest was painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n4) Watching YouTube lectures in class \r\n\r\nA few minute videos are fine but really.... a 20 minute lecture from the Thailand Health minister shown in class was just awful. Firstly, it could have been assigned pre-class. Secondly, his accent was difficult to understand and the quality of the audio was abysmal. 20 minutes of my life Im not getting back.\r\n\r\n5) Technology Issues \r\n\r\nOn more than one occasion with guest lecturers via video we had technology issues.  In one case 20+ minutes of class time was wasted, which when you only have 1 lecture a week is pretty embarrassing for Yale and a waste of our time. Guest lecturers were very good though.\r\n\r\n6) Readings \r\n\r\nSome weeks it was 300+ pages. Assigning massive reports to read just not helpful and nor is it realistic to just skim reports like this without any direction. If allocating readings like this then at least prioritize them. A lot of the readings were also super old and the global health field has evolved massively so this old material is just not as relevant anymore. \r\n\r\nAll of this highlights that the Professor did very little actual teaching or lecturing throughout this entire semester, which is a shame because he is clearly a very knowledgeable and influential figure in this field who as a lot of experience and wisdom that could have been imparted on students. ",
            "\u00a0Gives exposure to a wide range of topics.\r\nThe readings could be improved. They were mostly boring and we were able to find more helpful and interesting journal articles online.\r\nFocus could also be given to imbibing certain quantitative/technical skill (such as LiST, Spectrum) ",
            "\u00a0This is a course with potential but the professor should be replaced or monitored extensively by the administration with a very short leash. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this course. I was looking forward to it, as the MPH Global Health Concentration capstone, and felt like I gained a lot of what I was looking for. The guest speakers were of very high caliber. One piece of feedback is that I wish student presentations had been shorter and there had been more group work time. I also did not find the weekly assignments very helpful and found that they took a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n+ The structure of the class flows well and is nicely split between learning the fundamentals, assessing UHC reforms, and assessing scale-up programs\r\n+ The TAs were great and responded quickly with feedback\r\n+ The outside presenters were always phenomenal\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The number of required readings was overwhelming, so I stopped reading. Didn't affect my class performance.\r\n- The student presentations were designed to take up no more than 20 minutes of class with each presentation lasting 8 minutes. Often times, presentations went WAAYYY over the designated amount of time and took up a significant portion of the class. One particular presentation took 20-25 minutes itself. The presentations often times did not cover new information that was not introduced in the readings, so when I did do the readings, it felt very repetitive. I didn't come to class to be re-taught information I've read by my peers. \r\n- Several problematic comments referring to African nations and their development were said that the professor declined to comment on or made himself e.g., \"I can't believe this [African capital city] looks so urban!\" or \"People in Africa who can't afford healthcare have to barter for services with potatoes and woven rugs.\" Often times I felt as if the professor took on a white savior complex when he described low- and middle-income African and Asian countries. ",
            "\u00a0. ",
            "\u00a0This class has the potential to be fantastic, given that Professor Hecht has a LOT of experience and is very knowledgable. However, I felt like there was TOO many class presentations and videos/group work that took up time that I would have rather spend learning from Professor Hecht. The presentations/videos were redundant from the readings and problem sets, and I rather have had more actual lecture time. ",
            "\u00a0The topics in this course were engaging and provided great opportunity for learning and discussion. The format of the class could be improved to better facilitate this learning. The size of the course was a big challenge and it would have been better to limit the number of student presentations to leave more time for discussion and presentations by guest speakers. The best class sessions were the ones in which experts spoke about their work and first hand experiences. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The class has a lot of breadth to it and we had fantastic guest speakers! It was also cool that we had a modeling workshop\r\nWeaknesses: We always seemed to run out of time, and the teacher didn't always seem as interested in the input of others. It just wasn't always organized. ",
            "\u00a0Weekly assignments and their design are major strengths. Readings could have been better selected and then discussed more directly at class that week. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The group presentations were a great way to collaborate with classmates and dig deeper into specific topics. Projects like these create memories in students minds that last longer than memories of lectures past.\r\n-- The class periods were well-structured, dynamic, and engaging. Classes often opened with brief videos, then incorporated full-class discussions, lectures from the professor, student presentations, small and large group discussions and debates, and guest lectures. I appreciated the planning and effort it took to put together these classes, and the end result. \r\n-- I appreciated the opportunities to do group work with classmates. These were important moments for us to engage with the material to strengthen our understanding.\r\n-- The assignments were interesting and the essay prompts were the right balance of general and specific; essay prompts should be open-ended questions like these were, that give students the chance to think through problems on their own. \r\n-- The PowerPoints were well-organized, and the content of the course was relevant and interesting. \r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- Assignments should be written up and posted on Canvas at least 2 weeks before the deadline. Students have complicated schedules, and time management is smoother when we can prepare more in advance. Alternatively, halve the amount of work required for each assignment. \r\n-- The most helpful way to organize course readings on Canvas is in a File, which can be downloaded in its entirety, and then easily accessed when offline or facing slow internet access. Modules and links to external websites are difficult to navigate. It is easier to download all the files for each class in one go, and that is best done when they are all included in a folder in Files. ",
            "\u00a0I was really disappointed in this course. Perhaps that's harsh, but it was the class I was most looking forward to this semester. The topic is so interesting, and the professor's background meant that he could add a lot of his personal experiences to the mix. Unfortunately, I think that the class was just poorly organized and too big for what the professor wanted. At that class size, I would have much preferred a more standard lecture format to the large group discussions. Splitting the class into four large groups did not work. The desks were not arranged for that, and inevitably students on the periphery of the group did not have a chance to participate. Smaller groups of three or four would have worked better. The problem sets were good, but the essay questions often involved too many questions. In attempting to answer all of the questions, the style and structure of the essay itself was often compromised. The presentations and final essays were useful assignments as well. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: gives a broad picture of how the PH works actually is implemented in LMIC and what a donor's perspective can be regarding any specific issue in global health\r\nweakness: cannot fit many topics in detail (but there are other detailed courses separately available) ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good platform for continuing to think about and develop perspectives in global health policy and health finance. However, the time breakdowns for the class schedule were rarely adhered to with student presentations taking longer than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0This course was overwhelming. I do not think our professor used class time appropriately and the course seemed very disorganized. He assigned a ridiculous amount of readings that were just not possible to complete in one week. Overall I did not enjoy this class ",

            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe course allows for a more nuanced look at how financing decisions are made pertaining to interventions as well as their impact on global health\r\nTeaching about different models with respect to a countries needs, population, and financial situations is imperative for work in global health as well as allows for a more educated criticism of the US health system (for future reform efforts)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThe course often appeared disorganized and there was some criticism about what the course taught, however, I found the teachings to be quite helpful and the student presentations presented a great opportunity to understand a subject of one's choice in more detail. ",
            "\u00a0Towards the end (last ~4 weeks) this course improved drastically, however it should be noted this was in part due to outside lecturers. I believe the instructor had the best intentions and applied himself to teaching, but I felt that often the blanket statements/general concepts applied were fairly intuitive and didn't signal any particularly in-depth knowledge of the (admittedly many) countries we looked at. ",
            "\u00a0Robert has a lot of interesting anecdotes and a lot of global health experience. However, this class was really frustrating because it felt like each week we always got stuck on a particular topic and the class never moved forward. Students were regurgitating the same talking points and giving a lot of comments without moving forward the conversation. Instead of guiding the lecture and discussions I think Robert got caught into this as well. I don't think we ever got through everything that Robert outlined at the beginning of the lecture. I would recommend getting rid of the group work altogether and focusing on the lectures and Robert's case studies. The paired presentations were also just on the weekly readings and I don't think were necessary; they just ate up a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the topics of the course, but wish there could have been more discussion. I felt that time was not always used effectively to truly dive into topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class provided a nice opportunity to explore topics that I'm really interested in. The country case studies of UHC reform efforts were very interesting to read and write about, and the final paper was actually one of my favorite assignments at YSPH so far, thanks in large part to the flexibility around the topic and the support of the TAs.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: While the topics we studied were really interesting, class time was poorly structured and often felt like it added little to my learning. The student presentations often just recap the readings and add little new insight or information, and given the large number of students who had to be accommodated in the presentations, I did not find the worth the time they consumed. The videos and discussions were often too loosely-structured to to deepen learning or challenge assumptions. Dividing us into country groups for in-class debates was a nice attempt at more interactive learning, but I didn't feel like we had adequate time to prepare for these discussions, so it ended up feeling like a distraction.\r\n\r\nIn general, I think that this class has a lot of potential, but in its current format, it tries to accomplish too much, reducing the overall quality of the class.

            "\u00a0I've heard he does better in smaller class settings. The class needs to be redesigned. ",
            "\u00a0Robert was hostile, made blanket statements that were offensive and often racist/misogynistic. I only went to class because attendance was mandatory and every minute spent in class was a waste of my time. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hecht is a very pleasant man and I enjoyed chatting with him before and after class. Unfortunately, as a Professor he just disappointed me in comparison to the benchmark set by other Professors at YSPH. I think he is overextended in his non-Yale commitments with Pharos and the traveling associated with that, which leaves him not putting his Yale work as a priority and delivering a class that is well beneath the quality that he is capable of if he actually put some effort in to teaching rather than creating lessons that are packed with what I would call filler. ",
            "\u00a0He is great. Very charismatic.\r\nBut chose TAs that were tardy. We did not get our PSET results on time. For instance, we had not received our evaluation of Essay 2 by the time we had to submit essay 3. Their evaluations could have helped in improving our Essay 3. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hecht is using his position at Yale to market Pharos.  He shows up to class unprepared (sometimes skipping it entirely), plays YouTube videos, delegates teaching responsibilities to students and encourages student infighting by being out of touch with the course material and applying different standards of evaluation to different students depending upon whether he likes the student or not. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hecht was excellent. He is incredibly knowledgeable on the global health field, and one of my favorite parts of the course was hearing about his firsthand experiences working with Pharos, at WHO, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n+ Has profound knowledge on LMIC health system development\r\n+ Really enjoyed when Professor Hecht presented on his current work to demonstrate a tangible example of the material that we're learning\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- I understand that Professor Hecht is very busy, but he often came off as inaccessible\r\n- Professor Hecht and other students have made said problematic statements in class. Often times, I felt Professor Hecht took on a white savior complex when referring to low- and middle-income countries, particularly those in Africa. He has made very sweeping statements like \"people in Africa who can't afford healthcare have to barter for services with potatoes and woven rugs.\" Other students have made problematic statements that he failed to address in class, like \"I can't believe that this [African capital city] looks so urban!\". (What else is it supposed to look like--dirt roads and mud huts?) I would say as the class went on, fewer of these comments were made, but I felt uneasy going to class after the first few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0. ",

            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The professor appeared to have put considerable effort and care into crafting lesson plans, with many different ways of engaging students. The professor found exciting ways to approach topics from several angles.\r\n-- Hecht brought in examples of analyses of global health system reforms not just from real life, but also from his own recent work. When a professor sets out a narrative like that, it is often far more compelling for the listeners than a Fact. Fact. Fact. kind of lecture devoid of the good parts and the real life urgency of problem-solving and saving lives.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- The professor rightly asked that students respect his time and avoid using phones and laptops during class, arriving late, etc. However, it is better to mention these classroom standards all at once at the start or middle or end of each lecture, rather than as an immediate response to an individual student using their laptop or arriving late. Those of us who abide by standards will do so without many reminders, and those who dont will probably ignore tactics like that anyway. Best not to call out individuals that way. ",
            "\u00a0excellent! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Hecht has a lot of expertise in the subject matter and demonstrated it through his anecdotes and presentations, however he would sometimes spend too much time on a specific, causing students to tune out. Perhaps being more succinct and hitting the main ideas would be more beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0Appreciated his real-world knowledge. Felt like he had a difficult time establishing good class conduct- too much cell phones among students and they didn't really contribute. ",

            "\u00a0More can be gained from the professor sharing his experiences and opinions on the topics instead of opening it up to the class to answer. The class is well structured but a lot of what the professor wants to achieve in class does not get covered because of poor time management and time wasted going over the logistics. ",
            "\u00a0problematic statements that students shared were not corrected by instructor, instructor did not help me learn anything that will equip me with tools to work in reforming health systems which is why i took the class. i heard that this professor has a group of undergraduates who are on a team consulting for the global fund. i wish he did that for MPH students instead as i see myself in that line of work after graduation. i wish lectures were actually taught by the professor with presentation slideshows and actual notes i can take away. the student presentations were not helpful as they were not experts in the given topic. i wish the professor had prepared for the class more. he also said rude things to students and to myself as i was giving my presentation. my presentation was cut short to 10 minutes because the professor hustled us that day, whereas other students were given up to 40 or 50 minutes at times. i was unfairly judged on my presentation because he was in a bad mood and technology was not working that day.
