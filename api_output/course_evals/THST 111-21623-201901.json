Its a great intro into theater studies at Yale and develops your writing while teaching you about different performance concepts and cultures. ",

            "\u00a0THST 111 provides an overview of theatre (works written, performed, etc.) and the theory and history that propelled these works. This class, unlike 110, feels less rushed because only a few hundred years are covered instead of a few thousand. \r\nThe class provides excellent insight into why the history of theatre looks the way it doesincluding insight into important movements, artists, and world politics that shaped art. It also relies heavily on the idea of adaptation as historiography, asking students to draw connections between adapted work as a lens into a particular time and culture. \r\nTowards the end of the class, we began to speak much more about ivtersectionalities of race, gender, and sexuality, and we also began to look more at art forms beyond musicals and plays. We ventured into dance movements and some visual art to understand how all of these forms were in conversation with each other throughout time. ",

            "\u00a0The teaching fellows were excellent, the course offered opportunities for us to get to know peers with whom we might wish to make more theatre in the future, and I do feel I learned a very important base of plays and cultures from which to build my theatre knowledge going forward.

            "\u00a0Since it is a survey course, we did not go in-depth into any of the material. The format of the midterm and final do not require you to read all of the plays because it is rote memorization. I wish we were assigned fewer plays, so we actually could have time to read them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting, good projects, great TAs, good topics\r\nWeaknesses; 3 midterms, 3 finals, and slides that we can't access outside of the classroom ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, this course does exactly what it sets out to do: provide an overarching look at the development of art and thought throughout time. It follows a very strict schedule, and students always know what they must have completed by when. This structure relies heavily on the TFs, all of whom are students at YSD. They add incredible value to the courseeach one presenting a lecture once a semester and leading weekly section. Furthermore, students read many of the most influential works of theatre and theory, meaning that they can feel confident to talk about these works and their effects today. Also, students are asked to create devised work in their section for a midterm and final performance. This is a really great way to get out of the chairs and into the creative work. Honestly, we should do this more. \r\nFor weaknesses, this class can gloss over some material in attempt to get through all of the works and history we study. As such, some things like the black arts movement aren't provided enough time. Furthermore, we have guest lecturers sometimes, but they rarely provide really valuable insight into theatre as a whole and often talk about a really niche topic that only they are interested in. ",
            "\u00a0We rarely talked about the plays we read for class. The lectures were rushed and we would have done well to talk more about the plays than history to put the movements into context. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of material, which was interesting, but on account of this we moved very fast. ",
            "\u00a0Section is amazingthe lectures themselves are less engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely reading heavy and I think would be better taught as a seminar, giving enough time to actually discuss the readings for each week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Guest Lectures, inconsistent reading load (I see this as a major pro- there were a few points in the semester in which I fell off of doing the readings, but was then able to get back on it bc one class had a particularly lighter than average reading load for that day), the community and camaraderie formed among the students themselves, and the performance the class is required to see each semester.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having to deal with an exam, performance, and essay at both midterm and performance is a pretty rough thing to deal with, especially given so many of us are actively participating in extracurricular theater while taking the course. For some of us, it often resulted in not being able to fully engage with one or more of those requirements at our full potential. ",
            "\u00a0The course deals with some heavily racialized content that is not delivered or handled in the best way. Lectures and conversations about Japanese and African American culture aren't given the same respect that white playwrights are given. Since the class is so short, there isn't enough time to legitimately discuss racial dynamics of certain shows and the history surrounding them, especially not by a white professor. Additionally, the class is fundamentally based in adaptation and very few works by black/POC playwrights get adapted, which significantly limits the scope of paper options to mostly white playwrights despite attempts to diversify the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers a lot of important plays, theorists, and cultural movements and provides very intriguing glimpse of the growth and change of theater of the last few centuries. All the plays are extremely engaging and foster excellent group discussions, especially in section meetings. I felt that I did not grasp some of the theoretical concepts/cultural movements due to the pace of the course and the sheer amount of topics covered in a short time. Perhaps concentrating more closely on fewer topics would help this. Also, having a final performance, final exam, and final paper was a lot of work. Perhaps choosing either a paper or an exam would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness of this course is that it has such a broad subject area to cover in such a short space of time, making for a shallow survey that tests our understanding via memorization of facts. I do not know how much information I will retain from this course because it is designed to be the type of class for which you take the test and then forget everything. A strength of this class, however, is that it furthered my skills in analysis, writing, and comparison. Even if I do not remember the dates during which Artaud lived, I think that this class will certainly help me within the theater major and beyond. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are Theater Studies majors, or those who actually intend to actively engage with theater on campus. This class is a good way to meet potential collaborators and to work with them in a discussion section and on making performance pieces-- however, it moves at a rapid pace, and might be overwhelming to a student who is only mildly interested in theater. ",
            "\u00a0Very much, especially for someone with an interest in theatre history. The class does have very little in the way of student performance, however. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are planning on majoring in theater studies. If not, I'm not sure. Only if you love reading plays and critical texts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this classes teaches a lot and doesn't ask too much of you in return, the TFs are incredible and you end up learning so much from them. ",
            "\u00a0If you are a theater studies major, take this course. If you aren't, I would not recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it to anyone interested in theater studies. Try to get Ariel for your TF, she is a goddess among women. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Elise Morrison is a great professor, and you end up reading some fantastic works in the class. ",
            "\u00a0So if you want to major in theatre, you must take this class. A lot of people really don't like this class because of all the theory, but I think that if you lean into it, you can actually find some really cool pieces of knowledge and insight into your own practices as an artist. \r\nFor someone who is just interested in reading plays and understanding the thought behind artistic movements, then yes go ahead. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you want to continue taking theater studies classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to a theater major (its a prerequisite) but not to anyone else. The volume of readings is impossible to keep up with and lectures rarely touch on them but expect to be tested on both. If youre interested in theater this course might broaden your horizons but will more likely frustrate you by waving schools of theater in front of your face and then pulling them away before youve had any time to engage with them. This is one of those courses so frustrating that it forms a community of passionately disgruntled students so if you are a first year looking for friends to complain about things with this is a great option. ",
            "\u00a0For anyone looking for a broad sense of theater history and an interest in reading plays/performance theory, absolutely. And of course, for anyone planning to take the major I recommend too. Definitely one of the cooler of the major \"intro\" courses/sequences. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student that needs it as a prerequisite for the Theater Studies major. If you are interested in getting an overview of theater, this a good class for name dropping significant playwrights and theater theories. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who wants to pursue theater at Yale. It's a required class for Theater Studies majors, so it's good to take early on in your Yale career. Even if you're not a theater major, it's a great starting point for someone who's interested in learning more about the history of theater. "
