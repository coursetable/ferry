            "\u00a0Definitely got a better overview of the literature! I also became better at analyzing methodology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how various models worked and how well they applied to different dynamics in our politics today and throughout history. I learned how to evaluate different research designs and different trends in political science today (bandwagoning on audit studies). ",
            "\u00a0I learned a large degree on congressional theory, the ideology of legislators, and spatial theories explicating policy decision-making. I gained the skill of being able to observe and analyze spatial theories with more precision and accuracy. ",
            "\u00a0Useful overview of the literature, good discussions on both methods and substance ",
            "\u00a0Greatly increased my knowledge of American political institutions and the political science research on them.  Gained skills in analyzing this research. ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of how to think about the \"equilibrium outcome\" of the institution we see (e.g., Congress, the bureaucracy) and how the incentives and preferences of the actors with the power (e.g., the median member) would cause this equilibrium result. Also gained an enhanced understanding of spatial models. Also an enhanced ability to think through some research designs. "

            "\u00a0Kelly is an excellent professor. She is very kind and explained complicated material very clearly. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and the format of the papers; it allowed enough flexibility week by week while still encouraging the synthesis of ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe one week where we read studies that all do one kind of statistical analysis method (diff in diff week, etc.) to clarify when a technique is used well compared to when it's not? But I did like how the readings were grouped by subject areathat may have been at the expense of greater understanding of statistical methods. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of the course was that it did not pose specific discussion questions and key aspects of readings to look for. A strength of the course is that we were encouraged to tie the readings from past weeks to current readings. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the balance in the readings, between classical pieces and more recent work, and between formal models and more empirical work. \r\nThe \"mini-lectures\" when a topic deserved them were often useful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the syllabus and instructor.  I enjoyed most of the readings and the discussions had in class.  The only real weakness was that sometimes the in-class discussions were a little slow. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Read lots of different material\r\nWeakness: I didn't love the 1-pagerssometimes they felt like busy work; I also never seemed to engage with the readings when writing essays as much as Kelly wantedmaybe some clearer directions at the outset could've helpedit seems a function of trying to write similar papers for prior courses for this course, but the past kinds weren't quite good enough for Kelly (which seems awesomewe should be pushed); sometimes I wanted class discussion to be more structured "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in obtaining a better understanding of how America's political institutions operate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if you want a crash course on the literature on institutions in various corners of American politics. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, to anyone interested in American politics or the political economy of institutions. ",
            "\u00a0Yea definitely. It was helpful to think through why institutions form, how they persist, and the implications of their designfor different kinds of cases/environments. "
