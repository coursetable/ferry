            "\u00a0knowledge concerning architecture and its role in the greater urban context. Introductory course in developing the skills needed to analyze and view architecture from an intellectual standpoint. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about how to talk about architecture, about New Haven's history and Architecture, and a bit about the history. I learned how to write about architecture and how to conduct a research paper. But I had to figure out how to do a lot of that on my own. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about American architecture and its context, but also about different architectural works overall by famous architects and their impact. I liked the intersection between architecture and historical development, but I especially liked discussing art with architecture in mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to meaningfully interpret forms in an urban context, placing them in dialogue with events of historical and cultural importance. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think I learned very much from this course, but the few things I did learn were about various architects and architectural styles. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I'm not sure exactly what I learned in this class; we covered a lot and most of it was pretty abstract. What I can say is that I look at the world around me in a much different way than I did before. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who had never studied architecture before, it was a phenomenal introduction to the subject. It helped me understand architecture from a critical, functional and artistic point of view. It also helped me understand the relationship between urbanism and architecture, as well as the structure of cities and their development. I am now more knowledgable on general architecture and feel much more confident and cultured. ",
            "\u00a01.\tThroughout this course, I have learned an incredible amount about the history of architecture, its connection to history, as well as the urban environment of New Haven. The vast majority of what know about New Haven and its history has come from this class. When I read about architects in books and hear about them in podcasts, I now find myself recognizing a majority of the names and being able to name some of their works. I have a better understanding now of concepts that were previously confusing to me. "

            "\u00a0strengths: interesting and insightful readings, engaging discussions. weaknesses: discussions could be slightly more structured. ",
            "\u00a0There were really good assignments including a fun collage assignment where we were able to be creative. The course however had very little structure to it, both on a broad scale and a minor scale. The readings were very long and there were a lot of them and they were often dense with architectural jargon and theory that was difficult to understand and relatively unimportant. The readings would then not be a part of class discussion so many of us just stopped doing them which didn't seem to impact the course's productivity, suggesting the readings really were pointless. Surry, while he was well intentioned, did not provide even close to enough structure when giving us papers. The grading was subjective (although not harsh) and the feedback was sometimes repetitive and unclear. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was pairing good discussion and conversation with the visual materials. There isn't really a weakness to this course because it was a peak into the immense world of architecture, but there was a lot of readings in the way that there was a lot of information to cover, mostly with dense language which can be overwhelming but I liked how there can still be high engagement purely with what is covered in the presentations in class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderfully taught course with few weaknesses. Of its many strengths are its professor, and the mix of formal writing with artistic projects. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the strength of the course was the subject matter is interesting. The weakness was that there was no structure, guidance, or teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Surry was the course's greatest strength. He's great at guiding discussion, so classes were always interesting and insightful. He's also thorough in his feedback so you know exactly what he's looking for in assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! The one area of improvement was that sometimes the reading were difficult to understand, especially when it came to placing them within the context of the other things we were learning. I would appreciate a little more guidance before reading some of the denser stuff so the students would know what to pay attention to. ",
            "\u00a0The conversational flow of the class through images was always incredibly entertaining and helpful. Michael Schlabs was always engaging and kept the class thinking critically. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness, in opinion, was the exclusion of the readings in some of the classes. Sometimes, the readings would be ignored, although they had been assigned to be read the week before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I really enjoyed the field trips we took: a walking tour of New Haven and a visit to Philip Johnsons estate. The small class size served to create an atmosphere that was conducive to making friends. Our trips and out-of-class film viewing assignments, served to develop a tight-knit community of students, many of whom I hope to remain friends with. Although the readings were often very dense, our class discussions made complex ideas much easier to understand and digest.\r\nWeaknesses: The readings were often very long and difficult to understand. Also, instructions for assignments were frequently vague. This may have been intended to foster creativity, but often left students confused. "

            "\u00a0Yes. In my opinion, the content explored in this course is not only interesting, but relevant to any urban or suburban citizen. ",
            "\u00a0No. There was not enough structure to make it truly informative and engaging and a learning process that is worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because it was really interesting and I now look at the built environment in new ways because of the information I learned in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. White there is a bit of reading involved, the workload is more than worth it in comparison to what you get out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0No, I do not think there is enough structure, making the class pointless. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fun, low-stress class that provides a great overview of architecture as it shapes and influences the city. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great seminar! Surry is brilliant and a super cool guy. Everything he said sounded as if it was coming straight from a Ted talk. The assignments in the class allowed for a lot of creativity and flexibility. If open-ended assignments stress you out, this class might not be the best fit, but if you love having the chance to write or create something really unique, then this seminar will allow you to do that in a way that my other classes did not. The class has a lot of interesting connections to other fields, including art, literature, and sociology. My favorite part of the class was having the chance to learn more about the city of New Haven. Surry knows a lot of the city's history and present, and learning about this has really deepened my connection to the areas around Yale's campus. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If the student is at all interested with architecture or urbanism, it is a phenomenal introduction to both subjects. The course is always engaging and forces you to look at architecture and cities in a critical manner. The conversational aspects of the class also encourage discussion and the ability to see many different points of view. I also think that the class does a good job at covering the cultural aspects that surround architecture, not simply the subject itself. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student who is looking for a good introductory architecture class which goes over a wide range of material in a semester. "
