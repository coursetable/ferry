            "\u00a0I learned about the relationship between the environment, our actions, and our hormones. I also learned about the real scientific method and how to create and run a research project. ",
            "\u00a0I think I covered a lot of this in my lab evaluation because I forgot they were technically separate classes. I learned so much about engaging with science and research which I didn't think I could do before. I learned about reading scientific papers and understanding results. I learned basics of the endocrine system and what hormones really even are. This class truly taught me so much. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about questions and how to solve those questions in scientific way. I can now differentiate between and formulate hypotheses and predictions as well. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various hormones, lab protocols, and how to analyze data. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read scientific papers and basic lab techniques through ANTH148L (which you have to take if enrolled in ANTH148). I also learned how to brainstorm/troubleshoot/execute a scientific study. "

        [
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are definitely the professors! Maggie and Claudia are passionate about the subject of the class and created a very welcoming, open class environment. Every single class was started with meditation and helped create a very calm environment. I never hesitated to ask a question or contribute during class. I don't think there are any weaknesses to the class. ",
            "\u00a0It was so incredible honestly one of the best formatted courses I've taken. Days where we continued lecture into lab were tough because it was hours of focus straight but other than that it was so well formatted/organized. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size made this course engaging and facilitated interesting conversations. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small class size (only 8 students for 2 lecturers - Claudia, professor, and Maggie, phd researcher) makes for really intimate learning environment; a true seminar around science and \"how to think;\" ability and expectation to build really close relationships with instructors\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not a very rigorous class, and sometimes I felt that Maggie was not very good at independently leading class discussions/lectures. Also, sometimes we wouldn't actually do lab work during the 3 hour lab period on Wednesdays, which made for a very long time (4 hours) of listening to Claudia and Maggie talk. \r\n\r\nCourse could be improved by provided a more molecular understanding of hormone pathways.

            "\u00a0I recommend this course to everybody, even those who aren't STEM majors. The professors are amazing professors and accommodate everybody regardless of their science background. Learning how to run a research project was a great experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I got more individual attention than almost any other course. Feedback was specific and met me where I was at. Everything was organized to encourage learning while also not being a huge source of stress. We weren't expected to memorize facts we were led to engage critically and actively with the course material. Truly incredible. The most hands on class ever and its stem. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone that would like to gain a stronger foundation in scientific thinking and practice, especially to those that have had no prior lab experience. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any other student looking to build a personal connection with their professors, and who haven't previously. Maggie, Claudia, and Eduardo are all very dedicated to their students and can help connect you with different professors and areas of research that you may be interested in. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are someone with little scientific background who wants to learn about the scientific process. I would not recommend this course if you already have scientific experience or are pretty serious about learning about the granular molecular pathways. \r\n\r\nAt times, I was frustrated by surface level-ness of lectures. I understand that this course was  intended to bring more undergrads into research, but I found it to be not very stimulating. "
