            "\u00a0Interesting overview of Rivers under Professor Scott.  The class introduces you to the complicated relationship people have to the environment, really makes you think about the world around you and how it came to be. ",
            "\u00a0Reading a lot of material at one time. Politics of rivers, nature of rivers, effects that we have on rivers, the power that rivers have. ",
            "\u00a0The main takeaway of all readings and discussion is that dams are bad. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, we discussed rivers what they are and the politics of waterways. Most interestingly we learned how to view a river not just as a resource but from a different importance from human use. ",
            "\u00a0There is a wide range of insights I gleaned from this course. I learned about the birth of civilization through draining swamps. I was able to learn about the geopolitics of water while also developing an understanding of the ecology of water. I learned about the shortcomings of using a utilitarian cost-benefit analysis when there are consequences pertaining to cultural and ecological integrity that cannot be ascribed an accurate market value in order to be adequately weighed in calculating overall utility. This is a riveting course and just listening to Professor Scott and hearing all his stories is a wonderful opportunity that should not be missed. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt to view rivers in a different light, as dynamic living beings with agency, stories, and a life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Scott is very passionate about Rivers, you learn so much, about how rivers have been influential to society.  Professor Scott challenges you and is interested in your insights.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is no overview of rivers in the beginning, and as a result almost all the students are at different levels.  Some of the books do get a bit repetitive and are rather long.  If the reading could be consolidated and decreased a bit class discussions could be more interesting.  A bit more concrete guidance on the final paper and only tangible assignment in the class would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was just brilliant, and rivers are just a fascinating topic that most people know so little about. We ready from so many different lenses. ",
            "\u00a0This course has great potential, but it was not fully realized this semester. \r\n\r\nThe driving force behind each lesson was meant to be student-led discussion. Planning the day's discussion was a big part of the student grading on the syllabus. But each time a student began the day's discussion, Prof Scott cut them off before they finished their thoughts. It was also hard for students to converse with one another because Prof Scott made many interruptions and talked over students while they were still making their comments. \r\n\r\nThe assigned reading for this course was above the Yale limit. Yale's Guide to Academic Criteria says that students should expect to read a maximum equivalent of a book a week, and the two books a week assigned reading (often over 300 pages per book) was just impossible to keep up with. This decreased from the experience. It forced all students to read synopses online and grapple with conversations in class. \r\n\r\nIt would have improved the course to read more recently written books about the topics. I appreciate the historical contexts, but we finished the course with a book from the 1970s. It felt like the syllabus had not been updated in years and it would have been good to read about current events as well. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very relaxed and a classic seminar format. The discussions were enjoyable and Professor Scott in very interesting. The guest lecturers are all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course has all strengths - I couldn't think of a single weakness. Professor Scott is a wealth of knowledge and class discussions are engaging. The books we read were thought-provoking and unique. One of my favorite classes was when James Prosek came in to speak to us about eels. There were several other great speakers that came in to talk to us too. ",
            "\u00a0This course is not well organized and unclearly formatted. Students are expected to come prepared each week to give a 10-15 minute presentation on the book. However, students would often be cut off after 5 minutes by the professor, and halfway through the course, he forgot who had already presented so people were able to just volunteer themselves. Additionally, some weeks when students were to come prepared to present, there was an unannounced guest speaker who would present the entirety of the class period. Furthermore, the only elements of assessment in the entire course were the presentation and a final paper. This meant that there was absolutely no way to track your progress, learning, or grade in the course. Class discussion felt largely unstructured and unproductive. We would read upwards of 300 pages a week and end up essentially never referencing the text in the whole two hours which felt like a waste of energy and opportunity. The texts themselves were interesting, but we rarely dug into them in a meaningful way. Another problem with the course was that the final texts of the course were from the 1970s and were discussing issues regarding rivers (the rights of nature) that have changed dramatically since then, something we barely discussed. Ultimately, the class feels dated, static, and poorly organized. It could be improved by revitalizing the list of texts, assigning students a specific week to present so that their presentation would be more well thought out and planned, more opportunities to demonstrate learning throughout the course, and better structure of class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent in facilitating productive thought processes over a variety of topics relating to rivers - though not exclusively about its hydrology. I enjoyed that some weeks we talked more about the political science of rivers, and about dams and physical infrastructure around rivers in others. Though we did not have any indication of our performance in class till the finals, it helped keep to focus more on the week-to-week discussions and readings. However, the readings are a little heavy though Professor Scott helped us navigate them very well and I learnt a lot from the texts we read. "

            "\u00a0Take another class ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course that makes you question almost all of humanity's actions and the development of societies.  However the reading load is pretty heavy (one book a week), and some of the books do get a bit repetitive.  Be prepared to delve into rather philosophical discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible class. I would recommend this class to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0As it is, this course was my least favorite of my time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely take it. Professor Scott is a gem and so knowledgable and helpful. Definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting and Professor Scott has very interesting remarks. The books are all enjoyable to read but can be a lot to manage on a weekly basis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - learning from Professor Scott is a once in a lifetime opportunity and he really has some incredible stories to share!!!! ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend. The reading list was great, but the class itself very disappointing. I was so excited about this course at the beginning. My underlying expectation was that we would use rivers to talk about other thingsculture, land use, spatial politics, the environment, etc. However, this never happened. Instead, we talked about rivers, and only rivers. Scott was great, but as a teacher he controlled the classroom to such an extent that the conversation never (and I mean, NEVER) got off the ground. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. It was an onerous amount of reading each week for very little result. I do not feel that I am walking away from the class with anything I couldn't have gained by reading the texts on my own. It felt like a bad book club. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. It was an excellent course even if one has no prior experience with rivers or the politics of nature (as was my case). "
