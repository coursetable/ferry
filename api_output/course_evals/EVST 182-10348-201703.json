            "\u00a0I felt that I gained a basic understanding of some biological and evolutionary concepts in this course. I also learned about the actual discipline of Primatology and its history. ",
            "\u00a0In this course we leaned about the evolution of primate behaviors, primate anatomy, and primate social interactions. We also learned about fieldwork in the area of primatology, and of the methods employed to gather data. ",
            "\u00a0Evolutionary thinking, hypothesis formation ",
            "\u00a0I think this course taught me how complex and nuanced animal behavior and ecology can be. Also, I definitely gained an understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of primatology, and a pretty comprehensive understanding of primates and the systems they inhabit. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about primate diversity and behavior as well as new insights and understanding of evolution (behavioral evolution specifically). As a psych major, it was very interesting to be looking at these things from a more ecological perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class in my sophomore year, and I haven't done science since high school. This was a great course to learned how to read scientific papers and think through the lens of evolution and natural selection. My scientific reasoning skills increased. \r\n\r\nI also learned a lot about primate diversity and behavior. ",
            "\u00a0Good primer on biological anthropology, especially with a focus on natural selection. We also read a fair number of scholarly papers which was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about viewing behavior through an evolutionary lens. I also learned a good deal about the complex life cycles and factors effecting the lives of primates. This course was definitly a great way to introduce myself to primatology. ",

            "\u00a0I think that Eduardo is very passionate about primatology and this really shows through. He has an extensive body of research in the field and brings that experience to the classroom. He struggles, however, with organization and communication. I am very unsure how grades in the class worked as this process lacked transparent. The expectations of students in the class were even more obscure. While it was said at the beginning of the course that the material would be accessible to non-STEM majors, I found it very difficult to access the information and digest it. The class could really benefit from a clearer communication of expectations. ",
            "\u00a0The year I took this course it was advertised as a lecture but run more like a seminar. Since most of the students in the class seemed to be taking it for their science credit and were not engaged in the material poor Professor Eduardo was at a disadvantage. Some students willingly and actively participated, but others didn't, which made the dynamic awkward. \r\n\r\nAgain, I'll reiterate that Professor Eduardo is a passionate and funny professor and it was a pleasure to see someone so excited about their work. He started each class with a guided meditation which was amazing. ",
            "\u00a0Dr Fernandez Duque is an amazing professor. he is very knowledgeable in his field, and he is very well connected. This semester he hosted the Northeast Evolutionary Primatologist conference, and that was  good opportunity for students interested in research to meet other researchers and learn about their work. He is very well connected and cited in the field, and that is reflected in his work. One of the weaknesses would be that there is much to cover in a short period of class. in a sense this class may help introduce primatology, but it wont really satisfy the needs for someone who wants to pursue the field. ",
            "\u00a0Very involved, Eduardo expects a lot from us and I think if I had been willing to give it my experience would have been better ",
            "\u00a0This course started out as one of my favorite courses of the semester. However, it lost a lot of steam towards the middle of the semester, and became kind of a chore/not that enjoyable towards the end. I think this was due in large part to the increase in guest lectures/ absence of the professor in the latter half of the course, which made things hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a lecture, but is taught as a weird mix between lecture and seminar. Class participation is a large part of the grade, which I don't think is fair considering that classes are lectures and it was a big class it was hard to participate. The information we covered was interesting, but we moved a bit too slow. It also would have been nice to have a more comprehensive \"study guide\" of topics covered over the semester, because I'm finishing the class not completely sure of what I've learned. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of it was focused on learning and understanding which I definitely support. However, this philosophy did not transfer on the first exam. I think that if that is how the course is going to be structured then grading should NOT be that nit-picky if the student has proven that they understand the material and have explained it in a way that in class was told would be adequate.  I think there has to be continuity in class with the exam. The material on the exam was certainly fair but it was almost as if someone who had not been in the class all year was grading the first exam. (This seemed to be different on the second exam which I was grateful for. When it comes to grading I would follow that strategy whether that was the professor and the TF creating a grading key together or both of them grading the exam... something of that nature.) There was really no need for this class to be stressful if you were doing the work which ended up being the case quite frequently. As I said before I liked that the course was structured more around learning and understanding but the downside is that at the end of the day the students do need to take an exam and so sometimes its helpful to be slightly clearer on what you are looking for in a response. I think getting feedback on homework responses more often would have been beneficial as well so we would have an idea of how we were doing. I would also publish the same slides that were used in class instead of student versions only because sometimes slides with information would be skipped in class so we didn't have time to write them down but then those details would not be present on the student version even though we were told to look there.  I offer all of this as constructive criticism as I did generally enjoy the course.    \r\nThis course did have several strengths. It was great going to the Bronx Zoo and really getting to see first hand what we had been discussing all year (as far as primate behavior, sociality, and diversity). I also LOVED that we started class with meditation. I did enjoy that the class was centered around understanding and exploring different questions that arose because you could see how so much of what we were learning was connected. I think this would have been the PERFECT approach if we were writing a final paper as was originally planned. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is amazing. He is enthusiastic, caring, and flexible. \r\n\r\nThe second half of the course (behavior) was not structured as clearly as the first half (primate diversity). It would be beneficial to clarify the intention of the second half of the course as well as the format. ",
            "\u00a0To improve this course, it is imperative that the syllabus not be changed after reading period. The course originally had one exam and one paper, the latter of which was changed to an exam. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was great and I wouldn't change it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Eduardo is very passionate about the topic, and it shows. I felt he really made an effort to tailor his lectures an assignments to the class' level of understanding, and he's very accomodating to those of us with no background in biology or anthropology.\r\nWeaknesses: At times I felt this course covered so many different, yet similar, topics that it was possible to become confused if you were not following closely. Participation is very important, otherwise you may struggle to grasp ideas which are essential to future discussions. In addition, it was tough at times to understand what the assignments were. Somethings were posted on Canvas while others were relayed to us via messages, so at times I did not complete work in time because I did not even realize it was due. Also, the first midterm was rather difficult, although the final went much better. ",
            "\u00a0Maybe more focus also on humans rather than only primates. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting and not strenuous, although some reading is required. The meditation is great and Professor Duques is engaging, although was largely away the second half of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Before the first midterm, it felt like there wasn't a lot of structure to the course. Additionally, it felt like assignments were always changing and the participation scheme was very weird for a lecture class. The first exam was very harshly graded and it was really confusing how the extra credit question was going to be factored in making it very difficult to ascertain how one was performing in the class. In addition, this problem was exacerbated by the fact that all of the other assignments were also not graded till the very end of the semester making concerted improvement impossible. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Fernandez-Duque was very passionate and engaged with the material but it would have been helpful to be a little more organized and come exam time give us more straight forward answers to our questions. I know he wanted us to engage with the material without worrying about grades but that is hard to do when the TA is a very harsh grader. ",
            "\u00a0The open manner of the professor during lectures is a major strength of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Grading is a little ridiculous but great course material "

            "\u00a0Amazing class! Eduardo is a really engaging lecturer, and he really cares about his students. For science and non-science majors alike, you'll learn something and enjoy it. ",
            "\u00a0Unless they had a particular interest in the discipline, I would not recommend that another student take this course, especially if they are just looking for a science credit. The material is deceptively difficult to understand and there isn't much help. The grading is obscure and it is extremely hard to judge how you are doing in the class. And participation is way too central to doing well for a lecture class without a section. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in primates - yes! If not, don't really recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It may be difficult for some to wake up at 9am to get to the course, but it is definitely worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah monkeys are amazing ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed this course and I would recommend it. \r\n\r\nThe teaching style is a bit different, really meant to foster discussion and original thinking.\r\n\r\n I think its a little strange that Prof. Eduardo uploads a \"student\" version of the slides where a lot of information that was on the slide during class is no longer there. Sometimes the \"student\" versions of the power point only have the title on them. Prof. Eduardo likes for us to meditate each morning we're in class to help us relax, but quite honestly, it would help me relax more if he would just include all of the information on the powerpoint when he uploads it. \r\n\r\nIt is not impossible to do well on the course. I got a 76% on first exam and worked my way up to an A-. ",
            "\u00a0I do not think I would recommend this course, other than to fulfill a requirement. It was difficult to justify attending the lectures towards the end of the semester, especially given that the professor wasn't even there. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly wouldn't recommend this. Professor Fernandez-Duque was great, but he wanted very specific things for us that I could not figure out. He cared more about us learning how to think than learning the material, but then exams asked for specific concepts from readings....I was just confused as to what he wanted us to focus on. The meditation at the beginning of every class was great, but the classes that followed were often boring. ",
            "\u00a0You will learn a lot from this class that is very interesting even if you are not an ecology major. It is a good way to get a science credit that isn't your every day chem, bio and physics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students interested in E&EB or primates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Professor Fernandez-Duque is a great lecturer and it's evident that he has a passion for the material. He took us on a trip to the Bronx Zoo, and took time at each primate exhibit to relate what we were observing back to the class. He seems like a very nice person. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone. I was looking for a science credit but absolutely loved learning about primates, natural selection and behavior, and what these topics can tell us about humans. Eduardo was a very understanding, engaging, and positive professor, and this class has made me want to take more primatology classes at yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You really learn to see yourself and your environment in a completely different way. Plus, Eduardo is a lovely professor! ",
            "\u00a0Only if strictly interested in primates. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Interesting and fairly easy science credit ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a doable science credit, an introduction to field research and evolutionary bioology, or as a fun extra class. It is a good course and very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Do not take this course. It may seem fun at the beginning, but it is poorly structured, the exams are graded harshly and the professor and TF are poorly organized, making it a very unenjoyable experience. ",
            "\u00a0Good science credit if you need one. The professor is very nice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for anyone looking for a science thats enjoyable for both STEM and non-STEM majors, Id recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0No, as I said earlier the grading wasn't the best. The material was fun to learn, but wouldn't match up to exam material in a way that left me feeling comfortable with what I knew come exam day "
