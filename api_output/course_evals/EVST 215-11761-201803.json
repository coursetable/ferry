            "\u00a0How to structure a journalistic piece, how to report well, and how to engage the reader with clear explanations ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to write simple, effective stories on complex STEM topics in a way that makes them far more compelling for the general public, and therefore more worthwhile, than the more complicated writing you may be used to as a STEM major. Even if you are already a very good non-science report writer, this class will be valuable for you. Prof. Zimmer is a fantastic resource and really knows how to get at whatever writing problem you may have. The feedback is also very tailored to the individual, and there are ample office hours to get one-on-one feedback, even for just general questions on writing, with both the professor and TA. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write engaging stories about complex issues. I leaned how to find sources and pitch ideas. I learned nitty gritty details about journalism. I learned how to write more clearly and succinctly. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I got to develop not only my reporting skills, but also how to approach writing about complex scientific subjects in a readable, interesting way. After this course, I've gained confidence in reporting, structuring articles, and interviewing subjects. ",
            "\u00a0I got some practice writing about science-related topics for broader audiences, but honestly, I do not think I grew much as a writer from this class. I was really hopeful and eager about learning how to make my writing clearer and more engaging, but most of the comments I got from the professor were a bit confusing and did not help me develop and improve my own personal writing style. Overall, I did not develop many skills or insights from this class. I took an English 114 class at Yale in the past, and I learned a lot more during that class from that professor than I did in this class from this professor. This is all true despite the fact that I always seek to make the most of my classes and have so far learned quite a bit from the vast majority of my classes at Yale, so I was pretty disappointed with this class. ",
            "\u00a0I had never done this type of writing before. This is the only writing class I've taken at Yale (and I've take 14 with the WR designation) that I actually learned something new about writing at every class meeting. There were specific, applicable rules that we covered (focus on narrative over theme, avoid hypothetical questions, etc.) but also general skills that one needs to develop to do this type of writing. In short, I learned how to write journalistically. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great introduction to science journalism and what is required of a science journalist. "

            "\u00a0Much of the course's success depends on the engagement level of your peers. This semester, we were fortunate to have a cohesive group that were all invested in each other's works. ",
            "\u00a0The weaknesses of the course are that basically if you don't get high grades on the first assignments, its very difficult to bring your final grade up in the course (even though later assignment are worth more), just because there really are not that many grades over the semester.\r\n\r\nThe strengths of the course are some of your writing getting directed and analyzed by the entire class. Though this may seems nerve-racking at first, the feedback is incredibly supportive, understanding, and in the end quite constructive and beneficial to your writing. The chance to read all your classmates stories is also very enjoyable and interesting, since everyone comes from such diverse academic backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a great way to learn about science journalism from a prolific and accomplished expert. Carl pushed the class hard, and he had high expectations. At times, I felt like I needed to be a full-time journalist and a full-time student all at once. I haven't worked as hard for any of my other classes at Yale. But I learned from that challenge. I got to observe and interview interesting people doing interesting things. I got to write about fascinating and important topics. I got to read excellent examples of science journalism. And I got in-depth feedback from a pro. All in all, it was great class, despite the difficulty.\r\n\r\nAs a point of constructive feedback: the class time sometimes felt unstructured and underutilized. I think we would have benefited from having more organized lessons, in addition to the meandering discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I feel torn saying this, but I think that having one fewer long assignment would improve this class. Even though I got a head start on all of the reporting, it was hard to a) have enough time to write and b) have time to edit past submissions before the next one was due.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think stricture guidelines for the class presentations would be helpful. I didn't like that a lot of the students turned the presentations into posing questions to the class, and I think this wasted some time. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the workshops, which proved to be very helpful. I also loved reading other students' work, as well as the assigned reading (Silent Spring!). However, I sometimes wish we had more time to unpack some articles. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that students got to hear from popular professional science writers about what it is like to work in the field. This familiarized me with the process I would have to undergo to submit and publish an article. One weakness was that students were asked to get multiple books with advice on how to write about science, but the professor did not incorporate any readings from these books into the syllabus and into class discussions. Aside from the fact that I was upset about having purchased books that we never used, I think reading assignments from these books would have actually helped me improve my writing. In my last writing class at Yale, the professor picked some of the most useful chapters from writing technique books and assigned them, and this did help me see how exactly I could improve my writing. I really wish we had used the books more in this class and discussed some of the techniques during class sessions. Another aspect of the class I didn't like was that the readings the professor assigned did not help me improve my writing on class assignments. The readings he assigned were on big topics (e.g. Ebola, death, climate change, sea level rise, earthquakes, etc.), and the authors of those articles traveled across the country and the world to write incredible, sometimes dramatic stories about these catastrophic topics. On the other hand, because of our limited time and resources as college students, our story topics were much less dramatic, so it was very difficult to translate the techniques used in these articles to the articles we wrote for our class assignments. It would have been much more helpful if the syllabus included more articles on less dramatic topics so students could see how to write about complex scientific topics that are less dramatic in a way that engages readers. We read about two pieces by professional writers that were on less dramatic topics, but I felt like I needed more examples like these to find techniques that I could work into my writing. Therefore, on top of not getting a lot of instruction on writing techniques, the articles we read as examples of how to write were not really relevant for the types of topics we were writing about. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strengths are its rigor, unforgiving nature, and similarity to the real world in terms of publication standards. Those are also its weaknesses. This class demands exacting attention to detail, many many hours of work outside of the classroom, and allows zero margin for error. It will help you prepare for a career as a writer, if that's why you're taking it, and it will also completely take over your life and wreck your GPA. This wasn't an issue for me; I valued the rigor and experience. ",
            "\u00a0I think the professor could have done a little more introduction of the subject before asking students to do assignments. "

            "\u00a0Recommend for anyone in the science/environment sphere, not just budding journalists. Clear, engaging writing will serve you well in whatever field you pursue. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course would be valuable for anyone, no matter your writing level or major. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the course to any student who's willing to put in the work. It was a great way to learn about journalistic reporting, structured storytelling, and explaining complex topics. Taking this course was a highlight of my semester and my time at Yale. But doing the assignments well takes a lot of time. If you aren't willing to put in the time, then you won't get very much from the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The assignments were so much fun, the feedback was incredible, and learning from one of the top science writers in the world was surreal. I think my writing improved in between pieces, but I think editing them more now that the course is over and the pressure is off I will get even more out of it. Your writing will improve a lot! But be prepared to spend a lot of time organizing interviews. This is a hard course to do with a science/lab-heavy schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. I learned more from this course than from any other so far, and I believe I've come out of it a much stronger and more confident reporter and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student because, as it is now, it gives students weak, somewhat scattered instruction and advice on how to improve their writing. I explain this further in my other responses on this survey. ",
            "\u00a0This is the first English class I've taken at Yale that I can say that I DO NOT recommend. Professor Zimmer is an absolute treasure, and I learned more in this class than I did in any other class at Yale. It's an incredible experience that I'm glad I was given, and it is one of the best writing courses here. HOWEVER, it completely ruined my semester. The amount of work required is pretty astronomical. That's part of the appeal of the class; it asks the same of you that an editor at a newspaper or a magazine would, so it really prepares you for the real world. Additionally, Professor Zimmer is the harshest grader I've ever had. That is also part of the point of the class. He is exactly as forgiving in his assessment as an editor or supervisor would be...which is to say not at all. I absolutely love this about the class, but when you're so busy with one class and it takes up all the time you set aside for your academic work, your other classes begin to suffer because of it. DO NOT take this class if you have a 4.0 GPA and wish to maintain it. I am not very interested in my grades, but it still hurt a bit watching this awesome, exciting class slowly chip away at that number. Essentially, I can only recommend this class if you do not mind doing many hours of work a week for it, putting yourself WAY outside your comfort zone, and/or if you are only taking easy classes aside from this one. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student, but I would warn them that its extremely time consuming. "
