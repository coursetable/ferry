I was trying to learn physics that I had never seen before for the laband the prelabs were written poorly so I had to go on other websites (Wikipedia!) to learn things. Also bad: we were expected to know how to use the equipment without being taught anything, which made the final extremely stressful. Also bad: the TAs didn't know how the labs worked either; they would try to ask the professor during our lab if we had questions. Overall one of the worst classes, probably the worst experience, I've had at Yale. ",

We never learned how to draw lens diagrams in class and had to figure it out as we went in lab. Little things like that. Frustrating ",
            "\u00a0I like that the lab handouts are pretty well-written and that the lab reports are limited to one page. I wish the time commitment was a little more consistentsome labs took the full three hours, while others were more like an hour or an hour and a half. If all of the lab sessions could be a consistent two hours that would be awesome. I also wish the grading rubric for the lab reports were published. The merging black holes section of lab 4 was confusing, and I felt like the TAs didn't have good explanations for all the behaviors we observed in the RC circuits, Harvey, and induction labs. ",

Some of the labs felt like they did not correspond at all with the lecture (optics for example) and I sensed that they were thrown in because the instructors had run out of relevant labs, so I would recommend reviewing those. ",
            "\u00a0Some labs (especially the optics labs) were just confusing and even the TAs didn't understand certain concepts even to a basic degree. It was just a weird aggregation of topics thrown together. ",
            "\u00a0I think that all of the assigned work was reasonable and useful. There were a few weeks when the lab was crazy long, so maybe splitting some weeks up and combining others would avoid those high-stress days. ",
            "\u00a0I like the idea of the course and the concepts taught. In practice, however, the lab sessions could be really messy and chaotic, and in general, the course didn't feel well-organized to me. Students weren't necessarily prepared for the final either---ostensibly, the weekly labs are meant to help students prepare, but it didn't really feel that way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths, hands on experience. Weakness: labs don't need to be as long certain weeks...felt like just busy work. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be improved by tying in more cohesively with the lecture class.  For example, doing labs with inductors after they are covered in PHYS 181 would have been nice.  Also, the lab on optics did not relate to anything we had learned in lecture, and instead we had to learn the concepts in the lab from scratch by reading the prelab.\r\nOverall, though, the class is fair and the TAs were very helpful with any problems that arose. ",
            "\u00a0The labs are pretty tedious and the lab handouts can be very dense. ",

Time crunch final is a poor indication of your knowledge level and really stressful for no reason. Grading is super arbitrary and depends on the TA. \r\n\r\nReducing the number of tasks (every lab and on the final) would HUGELY improve this class. We'd learn more and be less stressed out. Please! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well aligned with 181 topics, labs were interesting and relevant. Weaknesses: labs often felt rushed which made it hard to actually understand them, some labs were not well explained before doing them ",
            "\u00a0One big weakness of this course is that the topics covered rarely correlate with what we are being taught in physics lecture. As a result, we often cover advanced topics in physics lab before we learn about them in lecture. This makes the labs very difficult to understand and puts much more work on the TAs who end up having to explain these concepts to the students during lab. Also, the students would get much more out of the lab if we did labs on concepts we had already covered in class. As is, people often do the labs without actually understanding the concepts behind them since it is their first time being exposed to the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The topics of these labs were much more interesting than Physics 165L, which kept students more engaged. The lab handouts usually provided clear instructions for students as well. However, often times we had not learned about the lab topics in our lectures. This made the labs quite frustrating at times when we were asked specific questions about topics we did not know much about. Additionally, topics like optics were never covered in lecture and seemed like they came out of nowhere. ",
            "\u00a0The labs were varied and interesting, and it was a good refresher of many physics concepts. However, I sometimes felt very rushed, and other time the labs were very short. It was occasionally hard to predict how to budget time in the lab. ",
            "\u00a0The class was good in that it covered a wide variety of physics material and was set up so it was easy to prepare for the lab before hand by reading the handouts that guide us through the experiment. It can be improved by making the lengths more consistent as some labs take longer than 3 hours while some others are less than an hour long. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: you learn how to use all the tools well, the final itself is well structured\r\nWeaknesses: Most labs in the course packet are too long, trying to teach too many subjects as opposed to focusing on one main technique or topic. Labs themselves should be shortened and made more concise so that students actually take away a key concept. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured very well. There are no surprises week-in and week-out which is definitely nice. I think the labs could sometimes be a little bit shorter, especially considering the labs on the final exam are (a) one hour long and (b) time-sensitive. ",
            "\u00a0No noticible strengths or weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good organization and labs were all designed to be completed within the 3-hour slot, which I appreciated. Lab reports had reasonable expectations.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The one lab using the breadboards and related electronic equipment was hard to grasp because most students had never used that device before and it was never covered in other settings except for a brief introduction in the lab handout, so a more thorough background would be appreciated (or at least more time to read up on the concept before lab). However, the majority of the labs covered concepts we were familiar with, thus strengthening our conceptual knowledge with concrete experiments. So, overall this was a good course. ",
            "\u00a0There are pretty much no strengths to this course. However, weaknesses include TAs who didn't prepare for teaching labs/didn't want to be there, lab handouts that didn't actually provide any useful information for the lab, and many more. ",
            "\u00a0There really needs to be SOME method of standardization of the grading between sections. Really so much of your grade in this class depends on how hard or easy of a grader your TA is, which I don't think is very fair. ",
            "\u00a0Not a particularly intellectually interesting course. I wish it aligned more with the material covered in the physics lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- definitely a course that taught me a lot about different applications of physics in the real world through the labs. \r\nWeaknesses -- there is definitely a lack of preparation for the final exam given that we work every week with a partner on a lab that is three hours long and then get thrust into the final that is done individually, with three experiments in three hours. There is a final preparation in the sense that they put out three past questions that you can come in and see before the final to give you an idea of what type of questions will be on there -- but it just isn't enough preparation. ",
            "\u00a0My TA this semester was great, but I again feel like physics lab was just a waste of my time. The labs were quite monotonous and often boring. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Cool experiments \r\nWeaknesses: Many instances of poor wording in the lab manuals. The experiments did not match well with the lectures (at least in 181). Circuits come up in the middle of the semester for 181 and these is the first topic that we cover in the labs. It got confusing conceptually. ",
            "\u00a0It is good to take this in conjunction with Physics 180 because it helps solidify some of the concepts you learn in class. I don't know how much physics knowledge I gained from this course, but the labs were usually pretty interesting and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent in its introduction to practical usage of electronic and magnetic equipment and phenomena, as well as its ability to expose me to novel concepts related to these topics in the course of my research for lab reports.  It was  hindered, however, by experiments that were either confusing or mistakenly put together.  Engagement with the course would be smoothed and heightened with insurance that all labs are typed and laid out clearly and in a manner that does not require the TA to come around and explain to individual groups what is being asked of them ",
            "\u00a0The course is fine once you get the hang of it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that it was well organized, and the professors and TAs were dedicated. ",
            "\u00a0This course was boring yet hard based on nit picky grading. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: so much easier than PHYS 165 because we don't have to do uncertainty calculations and the data collection is so much easier, my TA became way more chill this semester, I actually learned about a lot of important electricity and magnetism concepts and I'm a premed\r\nweaknesses: the final is kinda scary because it's such a huge part of your grade ",
            "\u00a0This course was very structured. The writing in some of the experiment guides was a bit confusing, sometimes typos or mistakes would impede my understanding / ability to complete the experiment efficiently. Our TA was a definite strength, quickly pinpointing any inconsistencies and guiding our progress. ",
            "\u00a0The instructors that I encountered were all good and the workload expectation was very reasonable. My greatest criticism is that sometimes the labs just expected way too much preliminary physics knowledge or other knowledge which students just wouldn't have in their first year of physics classes. If the labs were over some more basic topics that tied more closely into the 180-181 curriculum then that would have been very helpful. For instance, there was a lab over logic gates in circuits, which is nowhere to be found in 180-181 and was completely unnecessary. ",

I will say that some of the experiments were boring or kind of redundant, so I didn't feel like I learned that much during those particular days in lab. There were also some topics that lab covered that students in Physics 181 never learned, so the course could have been more general to apply to both Physics 171 and 181, rather than focusing more on 171 material. ",
            "\u00a0The material never matched up with what we learned in class so I never had any idea what was going on in lab.

It does not test one's mastery over the topics throughout the semester but rather tests one's ability to perform under a highly stressful environment. you get 55 minutes to do an experiment that could go wrong for a myriad of reasons that don't test your ability in physics but your Luck. A computer error could be the reason you do terrible (and was so for many people I know), and this is simply a ridiculous and poor measure of one's physics abilities. The professor's need to seriously reconsider what their values here are and how they want to teach. The TA's for this course work so hard to teach PHYSICS throughout the semester and for the knowledge that was transmitted throughout the semester to be so poorly tested is almost disrespectful. Do better for the sake of the future students PLEASE. ",

Often, we would do things in the lab (i.e capacitors and magnets) that we wouldn't cover in class until 6 weeks after the lab. So most of the time, the students are just in lab with no idea of what was going on. In addition, there were topics covered such as optics and digital logic that were completely irrelevant to the 180 curriculum meaning we never covered it. Overall, this makes it so that students are often just in lab with no idea of what they're doing and rushing through so they can get out as soon as possible. ",

The labs in the middle of the course came ahead of the lecture and were extremely difficult for everyone. All the students in my section practically relied on our TA, asking him for each explanation question. The last labs were not taught at all in the course, but all the information was given in the packets. Thus, it would help to switch the order a bit. ",

The primary weakness is that the class only has a single exam that basically determines our entire grade, which is high-stakes to say the least; having a midterm in addition might be nice. The errors in the lab handouts were also pretty annoying at times, especially the one on page 5 of lab 3, where the formula for a triangular wave was completely butchered (I wasted a lot of time trying to figure it out); it'd be nice for someone to proofread all of the handouts again before re-distribution next year. Lastly, a few of the labs were quite long, given that we only had 3 hours (often closer to 2.5 after the quiz and pre-lab lecture). ",

Other than that, the class was really stressful, and I'm glad I had it early on in the week so I could get it over with. I spent so much time on the lab reports for this class that the workload went well above a half credit, and yet my TA always found nitpicky things to take points off on. Don't even get me started about insight points: its basically an open invitation for TAs to grade subjectively depending on whether they like you or not. And the final exam was the most stressful exam I had this semester, despite taking a heavy courseload of six classes. The final exam places a completely unreasonable amount of stress on students, and tests us on concepts we didn't learn in the semester. The final exam should either be completely scrapped or at least replaced with a less daunting exam. And finally, it's pretty ridiculous that the same exam is given to students Monday-Friday; course instructors must know that by later in the week many students have a good idea of the three different experiments, and this poses a significant disadvantage to students on earlier lab days.

The lab reports and that system were fair, even though it is impossible to get insight points. The final exam is also wild, because I do not understand what skill it is assessing. Being able to do the experiments is important, but under that time pressure is ridiculous. ",

",
            "\u00a0A weakness in this class was that the content of the labs often did not match what we had learned in lecture. This made it difficult to follow along during lab, and I often felt like I was just going through the lab steps without really understanding the underlying physics of what the experiment was doing. A suggestion would be to match the lab experiments up more closely with what is being learned in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the course handouts for each lab are quite detailed and informative, and that the course instructors (for my lab section, Professor Ramos) walk around during the lab sessions and are very available to help students work through questions. I also think the structure of the course works well, in which students prepare for each lab session by reading the handouts, are held accountable for doing so by the weekly quizzes, record what they do during the lab sessions, and reflect on/analyze the work done in lab with the weekly lab reports. The greatest weakness is that sometimes the course seems to throw new material at students without thoroughly explaining it, which leads to frustration among students because they don't understand what they're doing. It does not help that the individual topics are usually covered in lab earlier than they are covered in the physics lecture course, at least for 181. ",
            "\u00a0It's very TA dependent, so it's hard to say. A midterm like in PHYS 165L would have been nice, as it currently feels like there's a lot of weight placed on the final, but not a lot of preparation for it. ",

They were written, quite frankly, like high school lab reports by a student who didn't know physics. Most of the information in those modules could have been taken out, and the important information was written in such a way that students couldn't understand without getting help from the TA (who often had trouble understanding the module as well). The directions never made sense, and often were hidden in the convoluted language of the module. Also, the lab should definitely have been at least from 1:30-5pm since the lab often went longer due to confusion over the notes and the labs took longer than they should have. For some of the labs, my TA often waived the last part of the lab due to confusion as to what was wanted and lack of time. ",

I thought it was just a physics 171 problem, but I talked to friends in 181, and they experienced the same issues. For example, we did a lab about induction of magnetic fields before I had even learned what a magnetic field or magnetic flux were. This made it really frustrating, and my TA didn't seem to realize that we were seeing this material for the first time and then being asked to apply it. I would hope that next year, the curricula of the lecture course and the lab course will match up more coherently. This made every lab a struggle to get through, and I found myself just trying to find a way to finish instead of actually trying to learn the concepts (because it seemed impossible in this setting).

Pretty enjoyable overall for me actually. There wasn't a lot of intellectual challenge, more like just a chill way to reinforce concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you need it. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this class to another student. Unless it's a pre-req, don't take it. ",

            "\u00a0you definitely should only take this if required ",
            "\u00a0I don't think many people take physics lab for fun, and I cannot say that it was the highlight of my week. The quality of the lab handouts, compared to other general science lab courses (such as chemistry!) is severely lacking. I was in the Wednesday lab and every single Tuesday, nearly without fail, an email would get sent out with corrections of mistakes that had been found during the Monday lab session. Even after corrections, the lab handout often had unclear wording/instructions, and was overall not well written or clear. \r\n\r\nThe reports that we were expected to write were essentially pointless and I think could use more structure or a more specific formatting.\r\n\r\nThe strength of this course is definitely in that the material is relatively interesting and very few labs were unreasonably tedious or stressful. Usually the lab was done well before the designated end time, so in general this is not the most stressful lab you could take. It is not bad. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course, you're probably doing this because you have to. Best way to get through this is to sign up for the same section as friends and get through this together. ",
            "\u00a0No. Only take it if you have to. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if they need a physics lab requirement. The TAs are very nice and the class is structured in a way that it is low-stress for most of the semester, until you get to the final. ",

            "\u00a0Yeah. Great introduction to doing labs. Much preferred over the harder lab. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you need to - if not, it's pretty tedious and not very interesting, but not very challenging either. ",
            "\u00a0Take it only if you have to. It is the worst part of every week. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was amazing, and I really didn't expect to like it so much. So I would recommend you approach it without prejudice - this is actually a very cool intro-lab, unlike some other intro-level labs. "
