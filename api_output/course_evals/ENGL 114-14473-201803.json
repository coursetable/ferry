            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH from this class, and came away from it a much better writer. I was debating taking 114 or 120 early in the semester. I am a confident writer, and assumed I wouldn't need to take 114, but my FROCO urged me otherwise and I chose to take this class with Prof Riley. Boy, I am so happy I did. I left high school hating critical writing, thinking that it did not leave any room for creativity. What I learned in 114 is that great analytical writing is quite possibly the most creative writing you can do. It takes skill to write a great personal essay (like you do in 120), but it takes a whole lot more to write a great analytical essay.\r\n\r\nI came away from this class with a working vocabulary around objectivity, truth, fact, and responsibility. I will take what I learned in this class and apply it to many, many of my future classes, not just English classes. ",
            "\u00a0The meaning and importance of words like truth, facts, objectivity, and impartiality in the context of philosophy, politics, and journalism. ",
            "\u00a0This course will be foundational for the rest of my college education and likely the rest of my life. Although it is an English class, it felt more like a seminar on truth that happened to have a writing component. My writing certainly improved, but my greatest learning was regarding the topic of the course itself. We discussed truth, facts, objectivity, and their existence and relationship to one another. It has given my a great deal to consider as I navigate the rest of my college experience, both in and outside the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that every word you write counts, which helped me fine tune and make my writing more meaningful. This class also helped me figure out how to organize my ideas in a paper. ",
            "\u00a0From the moment I stepped into Professor Riley's course, I knew it would be a semester of change and learning, for starters I didn't have a clear understanding of objectivity, which changed the first class during reading period. Professor Riley taught me how to be a better writer overall, and even when you think you're done, you're never quite finished. There was never a point in the class where I was nervous to talk to Professor Riley, or ask for help. Professor Riley has been the most understanding and thoughtful professor I have had this first semester and I am ever so thankful. Not only did I learn how to become a better writer, I learned how to become a better student in general. ",

            "\u00a0Strength: great readings, interesting conversation topic, EXCELLENT professor. Riley is truly what made this class for me. I can't recommend her more as a professor. Weaknesses: I happened to be in a section in which the average level of engagement of my classmates did not match my own. I often came to class excited to discuss last night's homework, finding that a solid majority of my peers had not done the reading. This is not the fault of the class in it of itself, but perhaps Riley could have done more to ensure students were actually engaging with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and the discussions, although it is difficult to truly answer any of the questions in the course description due to their philosophical nature. Prof. Riley gives amazing detailed feedback on essays, and really knows how to help you improve your writing. Personally, I think the course could be improved if we spent less time on peer essay workshops, but I know some people found them helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was remarkably strong overall. My only suggestion would be to consider reordering the texts to provide some earlier context for our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think all the feedback that I was given from both my professor and my peers was incredibly helpful and allowed me to see the flaws in my writing that I hadn't seen before. Maybe there could have been more peer reviewing, such as having every paper reviewed by a small group of my peers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths would be the material was interesting, but the material is also the weakness because it is hard to learn and understand. Under the great conditions of time, willingness, and intrigue it is manageable to learn and understand the magnificent philosophers we read throughout the semester. I think this class should have a rubric for the grading and more information on the writing prompts. "

            "\u00a0YES, absolutely. I think this was the best section of 114 out there. We learned to write critically and analytically, but also examined some of the most important issues of our time. I will never be able to look at the words Truth, Objectivity, or Fact in the same way. I highly recommend this class, and any other class the Riley may teach. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you are interested in philosophy, politics, and/or journalism. It's a great writing course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely -- my writing improved a lot, but the course was more of a philosophical and introspective experience than anything else, and forced me to ask tough questions that don't have clear answers. In such an intellectually challenging place, I think it's incredibly important to have these kinds of conversations early on and to take a look at the underlying assumptions that guide our actions and discourse. I could easily continue with this course for another semester -- I've learned and grown so much by taking it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I really enjoyed this class and thought it taught me a lot about writing and about truth and objectivity (not that I fully have a grasp on those concepts yet). ",
            "\u00a0From each paper, I could see my writing improve in the matter of weeks. This improvement in addition to the critical thinking required from our readings create an environment for academic strength that cannot be taken away. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
