            "\u00a0I learned about various painters and painting styles and used them to improve my own watercolor paintings. In addition, I also learned to write about this form of painting. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the abilities to paint outdoors, to evaluate art and to relate art to other areas of my life. I also learned about the life of a professional painter, and I learned about the variety of techniques that you can apply to watercolor. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me the basics about watercolor and its long history ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use wartercolor. i also developed a new appreciation for light and color, and for beautiful art in general. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate watercolors, make a watercolor, and write about various experiences related to the art of watercolor. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how beautiful watercolor can be, that is unforgiving yet rewarding, and that being messy is sometimes better than being exact. ",
            "\u00a0You dont actually learn much from the actual lectures, but you do gain insights to different techniques from past watercolorists and from the numerous paintings you do. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be creative and techniques in the art of watercolor. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a variety of techniques, as well as history, of watercolor artists through a combination of lecture, critique, and hands on practice. "

            "\u00a0Some strengths were the professors push for an active class and our museum visits. The only thing improvement would be the time spent on the slide shows looking at different paintings. They went on for a little too long. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the emphasis on painting as an interdisciplinary skill, but one downside I would say would be less emphasis on the classical techniques of painting. ",
            "\u00a0I love how this course gave you freedom to paint and write about whatever you like. I wish there would have been some type of rubric for the essays. ",
            "\u00a0the class was very interesting, and being able to work with paints hands on certaily helped me to engage. ",
            "\u00a0Getting to visit the YUAG and Center for British Art and actually see watercolors that we talked about in class was very rewarding.  Also, the experience of actually doing watercolors and having them critiqued and evaluated in front of you was a good learning opportunity.  I feel like sometimes students can get behind on their work just due to a lack of personal timeliness but Professor Van Doren could help by checking in and making sure everyone is caught up. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of freedom to express but not enough supportive/helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the class was structured more towards learning the different techniques by doing them step by step rather than looking at paintings and talking about them. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very well prepared for, making sure everyone had access to the same level of materials, which was great. However, there was so much packed into each meeting period because we only met once a week. Half the time would be lecture styles, teaching about the masters, which the other half crammed in a painting session which we rarely ever finished. The class could have been improved by meeting twice a week, maybe for an hour the first time and three hours the second dedicated purely to painting. This class was also a little learning on your own too. Whenever we talked about techniques, we didn't really immediately practice them. It was up to yourself to practice techniques on your own or to apply them to paintings. ",
            "\u00a0You're given many resources to work with and given the opportunity to paint all over campus. But, sometimes the weather is not so favorable during class (it became very cold and the sun would set while we were painting). "

            "\u00a0It was a fun class. We got to write essays about art, we got to meet different artists, we had curated gallery trips at art museums and the professor was hilarious. ",
            "\u00a0No. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would, but only if they are dedicated to producing art consistently. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If youre really into painting I think this course would be a good fit! ",
            "\u00a0maybe. if youre excitedx to do art, yes. otherwise, no. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would!  It's a good course to get away from a STEM-heavy semester and it gives you an opportunity to relax and watercolor while still learning useful life skills. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if you like to paint and dont mind spending a few hours each week. I wouldnt take this class if you have bad time management. Painting ten pieces a week towards the end of the semester isnt all that fun especially if youre taking hard classes in addition. Also, the papers for this class are doable, but the professor expects quality, higy analytical content in order to receive an A. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class because it was great fun and a lot. Watercolor is a medium that you can make as simple or challenging as you would like to. This course is also a great excuse to be creative as take a break from problem sets because the homework every week is literally to paint and create something. "
