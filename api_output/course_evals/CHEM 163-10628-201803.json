This class completely changed my outlook on chemistry and I cant wait to continue taking chem courses in the following semesters. Professor Mayer loves the subject and that really came through in his teaching. I like how the lectures were short but frequent (3/week), and structure of the course (amazing professor, great TAs, and peer tutors) meant that I had a support system that allowed me to seek help. I worked really hard in the class but didnt even do well relative to other people but that doesnt even matter to me! I walked away from the course having learned so much and feeling very content, and cant wait to challenge myself in the coming semesters. Professor Mayer truly made this class. ",

Much more interesting and stinulating than AP chem. I now have a deep appreciation for how powerful quantum mechanics is in describing molecular shape, bonding, and predicting the color of materials. ",

I learned how to apply simple scientific understanding to complex questions and think critically about scientific issues. ",
            "\u00a0This course broadened my knowledge of the topics chemistry is involved in. After taking AP Chemistry in high school, I thought chemistry was somewhat math based and that it revolved around reactions. However, after taking this course I can see that there is so much more to chemistry that I still don't know. ",

Dr. Mayer gives wonderful advice, and honestly that was one of the most valuable parts of the class. ",

Since Professor Mayer focused on a conceptual view of the class, it gave me an understanding of how and why things happened, rather than just memorizing facts. Additionally, Mayer introduces concepts that will show up in later, more advanced chemistry courses, with the mindset that students who continue in chemistry will find those courses easier, and those who don't should still be exposed to the concepts. ",

It was taught in a way that forced us to be creative in the way we thought about science, and I firmly believe that these skills will prove helpful in my future coursework. I also learned a LOT about chemistry that was far behind my high school curriculum. I thought Id received a thorough chemistry education through the IB program in high school, but I was so pleasantly surprised  by how much incredible knowledge was still out there to discover! ",

            "\u00a0Attained a solid understanding of the quantum mechanics of orbital theory and its application to organic and inorganic chemistry. Mayer did a fantastic job of pushing our experienced class intellectually while also guiding us through new and peculiar topics. I additionally learned how to critically think and work through some of Mayer's nebulous questions on both psets and examinations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper knowledge of chemistry and learned topics that extended beyond what I learned in AP chemistry. I would say almost every topic we learned I had no previous knowledge of. I learned how to connect topics and ideas between units. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught a lot of material that would serve as good background knowledge to have going into upper-level chemistry courses. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that you need a lot of prior knowledge regarding Quantum Mechanics, Organic Chemistry, and Transitional Metals. This course does not teach general chemistry. Rather, it teaches the three topics mentioned above in a fast and unorganized manner that leaves a student with a scattered understanding of each concept. The questions on the tests do not reflect an individuals comprehension of the general material, but rather an individuals comprehension of very specific facts that are not relevant in the bigger picture of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about chemistry more conceptually and thematically (e.g. bigger picture) rather than be boggled down by math questions like in high school chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely learned how to better apply my knowledge about chemistry to more conceptual and broad problems. Extending my knowledge of chemistry past the plug and chug type problems of high school was interesting and no doubt helped to develop new skills. ",
            "\u00a0There are three units: quantum, organic, and inorganic. This is really nothing like AP chemistry, there is almost no calculation or math in this course (except sometimes for the Sapling). You really get to focus on the conceptual stuff, and learn how to think analytically (like applying equations and what they mean instead of blindly doing plug and chug). ",
            "\u00a0Basic thought processes to effectively navigate scientific questions. ",
            "\u00a0I developed understandings of different part of chemistry that were relatively shallow themselves, but they gave me the tools and preliminary knowledge to dive deeper into each part of chemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of quantum mechanics, organic chem, and transition metals. In high school, I always wondered about the exceptions to the rules of Chemistry my teacher taught me and Chem 163 adequately addressed those concerns. ",
            "\u00a0A much deeper understanding of Chemistry and how everything connects. Attained a brief introduction to the branches of Chem. Much better than Chem 161 if you are looking to learn Chemistry at a deeper level. Memorization is a very small part of this, believe it or not. ",
            "\u00a0CHEM 163 has been one of the most intellectually stimulating academic experiences I have had in my life. The course did not only focus educating the students on fundamental concepts of chemistry, but also it wanted to introduce the students to a conceptual, comprehensive understanding of the workings of science. The course provided me with skills on critical thinking and analysis of information, as it prompted me to utilize the knowledge I had gained in class to solve challenging problems in the problem sets distributed. Furthermore, the class had as its core aim to make students understand the underlying foundations of chemistry and not purely memorize chemical facts and equations. This aspect of the course was, for me, the most interesting one, as I got to answer all those questions that high school chemistry had left unanswered. The course was very well structured, and this structure allowed the students to build on each one of the concepts to acquire a holistic understanding of the foundations of chemistry. The great depth at which the course went when explaining various concepts may have been hard at times, but it certainly contributed to the student's gaining of the a very comprehensive picture of the concepts explained. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an intuition of how to approach the subject of basic general chemistry (the structure of atoms all the way to electrons within wavefunctions, and how those structures affect bonding and structures). I also learned to use some of that chemical intuition (particularly around Molecular Orbital Theory) to approach basic organic chemistry. To predict properties of atomic or molecular bonds, I used a large number of different mental models. I also delved into some of the physical reasons behind those models. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new, profound perspective of chemistry that very well complemented what I had learned in AP Chem. Instead of training myself to solve a specific type of problem or perform a specific type of calculation through memorization, I was able to think critically and apply the information from lectures/textbook to difficult (and weird) problems that I would have not been able to answer with basic AP Chem knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I was exposed to topics not normally covered in gen chem, including organic chemistry, which I found very interesting and engaging. I also learned a lot about the real-world applications and implications of the material we were covering even in basic chemistry, which was very useful and exciting to think about. ",
            "\u00a0Lots and lots of very interesting facts about quantum chemistry, a good solid base summary of organic chemistry, inorganic metallic chemistry, and a bit of  band theory. Really made me think about the intersection of various fields with chemistry, such as especially physics, nanoscience, and biology. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing in giving me both an understanding of general chemistry as well as providing very useful information about the complexity of chemistry. It also provided insights on real world examples that were necessary to discus in today's world. ",
            "\u00a0This course really challenged me to synthesize everything I've learned about chemistry thus far. It is not an easy course at all. You do not review chemistry basics; instead, you dive into complex topics that call upon what you already know to understand new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0SO MUCH KNOWLEDGE about how atoms work. I seriously increased my understanding of atomic and molecular level chemistry, and it has really enlightened me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I loved it, and I have only ever taken one chemistry course in my life (a very basic high school class, 5 years ago). It covers all material, even though it says AP Chem or an equivalent chemistry background is required, a basic knowledge of physics, or even just a strong desire and willingness to learn content is enough to learn everything this course covers. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Mayer! \r\nWeaknesses: The Saplings were a bit of a disconnect from the entire course. Also, Oxtoby was too dense of a read for this course, and if you're trying to learn all the material through the textbook, it'll be a large consumption of your time that might be a waste, anyway, because Oxtoby was often unclear about topics. Also, the lectures for the course often ran out of time, leaving some things unanswered that might be needed for psets or exams, but usually the TFs and Discussion Sections covered the rest. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-\r\n- Taught me to \"think like a chemist\" and not just memorize information\r\n- Taught me the science behind much of the common knowledge about chemistry\r\n- Very engaging and interesting\r\n- There is a lot of help available\r\n\r\nWeaknesses-\r\n- Sapling problems often did not apply to course material or went into unnecessary detail\r\n- Psets were \"flipped\" (learned material after doing problem sets) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Topics are fresh and interesting\r\n-TAs and Peer Tutors \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n-Lectures could be confusing\r\n-Not enough time was spent on band theory and bonding in solids ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the peer tutors were very nice and helpful; discussion section with Apala was great; Mayer cared for the students and wrote tests that reflected the material well. Weakness: sometimes lecture was unorganized. A more structured lecture may help the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was good at introducing students to a number of topics that are usually either not covered or are breezed over in high school and introductory chemistry. I think the selection of topics may at times be disjointed, and are as a whole not entirely cohesive (especially the organic chemistry unit in the middle of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The course fits together very well and progresses in a logical manner. The professor puts a great deal of care into the course flow. However, the topics covered in the course are not typical \"general chemistry,\" which could disadvantage pre-med students who will need these topics on the MCAT. A second weakness is that the problem sets sometimes didn't correspond well with the pace of the course and that the Sapling math problems did not match the course (which is conceptual, not mathematical). Lastly, I'm not sure why the lectures are recorded because the recording quality is very low and only captures half the room. This should be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Some exam questions do not reflect one's knowledge of content learned in class but instead reflect one's ability to think (or make cognitive jumps) in a similar manner to the instructor. Some exam questions that are multiple choice should be free response instead because a rational, logical argument can be built for multiple choices, all being consistent (to an extent) with information given in class. While there is a single correct answer to such questions, the questions are poorly written and seem to emphasize that there is only one way of considering a complex problem, when in reality, there are many reasonable ways (only one of which happens to actually occur). Other problems on exams are so remotely related to in-class discussion that they are effectively testing problem solving ability and general knowledge of chemistry and physics, not if the student has learned information in class. The above issues are only relevant to a minority of test problems, but it is certainly a significant issue in the class.\r\n\r\nDespite these weaknesses, the course is interesting and informative. ",
            "\u00a0There is a whole host of people there to help you make the grades you want in this class. ",
            "\u00a0I think one strength of this course is that Professor Mayer really cares about if people are understanding the material and how they are doing in the class.  I also think we learned a lot about parts of chemistry that aren't taught as often.\r\nI think one issue was that the course often felt disorganized.  We would sometimes have P-set questions that we hadn't learned about yet in class, and we learned things in a roundabout way a lot of the time.  It was hard to outline and study for the final because it was difficult to know what was important and what was not.  Also, we would often learn the most important part of a section of the course right before the midterm (two days before or the day of), which made it difficult to study. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could move faster. We didn't cover as much material as I think we could have. Partially this is because Prof. Mayer intentionally moves at a reasonable pace to cover material in-depth, so it's not a bad thing. For my taste, I would have loved to have sped things up a bit. ",
            "\u00a0No improvements. Only small thing I would say is that I wish the curriculum lined up better with 134 lab, and that the review sessions were in the CTL. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion sections are very helpful and valuable, and the professor is amazing. I wish the practice exams were the same difficulty level as the actual one. Also, I wish we had a better understanding of how all the topics connected. The first unit seemed very daunting but by the end I was able to understand it and see how everything came together. The first unit needs the most work in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0At times, the problem sets were ahead of the lectures which was frustrating. Overall, the lecturing was good and the expectations of our knowledge were pretty reasonable in that lectures would hit main topics multiple times so the emphases were pretty clear. Another strength was Prof Mayers excitement/application of the material. Another weakness was the minutia of some of the physics, especially diving into that as the first unit; it ends up okay but is definitely disarming at first. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You meet other people who are interested in taking chemistry, particularly prospective premedical students. You also get connected with great resources like peer tutors and teaching fellows.\r\n\r\nWeakness: It is hard to stay engaged in lecture. Furthermore, I feel like I learned more chemistry outside of lecture than inside it. ",
            "\u00a0At times we rushed through topics and I was left to try to learn and understand the material on my own, but Prof. Mayer is a great professor and he really wants us to understand how everything ties together. I thought that the material was fascinating (although conceptually difficult), and the TFs and pper tutors were a massive help. ",
            "\u00a0Although this is an intro course Prof. Mayer really wants his students to understand all of the concepts on a pretty deep level which is great. Everything about the course is conceptual meaning students dont waste time plugging numbers into formulas. That said there were many points in the course where it felt impossible to answer pset questions well because Prof. Mayer had not addressed the topic well enough in lecture. There were points where lectures were our of synch with psets which meant students had to do a lot of extra reading. I also felt that sometimes lectures werent as efficient as they could have been and we only got to the really important concepts of a unit towards the end of the hour when time was running out. Thankfully Things not addressed clearly in lecture were usually addressed in TF section. Be prepared for a good amount of extra reading and visits to peer tutors or office hours. I didnt mind this because i found the material to be really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a good job of developing a depth of understanding in the areas of chemistry studied, but struggles in stringing these concepts together until the very end of the course. I wish that connections could've been made earlier in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course was designed really well. The only criticism I have is that I didn't really use the oxtoby textbook. I found the Ellis and McMurray chapters that Professor Mayer provided really helpful, but for me personally I found oxtoby too hard to read and follow. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was definitely the discussion sections and peer tutors. Both really helped me solidify concepts learned in class. One weakness was that sometimes the concepts covered on the psets would not have yet been covered in class until after the pset was due. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness was the lack of practice problems for the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer expected us to do a lot of the learning outside of class, rather in lectures. There were a lot of aspects of the problem sets that had not been touched upon in class. Peer tutors and TAs were very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught extremely well (by Prof. Mayer) and does not present an extreme workload. I think that one weakness of the course is that at times the ideas on the assignment don't mirror what we have discussed in lecture or section, and I think that this could be improved by having someone review the problem sets before they are assigned. Also, the sapling homework, though valuable, seems like it is removed from what is taught in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer is the greatest part of this course. He's super knowledgeable and brings all the information together. The information sheets he made right before each exam were incredibly helpful.\r\n\r\nIf I could change one thing about the course, I'd make it so that the single class between the 3rd midterm and the final (n- and p-doping) wasn't so prominently featured on the final. ",
            "\u00a0This course does really well when it comes to teaching us the chemistry at a comprehensive level. We definitely gained a better understanding of of how things work chemically. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super engaging, great speaker\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Confusing, super \"quirky\" exams, psets due on Wednesdays ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer has very engaging lectures and is always a great source for help or clarification. He really emphasised how we should be thinking about the topic. TAs and section were also very helpful along with the excellent peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0The homeworks could match up with the lectures better, but I really enjoyed the way the class was taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the professor is amazing!! Prof Mayer is super approachable and always seems engaged in his own lectures, which makes listening much easier. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lecture goes through concepts very quickly and without much background. Often I only understood what was going on in lecture after the discussion section met. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: amazing support system from TFs, peer tutors, professor\r\nWeakness: its a very broad class the concepts never sit on you for a long time because you move on so quickly ",
            "\u00a0This course really opened my eyes to the world. It was an intellectual challenge, but I felt that I learned so much. The course covered a bit of everything, and it was a good exposure to the many different aspects of chemistry. The only thing I wish from this course is if it was slightly more organized. ",
            "\u00a0I think my critiques of the course stem largely from my lack of ability as a science student, and not as much from the course itself. My friends in the class who were chemistry majors definitely handled the exam/problem set questions better than me; I found the creative, out-of-the-box nature of questions very challenging, but I wouldnt consider it a weakness of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class material is interesting. However, I do think that the teaching style is a little sporadic. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the class was a bit all over the place. I think the order of each unit and how they connected to one another in the end was interesting, but I needed more structure in the class itself. I found both the professor and, as a result, myself a bit scatterbrained and unclear as to what the focus or takeaway from each lesson to be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- lots covered, in depth, discussion sections\r\nWeaknesses- a lot of material in a small amount of time ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the peer tutors and TAs were a great asset to the course, allowing me to better understand the information mentioned in class. One weakness is that the pset often covered information that we had not discussed yet in class. I wish that the class and psets were better linked together. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the amount of help available to students. The peer tutors, TFs, and Mayer are all invested in students learning the material and engaging with it. The peer tutors and TFs are extremely valuable resources and the amount of them and their constant availability is amazing. Also, discussion sections and peer tutoring hours were where I learned the most.\r\n\r\nA weakness is the pace and organization of the class. For each midterm, there was something that we learned the day of lecture that was likely to appear that night on the midterm so the peer tutors and TFs had to teach it to us beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0This course it good because it places emphasis on understanding how to apply ideas and not just crunch numbers. It is bad because sometimes the exams do not reflect ideas covered in class, or we are expected to learn lots of material on our own because the lectures never got through all the material. ",
            "\u00a0The material was engaging and taught well. Professor Mayer was a great lecturer and the problem sets he assigned were very helpful preparation for the midterms and final. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how this course was structured; it made sense to start with quantum and proceed to the other components. Professor Mayer ensured that this class made us apply the concepts we learnt. The problem sets and exams really allowed me to challenge myself. I like that there were three midterms; it permitted us to study each section in-depth and then be tested on that material. \r\nIt would have been better if each lecture was better organised.  I think that we learnt many concepts in peer tutor hours and in section before we did in lecture, as many of these concepts were on the problem sets. Additionally, I did not see the necessity of a final exam. If the intention of having the final exam was to wrap up the class and link concepts, in my opinion, an additional problem set would have done this better. ",
            "\u00a0One strengths of the course is the peer tutors. All psets seemed difficult to complete without going to peer tutoring hours. However, at times, I felt that peer tutors were mostly feeding us the answer to the psets and most sessions turned into people asking for help on all the problems. The class itself is somewhat structured, as provided on the syllabus, but I wished there were more bridging of the information we learned. The most difficult part of the semester was the beginning and the end. At the beginning, nobody understood what a particle in a box actually do. At the end, I felt that we rushed through the band structure of conductors, semiconductors, etc. The class assume some chemistry knowledge but I wished better explanations were given to go over those information that we may have forgotten. ",
            "\u00a0The material covered on assignments doesn't always align with what students are exposed to in class. A lot of the material I learned or had to reinforce on my own using the textbook. I find myself at peer tutoring sessions needing clarity on a number of questions. I think making sure students are fully capable of answering what's being asked of them for assignments would be of use. ",
            "\u00a0The problem set questions were pretty helpful in learning the material. For future terms, perhaps more practice exam material would be helpful in giving students an idea of the questions. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the Sapling homework was great and really helped me learn things that I didn't understand. I did not like the p-sets and thought they were not very helpful in helping us practice our knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer is a good professor, however, the way the course is taught is in such a way that it covers so many branches of chemistry, yet doesn't go that deep into each branch enough to get a really good understating of the material. A strength of this class is that is was not at all quantitative learning, and we did almost no math, but still understood the importance of the equations given to us and how the variables related to one another. I liked that about this class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- discussion section\r\n- office hours of TAs\r\nWeakness:\r\n- unclear lectures\r\n- unclear lecture slides that often times the teacher would not completely finish\r\n- material on the test that was not explained by the teacher and was somewhat explained by the TA ( there is only so much a TA can do in 1 hour) ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the exams--they are written with a degree of creativity that I feel fully tests the concepts taught in class. On the other hand, lectures and psets are oftentimes a disorganized and superficial so most of the 'real' learning happens on your own outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0It was a little bit difficult when the problem sets surpassed the lecture materials, which was really the only major weakness of this class. I thought the biggest strength was the material in general, since it was extremely interesting and fun to engage with. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength was the professor who teaches it Professor Mayer. He is really amazing and you can just tell from the examples he pulls on his p-sets and when he talks in class how smart he is and how much experience he has. At the same time, he really understands that there are a lot of first-years taking his class and he really helps us through.\r\nAnother major strength is the TA's and peer tutors. I hope next year they are just as amazing, because so many people told me the TA discussion sections were where they did most of the learning. The TA's help you filter out the most important concepts, highlighting them and teaching them in section. The peer tutors were also incredible help with the psets and review sessions. Hands down, they were the most helpful part of the course, I definitely would have done much much worse without them. \r\nI think a weakness was the Sapling. To me, it felt like more of a nuisance than anything. I didn't feel like they were too related to what was on the psets or exams, and they often asked more math-based questions. I didn't mind it, and most of the time the questions weren't hard or anything, I just didn't really think they were that necessary or that I learned a whole lot doing them. ",
            "\u00a0The article questions feel unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer has a wonderful teaching style. It might prepare students better for exams if they had more practice answering cross-conceptual questions. ",
            "\u00a0In high school, I loved chemistry, so I decided to challenge myself by taking this instead of 161. However, going more in depth on this subject than I had in high school made me realize I don't enjoy science as much as I thought I did. The way this course was taught didn't contribute to that; I simply realized that science isn't the field for me. Overall, the course was very well instructed, and there are plenty of resources available for students. However, using these resources (like the peer tutors, office hours, TA's) is very time consuming, and is difficult to make yourself do unless the material is something you're truly passionate about. I'm still giving this course a positive evaluation because I think for certain people, it can be very good. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Mayer set the course in an arch by answering questions posed at the beginning of the class and connecting the three main topics. However, those questions actually confused me. We were not given the answer until the end and by the time the end came, we had forgotten about the question and its connection to the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Super cool stuff that we're learning. Peer tutors are a godsend. Mayer is great. You'll love him\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs weren't exactly helpful. The exams can be a bit confusing and sometimes go beyond the scope of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course lie mainly on its structure, its philosophy, and its professor. The structure of the course tries to build up on each one of its units in order to help the students formulate a complete understanding of the concepts presented. The fact that the course started with a very comprehensive introduction to the quantum mechanical foundations of chemistry and built upon that in the rest of the units helped me with framing a complete picture of what we were taught. Furthermore, the philosophy of the course, as described on the first question of this evaluation, was intellectually stimulating and targeted the concept of intellectually vitality, something that can also be clearly reflected through the passion of professor Mayer for teaching the course. When I say that professor Mayer was one of the strengths of this course, I sincerely mean it. He managed to take concepts that were very complicated and hard to understand and simply, but very thoroughly cover them in the span of four months. The amount of chemistry that we went over and the depth at which we explored it was amazing for the short period of time that this course lasted. Having said that, the course at times may have felt as too specialized or too ambitious. More specifically, I believe that professor Mayer's intentions to teach chemistry conceptually for first-years may have at times been overwhelming as the concepts that were taught were challenging and difficult to conceptualize. Nonetheless, I believe that the course was amazing, and I can certainly say that it was definitely a very good start for my academic career at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0As I see it, this course has many strengths and few weaknesses. I feel that I learned a lot, and did so in a fairly efficient way. (I learned to expect that some of the seeming misdirection/round-about-ness of the problem sets would, in the end, improve my understanding of the material. In the end, I felt the seemingly strange way the problem sets were written [I know at least a few students had complaints] DID help.) \r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that Professor Mayer has really made 163 his own in many ways. As such, most of the commentary on this course also applies to him, and is attached below. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of the class was that the lectures were taught in a way that assumed that students were already knowledgeable about the topics. It was a little difficult to keep up in class without just blindly copying what was on the board. If students were to read the textbook before class, start the pset super early, or look at the lecture figures before, then it would be easier to keep up. A strength was the TF sections, which were really good at laying the foundation of what was necessary to understand the topics. ",
            "\u00a0The material of the course itself was very interesting and I agreed with Prof. Mayers philosophy of conceptual learning. However, the course felt incoherent a lot of the time because material was not taught in a cohesive mannerfor example, sometimes we wouldnt learn material on the problem sets until a week after that problem set was due. Because he jumped around a lot and things were often out of order, there was an added layer of confusion that was an impediment to my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent professor, well-designed psets that make you think about and help you review the material, Sapling was good for skills practice but isn't the most specific to the course material at times, great support system of TA's and peer tutors. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture style of the professor always kept me interested in what he was talking about and the peer tutors and teaching fellows added to the more basic understanding of the course. ",

I walked out of the class loving the subject, feeling good about how much I had pushed myself and learned, and had made some incredible friends in the process. Professor Mayer makes the class exciting and, while the class is very fast paced and will require a lot of time and effort, is SO WORTH IT. And this is coming from someone who hated chemistry and high school and thought she would never take another chemistry class in her life. ",

Its challenging intellectually, but worth it in the end and everything kind of ends up making more sense than you thought it would. ",
