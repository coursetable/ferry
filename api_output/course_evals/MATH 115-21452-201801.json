There are other great classes such as logic stats or Econ that can be used to satisfy the distribution requirements that will actually be helpful to you later. This is a dead-end class. I took AP ab in high school and wanted to continue Calc in college for the sake of learning and this was a truly terrible experience. We didn't do anything wherein this could be applied to our actual lives. We didn't do interesting problems that made you think and become better at math, work to be proud of even in the abstract. It was just wrote memorization and copying; few students ever cared to learn why the math works and actually think, and if you wanted to do those things it was enourmoysly difficult with the way the class is set up. \r\nMy individual teacher, a grad student, got much better as we went along and started bringing in objectives sheets with a summary of the days material, which made it better to learn, especially since the videos were aweful and he basically had to teach us from scratch. \r\n\r\nWith all the opportunities yale has, don't waste your time, money, or a class slot on this class unless it is a requirement.
