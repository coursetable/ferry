            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes were a lot sometimes, but watching and going over the video in class was helpful, as well as the workbook and ding worksheets in class that helped us prepare for the tests. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun and well-structured. New concepts and vocabulary were presented clearly and thoroughly, and questions were answered effectively. The only real weakness of the course is that it met every day, even during reading period. However, the class was enjoyable enough that this did not really pose an issue. ",
            "\u00a0The course moved very quickly, but the material was reviewed regularly so it wasn't too overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0I think it would be helpful to have a more structured vocabulary list that we could reference week to week in preparation for the tests. I think I may have gotten behind in vocab because I didn't have something I could look back on and review. ",
            "\u00a0If you do the homework and watch the videos, you will get the most out of the class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, you have to be willing to put in the time and see the professor if you need help because it really does make a difference. They want you to succeed and understand French. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It's a great way to learn French and although the workload is pretty high, the class does a great job of teaching you a lot of French in a short period of time. The videos are actually pretty amusing to watch after you get past the initial barrier of a foreign language. The class itself is small and pretty fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although it was a lot of work, you come out of the course with basic proficiency in French, which I think is a very rewarding skill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, French is one of the better language programs for introductory students at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Although this class can be a lot of work, it is rewarding to see yourself improving rapidly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Ngame was very helpful and I looked forward to coming to class everyday! ",
