            "\u00a0Chinese at Yale was much stronger when it was taught five times a week. We no longer have enough time to review writing characters, and we rush through pretty much every lesson. Now that teachers do not alternate between classes, we also lack exposure to different accents and teaching methods. What used to be so wonderful about learning Chinese at Yale was that everyone knew all the teachers and would gladly come to Chinese table every week. The new one-professor-per-class format makes it difficult to get to know multiple professors well and undermines the sense of community there used to be among Chinese learners and teachers. \r\n\r\nI know that my saying this will not change much, as those who remember what learning Chinese at Yale used to be like will soon graduate, and those who are new will not know any different from what they have now. At the same time, I cannot help venting my frustration in the naive hope that we can still change course. Chinese is a difficult language for Westerners; it simply needs more hours of instruction. And other departments should adopt the Chinese department's model of multiple professors per class, not the other way around. It is upsetting that standardization has taken precedence over quality. It is also upsetting that funding for Japanese is being cut in favor of Chinese and yet somehow, both the quality of language instruction and the department's ethos are deteriorating. ",
            "\u00a0Taking Chinese at Yale has been one of the best choices in my academic career. The teachers are extremely helpful and know how to teach the language very well. Constructive and helpful feedback is constantly given and is always given in a very kind manner to students, which I really appreciate. Taking Chinese has been about so much more than just learning a new language. It is about expanding your worldview, and I think the teachers also do a great job of that by telling stories, sharing experiences, and giving us this rare peek into a world we often don't think about in America. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent and thorough teaching, interesting course material\r\nWeaknesses: Not enough speaking practice, also we don't mention the words for everyday/non-abstract things as much because it's assumed that we already know them ",
            "\u00a0I think the teacher involvement and feedback is amazing. The professors are great and really kind. The final project is amazing and really lets you explore a topic of personal interest. Another strength of the class is how interesting the material is. One potential weakness is that I wish there were more speaking opportunities. Also, 3 days is great because its a bit easier but also 5 days would be better language practice. Also, there is limited character writing in the class, which made it easier which was good. But also it meant that my character writing got a lot worse. ",
            "\u00a0It's a difficult course and takes a lot of work and attention. It's put together in a an ok way and I'm not sure I have any suggestions. I liked the final project more than I would have liked working on a skit. "

            "\u00a0Sun Laoshi is one of my favorite professors in the Chinese department. She is always positive and kind, and really cares about her students. Take Chinese with her! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to any Yale Student. However, I would only recommend taking Chinese if you think you are going to continue using it in some capacity, (travel, work, family, etc.) Otherwise, it's a pretty hard language that you will lose pretty quickly if you're not engaging with any form of Chinese language learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, short of immersion it's the best way I've ever seen to improve your Chinese ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Teachers are excellent and helpful, youll definitely see improvements in your chinese and get to study some really interesting and more advanced topics such as economics and politics! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone wanting to further pursue language at an advanced level. The quizzes are easy, the homework is manageable, the lessons are very interesting, and the teachers are fantastic. L5 is much easier than the other years in terms of workload and quizzes. Its also the best way to keep up your language skills. Plus the teachers really are so wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend third year Chinese to any serious Chinese learner. "
