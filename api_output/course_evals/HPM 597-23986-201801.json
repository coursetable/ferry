            "\u00a0I don't feel like I learned much at all from this class. Discussions were too theoretical and high-level, did not provide me with deeper understanding of health policy or enable me to better work as a health policy professional. The one assignment that I found helpful was the morality paper, but even that did not feel very practical / realistic, as creating morality-based policy briefs does not apply really to the real world. \r\n\r\nThe class would function better if the capstone assignment were started earlier and made more of a prominent focus of the class, with additional drafts due throughout the semester so students could get feedback and then revise their policy suggestions, in order to create a final product that we are proud of. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'd solicit additional student feedback about what actual material would be helpful to include in a capstone and focus on allowing them to discuss this / learn about this, instead of Prof Schlesinger just providing all of the ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Incredible, engaging material that is pertinent for understanding what shapes policy. I wish I had more time to thoroughly go through the readings. One of my favorite courses here at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0great course, great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course, which provides a conceptual foundation for health policy. \r\n\r\nVery heavy workload however. ",
            "\u00a0incredible instructor, very helpful with feedback. Very hard though to stay attentive with the very in-depth intellectual lectures for 2 hours straight and minimal notes, there needs to be a 5-10 minute break in between the two hours. Also if he posted some kind of notes of his lectures to help digest the information that would be ideal. ",
            "\u00a0To me, this is the best class at YSPH. You will learn lessons in policy and making transformational change that, if you put in the effort, will remain with you throughout your life. There are no weaknesses in this course. "

            "\u00a0Prof. Schlesinger's lecture / teaching style does not work for me. He clearly has a strong sense of where the lecture needs to go, to the point that any student contribution that is not explicitly in alignment with his idea of the \"right answer.\" This creates a dynamic where students work to guess what he wants them to say, instead of saying their true opinions on the topics. This class would work MUCH better as a true seminar, where the professor speaks less than 20% of the time and health policy students are tasked with discussing readings and learning from one another. This style would encourage more creative thinking and critical analysis.\r\n\r\nAlso, Prof Schlesinger spoke about the obesity epidemic in a way I found offensive. We spent 3 classes discussing this topic and after each I left upset and frustrated. Using terms like \"fat people\" and being intentionally provocative in his rhetoric regarding personal responsibility & how people are to blame for their own weight was insensitive. For students in the class with a history of eating disorders, any conversations about weight can be upsetting or triggering, and I thought the way we discussed obesity was incredibly inappropriate. I'd prefer completely removing this topic from the syllabus, or drastically reformatting it in order to avoid the moralization of obesity. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturer. I appreciate the more \"philosophical\" teaching style. Could go over some parts of the material more in-depth, though. ",
