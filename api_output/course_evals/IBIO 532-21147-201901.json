            "\u00a0Greater understanding of many concepts relating to inflammation, disease, etc., and a new way to think about my own work (analogies, questioning basic concepts) ",
            "\u00a0A very good class following the Introduction to Immunology course (MCDB 430). However, Prof. Medzhitov made this class accessible to everyone regardless of their background, as his lectures and examples were very clear and descriptive. He always made sure we had the \"big picture\" in mind, which helped me retain knowledge and think in a broader perspective, comprehending fundamental concepts in inflammation. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a broad understanding of homeostasis, inflammation, and the relationships between the two. I gained a new perspective on cell specialization, how cells work together to have emergent properties, and the evolutionary foundations of these understandings. ",
            "\u00a0The concept in homeostasis, the model for homeostatic control and inflammatory control\r\nConcept of emergence in tissue organization\r\nAcute and chronic inflammatory response\r\nEvolutionary thinking of inflammation and the organization of immune system ",

Both Prof. Medzhitov and Eric (TA) were very accommodating and helpful if any logistical problems came up regarding scheduling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lecture format is relatively engaging. Provides alternative perspectives on classically accepted concepts.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: only once a week. Could use more points of engagement for students such as the occasional write-up. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!! Each lecture was very informative and had important concepts within them--making it necessary to keep up with the course material. However, I never felt overwhelmed or lost; there was clear progression and logic connecting the lectures every week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as an add-on course, because it is informative course and very low commitment. I would not recommend it as a primary course if a student's credits are limited, however, as it is not the most engaging course and has few opportunities to engage with other students or the instructor, and to receive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\nBefore, I always view life science in a reductionism way. Ruslan opened the students an entire new scope in thinking about biology. He generalize the basic models but also discussed very concrete examples using his model. He provided deep insight into the logic behind immune responses, and the evolution of why these responses exist as they are, how are they effective and what are the pitfalls. ",
