            "\u00a0This course was structured like a middle or high school course, which is not a compliment. Discussions of fundamental topics were repetitive and superficial, encouraging a basic memorization of the steps in a process or pathway rather than a full understanding of the specific role that each individual step has in the overall procedure, nor even the slightest intuition behind the development or advantages of this fragmentation of a process into numerous small steps. Lectures were never designed for the proper 75 minute period, some ending 20 minutes early, others ending without having covered 10 or more slides of content. Illustrations on the board were hopeless in the enormous lecture hall, being practically invisible from the back of the hall, not that they were that useful to begin with given that the lecture slides usually demonstrated the same material more clearly. Lecture slides were expected to be printed prior to class each day, as with the other intro biology courses (BIOL 101104), but these slides would sometimes not be uploaded to Canvas until 8pm the night before, making this difficult, as well as expensive. The textbook is not available in a bound form online from a reliable retailer, so the only option is the Yale Bookstore edition (contains only a few selected chapters from the full text), which is both significantly more expensive than the loose-leaf  version which includes the entire text and was not available by mid-semester, when BIOL 102 begins; the Yale Bookstore version also literally has a typo on the cover (\"Cell and Moleculuar Biology\"). The pre-class quizzes on Canvas are useless because they quiz on minutia from the readings (easily answered on Wikipedia or a Google Search) before having covered the content in class; it would be much more helpful and informative as to one's personal understanding of the material if a quiz covering key concepts were offered after the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: going over lab techniques and how to interpret data from them, gaining a basic understanding of cellular biology processes, discussion section activities are definitely worth your time, and the homework properly prepares you for the exams\r\nWeaknesses: The professor!! ",
            "\u00a0Discussion sections are a great strength of this course because we worked through problems that helped focus and reinforce our learning. The readings are extremely dense and can be difficult to grasp before having attended lecture. The lectures can also be difficult to follow at times. ",
            "\u00a0The slides are a good system; however, the professor for 102 was not good. ",
            "\u00a0this course was so bad. the discussion sections were not helpful in facilitating learning. the lectures were so poorly executed. the material is dry and not at all presented in a way that would be of any interest to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0The way that the content was organized was helpful and the order we learned topics made sense, however the lecture slides were hard to follow after lecture. They made sense during the lecture, but when I would go back to go over them I would often have a hard time following them. The lecture slides were organized much better in 101. ",
            "\u00a0I believe how the course is taught is effective for learning the material. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely liked this course more than biology 101 because we could ask questions more frequently and Professor Horsley went back over the information that we were confused on and made sure we understood it. \r\n\r\nI think a strength of this course was the real-life demonstrations of cellular processes/movements and that a weakness is that the slides weren't always in an order that made sense, with some topics having slides that were separated from each other throughout the powerpoint. ",
            "\u00a0The course really teaches the material well, especially with the TA's and discussion sections. the lecturer could improve by making better slides to take notes from. ",
            "\u00a0The course material is intrinsically interesting. It's very accessible as it's not too complicated, and it's cool to get to know some of the basics of how life operates. The expectations of what students should know on homework and the exams is clear and reasonable. However, it does involve a lot of memorization, sections can be slow without a good TF, and the quality of teaching wasn't as good as 101. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the textbook readings for the course go through the information at a much higher level than we learn about in class and so it seems almost pointless to put the time and effort in to read the 40+ pages of textbook reading and struggle to understand it if we are going to talk abut what exactly we need to know the next day in class. ",
            "\u00a0loved the activities during class, loved drawing on the board (next time, pls do that the whole semester and not just the second half), liked the demonstrations bc they helped my visualize and i remembered hand motions a lot during the final exam\r\n\r\nwording on hws and tests left a lot to be desired...felt like questions were often unclear\r\n\r\nmultiple contradictions between slides and study guides, multiple mistakes on slides...made already dense material very confusing. i get that mistakes happen but it seems like the slides should be prepared well ",

She tends to contradict herself between sentences, confusing the class. Bring binoculars to have any hope of seeing the diagrams she draws on the board. ",
            "\u00a0The test questions are fair and relatively straightforward. The on stage performances of the instructors were interesting and helped to clarify the materials taught in the class. The pace of the class is just right and the pre-class quizzes encourages the students to preview materials taught in class and helps students grasp the concepts better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: study guides were very clear, much of the course material was interesting, and faculty clearly were knowledgeable about cellular biology.\r\nWeaknesses: in some cases, it seemed that extra information was provided, although this wasn't always noted to be as such. Also, would have enjoyed seeing some more relevant real-life examples of how the cellular-level concepts could influence the bigger picture. ",
            "\u00a0Assigned readings do not line up with course material. The assigned readings go into far more detail than is needed. Also, papers that are assigned reading are hardly discussed in class or section; further, they are not annotated and are therefore pointless to assign to Bio 102 students unless the paper is discussed and explained.

            "\u00a0The class was good in that it covered a lot of laboratory techniques that are essential to research. The pre-class quizzes should be more relevant to the class material. The quizzes went too in-depth into information we didn't even cover in class or was tested on. In addition, there should be article annotations for the articles we read, because they were a little in depth. Finally, the textbook should have been the same as the the one used in BIOL 101 in order to save everyone some hassle (and money). ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting because I really enjoyed learning about the different signaling pathways and the cell cycle. One suggestion is to provide a study guide for the midterm exam just so students can have an idea about how the test is formatted. ",
            "\u00a0The course would likely benefit from more interactive and engaging lectures as well as more clarity in expectations for assignments and content. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is that lecture is often disorganized and kind of dry. The strengths are the pre-lecture quizzes keeping you engaged with the material, and honestly, I liked that there was a midterm even though it was a half-semester class because it allowed me to review the material and get a sense of how well I understood it so I wasn't completely blind-sided by the final. ",
            "\u00a0The mechanisms were relatively easy to memorize and understand, and once you understood them the exams were quite simple. The most annoying part of the course was the expectation of us to understand lab techniques when some students had never actually performed such experiments by hand. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures weren't always cohesive/ there were many irrelevant or poorly explained slides. The 'challenge the class' parts of the lecture weren't helpful to me personally, and some of them were just irrelevant to the course work. For example, while I do think it's important to consider how unethical the widespread use of HeLa cells is, I don't think 3 minutes of small talk with the people we sit next to is really going to generate any novel discussion or recourse for these sorts of problems. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that it was difficult to understand what material was going to be tested and what was extraneous. It was also very difficult to see the larger picture of the processes being taught. For example, it was only after three lectures that I understood that the past lectures had all been conjoined by the common theme of protein transport/ creation. ",
            "\u00a0The course was not well structured. I always felt bombarded with information in lectures and I could never tell what was significant to take away from the course. The information that we learned also felt randomly specific instead of more general and relevant information pertaining to cell biology. ",
            "\u00a0The powerpoints and study guides were extremely helpful, and the instructor Professor Horsely herself was very animated. I wish there was more student-professor interaction during the class, though, or student-student. I would have enjoyed being challenged more often during the class to engage with my classmates. Also, the pre-class quizzes were a good idea, but I did not find it helpful to read large portions of the dense textbook. Most students I spoke with did not bother with the reading, and it felt like a waste of a purchase. The quizzes could be done without the book. An pre-class quiz in class would have been more effective. Discussion section was very helpful and had structure to it. The TA clarified what was previously taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness was that the topics seemed kind of unstructured. I'm not sure if that is a flaw of the course or just something inherent to the topics, but it was difficult to link the topics together. Rather than feeling like a systematic exploration of cell bio, it kind of seemed like a handful of processes tossed together and that made it somewhat difficult at the final. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are not very attention-grabbing and sometimes the information is communicated in confusing ways. Because of this, it can be difficult to engage with the material during class. However, it is always clearthrough the weekly study guides what information students are responsible for knowing. ",

When there is confusion regarding a concept, especially when incorrect information is taught in lecture (the effect of phospholipid tail length on membrane fluidity is the first that comes to mind), there needs to be a class-wide correction made during lecture and not just a follow up post on Piazza.\r\n\r\nSome strengths are that a lot of material is presented in the course and all the concepts tested on the tests reflect the material presented in lecture. The material itself is very interesting, and the homework and discussion sections do a good job reviewing those ideas. ",

I also appreciate professor Horsley's attempts to appeal to many types of learners-- through physical, video, and textual examples, she put a great deal of care into making all feel welcome (and while not every example worked on me, I'm sure they did for some).\r\n\r\nA strength and weakness was the class time-- unlike BIOL101, the timing was more variable, which meant that sometimes lectures finished early and sometimes they spilled into the next. This is a strength because unlike BIOL101, we were not held to ask questions for the remainder-- when we finished early we generally got to leave early, and when lectures spilled over Professor Horsley made sure we understood everything, especially problematic topics that were hard to explain.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes the lecture was unclear (and even once or twice wrong), so a weakness was needing to go on google or Piazza and find out the answer to some unclear questions on our own. To Professor Horsley's credit, if she made a mistake she rectified it in the lecture slides. \r\n\r\nFinally, the readings were assigned prior to lecture. This allowed us to understand lecture better, but as we were only responsible for the reading covered in the lecture and the textbook is particularly advanced, I found myself memorizing difficult concepts that would never be tested, a problem that I never had in BIOL101. This led to often working much harder than I should. ",

I didn't think it made sense to take a quiz on information that I wouldn't be given a lecture on until the following day. The BIOL 101 format where we took one quiz a week on info we learned the two lectures prior was much more effective. There was too much of a chance to get a low grade with only 5 points on the canvas quizzes. I didn't learn anything from them. ",

Better slide and lecture organization could improve how students mentally sort the course material.\r\n\r\nHomework was too easy. I didn't feel that my knowledge was deepened by doing the assignments, which felt too simple to be preparing me for real scientific pursuits.\r\n\r\nThe textbook readings did not feel worthwhile. They were too long, and they provided a lot of information that felt superfluous because it was never brought up in lecture or tests. After a few attempts at getting through the readings, I usually just opened up the quizzes and looked through the textbook to try to find the answers.\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections were better than lecture.

Lecture and discussion were far more efficient as we probably covered 75% of the material that the readings did in wayyy less time (the readings just took way, way too long and I gave up doing them at all in the end). In the end the most efficient learning method turned out to be to skip the readings and rely mainly on lecture and discussion coverage, then possibly skim the readings for missed details. Offer more than one review session; there was only one review session based on majority vote so many of us could not attend it due to mandatory events that were scheduled months in advance. ",

I have heard from multiple peers not only my own that she was very attentive and explained very thoroughly concepts that were confusing in the lecture class during her enrichment sessions and she was always available for help. The discussion sections were also wonderful and help greatly in covering the material of the course. The greatest weakness was the lecture time. I feel that the way the lecture was taught was very problematic and confusing to keep up with and did not flow as smoothly as when material was covered in Biology 101. ",

I believe they could have been much more helpful had the review slides presented been distributed or if more time was spent discussing each topic to ensure complete understanding.

Therefore, the midterm and final exams as well as the homework are very data-driven and focus on interpretation and application.

We were required to print the lecture slides each class, but the slides are mostly just photos.

As it is near impossible to test out of intro bio even having taken a solid AP bio course, the people in the class range from people who have barely taken high school bio to people who have a strong biology background. Thus, in lecture, the professors aim to simplify information so that anyone can follow along, causing it to be long/boring for experienced students to sit through. However, on problem sets and tests, the standard of knowledge required is way more than was taught. Thus, the level of instruction is quite different from the level of knowledge expected. "
