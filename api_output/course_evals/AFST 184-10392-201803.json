            "\u00a0Strengths: lectures, readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: discussion sections ",
            "\u00a0The essay timeline and the final exam were kind of weirdly structured. I wish we had the deadline moved up a bit on the essay, and the take-home aspect of the exam was a lot more than most students expected. Professor Rugemer did change the prompt and length of the take-home essay, which helped, and I appreciate that students were actually listened to. ",
            "\u00a0Of all the prerequisite classes I've had to take at Yale so far, this was one of the most enjoyable. You do have a good amount of work for the class (more-so at the end of the year than at any other point -- the rest is manageable), but you really do come away learning a lot about the slave trade, what it meant for who was involved, and what effect it had on the Atlantic world while it existed and well after. The one suggestion I might offer for improvement would be to have either written exam or a take home exam during finals, not both of them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were Professor Rugemer's lectures, they were always very interesting and captivating. The readings were definitely a weakness of the class, they were often lengthy and had little to do with that week's material, they felt like unnecessary extra work. ",
            "\u00a0The readings/discussion sections and the lectures did not really interact. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness is definitely that we had 3 assignments due during reading and finals period. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Rugemer is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far! He is super engaging and extremely knowledgable about the topic. The class passes so fast; some classes you keep checking the time to see when it ends but I never did that once for this class. Learning about the history of slavery is so important and I think is something everyone should get exposure to. \r\nWeaknesses: A lot of terms to study for the exams and take-home essay was not clearly indicated in the syllabus at the beginning of the semester so I had a surprise essay to write on top of the 4 I already had due during reading week, but I dealt with it fine ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing lecturer.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: TAs. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rugemers lectures are very rich and informative, and its a bad idea to miss one. It helps to take good notes. I had a great TF, and it made the discussion sections very engaging. There was a pretty heavy workload. ",
            "\u00a0no weaknesses of course; lecture format was very structured, and the handouts with key terms was helpful without making it about teaching for the test ",
            "\u00a0Professor Rugemer's lectures were often very formulaic and he was not prepared to answer questions regarding his claims, even though he routinely opened the floor for questions. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very in-depth and imformative but the section was not too helpful in its structure. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting but the readings were often dry and the powerpoints could have been more captivating. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: covers wide amount of information, interesting readings, structure of the midterm\r\n\r\nweaknesses: finals schedule was unorganized and too much work for both the TAs and the students, feedback/guidance for paper assignments was a little unclear ",
            "\u00a0there were no grades given before the cred/d/fail deadline and that was very unfair ",
            "\u00a0The course material is interesting and while Rugemuer is a good lecturer, the style of learning does not coincide with the teaching style. The assessments all seem half-baked as if the Professor and TA could not decide if they wanted us to learn the course through memorization of key facts, (which becomes incredibly difficult as there are no actual lecture slides and Rugemuer talks incredibly fast) or through analysis of the events and their significance. My biggest complaint with this class is the test/essays as they are unfair to the teaching style and the fact that it is an introductory course into the major. The professor seems to be teaching the class as an homage to the 60s style teaching if only to make the point, \"this class used to be taught in a racist way I will teach it exactly the same except not racist.\" The Discussion sections are similarly under cooked. Throughout the course the mixture of repeating incredibly basic knowledge, and performing higher levels of analysis is so unbalanced that the often vague questions of the assessments leave you without any sense of where to go or what is expected of you as a student. The last half of the course is incredibly messy as the professor and TA all seemed out of their depth and expertise, yet again we as students were expected to maintain in the same limbo of participation of the first half. When there are no lecture slides, a messy lecture and messier discussion sections make for an impossible final assessment. The material of this course is cool and incredibly necessary if one hopes to be an african american studies major. It could be taught and facilitated much better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the lecture handouts and the section structure. The weaknesses are the lack of notes on the power point, this could be improved ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated the narrative style of the class, as I felt like it made the course more engaging. The only thing I would suggest is to maybe have sections incorporate the Research Paper process more, as I felt like the course, as currently constructed, is segmented into 3 relatively separate components: lecture, section, research paper.

            "\u00a0I would recommend the class to other students. Ultimately, I think that learning about the slave trade and its implications is important regardless of whether you are interested in the field of study or not. This course lays out the entire progression of this narrative from beginning to end in a way that is straightforward and clear. No matter what one's area of study or interest is, I think this class has something to teach them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great HU credit, easy A, and you'll look forward to going to lecture! The final research paper isn't too bad, just pace yourself and don't leave it all to the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0It was a good way to get a very broad overview of slavery in all the Americas. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Professor's lectures are engaging and tell a story about an awful part of history that everyone should learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I shopped this class with no intention to take it but ended up being riveted by Professor Rugemer's lecturing style and obviously the topic of slavery itself. Prof Rugemer is the best lecturer I've had at Yale so far - he is super engaging and extremely knowledgable about the topic. The class passes so fast; some classes you keep checking the time to see when it ends but I never did that once for this class. Learning about the history of slavery is so important and I think is something everyone should get exposure to. The workload is decently low (one research paper, 2 exams) -- but be warned that the final exam is split into a test and another take home 3-4page essay. That was pretty annoying because it was unexpected but other than that it was really a great class. ",
            "\u00a0Only take this if you are an AFAM major. Otherwise, this class is not worth 1 of your 36 Yale credits. ",
            "\u00a0Yep, super interesting content. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that allows you to learn about a subject that many people know the sparknotes on. Taking a much more in depth look into this subject is eye opening and, like a good History course should, it helped to explain why the things that happened long ago resulted in other events and eventually more contemporary relevant issues.\r\n\r\nThe course work was not overbearing during the semester, but many people felt blindsided by the final exam, because it included its own take home paper. This of course followed the original final paper due for the course as well. So just be prepared for that as you plan out your finals period. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely. I would suggest this course to anyone interested in a rigorous historical survey that assigns a lot of work. Obviously the subject matter can be emotionally difficult; were talking about some of the worst atrocities in history. People should know that going in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; if Yale were to make a required course for all undergraduates this would be an appropriate one given the centrality of the content to every aspect of American history ",
            "\u00a0it is a required course for the Afam major, so inevitably some must take it, but my TF Alycia was a far better instructor than Professor Rugemer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a great course on a very important, relevant topic. ",
            "\u00a0It's a requirement for the AfAm major, but if you're a nonmajor without a strong passion for history, I wouldn't recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Absolutely imperative information about race, capitalism, and the roots of modern society ",
            "\u00a0Probably not. The lectures were very interesting and engaging but the out of class reading and sections didnt really add much. Also very little direction is given on the research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I would because the class taught slavery and its consequences much different than traditional courses. ",
            "\u00a0i would recommend taking it sooner rather than later for african american studies majors. but, for people outside of the major, i would hesitate to recommend it because of all the work thrown at you by the end. ",
            "\u00a0This material is very important for african american studies major. If you are not in the major, I still think it is an untalked about history that is important to know. I wish that it was taught better. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it helps you understand slavery from perspectives I never considered before ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as I feel it offers a very good background to the existence of slavery in the Atlantic world. "
