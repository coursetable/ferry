            "\u00a0You will learn about Medieval art through the lens of specific patrons and the works that they commissioned. The class gives a great overview of the prominent ideologies and beliefs of individuals during the late antique through medieval period. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Medieval Art and its historical context. ",
            "\u00a0My analysis skills of art were enlarged in a more historical than in a visual analysis sense. This was due to the structure of the course being centered around key Medieval figures. I found it very engaging and enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0My skill for analyzing art has improved as well as my ability to write about it and draw connections. For the final project we had to commission our own piece of art which required a lot of research and big thinking as well as creative skills. ",
            "\u00a0I developed greater appreciation for medieval art and for its context in history. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jung provided an astounding survey of medieval arts and key figures during this period. I was able to read primary sources which I had heard of but never been able to delve into. I learned a great deal, in particular, about sculptural arts and, more generally, about the ways in which medieval artists, writers, patrons, rulers, etc. were interacting with one another. ",
            "\u00a0The class provides an overview of the history of medieval European art, including discussions of the different styles medieval artists used to express themselves, the subject matter and themes they indicated, and the structure of medieval society as reflected in its art. It offers a perspective on the concerns of medieval European people, including religious disputes, gender roles, beliefs about race, and ideas about the correct class structure of their society. ",
            "\u00a0-learned how to better evaluate images using context, visual, and historical clues \r\n-learned a lot about history and Christianity, which I didn't know before. "

        [
            "\u00a0The lectures were incredibly engaging and super fascinating. Professor Jung gives wonderful lectures. It was also great to visit the Beinecke a couple of times to look at artifacts similar to those seen in class. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved that this course was organized in terms of people, instead of semi-ambiguous or boring geographical/chronological dividers. Learning about the art in the context of its creation in relation to the people who commissioned it was rewarding because it presented a more complete picture of medieval life. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very engaging because of Prof. Jung. She brings in multi-media teaching aides, delivers clear lectures, and touches on issues of diversity and discrimination in the Medieval world. The weekly reading isn't too much and is a nice addition to the lectures if you get to do it. One caveat is the workload- it is super low (we're only graded on the two exams and the final project) which is nice for a while until it's very stressful at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The succession of the course material was easy to follow and made it very engaging. The visits to Beinecke and the Met Cloisters were especially good. \r\n\r\nThe reading material could be posted earlier to allow more time. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures for this course were absolutely amazing. Professor Jung would include pictures and stories from her own travels and encountered with the objects. Her lectures were packed with information and images. We traveled to the Cloisters and got to see lot of the kind of art in person as well as see her medieval art section at the YUAG. ",
            "\u00a0More smaller writing assignments during the year so that we can get feedback and are more prepared to write the final paper. Also, in this way, less emphasis is placed on the project and paper which can be stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was fantastic through and through. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well taught. Prof. Jung was a good lecturer and covered the topics we discussed in a clear and engaging manner. I would have appreciated a slower-paced class that focused on less subject matter in more depth and included more comprehensive perspective on a few topics, but I understand why that was impractical for a survey class and this was a good survey. Aside from the teaching, which was good in class and in section as well, I would have preferred a few argumentative writing assignments rather than the assessments that were used in this class. I know that memorization of specific artworks is standard practice in art history classes and I understand why our tests were structured to rely on that knowledge, but I don't think it's a good method for developing students' understanding of the period -- I would have found a couple of brief argumentative writing assignments to be more helpful, I think. In the same manner, I think I might have learned more from writing an argumentative essay about some aspect of medieval art for our final paper than I did from producing a project proposal. But even though I didn't enjoy the tests or the final project as much as I think I would have enjoyed a different type of assessments, I learned a lot from the class, it took advantage of the opportunities we had to see relevant art in person at the YUAG and the Cloisters, and it developed my understanding of the medieval period as well as encouraged me to form my own opinions about the topics we covered, religious issues in particular. ",

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course -- it was fun, interesting, and surprisingly relevant in terms of discussing people's self-representations, even today. The fact that we took a field trip to the Cloisters was just an added bonus! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for history of art majors and those who have never taken an HSAR class before. Prof. Jung immerses you in the Medieval world and really animates it. The lectures are engaging and she brings in such a wealth of objects and images. It's always accessible and Prof. Jung is always open to any questions. There's also a field trip to the Met Cloisters! Very fun! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I found this course to be fantastic and it really gave me a new appreciation for Medieval artwork and Medieval history in general. I thoroughly enjoyed and looked forward to class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course because many people doubt the beauty and skill required for art produced during the medieval age but its really amazing and now I have a deep appreciation for it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, prof Jungs lectures are incredibly engaging and we do cool stuff like go look at manuscripts in the beinecke and go to the cloisters in NY. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Jung is an amazing lecturer and is truly passionate about this material. This is a great course as an intro to art history or as a course covering a span that is most often underlooked in typical surveys. Viewing the history of art through people is also an invaluble intellectual method. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an introduction to the medieval period through its art that also encourages you to think about some of the political and social issues of the era that are still relevant today, yes. The class does a good job of meeting that objective, Prof. Jung is a good lecturer, and the sections are taught well. ",
            "\u00a0-Prof Jung is amazing, and she taught the material in a passionate and fun way. I'd take this class again if I could! "
