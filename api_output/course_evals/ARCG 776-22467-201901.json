            "\u00a0I learned the basics of GIS. There is so much to cover in a program like GIS and I felt that the course did a good job of reviewing the basic tools and tricks of GIS. I feel fairly confident in my abilities to take raw data from the field and convert it into something meaningful using GIS. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided me with a good overview of the potential uses of GIS in archaeology. Thus, I was able to develop the skills necessary to meaningfully use the software, so that further competences can be acquired autonomously. "

            "\u00a0The course is taught by a very outgoing professor who really makes it worthwhile. I did end up learning a lot, but I think I could have learned more if the format of the class was changed. The major weakness of this course was that the TA did not know a lot about GIS, and didn't engage with the students in any way other than an occasional email. If this is taught again, I think students would be much better able to follow along if a TA could:\r\n\r\n1) Help students catch up while Professor Honeychurch is teaching class. This means getting up out of the chair and more or less circling the room to see who is stuck and helping them to catch up with the rest of the class.\r\n2) Hold TA sessions reviewing important concepts from the class and labs for students who need it. I can say confidently from this semester more than half the class would have massively benefited from these two things.\r\n\r\nIt would also be very helpful if the practice labs, which are laid out in a step by step format, more closely mirrored the lab that needs to be turned in each week. They shouldn't be exactly the same - but if the practice lab walked us through the main concepts that we would need to apply to the actual lab, then we would be able to teach ourselves how to do it and get reinforcement from doing it a second time in the actual lab. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: hand-on experience, broad overview, possibility to apply skills to one's own project.\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps too many topics, sometimes chaotic. \r\nPossible improvements: more time on the most important topics/skills, different time/day. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend that students take GIS if the TA has a larger role in the class. If not, it might be better to take GIS through the forestry school. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only to students that intend to autonomously engage in further learning of GIS and spatial analysis. At the end of the course, the student is able to use the software, but far from mastering any aspect of it. "
