            "\u00a0Through this course I learned far more grammar than I even knew existed. We also learned a lot about the history and culture of the Spanish-speaking world, which I really enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much Spanish and gained a lot of comfort in my usage of the language. This was a great opportunity for me to consolidate things I learned in L3 and keep up my language usage, as well as learning new vocabulary and language structures. ",
            "\u00a0improvement of reading, writing, and speaking Spanish skills ",
            "\u00a0I became comfortable with using Spanish everyday again after not speaking it (regularly) for two years. ",
            "\u00a0My grammar improved drastically in this course. While my speaking and writing have improved some, my grammar is light years ahead of where it was. "

            "\u00a0a lot of work but very engaging ",
            "\u00a0There's not much I would change about the course, but I do think the assignments were a little too concentrated in the last part of the semester for no reason. I think things like presentations could have been done earlier, and eased some of the stress at the end. ",
            "\u00a0The course could be a little dry at times/repetitive. That said, it was strong in terms of learning the language well. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: use of many different materials to engage students in all types of Spanish usage; kind and caring professor\r\nweaknesses: daily busy work online with VHL (didn't provide a lot of substance for Spanish practice); workload progressed and escalated very quickly from L3 Spanish ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course include learning about Latin American history while learning Spanish. This part of the course was really interesting - it is not just grammar! ",
            "\u00a0I think the content of the course is good and sets people up for success in spanish. However, the second half of the term, after getting back from spring break, had significantly more work than the first half, and I think this could be better balanced (the work wasn't hard, there was just a lot more of it).

            "\u00a0yes if you are dedicated to learning Spanish as it is very helpful but a lot of work! ",
            "\u00a0This is a solid course designed to help you consolidate the Spanish you have learned and learn some more vocab/grammatical structures. I found the course pretty manageable except towards the end, when the workload definitely ramped up a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would not! ",
            "\u00a0Yesit's adequate preparation for higher level courses. However, it's a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0If you need free time during your semester, then do not take this course. Especially towards the second half of the semester, the work load starts becoming ridiculous. It detracted me from my other classes. However, if you love Spanish and have the time, this class is definitely for you ",
            "\u00a0Professor Len is a very good teacher and will help improve your spanish. I am so thankful for her guidance. I was challenged, but wasnt over worked. I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0For those who really want a strong spanish foundation, I would for sure recommend the course. "
