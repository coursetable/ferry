            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how child care centers affect infants, toddlers, and preschoolers with respect to development. ",
            "\u00a0I gained very practical skills and knowledge through this course. Many of the topics were covered by experts in the area, so they were able to talk about how their profession applies to what we were learning. Also, the observations in the child centers provided another avenue to practically apply the information. I learned how to better understand the reasoning for children's behavior, play, and thoughts, as well as what makes a high-quality child-care center. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, how to be a good observer and how to write about your observations. This class gave me incredible insight into early childhood education in the United States. The observations complimented the lectures so well. This class gave me a deeper, more intuitive sense of what is right and wrong when it comes to childcare. More than anything, it taught me the importance of laying a strong foundation of care, trust, and responsiveness to a child for their optimal development. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro class into early childhood development for EDST and PSYC students. Interesting weekly lectures and a 2 hour participant observation at a daycare which is basically just hanging out with kids and listening to the funny stuff they say. Would recommend to anyone but prob best if youre interested in working with kids ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the intricacies of child development. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of how children develop and how early childhood education should be structured in order to facilitate and encourage this development. I also learned how to effectively observe children in a daycare setting. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about current child development theory. Improved my observation skills by actually visiting classrooms. I really appreciated how, while the way the professors encouraged us to think (i.e. imagine the mental life/world of the infant, toddler, preschooler) was definitely not something I would have come to on my own, at least not to such rigour as a cohesive theory/narrative, it also felt very natural and right and helped me reflect on my own childhood and even present self ",
            "\u00a0I learned to understand and value children's developmental progress and how teachers/ care givers aid in that process. I am also a much better observer because of this class. Before this class I never understood how children utilize play and everyday experiences to learn and grow. After taking this class, I feel like I better understand my own childhood experiences, the experiences of children in my life, and of the children that I will interact with in the future as a parent or educator.

            "\u00a0A weakness was that the lectures were not very engaging, and the professors spoke very slowly, making the class move at a slower pace. ",
            "\u00a0The observations in the daycares are extremely unique and made this class very special. Applying the lectures to real children helped cement the information, but also allowed for new, clarifying questions to arise, which led to a deeper learning of the material. Further, the speakers that are brought in are great and are truly experts in their field. One weakness of the course is that there was not much time for discussion or questions during the lecture each week. ",
            "\u00a0The observation component of the course is phenomenal, and was always a highlight of my week. This class is incredibly non-stressful which is very refreshing. The teachers are very knowledgable about the material and always willing to help the students. Professor Close brought in a lot of guest speakers who are experts in their fields. The best part about this class is that it's taught in such a comprehensible way that you do not even realize how much you've learned until the semester is over. I would suggest giving a written prompt for the final paper as it was a bit vague what was expected. There was also little incentive to keep up with the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course gives a good introduction to the development of children but the many of the readings seemed a bit outdated/irrelevant and lectures were a little bit disconnected. The lecture and reading material was not always relevant to the age group you were studying. ",
            "\u00a0This course could perhaps benefit from more interactive teaching, but it was honestly a very solid course. The lectures were interesting and well-organized, the readings were relevant, and the assessments were useful ways of implementing skills. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic; all the topics were interesting and useful. The classroom visitation really enhanced the experience, allowing me to challenge my own observation skills as well as notice the theories introduced in class in practice. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the class is the visitation assignment hands down. Without this portion of the course it would be impossible to understand and grasp the concepts we learn in class. I wish the class lectures were structured a little differently though so that they flowed better. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student who wants to be a parent later in life or is interested in early childhood education. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class! If you are lucky enough to get a spot in the class, absolutely take it!!! Such an interesting course in learning about the development of young including ranging from infants to 5 year olds! One of the most incredible parts of this class is the weekly observation at one of the local daycares. It is incredible to watch the kids in your classroom develop over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Hard to get into, but definitely worthwhile if you land a spot. The papers are long but very straightforward to write. This class is great for anyone who wants to be a parent or caregiver! Great class and low stress. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend this class to another student. The 2 hour participant observation weekly is a pain sometimes but its very worth it and fun once you get to the daycare. Class is interesting and not particularly difficult (weekly lectures on different relevant topics) ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you love children, the observation portion is 100% worth it. My days in the daycare were some of my favorite at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great course if you're interested in child care, psychology, biology, or healthcare! ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great course even if you are not an EDST or PSYCH major. I took it for a WR credit and it was one of my favorite classes at Yale. Observing children is also extremely stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Especially if you're at all interested in working with children; these professors and the ideas they introduce you to are the best. Great for all psychology majors, because the early years are so formative and have such a large impact on the rest of our lives that it's useful for any psych/cogsci person to understand more about this segment of development ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! Take the course! "
