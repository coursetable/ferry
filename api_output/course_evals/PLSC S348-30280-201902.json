            "\u00a0Biggest weakness: the disconnect between our graded papers and the content we were studying. I felt that the assignments should have been structured with the course material in mind. That way, we would have been more engaged with the topics. At times, it just felt like passive reading, which explains why many lost interest in the readings after a certain point. I wish we couldve engaged with the material and developed more original thought on it. Perhaps different prompts for essays, making us utilise theories in the readings? Comparative essays? \r\n\r\nBetter integration between the course material and assessments would have led to better engagement during the class itself. \r\n\r\nI also did feel as if the research project went a little nowhere at some points. \r\n\r\nMore discussion questions for readings would be great so we know what to pick out and focus on. Lectures would have been much more enhanced had this been done. \r\n\r\nStrengths: the lecturers were fantastic and they all were engaging and knowledgeable field. My TAs (Gautum and Yongzhi) really did help with breaking down the topics and making us think more. I enjoyed the teaching sessions a lot thanks to these professors. \r\n\r\nIn particular, Yongzhi made us do IDs which I found were very helpful in allowing us to extract the key points of each reading. I would recommend this method for future sessions just because you get the main concepts and theories quickly and effeciently. \r\n\r\nI also liked the talks and hearing different perspectives. I enjoyed that there was a communal element to the course where we could talk to professors and have dinner with them. ",
            "\u00a0There was a huge gap of knowledge within one class, with some having more knowledge in IR and many having less. I found this quite difficult sometimes because I would mention something pertinent to the topic, but have to explain myself constantly because there were a few who did not understand what I was saying. I think there needs to be a warning to those who have finished taking the courses 'International Relations' or 'International Organisations in World Politics' that they might not find this course particularly useful or value-adding because it will be a crash course of everything they learned in those two courses. For those who have only taken either, there will be a substantial portion of the course that they might find repetitive, making them less engaged in certain weeks. Nevertheless, whether or not they took those courses, it will be incredibly useful for people interested in research or whoever needs help for their capstone. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am not very sure if the dinners particularly engaged me, aside from the first two dinners. Thus, I am not entirely sure how they value-added to my experience in the program. \r\n\r\nAt times, it was also a struggle to stay engaged in lectures and classes when they had nothing to do with the research paper we were doing. While it was great to learn research methods and understand the basics of what people go through when conducting research, it was difficult to stay engaged with readings and lectures when they were so far removed from research that we were all individually conducting. Thus, I felt that there were times when the assignments felt too far removed from everyday activities we were supposed to do in class, making it difficult to find the relevance and value in what we were doing. An alternative I could suggest would perhaps be short essays based on the readings, such as response pieces. Perhaps the final paper could be a research paper still, but keep the topics relevant to the themes we were doing in class. I found it quite convoluted that my paper topic was decided even before actual themes were discussed, considering that we had to decide on a paper topic when we had only learned about research methods, and I was forced to link it to themes we learned in class for my final paper. Another suggestion would definitely be to have two different types of final papers and students can choose which they prefer to do, based on their personal interest. One final paper can be a research paper, and another can be an essay.\r\n\r\nI think just in a general, a lot of us were quite surprised at what kind of work we were doing during the program. We completely expected something different, so to do a research paper without having expected to do one, was really a curveball. Nonetheless, I thought it quite interesting to learn from professors across different disciplines. It was also interesting to learn such a wide range of topics within such a short time. We were definitely stretched, but I think it was in a good way. It really pushed a lot of us to perform to a standard that we could all be proud of at the end of the five weeks. ",
            "\u00a0shorter lecture time and more in depth analysis rather than touching on many topics at a superficial level. \r\n\r\nstrength was definitely the TA, especially Yongzhi, who taught really well. enjoyed the formal dinners as well. could invite more influential speakers ",
            "\u00a0Clarity of assignments can be improved. Teachers and professors were highly dedicated and adequate guidance was provided. ",
            "\u00a0a lot of material which we did not delve deep into, maybe we could focus on fewer topics with more in-depth study ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the variety of topics that were covered and the speakers that came to talk to us. I think one of the weakness would be that the readings assigned were not related to the assignments that we did weekly. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is the variety of topics. A weakness would be that sometimes it's not as clear how they tie together. ",
            "\u00a0fantastic lecturers and readings ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the weaknesses of the course was dividing the grading between various TAs. I genuinely felt along with a lot of my peers that the grading wasn't standardized. My TA marked a lot harder than the rest. It caused a lot more stress than other students felt. Also, 5 weeks is not enough time for the amount of syllabus covered during this course. Either the grading should be easier or the courseload should be less. \r\n\r\nThe strengths were the amount of information I never thought I could grasp within such a short span of time. I really feel like I can do anything now. However, the stress I went through to get to this point, was at one point so much that I took 2 days off. The switching up of the profs was also really cool because some of the profs were much more radical with their views than the rest. It made the course entertaining. Lastly, the resources available at Yale really made the course great esp Prof Rosenbluth. ",

            "\u00a0The course lecturers were all really good, but it was slightly frustrating when different TAs gave different instructions for the same assignment. The assignments should be better thought out and all the TAs should be on the same page as to what each assignment required. As the weeks passed the assignments also became disjointed from what we were learning in the lectures, so more should be done to link the two. ",

However, as it stands now, the engagement with the text was low and so I would not recommend it in its current form despite the good lectures and teaching assistants ",
            "\u00a0There are definitely weaknesses to this course that I would not hesitate to share with another student. I guess in a way, I will only definitely recommend this course to a student if they are really interested in a crash course to research methodology with lower stakes involved. ",
