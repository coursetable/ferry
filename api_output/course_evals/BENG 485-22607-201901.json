            "\u00a0I learned to better research scientific journals to write a research paper on a chosen topic. The professors also gave valuable advice for writing scientific essays which I incorporated into the required essays and is applicable to any scientific paper. I also learned a lot about neuroimaging techniques and was exposed to a lot of neuroscience topics such as neuroanatomy. ",

            "\u00a0Would be better with smaller class size to facilitate discussion. The student presentations were a plus and good practice for giving talks ",
            "\u00a0I was shocked to hear that virtually the entire course would be taught by ourselves, but the professors do help guide presentations and conversation. 10-15 page assignments are a bit overwhelming, but I definitely feel like I achieved a lot. ",
            "\u00a0The course's main strength is its survey style -- it touches on a lot of relevant topics to give a realistic view of the scope of the field. Its weakness is that the class is largely student-taught; this leads to disorganized presentations into which the professors often interject, making the lectures somewhat confusing and not dramatically helpful. The other main disadvantage is double-edged; we received very clear and helpful feedback on our work, but almost no guidelines were given at the outset to help us succeed. For example, we were simply told to make a presentation on our topic with little to no guidance going in, but once we'd created a draft, we were told it shouldn't exceed a certain slide count, it should include certain information, etc. that was helpful but would have been more helpful given earlier on. This is also true for the midterm and final papers. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Workload was manageable. \r\n\r\nWeakness: CLASS WAS WAY TOO BIG!!!!!!! Cap it next time. I was excited to get the intimate experience of developing my critical thinking in a seminar setting. But this class failed to deliver on that promise. It took way too long to get feedback on material. The group discussion felt stifled. I really think the professors need to cap it. \r\n\r\n(As an aside, the method used to form the groups at the beginning of the year was a joke. If you have a specific criteria of how you want to groups to look, then design them yourselves! It wasted everyone's time to be scrambling to find people that formed \"diverse groups. You ended up creating most of the groups anyways. Just assign them next time if you want each group to have one person from each major.) ",
            "\u00a0Student presentations mixed in with professor lectures I think would be more helpful. Cap the class to emphasize discussion more, take less focus off of weekly synopsis (maybe do biweekly, where students choose what to discuss from the two lectures? Would decrease the writing load, increase the importance of talking) \r\n\r\nGrading for midterm paper felt nitpicky/arbitrary at times, setting more clear rubric/guidelines from the outset should help with this ",
            "\u00a0I liked that students were able to give a lecture as a group as presenting a topic in a way that allows others to learn the material is a very valuable skill. However, I will that every lecture wasn't given by students. I also wish there was more feedback on the weekly synopses. \r\nThis class did not require students to have taken The Human Brain or neuroscience courses; however, many of the students giving the lectures disseminated the information as if everyone had taken such courses which often made it difficult for a person like me who has no neuroscience background to follow along. This class felt more like a neuroscience class that a biomedical class on neuroimaging. (there were also 3 times as many neuroscience majors in this class than non-neuroscience majors). The professors could instead present more of the lectures instead of the students or better guide the student groups to not assuming that everyone in the class had knowledge of brain anatomy and current neuroscience topics. ",
            "\u00a0The class presentation was good practice for consolidating complex neuroimaging concepts and public speaking. Course logistics and assignment requirements/deadlines were not clear at times. ",
            "\u00a0The material was really interesting. I liked the weekly synopsis and focus on writing. I wish there had been more discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured so that students conduct the lectures throughout the entire semester. While I recognize the benefit in terms of public speaking, it also comes off as laziness on the part of the professors given that they do little more than correct presentations, facilitate discussions once in a blue moon, and handle logistics with papers at the start of class. I think that more professor involvement in discussing their own research might even out the workload distribution. ",
            "\u00a0The material and subject matter is the main strength. However, the course is very oddly weighted, taught, and graded. The main issue is that students make presentations and are the actual teachers of the class each week, while the professors simply sit on the side and provide live fact-checking. This would be effective with infrequent presentations but it led to varying lesson quality. In addition, assignments had very vague guidelines and harsh grading, especially the midterm and final papers, where likely the entire grading curve will result from. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Intelligent professors who are responsive to feedback and are quick to respond to any emails, even at the weekend. Low work load (essentially nothing on weeks you don't have a presentation, outside of a one-page synopsis (which can be pretty annoying). Flexible essay topics. Weaknesses: The  presentation is pretty stressful, and the professors don't give you any feedback. Going to class is entirely pointless, the professors don't teach after week 2 and when they do THEY SPEAK SO DAMN QUIETY YOU CAN NEVER HEAR THEM. Really petty and strict grading rubric for the essays (they seemed to not want people getting near 100). ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed that the lectures were run by the students, and felt as though I learned a lot from my peers with the guidance of the professors. Assignments were a bit ambiguous, however, and I had trouble understanding the purpose of my assignments given that there were no prompts or clear instructions. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures could be given by the professors with a small talk from the students in the beginning. Students did not have enough knowledge about the material to be the only instructors. I didn't feel like I had the chance to really understand most topics. ",
            "\u00a0It would have been far more instructive to hear more from Professor Hyder and Professor Rothman, rather than from students who were unfamiliar with most topics and guided primarily by dense readings. \r\n\r\nProfessor Hyder was generous about vetting paper topics and guiding students around difficult topics. However, guidelines for papers were extremely vague and almost seemed to be retrospectively established, after papers were turned in. "

            "\u00a0Yes, decent WR credit that will improve your understanding of a niche but highly prevalent field ",
            "\u00a0Took it for a writing credit. You end up writing a lot more pages than most other writing credits, but the content is very different. It's scientific writing and summary based, so easier if you like that stuff. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course to take if you're a neuroscience major who does not code; the class is accessible and flexible to your interests. Also, it is a worthwhile writing credit in the sciences. To the general Yale student, however, I think this class is not the route to take unless you have a genuine interest in the material because otherwise lectures will feel very long. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It was a really thought provoking course that allowed me to learn a lot more about the fundamentals of neuroimaging from its biological underpinnings all the way to its clinical applications. It is probably the most on-the-surface difficult course I have taken but not something that was unmanageable. Great for any Neuro/Psych major that wants more of a hard science look at neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes with above modifications, otherwise, if you're not dead-interested in MR imaging, the class may lose you at times. I like the presentation part, though. ",
            "\u00a0This class doesn't require a large time-commitment outside of lectures. However, lectures are super long which can be difficult for some people. Also, beware that the lectures are taught by the students in the class for 11 of the 13 lectures. If you don't have previous exposure to neuroscience and brain anatomy, you could be lost during some of the lectures depending on how your classmates present the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Take the course if you are interested in neuroimaging (crucial imaging modalities, current findings, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Of course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take it if you're interested in learning from your peers about cutting edge technology. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great way to learn about different methods of imaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. The structure of the course made it mind-numbing at times. That said, it was enjoyable to watch peers excel in public speaking! I did come away learning a fair amount about neuroimaging methods that, in another setting, I might not have committed to memory as well. If a peer is passionate about neuroimaging, needs a relaxed writing credit, and doesnt mind watching peer presentations for the entirety of the semester, Id recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are extremely interested in the material and this is your only reason for taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0No. This course is probably one of Yale's biggest STEM tragedies: it is such a fascinating and important topic yet the fact that the professors (who are true experts in the field) don't teach at all past the second or third week of class is ridiculous. Learning from each other and learning to present in class is an admirable goal, but it really didn't make the class engaging at all. That being said, if you don't mind long presentations and want a really low workload semester with only two 10-page essays (and of course a WR and advanced quantitative Neuro credit), then this might be a decent idea. Hopefully they just change up the presentation structure. ",
            "\u00a0The field of neuroimaging is fascinating but the structure of this class is terrible. With the exception of the first two lectures, every lecture was a group presentation by students in the class. While it could be useful to have a student presentation for the first 15 min of every class, it is not productive to have student lectures for 1.5 hours. It is simply unrealistic to actually learn new material on complicated subjects like MRS, fMRI and PET when it is being taught by students. As a result, I feel like I gained only very surface level knowledge about neuroimaging. Additionally, there was a LOT of overlap in the information presented by student groups. \r\n\r\nThe class has 4 main assignments: a midterm paper, a final paper, your group presentation and weekly synopses of the lectures. We were given little/no guidance about how to write the midterm+final paper, which could be good or bad, depending on how you look at it. I wrote my final paper about a neuroimaging method that wasn't even covered in class lol. Grading for the midterm paper was very arbitrary (points were taken off for not having an abstract or tables/figures when there was no rubric that specified that either should be included). \r\n\r\nOverall, I would not recommend this class unless they significantly restructure the class to include more lectures by the actual professors. If you actually want to learn about neuroimaging, you should look elsewhere ",
            "\u00a0No. This course is taught by the students. Professors expect too much from the paper assignments. "
