Dr. Irwin invited some great guest lecturers, and the guest lectures combined with the course material was a great way to receive an overview on the multifaceted disease that is obesity. It was great learning how to write a systematic review as well. I would've liked some more guidance and feedback on the different sections of the systematic review and oral presentations -- I feel like our ideas of what was expected often did not align with Dr. Irwin's expectations. ",
            "\u00a0wonderful class discussions on obesity while learning the important skill of systematic review writing ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course - definitely my favorite course of the semester! It was a great way to learn how to write a systematic review paper, and I liked how we worked section-by-section through the process. Class was engaging and I liked all of the guest speakers. My only suggestion is that I would have liked a bit more documentation (e.g. rubrics for assignments) to prevent confusion. ",
            "\u00a0It helped me understand the various layers and players involved in the obesity epidemic. ",
            "\u00a0really gave me a different perspective on obesity and how to view it from the perspective of people who are obese. Never really gave much thought to the stigma especially they go through ",
            "\u00a0This course was great, engaging, the lectures were relevant and interesting topics, and learning how to do a systematic review was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging, interactive, small class size\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes assignments were not very clear, for instance: During presentations, we were told that each person should only speak for 3 minutes. Everyone spoke for over 5. I felt like because I spoke for only 3 that I was going to look bad and get docked. \r\nImprovement: assignments should be described more clearly ",
            "\u00a0really good course. would recommend. wouldn't change much ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was the wide and in depth knowledge of the professor teaching. She was vital to the success of the class as she provided the insight of her own work in cancer epidemiology and obesity to help us understand the diversity in academic research regarding obesity and lifestyle prevention strategies. She also provided us with guest lectures which further contributed to the class. I would only have one complaint and that would be that timeline for the meta-analysis due as a cumulative project at the end was short. Sometimes feedback and even working on it seemed rushed. "

Loved so much by her students, and my favorite professor at YSPH. ",

            "\u00a0The instructor was extremely helpful and feedback was essential to deliver a quality product at the end of the semester, the meta-analysis. However, feedback on paper was sometimes sparse and in person meetings were more productive. She was flexible and I never ran into any problems with this. As mentioned before, she really knows her topic even outside her own research, and was willing to admit when she was not an expert and provide guest lectures for topics she was unfamiliar with. Overall an excellent professor. "

            "\u00a0It will help you understand that the obesity epidemic is more complex than just diet and exercise, and the likely culprit is the built environment more than anything else. ",
            "\u00a0This course was fun and interesting, and writing the systematic review was challenging but useful (make sure you pick a topic you are  interested in, and Kate at the library is very helpful for explaining how to set up search terms). I would recommend this course to anyone interested in obesity research or lifestyle interventions, or to anyone interested in learning how to more effectively write editorials and systematic reviews. ",
            "\u00a0For those interested in obesity, this class is amazing! It gave such great insight into the pressing needs facing our nation surrounding obesity and the obesogenic environment we live in. There are no tests in this class, and students are graded on participation, two editorials, a presentation, and a systematic review. I would definitely recommend this class to another student. ",

            "\u00a0You will learn a lot about obesity and its current treatments and options. You will also learn a lot about obesity policies and effective and ineffective lifestyle interventions. You will get valuable experience in writing a literature review. ",
            "\u00a0The course is useful for a first introduction to not only the topic of obesity and lifestyle prevention strategies, but also for drafting a meta-analysis. I've come out of the course knowing how to critically analyze academic literature, but also how to write a good meta-analysis. Additionally, if you are interested in the topic of obesity then this would be a great start to get an idea of what the field looks like to use in the future for a potential internship. I would highly recommend to take in the first year. "
