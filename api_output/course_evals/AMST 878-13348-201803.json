            "\u00a0The course helped me develop the ability to read a complete book within a few days and feel prepared to discuss it. I also was exposed to some major trends in the history of medicine. ",
            "\u00a0Important distinctions between histories of medicine and public health - learned to think about historical divergences and sites of tension that I did not see before. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course teaches you to think in new ways and brings up many provocative questions about the history of medicine and public health. You learn how to critically evaluate the disciplines, which is a very important skill if you're planning a future in one of those areas. ",
            "\u00a0100 percent. I would recommend that it becomes mandatory for all public health and medical students ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course helped me improve my ability to engage with long texts, and Prof. Warner encourages students to participate in the discussion in a gentle and non-intimidating way. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Thorough survey of the history of medicine and public health in the U.S. - accessible to students without extensive familiarity in the subject matter coming in. Professor Warner is an excellent facilitator who skillfully draws graduate students from many different disciplinary and professional backgrounds into conversation. He adapts the class for the people in the room to ensure that he is speaking to and providing opportunities for growth to everyone. "
