            "\u00a0furthering my skills in Japanese reading, writing and speaking ",
            "\u00a0This course continued the Japanese language sequence offered at Yale, instructing students in reading, speaking, listening, and writing the Japanese language. We learned new vocabulary, characters, and grammatical structures, and applied them to our writing as well as situational usages that might be common within Japanese society. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned more about reading literary Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0More kanji, more vocabulary, more grammar. But I feel like more than learning new Japanese, this class was about reinforcing the foundations of previously learned Japanese. At this level, I feel like even maintaining your current level is a struggle, so this class was helpful for that. ",
            "\u00a0I mostly just practiced a lot of the Japanese skills I learned over the summer. I practiced my reading with all of the stories we read and learned more kanji. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to develop my Japanese skills. ",
            "\u00a0My reading skills improved while taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0My reading abilities improved a lot; writing, listening and speaking have also improved but reading was the most significant one. ",
            "\u00a0My Japanese was definitely maintained after studying in Japan the past summer. I noticed my reading skills and drawing meaning from passages improved by taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0My reading and writing improved the most over this course. Doing difficult readings and answering reading comprehension questions took up the most time outside of class. Having to explain English words in Japanese was also very useful for me. I think my Japanese improved overall. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Readings are challenging and push you to improve, however, not enough emphasis is placed on using new vocabulary or new grammar so nothing really sticks unless you make an effort to use them. ",
            "\u00a0This course really allowed students to take the four main aspects of learning a new language and further develop them to a level where one could actually have a meaningful, drawn-out conversation in Japanese. The homework assignments are straightforward and helpful, and the professor, Koichi Hiroe, was great at answering questions and explaining complicated concepts in an easy-to-understand manner. My only suggested improvement would be that I feel that some of our time could've been spent learning more universal topics, the vocabulary of which would come up more often in any given modern-day Japanese conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class was how greatly in detail we went over the readings. A weakness is the lack of grammar practice during class. ",
            "\u00a0More reading/writing heavy compared to L1 and L2 (which I'd say are also quite speaking heavy), but perhaps that's to be expected from the higher level. You can still get speaking practice through meeting with the TA. \r\n\r\nI love the organization of the course. The course packet is very helpful, and I thought all the readings were well-selected and genuinely interesting (the readings also helped me improve my Japanese, of course). \r\n\r\nEven though the class only meets twice a week, there's always homework so it is quite a bit of work. ",
            "\u00a0The course was effective in helping me read, but I don't feel like a learned a lot more grammar. We would learn grammar, but were never made to practice in class. ",
            "\u00a0The homework was simply too much about half of the time. I especially struggled with finishing reading comprehension questions any quicker than 45 or so minutes per page. ",
            "\u00a0I think that reading comprehension was well developed in this course. However, I feel as though my other skills did not improve nearly as much. Without a structural facilitation of vocabulary learning, it was much more common to look at the vocabulary sheet in order to comprehend what you had learned, but not to then learn the vocabulary to the point of remembering. Grammar seemed to work in a similar fashion. Further, there was not as much conversation in class as I think would be beneficial. Therefore, I felt like my speaking skills actually decreased to a degree, and as someone who was not able to attend language tables, I would have liked to have more speaking time. I think the class felt more like having a specific reading or viewing regularly, but felt more ambiguous in what learning from those was supposed to look like. To the point that I don't feel like I learned as much this semester as compared to previous ones, though I do know I learned things. ",
            "\u00a0If we had more speaking exercises it would be great. ",
            "\u00a0I think that reading was a central focus, so my reading and writing improved a lot. I think more attention to learned vocab and grammar would have been more helpful. After learning new things, I felt that they were not really revisited, so it was difficult to remember them in the long run. I do appreciate that we were reading actual essays and excerpts from books and scenes from movies. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and discussions in class were very good and entertaining. I definitely felt like the class time goes fast in that it doesn't drag on. Still I would have liked more grammar practice overall. "

            "\u00a0Yeah! after studying Japanese abroad for a summer it's good to keep the skills up, however, if you really want to see improvement like one sees during a summer abroad, you really gotta put a lot of time in, moreso than what's required. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone with the prerequisite skills in the Japanese language who is looking for continued improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to continue your study of Japanese! It's a great class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to another Japanese student who wants to maintain their Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, but as with other levels of Japanese, only if you are willing to work very hard to achieve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Absolutely, and Nishimura's class is the best. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! This course felt like a step beyond introductory Japanese. Reading actual texts and watching TV shows in Japanese definitely boosted my confidence and I can definitely see my growth from the beginning of the semester to the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for sure. It is very fun and entertaining although the readings can be hard to get through sometimes. "
