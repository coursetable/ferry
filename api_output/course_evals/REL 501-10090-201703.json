            "\u00a0Anne is an energetic teaching fellow which helps make section, particularly in the early morning, fruitful and worthwhile.  She has a good command of the materials that are to be covered and strongly encouraged -- effectively -- for students to take the floor rather than have herself lecture throughout the sections.  This helps students wrestle with the material better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well organized, clear section expectations\r\nweaknesses: spoke too quickly, could have tried to engage more students in section and restrain certain students who tended to dominate discussions with their thoughts and opinions ",
            "\u00a0Annie was a kind and knowledgeable TF. It was clear that she was always well prepared for section. However, the conversation didn't flow particularly well in my particular group. I felt as though Annie could have created more structure for our discussions, which would have made participation easier. I also am really not a fan of mandatory sections that are not factored into our final grades. I was not incentivized to prepare for section because there is no participation grade for the class. I have no interest in section as a \"community-building\" exercise. ",
            "\u00a0Annie led discussion well. She helped us engage more deeply with the material. When another student derailed our conversations, she gently steered us back to the point. She read our work carefully and gave good feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a cheerful presence in section, and kept a positive attitude even when discussions lapsed. Her teaching style was helpful to me in making sure I understood the major arguments of readings and how they connected back to lecture. Her instruction could be improved by having written discussion starters that students have to complete to provide a catalyst for general discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Annie's style of teaching didn't work for me - she would open section with open-ended questions about the material, and then sit and wait for conversation to begin. In the past, I had TF's who would walk us through the main points of the reading and then begin discussion, which I liked a lot more. Our conversations in Annie's section were incredibly stilted and therefore ineffective. \r\n\r\nShe also took longer than promised to return our grades, and I never got my midterm exam back, even though I asked for it. I saw the grade posted to Canvas, but I never got to see how the midterm was graded. From what I heard, the other sections got their midterms back; and seeing it would have helped me prepare better for the final. ",
            "\u00a0Annie is really nice and definitely has a firm grasp of the material at hand. She generally moved our section along at a good pace. I really, really appreciated her feedback on my paper and outline as well -- it was very thorough and helpful, and pushed me beyond the scope I had been addressing to begin with. \r\n\r\nI have two very small constructive criticisms though. 1. Annie talks VERY quickly. Please slow down a little in class; it would just make it a bit easier to listen & process. 2. Annie asks really difficult questions, and sometimes yes/no questions. This is good if your question is rhetorical, or if you're using it as a basis for asking a different question, but it isn't so helpful in teaching/moving your students along with you.\r\n\r\nOther than that, Annie is super cool, and I really valued having her as my TA this semester. ",
            "\u00a0Good listener\r\nSometimes talks too fast ",
            "\u00a0clear engagement with us ",
            "\u00a0Annie was always helpful and willing to assist if needed. I'm not sure that it was her fault, but our section was rarely lively and stimulating. I think this was a reflection more of the readings (which as said above felt disconnected from the lectures). Comments on written work were helpful and appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Anne has a wealth of knowledge about biblical interpretation and is a great teaching fellow. She is a helpful and cheerful facilitator of discussion who encourages everyone in the group to have their voice heard, and challenges them to draw out their points to develop their thoughts further. Her comments on work are detailed and insightful, and show that she thinks and reads through the work very carefully. She is a natural! ",
            "\u00a0Anne was a good TA, although she sometimes spoke too quickly. There were times I wanted to tell her to take a breath in between her sentences in order to slow down her message a little bit. Overall I think she had a strong grasp of the knowledge and was able to engage in conversation and create conversation. She also was able to balance between differing viewpoints, although I wish she had pushed a little bit more and been slightly bolder. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was amazing. He had a way of explaining material so that it went from a textual theological body of work to a practical and applicable to ones body of thought, work, or beliefs. He always gave great feedback and helped us to wrestle with our thoughts so that we could have a greater outcome. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was great as he was available before and after classes and sections to answer any questions and for feedback on assignments. His knowledge and perspective were much appreciated in our section. However I wish there was more lecture from him in the section. The section was too much about the opinions of a select few outgoing students, who were sometimes offensive in their remarks. I heard God just isnt a woman OKAY and Almost all Catholics dont follow the Catholic Churchs teachings anyways. As a Catholic woman I felt these were microaggressions and generalizations. I didnt feel like these comments added anything to the discussions and they were not moderated. ",
            "\u00a0Scoot knew a vast amount of information regarding writing an exegesis paper. He was always available to meet and help me out if needed. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was a careful, thoughtful teaching fellow - he was well-prepared and he had good questions for us to discuss.  Scott also provided generous and helpful feedback on my written work - he really helped me focus my exegesis paper, which was enormously useful to me.\r\n\r\nThe quality of our section was hampered by the fact that we were stuck in the Common Room - this should not happen again, it really adversely affects the quality of discussion when there are people milling about and other noise going on. \r\n\r\nScott is a little low-affect - it would be good if he brought a little more energy to the section discussions - he knows so much, and he is so willing to help us learn, it would be great to be able to sense his enthusiasm even more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0He was a very good TF. Did a great job facilitating discussion and offering helpful insight into the course materials. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent at facilitation of discussion even for a very subdued group. \r\nVery knowledgable of material and twists and turns of its implications to understanding the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Scott is a great TA and provides constructive feedback.  I have a very good experience in his section. ",
            "\u00a0Great Prep before class. Well organized. Good communicator ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Best TF by far! Extremely engaging and allowed students to guide the discussion for the most part. Came well prepared with discussion questions that related to the text that we read. Available to students outside of the classroom for follow-up questions. Thank you for a wonderful semester!! \r\n\r\nWeakness: When presenting to the full class I would slow down a bit when going through the slides and encourage more questions. ",
            "\u00a0He was attentive and prepared. Professional. ",
            "\u00a0Scott was a strong section leader. He came to our section prepared, ready to engage with the material and to answer questions that were raised.  He listened to student questions well and addressed them competently, including redirecting or reconsidering them with different questions. He seemed ready to learn alongside us, asking important and engaging questions about the material. "
