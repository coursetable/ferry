            "\u00a0Lots of things about memory!! Different kinds of memory, how memories are formed, why we remember and forget, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how memory works by taking this class! I now understand the purposes of the major anatomical structures of the brain, which I hadn't internalized from Intro Psych or Social Neuroscience. I also learned how to design and run mini neuroscience experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how we think, why we think the way we do, and why we forget some things. I also learned what college classes are like in addition to how to conduct social experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about human memoryf ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the different regions in the brain that takes part in keeping different types of memories. I learned how to read research papers, and how to design an experiment. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how various parts of the brains are associated with the behaviors we make. Also, it was intriguing that our brain is so sophisticated that we still do not exactly know which parts of the brains are responsible for a certain reaction. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all the different kinds of memory, the function of specific part of our brain, and great experiments that tell us another truth of our memory. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned some basic knowledge about human memory. I knew how to distinguish different memories and how do they work in our brain. Also, I learned how to conduct an experiment. What are important in a research and how to explain your idea in a logical and neat way. Most impotantly, professor cordova is very passionate and patient. She always encouraged us to think ourselves and made the class very interesting and inspiring! ",
            "\u00a0I gained insights into psychology and neuroscience. In addition, I learned how to plan labs and eliminate environmental factors that may affect the results. "

            "\u00a0The class successfully explained many concepts and incorporated many related experiments during the process. The experiments were helpful in understanding the content. The workload is ok, and most of the homework was very creative. The exams were designed in a reasonable way which was not that difficult and helped with our learning. However, sometimes, the grading standards of homework were kind of confusing, and the content can be organized more logically. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great!! It has the perfect design!! Its very challenging but acceptable. We learned a lot from this course. ",
            "\u00a0The professor's lecturing style was incredible -- so engaging and contagiously energetic. That she posted her slides was very helpful, but the material was sometimes disjointed, with consecutive slides occasionally completely unrelated to each other. Drawing connections across the material was left up to the student, which was mostly a strength of the course because it facilitated the learning of engaged students. \r\n\r\nI thought the duration of the class and frequency it met (three times per week) were both conducive to student learning and absorption of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This class was incredibly interesting! ",
            "\u00a0The class could feel long if we did not take a break. Likewise, it was sometimes hard to speak in class. Sometimes it was hard to make connections or form full understandings of concepts or specific things because we would jump around a little. \r\nThe class had a lot of positive energy. I learned a lot in this class and it was really fun. We learned about a lot of things that impact our everyday lives. I specifically liked the classes towards the end when we learned about different applications in our everyday lives. ",
            "\u00a0Professor's lecture was very helpful, and she made sure we understand the lecture by giving us writing assignments for each class. Feedback for each writing assignment was done before the next class, and it was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that the teacher is very passionate. She made the class very inspiring and fun. ",
