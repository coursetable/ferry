            "\u00a0I learned how to become a better writer and a more engaged reader. I specifically analyzed different essays and saw the strategies authors used in each essay to communicate their message. I wrote 5 different essays on a variety of topics, which allowed me to develop my writing abilities. I also had the opportunity to critique and comment on my peers' writings. Overall, I developed language and communication skills that will greatly help me in other aspects of life. ",
            "\u00a0You learn relaxed writing techniques aka. not strict academic writing that has a specific kind of format/tone ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing works and tips for writing simply and concisely; use of concrete details. Most information was not taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course makes you learn how to use words and sentence structure more effectively to tell a story. It teaches you how to write in a style that isnt usually taught in high school. ",
            "\u00a0This course informed my approach to writing creative non-fiction. We considered tone, point of view, syntax, pacing, structure, and more when reading and writing essays about personal experiences, people, places, cultural artifacts, and activities. Though much of my future writing will be academic in nature, my approach to essay-writing, and especially rewriting, has undoubtedly improved through this course. "

            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the wide array of readings that we do every class. It exposes us to many different writing styles and many different content areas, allowing us to absorb writing tips through reading other works. Furthermore, the small sizes of each section foster a close-knit environment, in which students feel comfortable sharing their writing and critiquing other students' writings. Another strength, although it makes the course challenging, is that the course requires you to push yourself by writing 5 different personal essays on varying topics. While this is a lot of papers in one semester, it allows you to develop your writing abilities. I don't think there were many weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The essays were interesting and entertaining, but poor execution of discussion starting and not a lot of feedback. I didnt at all feel as if I was writing for my own enjoyment or taste, but rather for my professors. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Hartman made this class amazing. Her approach to the in class discussions was helpful to get us into writing mode. She made this one of my best classes at Yale so far. The writing workshops are a major strength, a weakness is the number of papers. It would be better with fewer papers, which would give more time to work on them. ",
            "\u00a0We learn to write by writing, and the greatest strength of this course is its insistence that we write and rewrite and write some more. The essays we read were often enlightening reads, as well. Though I certainly benefitted from our close analyses of our readings during our seminar periods, by mid-semester the classroom experience began to feel monotonous and stale. Perhaps the course could improve with more diverse seminar structures. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this to another student! The skills you develop in this course are essential to any field that you might want to pursue. Writing clearly is crucial. I especially recommend English 120 over similar introductory English courses because it requires you to write personal essays. The ability to reflect on your own life is very important and I found it to be extremely rewarding. You leave this course with essays that are truly amazing, after having been edited and workshopped by your professor, peers, and yourself. Take this class, you won't regret it! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are looking to improve your creative writing ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but not with Professor Hartman. Many other professors allow for students to write about what they want and in the manner in which they want. Professor Hartman would actually disapprove ideas and essentially had us write to please her, not ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it with Professor Hartman! "
