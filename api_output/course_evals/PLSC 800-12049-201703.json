            "\u00a0Great overview of the subfield, good balance between foundational works and more recent debates/issues.\r\nThe size of the class ensured a high level of engagement from us and made the discussions more fruitful. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge:  A broad understanding of American Politics, particularly as a subfield of political science.  \r\n\r\nSkills:  Reading and writing on a number of different \"types\" of American politics writings (from APD to quant oriented).\r\n\r\nInsights:  Lots into American politics. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a fantastic introduction to the graduate study of American Politics. I learned to think critically, read broadly, and write efficiently. The class discussion taught the class to summarize and discuss concepts from the reading. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great overview of the different contemporary strands of research in American Politics as well as the different research methodologies currently used in the field. "

            "\u00a0- Good balance between the foundational works of the subfield and the current debates/issues, both in the readings and the discussions\r\n\r\n- Engaged in-class discussions\r\n\r\n- Useful feedback on the reading responses ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Greatly enjoyed the structure of the course.  Covered a lot of interesting topics.  The course readings got better as it went along. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was both the variety of readings and the class discussion. The readings often described the same topic but made different arguments. This enabled lively class discussion to dissect each author's argument and determine its strengths and weaknesses. "

            "\u00a0It was a great introduction to AP.  Anyone interested in AP should take this class from Prof Hacker. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all of the graduate students including those who have American Politics as an intended subfield and those who do not. The course would serve as a great summary for studying American Politics, even to those who lack familiarity with the topic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this class whether you are in PLSC grad school, are interested in attending grad school, or simply want an overview of the research on the central institutions of American government as well as the key trends characterizing the contemporary political moment (e.g. inequality, polarization, etc).
