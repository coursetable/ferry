            "\u00a0This is an impeccably designed interdisciplinary exploration of culture and the ways it shapes (and is shaped by) the literature that emerges from a given community. The course offers great skill-building in reading secondary commentaries on culture and literature. You also learn how to simultaneously respect the \"sovereignty\" of a book as a stand-alone piece of art, but also draw conclusions from it about the lived experience of the communities that produced it. You'll certainly come out of the class with greater comfort engaging with sociological texts, and it will also provide you with endless opportunities to make connections between these academic pieces and more artistic sources. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to use fiction to think about and apply concepts of urbanism and culture to African contexts and spaces.  This application through using fiction was an innovative and interesting way in which to tackle some of the questions of the course, with regards to what cultures and urbanisms look like in African settings.  In addition to this, we had the opportunity to work on a longer, self-guided research paper, with support from Professor Newell.  This was a great opportunity and experience for me to work and engage on a topic of interest in more long-form writing. ",
            "\u00a0Increase insight into African urban cultures and broader discourse on African cities.\r\nDeveloped a greater familiarity with African literature and the ability to engage intelligently with it. ",
            "\u00a0The most important skill I gained was around how to listen thoughtfully to my peers and engage with them in conversation in real time using the text to create a rich and diverse building of ideas. ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie Newell's African Urban Cultures and Literature class was by far one of my favorite English classes that I have taken at Yale.  The course not only utilizes close readings of the text but also places the primary literary texts in larger historical and theory contexts.  In this way, the works cross a number of fields and disciplines, expanding their reach to more than just the insular aspects of the text, a problem that plagues some English classes. "

            "\u00a0Steph has put together a superb choice of texts from such a wide range of sources  1950s Johannesburg, 1970s Cairo, 21st/22nd-century Nigeria. The class material presents multifaceted, humanistic, and dynamic narratives of the African continent. And class discussion was great. We had representatives from so many different fields: English, sociology, African studies, economics, political science. Learning was a very collaborative experience, and I often found myself continuing to process the texts after I'd left class, since my classmates and professor gave me so much food for thought during our seminar meetings. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very strong course, with a lot of good class discussion and engagement, led very well by Professor Newell.  Every week, I came away from the discussion thinking about new points that I had not yet considered based off of the discussion we had.  There were opportunities to engage with people not enrolled in the course as well, the author of one of the books we read was in the discussion in one week, and we spoke with a Ghanaian artist in another.  Professor Newell provided opportunities for students to explore and give presentations on areas of interest if they wished to do so.  The reading list was very good, and all of the books were very different, interesting and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: An engaging space for fascinating and intellectual discussions!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: None ",
            "\u00a0This class is so respectful of different experiences, full of new ideas, fresh in its openness and overall amazing! The other students were great and engaged, the conversation flowed and the guest speakers were truly wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0We read books every week which could sound daunting at the beginning but you will definitely learn to read faster and develop your analytical skills. All our major readings were novels which was very entertaining. "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this class to anyone interested in cultural studies. The skills you learn are applicable in just about any field, and you'll have a great time watching yourself gain confidence with class discussions, drawing connections between primary and secondary texts. \r\n\r\nIt's also a very welcoming seminar experience. Basically the format is that you read a novel a week, plus a piece of secondary material, like an essay or a book excerpt, and then you come to class and share your thoughts on it, challenge each other, point out what you've noticed that's interesting to you. Every perspective and personality is very welcome at the table, so whether you've taken a dozen seminars or none, Steph will make sure you wrap up the class knowing how to have intelligent and mutually edifying discussions with a diverse group of peers! ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you are interested in African literature, African cultures, and topics related to African urbanisms.  The opportunity to engage with literature to answer questions about these topics was novel and interesting, and the reading list was excellently assembled.  Class discussion was well guided and always insightful.  While the workload and essay requirements might seem intimidating, it is very do-able, and Professor Newell is super open and available to help you write the best research paper(s) you can.  I communicated with her a lot throughout the process of writing my paper, and her feedback and support really helped improve my work.  Overall, a very good, interesting and not overly challenging course for anyone interested in the topics I laid out above. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A great way to familiarize yourself with broader discourses surrounding not only African literature, but also urban cultures! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Such a unique and important course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes most definitely. Steph is an amazing professor! ",
            "\u00a0Stephanie Newell's African Urban Cultures and Literature class was by far one of my favorite English classes that I have taken at Yale.  The course not only utilizes close readings of the text but also places the primary literary texts in larger historical and theory contexts.  In this way, the works cross a number of fields and disciplines, expanding their reach to more than just the insular aspects of the text, a problem that plagues some English classes.  As such, I would highly recommend ENGL 424 to any student who wants an English class that stretches the bounds of sociology, political science, and African literature.  The course mostly focuses on West African and South African literature, but no prior knowledge of this literature is necessarily required.\r\nStephanie Newell brings her warm personality and willingness to go above and beyond for her students, and this shows in the weekly seminars for the class.  What's more, she takes the time to thoroughly comment and give feedback on assignments to help students reach their fullest potential.  All in all, I could not have asked for a more impressive, knowledgeable, and caring professor. "
