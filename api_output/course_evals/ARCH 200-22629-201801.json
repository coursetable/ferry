            "\u00a0This course helped me think more spatially and begin to process large concepts in the field of architecture. It introduced us to different scales of architectural projects and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I was really pushed in this class-- I learned so many technical skills through our projects, like how to laser cut, print on mylar, use basic photoshop and rhino, and, importantly, MANAGE MY TIME! I learned that failure is inevitable-- it's more a matter of giving oneself enough time to fail many, many times. As a result, my whole approach to work has changed both in this class and all of my other classes. Really powerful stuff! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of design skills (Rhino, Illustrator, Photoshop etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I think the most concrete skills I learned while in this class was how to use various software and hardware offered in the architecture school. This includes exposure to the programs rhino, photoshop, and indesign, as well as using the laser cutters and the 3d printers. Of course, we got some practice in assembling models. However, this course was definitely not a technical course, and while I was at times disappointed, I realize the main purpose of this course is not to teach students technical skills. Projects offered in the class were accompanied by a quick, 45 minute tutorial in whatever program was relevant, but for the most part, any proficiency or even familiarity with the software is gained through figuring it out on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Design as applied to non-typical architectural forms/representation\r\nTechnical skills like using Rhino, a laser cutter, photoshop, etc. ",
            "\u00a0More than concrete skills, I gained a lot of insight about the Architecture major/School of Architecture at Yale in this course. Through the completion of the four projects as well as the large amount of time spent with classmates, TAs, and in the school itself, I learned about the thought process behind architecture as a discipline as well as what it feels like to try and translate ideas and concepts into something that can be physically held. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to solve design problems at different scales, both using analog methods (i.e. building physical models) and software-based methods (Adobe Suite, CAD), and how to explain and present those solutions to a panel of critics. I also gained more experience in looking at the world using an architectural lens, and about design practices and concepts throughout history. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of technical skills, I gained better proficiency in Photoshop, Rhino, and Laser Cutting.  \r\n\r\nI think one of the main things I gained from this course was an understanding of how much thought, intention, and purpose has to go into design. I really had to ask myself, \"Why am I doing this? Why am I making this thing this color? What does it mean?\" ",
            "\u00a0This course enabled me to develop so many new skills and insights - from sketching to forming new ideas to visualizing various scales of space. It was truly one of the most enriching and eye-opening courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This class asked us to look at the world at different scales: the human, the building, the city, and the globe. We were given a lot of freedom in the way we approached each assignment, and the reviews with the class allowed us to see how our classmates took on the assignment. We were encouraged to be creative, and given lots of feedback along the way, which helped us produce better final products than if we were left to work on our own. We learned about different ways to manipulate space, think visually, and justify concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Architectural thinking, problem solving, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This course really forced me to think, and to really evaluate every single aspect of my projects. I got a strong sense overall of how to evaluate and critique myself. I now know how and why to justify every single one of my decisions, even if they seem negligible. I learned how to take criticism in a review setting which was really difficult. I'm proud to have defended my work to a jury. I also learned how to work with vague prompts to create something unique and that I was extremely proud of. It was nice to have such liberty and creative freedom with the projects. I am really happy with all of the work I produced this semester. I learned to think about space and how we occupy that space in a new way and at so many different scales. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of insight as to the different challenges of design and architectural thinking at different scales (naturally). I feel as though my creative mind was stretched and strengthened by the series of projects, and my own discovery of the nature of these different challenges was informed by the inspiring and guiding examples put forth in lecture.

            "\u00a0This course provided a lot of support for the students and did a good job of presenting a range of ideas and information. It could have been better organized to include discussions of the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The projects were fantastic, and the class environment between students was really wonderful and unique. Sections were a perfect size, as each section gets very close, and the three different sections slowly melded together to create a cohesive social whole. It would have been nice to touch upon readings more in section, more regularly-- at some point, I stopped reading them altogether. Or just not have readings. Lectures were also nice, although I think it would be nice to have the lecture portion be a bit shorter, and dedicate more time to thinking about projects. Solid structure about when we discuss readings vs. showcase our progress would be helpful. It would also be nice for reviews to be more punctual-- I was particularly frustrated with the last crit, since it seemed like the guests had not read the assignment and therefore weren't able to make comments that fell within the context of the requirements. A lot of the advice was therefore unhelpful since it didn't take assignment requirements into account. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good course though slightly unorganized and completely unrelated to the field of Architecture. I wish Analytic Model hadn't been replaced by this. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very ambitious course since it was a hybrid studio-lecture-seminar, which made for a unique class but the way those approaches interact could be improved. Assigned readings and lectures were excellent but more time could have been spent discussing those concepts than various project reviews and updates. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this class was fun, collaborative, and nice. ",
            "\u00a0-Although structured into 4 units, there were times the course seemed to be planned on a whim: 1) the long sections did not connect to lecture; 2)  the grading scale for projects were not clear; 3) the parameters for the projects were too broad or too narrow to result in anything meaningful ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it is nothing like any other course you will take at Yale because it is so open-ended (this was the case for me at least because I hadn't taken any other studio courses). The TAs were a definite strength as well as the sections they led which were great for discussing the readings, but the lecture was pretty pointless except for when used to introduce the new projects. However, the open-endedness of the course might have also been its weakness, so sometimes I felt like I didn't know what I was even doing/talking about during the early crit stages of a project until I saw what others were doing. It was very hard for me to mentally visualize what a project could be based on the loosely related examples presented in class. I wish that the goals had been defined better before each project, because I was never left feeling satisfied at the end of a project because I wouldn't grasp the scope of the assignment until after final crits. This was frustrating because I took this class to see if I would like the major, and while for some this might have sparked curiosity, I ended up feeling like we often just made stuff with very little meaning behind it. ",
            "\u00a0We were allowed an incredible amount of freedom with each of the projects which produced a fascinatingly wide range of results for each one, which I loved. Our lectures tended to be a little long but they were very inspiring and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This course tried to pack a lot into one semester. I would have appreciated more structured time to learn new skills. 30 min to 1 hour tutorials to learn new software were often not enough. In addition, I really would have liked to have gained access to the shop and had some instruction in using the tools there. \r\n\r\nI really loved the teaching assistants! They gave very valuable feedback and assistance throughout the semester and I am very grateful. I also really appreciated the thoughtful feedback of the critics during reviews and all the free coffee. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting introductory architecture course. The idea of approaching design from different scales is an engaging one, and I think helped us to think about our environment in different ways as the semester progressed. Some of the projects were excellent, but some were weaker. The section and panorama projects were incredible learning experiences, allowing us to explore certain issues and spatial realities in depth, and in a reasonable amount of time. The human project was interesting but I think most people agreed that could have been truncated to give more time for the other assignments, particularly the globe. There seemed to be a disconnect with the final project between what we were asked to do and what the reviewers thought we were doing/ should have been doing which was frustrating. Throughout the course, it seemed like there could have been a better organization and dissemination of information, eg. giving us projection maps from the start rather than two weeks into a project, and making sure all the TFs gave ample warning before pin-ups. That said, the TFs were all incredible, especially David who was the kindest, most effective TF I have ever had in any course. I think throwing us into model making was an excellent way to introduce us to the field, and was so much more effective than any pure theory course could ever be. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course was most of it. The lectures were really engaging and informative, there was a lot to absorb and it helped us think about the assignments in new ways. The assignments were fun. They were open-ended so that we could be creative, which was really helpful, though it made it harder to come up with concepts. The reviews were fun and the reviewers were helpful. Sections were great, the readings were always interesting when we discussed them and progress checkins really ensured we stayed on top of the assignments. I think the weaknesses may have been the amount of people in the class, it made class time go over really often and the reviews really long. I don't know how this would be fixed. ",
            "\u00a0The course is entirely designed around its four assignments. As a result, it often felt like there was no overarching goal or thought behind the course. A guiding text would, I think, help to give the course more grounding, as would more emphasis on the architectural theory behind the four scales. Bimal put a lot of work into the course, and so did the TAs. I think that my disappointment lays in the fact that I thought I would be more intellectually engaged than I actually was. As far as the lectures go: theyre interesting and visually stimulating, but often lacked content. I think the course would benefit from more specificity in content and critical discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a really great introductory course. It is a wonderful transition from classroom to studio. Everyone was so supportive and intelligent and I really could see how my ideas grew throughout the semester. I love how it pushed me to think. It definitely should be rearranged time wise somehow because we often went almost an hour over the allotted class time. I think it was hard because it was such a large class and everyone deserves individual feedback and critique. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were fantastic and very dense. It felt like every moment there was some amazing insight to be gained or observation to make or example to hold onto and ponder later. They were full of compelling images and thought provoking moments.\r\n\r\nSection was helpful and was the best time to see my classmates' work-- I much preferred going through progress reports and pin-ups with my section to doing that with the whole class because a smaller group facilitates more personal investment and feedback. Would have liked to cross over ideas among the sections at some point to see what everyone was doing, but overall the sections were very worthwhile and the TFs very helpful with both practical skills and overall design ideas.\r\n\r\nThe projects themselves were compelling and infuriating because of the obsession they provoked, though that might be a characteristic of architecture in general. I found the prompts fantastic and the concept of a project at each escalating scale very engaging. I think it would have worked better to make the second project a group project rather than the first, but otherwise the projects were great.\r\n\r\nMy only small frustration lay in the evaluation of the projects. In some ways, since this course was for very beginning architects who learned the technical skills of each project as we executed them, I found the critiques' focus on craftsmanship and execution less helpful than a stronger focus on concept would have been. For that reason, I generally found the feedback of the TFs infinitely more useful than that of the guest critics. I also would have loved the opportunity to revise a project after a full critique of the idea and execution so that I could see my own progress and show what I could do with the feedback I received. ",
            "\u00a0The course started out very very strong, in great part due to the organization of lectures, desk crits, readings, and discussion sections. In lecture, Bimal would introduce a concept and go through architectural precedents and abstractly related examples. The lectures also provided a contemplative space, which became immensely helpful for developing projects over the course of the semester. At the beginning of the semester, section was well-divided between reading discussions and developing projects. However, as the course progressed, many of the lectures were cut short for project discussions as a class. Because the class size was over 30, these discussions allotted only a few minutes per student and still took waaayy too long. As such, they were ultimately an inefficient use of class time. This also caused the lectures to feel truncated and unable to convey their message effectively. One way to solve this would be to cap the class at a smaller size, but that would be a shame. Perhaps a better option would be to add class-time during the week specifically devoted to reviewing projects. "

            "\u00a0Yes this class was very interesting and fun. It was a good introduction to model making, and spending time in the school of Architecture. It was definitely challenging, but the TA's were very supportive, and it was a good environment of students who are all very interested in exploring Architecture and how it can extend to different ways of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0For those interested in architecture, absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if they know what they are getting themselves into. This is a high workload course with lots of projects that require a good amount of time to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Bimal is great and the projects can be fun (but time consuming). Critiques could be better but I only see this class getting better with time. ",
            "\u00a0Bimal is a great professor to have, with lots of field knowledge and a genuine interest in the students of the course. The design projects are fun and it was nice to have a mix of both collaborative and solo projects. The course also forced me to learn skills that were helpful but that I would not have set aside the time to learn myself. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless if you are taking this as a required course; lectures are insightful but very boring, projects unclear and mundane. Although structured into 4 units, there were times the course seemed to be planned on a whim: 1) the long sections did not connect to lecture; 2)  the grading scale for projects were not clear; 3) the parameters for the projects were too broad or too narrow to result in anything meaningful; 4) lectures were very boring and not uploaded on canvas (which is also very disorganized) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, my favorite class at Yale thus far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but because it is inherently humanistic and eye-opening, not because it will tell you much about the major. If you think you might be interested in the major, this class will open you to considering the discipline, but it won't be enough to make the decision for you as I don't think it demonstrated all that the major entails. I found the first project in this class to be a waste of time, and I think that had we had more time dedicated to the other three that I would have felt more satisfied with my work. The software that we learned (Rhino, Photoshop) in this class was extremely helpful though, and I look forward to building on those skills. I have faith that this class (this year was the test run) will improve in the future! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student that is seriously considering the architecture major, or any other student who is truly interested in design. Sometimes you learn so much more by listening and making than you would just by listening alone. This course will give you perspective and experience and some projects to be proud of. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any other student interested in deepening their design skills. However, the amount one can get out of the course is relative to the level of commitment. ",
            "\u00a0If you are taking this course it is probably because it is required. It is a huge amount of work, but definitely feels worth it at the end, and I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in creating things. With only four projects, each and every student started to develop their own style and aesthetic sensibility, which is invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I loved it and the way it encouraged us to think about issues in a new way, represent these concepts visually rather than verbally, but also have a justification as to why we chose to look at a problem or situation the way we did, and why we represented it a certain way. I like how purposeful all our choices had to be. This made the assignments very time consuming, and so the workload was a lot, but it was enjoyable work. We learned a lot of skills, how to use the laser cutters, how to use rhino, photoshop, indesign, and also just different ways of representation. Most classes at Yale are focused on verbal explanation and presentation, mainly papers, and I loved that in this class you could do research, be creative, and showcase your conclusions through visual and physical means. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course if it were to be massively restructured. As is, I felt like I put an enormous amount into the class and didnt get much out. But the idea of the class is good, and its a good way to start thinking about architectural scales. That said, if you have any skill in spatial thinking already, then you already know the bulk of what will be taught. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But it definitely takes a while to get used to. Especially the readings! In the beginning I had no idea what was going on because architectural writing really is so bizarre. But as the course progresses it all starts to make sense and come together to I think it's all about pushing through for a little while until it starts to click. I think it's a great introductory studio course. Studio is such a different working and learning environment, and I really appreciated how this class was a stepping stone into the architectural studio. Really push yourself to be creative and think outside the box. Start your ideas early and be really clear with your thoughts so you can get as much feedback as possible. Talking to everyone and learning from them is an integral part of studio so listen to everyone's thoughts because they're all valid and coming from interesting perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to another student-- I wish I could take it again! I think it is a rigorous and compelling workshop in creative thinking as well as a fascinating new lens though which to see design in its many manifestations. I would warn other students, however, that this course completely took over my academic life when I was in the midst of a project and advise them to be aware that it demands a great deal of energy and time and resources. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in architecture or design. However, I think it would be effective for students interested in any number of disciplines, as it is an examination of the anthropocene above all else. "
