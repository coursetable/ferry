            "\u00a0My knowledge of Persian improved at a very unbelievable rate. I learned how to read and write very quickly as I am a native speaker, and now I am moving towards being able to more analytically scrutinize texts. I am also happy to see that I am able to now read news headlines and understand more complex vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the Persian grammar, vocabulary, and contemporary usage in this course. Additionally, I completely reviewed the alphabet and learned the formal written tense, which I knew very little about before. ",
            "\u00a0In just one semester, I was able to learn how to read and write the Persian language. On the first day of class I didn't even know the Persian alphabet, but by the end of the semester I was able to compose essays and read passages in Persian. I also became more acquainted with the culture of Iran. ",
            "\u00a0Persian alphabet, present/past/past perfect tenses, lots of vocabulary, lots of practice speaking. As long as you do the work, you should walk away feeling like you've learned a ton of Persian. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: I can truly say that this course grounded my Persian skills with immense guidance from our professor. The repetitive exercises in the textbook actually help me remember a lot of grammar structures as well as further understand the cultural significance of whatever unit we are on. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This course is extremely fast-paced and if you aren't a native speaker, you may struggle a bit with the intensity of our exercises. Additionally, there was an unreasonable amount of vocabulary that our professor expected us to know for our exams. By reducing a bit of the workload, it will help reduce some stress levels and further encourage us to focus on the material at hand and the significance of learning Persian. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good at teaching/continuing to teach fundamental Persian conventions and improving upon vocabulary. Additionally, the integration of the formal written tense into exercises was very useful as it enabled practice that allowed for growth in that area. Finally, the course was good at helping me practice spoken skills on a daily basis both in the classroom and during language tables. ",
            "\u00a0The course books used in the class are of very high quality and the class involves a lot of participation and is very engaging. The class also incorporates a lot of different types of assignments that improve one's Persian ability. ",
            "\u00a0The course definitely packs a lot of writing and vocabulary into one semester, which is great if you want to learn a lot of Persian. I think it would actually have been helpful for learning if there was a clear prioritization of which vocab was really important to learn versus which was just helpful to know, since the vocab lists we received were really long "

            "\u00a0This class is not a gut class! But certainly, if you wish to learn the Persian language on your own will, take this class. It may be very difficult at first, but I guarantee you that you will learn a lot. Also, do not take the professor for granted as she takes the course very seriously and will not tolerate students who do not. Overall, it is a perfect course for really dedicated students! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student interested in learning about Persian language and culture, and willing to work hard. It was rewarding to see personal language growth over the course of the semester and to learn more about cultural conventions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who is interested and committed to learning the Persian language. While the workload is high, I learned a lot in the class and was able to progress from illiteracy to being able to read and write at an intermediate level. Professor Shayesteh genuinely cares about the growth of all her students. ",
            "\u00a0This class is simultaneously incredibly challenging and incredibly rewarding. As an Iranian-American and a heritage Persian speaker, I would alway feel uneasy whenever someone would ask me questions regarding my Persian skills: \"Are you fluent?\" and \"Do you know how to read and write?\". Having been raised to speak the language within the context of my home, there were gaping holes in my vocabulary (leaving me unable to discuss complex issues), and an enormous chasm where my written ability should have been. \r\nIf you want to learn the Persian language and want to learn more about Iranian cultureand are willing to put in an enormous amount of effort to get therethen yes, this class is for you. If, however, you are easily put off by hard work (and the potential for earning a \"bad\" grade), then perhaps it is not.\r\nAfter this class, I am confident that my skills have improved. Are they perfect, or at least to the level where I would ideally want them to be? No. But here's hoping I get there once I'm done with L5. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Persian is a difficult journey, but I found that the class was well worth it. Persian (not Farsi, as Ostad will explain!) is a beautiful language and one that's very fun to learn. It's also really relevant right now because of Iran's role in international politics. If you can fit Persian in your schedule you should definitely take it -- Persian is a pretty small department at Yale so there's only one time for each class, but Ostad does a great job of running the department.\r\n\r\nI felt like I was improving every week, and Ostad was very good about giving feedback to help us improve. Ostad always filled the class with meaningful lessons and activities. She also held us to high standards and genuinely cares that each student is improving, which was difficult but also helped us improve so much. Our class was fairly small and we all grew very close through practicing Persian together at the weekly Language Tables. "
