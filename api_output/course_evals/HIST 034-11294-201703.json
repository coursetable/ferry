            "\u00a0I learned all about Cuba form various perspectives. I learned how to analyze sources and literature in order to form my own conclusions on social themes such as inequality, nationalism, race, and other. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think much more critically about conventional narratives proffered to us in the US and to better synthesize information and consistently produce good history writing. I gained a great understanding of Cuban history and social issues and a framework through which to view current events. ",
            "\u00a0Analyzing skills\r\nHow to consolidate information from different sources together\r\nHow to expand my thinking to see what is missing ",
            "\u00a0This course belied the ignorant, regressive, americentric notion that, contemporarily, Cuba is a nation \"stuck in time.\" I especially enjoyed learning about Cuba's unique conceptualization of race, African identity in Cuban slave society, Cuba's prolonged decolonization and the \"debt of gratitude\" rhetoric the US deployed to maintain control, and the communists state's aggrandized visions of what socialism and militant reformism could provide. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Cuba's history, its political issues, and its culture. I have a better understanding of the Cuban Revolution, the Cuban War of Independence, and other significant moments in Cuban history. I have learned how to engage with historical texts. The course was significant to me personally because it gave me a better understanding of my background. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the history of the island where my family came from. ",
            "\u00a0Being a first generation Cuban-American, I always felt a strong connection to my heritage through my relatives in Miami, yet lacked the knowledge of the island nation I've never known. Taking this course gave so much insight to the history and culture of Cuba. What I learned was not only helpful in connecting me to my culture, but was also extremely interesting when discussing American diplomacy within Cuban history. ",
            "\u00a0I hadnt known very much about Cuba going into this course, and it taught me a lot about how to understand Cuban-American relations as well as giving me the skills to interpret news stories about Cuba ",
            "\u00a0In this course I learned the may intricacies that are involved with the revolutionary history of Cuba and the key role of minorities in these movements. Some skills I have developed include analysis of expository works and putting many different historical works in conversation with one another in order to develop a more holistic understanding of the history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Cuba's history spanning from colonialism to the present. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Cuba that I did not know before in a very profound way. The legacy of slavery in Cuba is a topic I appreciate exploring. "

            "\u00a0The course focuses heavily on class discussions initiated by the students. Thus, it can sometimes omit the 'unpopular' themes that are nonetheless important. This course is still great and highly recommendable. ",
            "\u00a0The course pushes you to challenge conventional narratives and maintain a constant level of high engagement both in and outside of class. Professor Eller expects a lot but is quite available and always willing to help if you reach out. Producing a paper every week definitely helped me as a writer! It may seem daunting but is quite manageable once you get used to it.\r\n\r\nBe prepared for social issues - race, class, gender - to figure very prominently into class discussion and readings. I thought this was a great breath of fresh air, but if you prefer to discuss only \"politics\" this course may not be for you. (Of course, as Professor Eller has helped me understand, race, class, gender, etc. ARE political.) \r\n\r\nThere is very very ample opportunity for participation, so you must come to every class prepared to engage with the material! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it thoroughly goes over the entire history of Cuba, through as many perspectives as can be done in such a short amount of time. The professor is very knowledgeable on the topic. In addition to that, since most of the students taking the class had some connection to Cuba, they were able to provide their own personal input as well. This made the course more comprehensive. The only weakness that this course had was that the current reading materials were not enough since scholarship has been unable to fully document this time period in Cuba yet. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Eller is brilliant; I savored every moment of her lecturing during seminar. Though occasionally tangential, I appreciated her insight on broader Caribbean and Latin American history, which greatly enhanced our discussions. Professor Eller expertly moderated debate, ensuring that all voices were heard and that we did not digress from the question at hand. I especially enjoyed our discussion of revolutionary and contemporary Cuba; the articles/books Eller selected were intriguing, accessible, and relevant. At the same time, I felt we spent far too much time on early Cuban history; I felt the readings were sometimes insignificant and very niche.\r\n\r\nI took issue with the structure of this course, which I think sometimes provoked fruitless debates and wasted time. Each day following student presentations, Professor Eller would take the questions of the first four students to raise their hands. We would spend the remainder of class discussing these questions, regardless of their relevance or quality. Class time could have been used much more effectively if, instead, Professor Eller had taken a census of the room; each student would name a topic/theme for review and Eller would select those which she found most worthy of discussion. While certainly less democratic, I think I would have emerged with a more nuanced understanding of certain issues had class time not been wasted on obvious or totally irrelevant questions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good survey of Cuban history. Discussion is mostly student-led. Some texts were very interesting (Capitalism, God, and a Good Cigar; Antiracism in Cuba). Professor was very nice, caring, and extremely passionate and knowledgeable. Weaknesses: Some texts were too long - so much reading that it made the class less enjoyable. Sometimes student-proposed questions were not great. Student-led presentations were too long. Grades need to be put in more regularly - still do not have a single grade in as of December 13. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of reading in this course, which made it difficult to follow along completely but I think that it's awesome how much material Professor Eller has found for the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course contains barely any lectures and is primarily class-led discussions. Every class consists of a brief presentation by a student on last night's readings and is followed by a class discussion based on four student provided questions. Although this style is conducive to focusing on what the students want to talk about, many times we found ourselves never getting to the root of the answer. I felt that those moments were perfect for Professor Eller to step in and provide brief lectures to answer those questions. This, however, was usually never done. ",
            "\u00a0For the most part I really liked the readings, but they could sometimes be a bit niche or less representative of different genders, races, or identities as I might have hoped  (however this is mostly due to the amount of scholarship on Cuba currently available in America). Overall I liked the presentation formats and discussions ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Cuba in a very engaging manner. The teacher was very passionate and is an incredible teacher. I would have liked to have spent more time learning about revolutionary Cuba and modern-day Cuba. I also feel that some topics weren't covered well because there weren't sufficient resources. I would have liked to have learned more about punishments given by and the corruption in the communist government. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of this course was a repetitive atmosphere, a few weeks in it became difficult to remain engaged in the class. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of reading for the course but it ritually becomes manageable.  Completing the readings is always rewarding as they are almost always brought up in class. ",
            "\u00a0I found the in class discussions truly engaging and absolutely necessary for the material being covered. I would push for a greater number of organized lectures from Professor Eller. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course was great if one is genuinely interested in Cuba ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Take take take this course. You will not only learn so much about Cuba but also gain a broader framework through which to critically analyze history and current events in general - especially US policy. Your writing will improve and Professor Eller is a joy. It is also a great opportunity to begin your freshman year with an intimate, discussion-based course that allows for personal feedback and guidance. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend this course to other students who want to learn about why Cuba is such an anomaly in comparison to all the other Latin American countries. Even though it is a lot of work and reading, it is an eye-opening experience. ",
            "\u00a0If you are undaunted by a heavy reading load, genuinely interested in Cuban history, and are looking to refine your writing with weekly response papers, I would definitely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to a student who is very interested in history, loves reading and discussing historical texts, or has a personal interest in Cuban history. ",
            "\u00a0Of course.  A fine example of the strength of Yale's history department. ",
            "\u00a0The readings for this course are ridiculously long. If you take this course, be ready for long nights reading dense papers. Or, if you are like me, you can learn the art of skimming and get away with less preparation during class discussions. You may also want to factor in that its a 9 am on Tue and Thurs (the following morning after Woads). You should also know that there is a two page paper due every Wednesday at 5 pm which means that you are expected to complete the reading for Thursday by that time while also leaving enough time to actually finish the paper and submit it. The final paper is also much longer than that of other classes. That being said, I still very much enjoyed this class and learned more about Cuba than I had in my entire life. Professor Eller is an amazing teacher and is extremely knowledgable for her age. At the end of term she takes us all out to dinner and we give toasts summarizing our final topic. I recommend this to anyone who really wants to learn about Cuba and its culture and is willing to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- its a really interesting history course and important to an understanding of Latin American relations ",
            "\u00a0Yes, such a rewarding course! ",
            "\u00a0Everyone interested in Latin American and Caribbean studies should take this class because it is truly wonderful. "
