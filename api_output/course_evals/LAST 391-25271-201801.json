            "\u00a0Deeper appreciation of the connections between the literatures of NOrth and South America; developed essay-writing skills in both Spanish and English ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about literature and learned about magical realism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better write about and read literature. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Adorno truly makes this course the fun, educational, and interesting class that it is; without her unique and informed perspective, the course would not have been nearly as engaging or accessible. ",
            "\u00a0I think that if this course is to be taught again there should be one version of the class taught in English and another taught in Spanish. As someone that read the works in Spanish, lectures sometimes were confusing because I had not done the English version of the reading and had very little experience discussing the works in Spanish before I was required to write about them. I think that the setup this way would facilitate improved student learning all around. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course has a phenomenal reading list and Prof. Adorno is both knowledgable and enthusiastic about the material, making this a great course. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong, a lecture/seminar mix.  Professor Adorno could lecture even more, really. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great. I loved the combined lecture/seminar format. Professor Adorno makes every class engaging and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was incredibly knowledgeable on the subjects at hand and would often lead us through meaningful conversation about the novels we read. Having the small class size also allowed for deeper conversations and more detailed understandings of the novels themselves. "

            "\u00a0If Professor Adorno is teaching it, then always. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really enjoyed reading works and comparing them and it was not an exercise I had really done before, so this was a great experience ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend.  Great books, great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Of course! The professor alone might be a reason to take the course, but the reading list set up by the professor also captures the human condition that exists between north and south america and we can clearly see the influences on one another in this class. "
