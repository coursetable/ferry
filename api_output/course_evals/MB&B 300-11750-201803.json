The problem sets were easy, which is very nice when taking a STEM-heavy course load with many other p-set-heavy classes.

            "\u00a0The strength of this course in definitely the material and how it is presented to you. However, it's a little disorganizing to have too many professor teach and change. The flow is not smooth at all. ",
            "\u00a0The material of this course is well-organized and really engaging - I'm glad they expect a level of engagement with the material that really helps you gain a strong understanding of biochemistry in detail. The lecture notes and book are well-structured and helpful, questions posted on Piazza are always promptly answered, some of the TAs and professors are really clear and helpful as well. There are always many extra review sessions/office hours before exams that are really helpful as well. But exams felt like the instructors did not want students to succeed -- points would be taken off for slight mismatches in wording between your answer and the approved answer even if your answer was conceptually and factually 100% correct. Except maybe two times, going to lecture was a complete waste of time. There was a mismatch between the teaching style of lectures and the assessments -- exams required problem solving and a degree of creativity, but lecture was spent sitting passively while a professor reads facts to you. The professors falsely believed that understanding facts would translate into ability to apply the facts to problems when we did not get practice applying these facts to problems over the semester outside of the exams. This class is antithetical to educational principles of what actually helps students learn. Lecture is not an effective way of instruction for things that require deep understanding, and honestly all STEM classes should be taught seminar-style or in another innovative style that lets students actively participate in class. Like in most STEM classes I've taken at Yale, I came away from this class feeling like I mostly taught myself the material over the course of a semester and could have gotten 90% of this level of understanding on my own. ",
            "\u00a0This class makes you memorize so much and then asks about rather irrelevant small details on exams which is really frustrating. It constantly felt like I was being tested on the one thing I didn't review as in depth as other stuff, and it was really hard to improve because the pace was so fast. I think they need to focus in on what is important and give students a more clear idea of where to focus their energies. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the midterm/class format a lot. I think Michaelis-Menten kinetics could have been explained more in depth; I would have liked a deeper derivation of the concept, along with the hill coefficient. More quantitative biochemical analysis could have been really cool - I loved seeing the Ramachandran plots but wish we could have covered laboratory analytic methods more! The parts not taught by Matt Simon could have been faster - metabolism went a little slowly and isn't terribly hard to understand. I'm surprised we didn't cover amino acid biochemistry, I've heard it is one of the essential aspects of introductory biochem. I liked hearing about the supplements, but I think professors could do a better job of connecting them to new topics in research (i.e. cancer) to get students excited. The supplement about how biochemistry academia research done by Candi was really helpful, and perhaps one on industry life could also be good. Connecting the concepts at the end of the course was especially helpful and I wish more overview could be done. ",
            "\u00a0It sometimes seemed a bit disjointed. One day we'd be on enzyme kinetics and the next it was on the structure of carbs. I know that is all biochemistry but there didn't seem to be much flow to the course. The strength was how organized it was. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked how the course was set up because it was a detailed look at a lot of different macromolecules and the metabolic pathways and how they all tied together to eventually lead to life. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-organized and the exams fair. The subject matter of the course is really interesting! All the TAs were excellent and appeared to function as a cohesive group, and I appreciated all of them. I actually liked having a number of different professors because each brought his or her own energy to the class (and are very knowledgable on their specific topics). Piazza was a wonderful platform! \r\n\r\nThough I liked the study guides, they varied in quality. Especially near the end, the study guides did not provide more guidance than the lecture slides because of how vague they were. They helped a lot in the beginning in directing me to what is most important to understand in a sea of information. \r\n\r\nI know there isn't really that can be done about it, but the class size was way too large. Though the professors had occasional office hours, the slots would fill up REAL FAST. I was in an exam when the email was sent out about the possibility of office hours and by the time I got out, all the slots were gone. I like the idea of more study halls. Though I realize this would require more time from TAs/profs, it would really help in terms of providing access to professors/TAs without having to email them individually to meet, which can be a barrier sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Koelle is a seasoned veteran and his slides/lecturing show it. Biochemistry is very difficult to navigate and it can be made more difficult by unclear lecturing, blatant incorrect slides, and other issues with some of the other lecturers .\r\n\r\nAlso, the grading in this class needs to be changed if it's going to continue with this format. Having an A-/A cut-off at 94% is absurd. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are definitely the lecturers. I think the mix of lecturers kept students fresh and marked clear changes in topics. Each lecturer had a different style but I found this to be refreshing. The main weaknesses I can think of is the structure of discussion sections. Since they are not mandatory, many students didn't show up and I felt like even though I made the effort to go, I didn't learn much/supplement my learning in lecture. I think there is a lot of potential for learning enhancement for this class that people could benefit from. Additionally, grading on midterms was suspect at best. Several grading errors were made and sometimes one's answer could be almost exactly like the answer key and points will be lost unnecessarily. I understand that consistency has to be ensured across all exams graded, but some grading errors are easily preventable and potentially costly for students. This is a trend that has unfortunately been consistent in many science/MBB classes and needs to be looked at much more closely. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing that I would personally change would be to make the course curved. I think that exams are just way more interesting when they test the limits of you knowledge, even if averages are 20 or 30 percent lower. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: prepares you well for MCAT\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of memorization, grading is subjective, TAs and professors really don't give a shit about how students feel with the material ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the lectures, which were usually easy to comprehend. Our TAs were amazing and super helpful, but I wish they (and the professors) had office hours that we could attend and ask questions. Although I loved all 4 professors, I wish their lectures were tied together more. ",
            "\u00a0Oof it was just hard. Not great to have four different professors with four different teaching styles. The first third of the course had a fraction of the material the second third did. The way we were tested was mostly fair but then there were always a bunch of small details that seemed impossible and not particularly important to remember in the first place. There was no real thread to the course: each lecture didn't really follow the one that came before in any logical way, it was more like a mish mosh of different, often unrelated topics (up until metabolism, that is). ",
            "\u00a0While having four professors specialized in different areas of biochemistry may give students more in depth understanding of the topics, because we are constantly being exposed to different teaching methods it can be a bit confused. Moreover, each professor will stress different points of the content covered, but the exams are solely written by Michael Koelle and reflects what he thinks is important, so most of the time students cannot discern what is important and what's not in the ridiculously large amount of content covered in the class. Finally, the grading system is rather obscure as no averages, means, or standards deviations or criteria for grading is shown to students and is orchestrated in such way that fosters unhealthy, unproductive competition amongst dedicated pre-medical students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: teaching team, pset style, exam style, content. This course was overall great. The teaching team (Simon, Koelle, Paulson, and de la Cruz) were a fantastic combo with a lot of different perspectives that made each unit feel well taught. The course is not a lot of work (weekly psets are like 1-3 short questions, ~1% each of your grade) outside of exams. Exam style is also nice: fair questions, 3 exams and you get to drop your lowest one (a welcomed change from last year) for 25% each. The 2 quizzes are also low stakes and not that difficult. Overall the grading structure was very fair. Course content was fantastic! The content is very thorough and covers a lot of both the principles and the experimental techniques. The supplement and the end of every lecture was nice stress-free way to learn cool concepts and make the content more medically relevant. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: due to the competitiveness of the class, it can be hard to get that A. I appreciate that this course is no longer on the 20/20/20/20/20 breakdown but also the grade ranges on the exams were pretty tight; missing more than a few points could knock you out of the A range. ",
            "\u00a0I can tell the professors tried to make this class a good experience for the premed students enrolled, but in that pursuit, they made the class into a useless game of memorize-it/forget-it. As someone who was taking the course for the love of biology (and not to get into med school), I was very disappointed in how the tests favored those who could memorize every fact on the lecture slides over those who actually had a comprehensive and intuitive understanding of the material. This class was a travesty of pedagogy. Give the 200 premed MCDB majors their own class where they can memorize all they want and claw their way to an A if they need it so badly. The MB&B department should serve MB&B majors who actually care about understanding and studying biology. \r\nAlong this vein, the grading was also garbage. Many of the questions on the midterms were scenarios (I assume in a lukewarm attempt to make students think beyond memorizing). However if you responded with anything other than the key words the graders were looking for, no points were awarded. Even describing in precise detail the basis of a physical phenomenon without naming it would result in no points. In these scenarios, deeper understanding was actively PUNISHED instead of rewarded. Although I see the importance of understanding jargon, penalizing understanding at all, even when memory is lacking, is despicable. A working understanding of biochemistry is not demonstrated by knowing the name of the first enzyme in gluconeogenesis or even by memorizing the pKa of every amino acid (which all real biochemists have on charts at their lab benches anyway). It is demonstrated by the ability to understand, think about, and solve problems in the abstract. Anything missing from the translation of the abstract into a precise system can be found via Google. Michael Koelle, if you hate rote memorization as much as you say you do, the first step you will take is removing the \"fill in the blank\" section on the first page of every exam you give. If you don't, you are a hypocrite. ",
            "\u00a0I love the fact that lecture slides are printed out and we can make notes on them during the class. I also like the fact that it was taught by multiple faculty. I appreciate the visuals, but there was just a lot of information and I found it really hard to know which ones were the most important facts to focus on for testing. ",
            "\u00a0The exams in this course were impressively incapable of testing one's mastery of the material. It was painful to study for hours, master the class content and then be given an exam that in NO WAY represented my understanding of the material. It was a shame, and it honestly made me very unenthusiastic about the course. It made me dread going to class.  I knew that regardless of how many hours I would put in to study for the exams, I wouldn't perform well. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were the 3 lectures that De La Cruz taught. Simon did a decent job but he mainly taught the very basic material at the beginning of the semester that could have been taught well by most MB&B professors. The weaknesses are literally every other aspect of the course. Koelle is an awful professor who has structured the class awfully. The problem  sets are useless and not helpful or on stuff that wasn't really taught. Discussion section was a complete waste of time. The TAs (at least my TA) was not helpful at all and could be described as apathetic at best towards the students. The lectures that Paulson taught were alright, but oftentimes very rushed. Everything Koelle taught at the end of the semester was just very very very poorly taught (on purpose? You can never know with Koelle). This class has the most competitive classroom atmosphere that I have ever experienced at Yale, which is really fun. The tests (particular the first exam) are very poorly written to the point that they are not representative of the material learned/how much you studied at all. The fact that class is \"not curved as to not pit you guys against each other\" is laughable considering how obviously Koelle was making it to get an A or A- in the course (surprise, thats the same as a curve, wow). I could go on but there's really no point. The only way to fix it would be to have someone other than Koelle run the course. ",
            "\u00a0I think the exams given  did not really test the information that was taught in the course very well (with the exception of the third exam). the first two exams required knowledge of very specific content that was not necessarily presented as relevant in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - think the teaching is well taught, but very hard to intake information during lecture and understand it because it's not enough time to comprehend each slide ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were generally engaging (with a supplement at the end of each that put something from the course into a bigger-picture perspective), and the professors were all very clear and receptive to questions. The lecture slides were also clear and well-organized (and printed for you!) so they really do make studying easier. Metabolism also was presented in a way that made a traditionally complex topic eventually feel somewhat intuitive, which was surprising! Studying for the exams was also made easier by the fact that we were given three years' worth of past exams for practice. It seems that the profs really do want people to succeed. For pre-meds, I can think of two concerns: there's very little curve (which is usually fine as the exams are very reasonable, but is different than most pre-meds' previous science courses and takes some getting used to), and there is slightly less material covered than the MCDB course and with different emphases (ie, no nucleic acids in this one, because it's designed as a two-semester course). Also, the grading of exams could be somewhat fickle (ie, some TAs give very generous partial or full credit while some are extremely nitpicky). ",
            "\u00a0great class! best science class ive taken at yale ",
            "\u00a0It is fine engagement of professors lacking but difficult with such mundane material ",
            "\u00a0Strength is how organized it was. Koelle is SUPER on top of this course and made sure that this course was manageable. I liked the Psets this year. I read in the past that they were useless because it didn't prepare people for exams. This year, the questions were all from past exams, which really made the homework assignments useful. I also really appreciated the exams this semester. Compared to last year where there were 2 midterms that you couldn't drop, I thought this one was fantastic because you take 3 midterms but can drop one. It definitely distributed tested material better and also lessened the pressure. Another strength were the peer tutors. Ben Koleske is a literal genius and also so kind. He was basically the only one answering questions on piazza and I loved having the opportunity to use this website to ask questions. Ben provided SUCH thorough responses and also in a timely manner. I liked Uche as well, and felt he also really knew his material. I also really appreciated Uche because more than one occasion, he went out of his way to email me to say he made a mistake during his office hours and wanted to make sure I knew the right answer. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses are sections. I felt that because they were optional, there was less care that went into them and it felt not helpful to go. I understand some had worksheets, but I felt like these worksheets were just copied lines from the study guides. I'm not sure how to address how sections could be better run (perhaps there could be more explanations of a certain topic (e.g. the ATP synthase) and then example questions that apply this protein complex to different situations rather than having question sheets that are way too broad). I struggled in this class, and I feel like biochemistry would really benefit from enrichment like how the biology modules are run. I felt like the entire time I was in the class, I couldn't keep up or perform as well as other students who have taken other courses at Yale related to biochemistry that provided an edge. ",
            "\u00a0This course is super well run; the teachers are enthusiastic, tests are fair, and the concepts are cool. No complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The fact that we had 4 different lecturers rotating was rather disadvantageous. It felt a little disjointed because each person lectured differently and expected us to study for the material in different ways. I think either reducing the number of lecturers or standardizing instruction would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Expectations are very clear and the lectures are engaging. Discussion section wasnt very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught excellently. I was nervous about the changing of faculty over the course of the semester, but they turned out to pass responsibilities over to one another seamlessly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Quizzes. They were extremely fair. Weaknesses: Problem sets. They did not reflect the relative difficulty of the midterms. Also, I believe having 4 different professors throughout the semester was both a strength and a weakness. One had to adapt to different teaching styles and thus different test questions. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness is that at points, the course does feel like it lacks cohesion since it is split into lectures by four different professors. Not every topic will fit together with one another and sometimes, this leads to an odd-ball topic that feels like it was just thrown in there. One strength is that the metabolism portion of the course is very well taught and very cohesive. For those lectures, everything fit together perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-organized and well-taught. The instructors made an effort to make their material engaging and clear. The workload was manageable and the tests were fair. Don't really have any complaints. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course is that the professors were really good, especially with how they rotated to encompass teaching the different kinds of materials. The only weakness of the course was that the material was a lot and the tests sometimes went more in depth than the material covered, making the class more difficult than anticipated. ",
            "\u00a0The test format was frustrating in the sense that if one knew the correct answer but didnt express it in almost the exact way as was on the answers key, one could get points off. ",
            "\u00a0Improvements: more review sessions for exams, making it clear what students are expected to know rather than just assuming that students can memorize every words spoken during lecture and more. Strengths: you certainly learn a lot of biochemistry! ",
            "\u00a0The course makes it clear what information should be known, but we could use more practice before the final synthesizing concepts together so we are able to approach questions with the required problem solving approach. ",
            "\u00a0I didnt really enjoy switching between lecturers. I really enjoyed Prof. Koelles lectures. ",
            "\u00a0This course has incredibly interesting material, but it could be structured better. Some lectures felt like they were attempting to fit as many facts in it as possible, while others felt like no content was being taught at all and the professor was just trying to fill the lecture time. Also, while having different professors is interesting because they are experts in the field they are responsible for, needing to get used to different lecture styles every two weeks was a bit challenging, especially between the first and second midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were study guides, practice exams, Piazza, peer tutors, and overall organization. Weaknesses were how highly exams were weighted and how questions were often worded ambiguously, which made answering well difficult even if you knew the content. ",
            "\u00a0having 4 people teach this class was way too many. No one was that great at teaching, and we never got the chance to properly acclimate to a teachers shortcomings before the next one came with a whole new set of them. I think Michael koelle was rather disrespectful and unempathetic towards students, but also decent lecturer. Candice paulsen is really kind, a little monotone. Enriques lectures were messy but since its his first time thats understandable. ",
            "\u00a0This by far one of the worst courses I have taken in college. The the idea of focusing on the general concepts rather than memorizing details is a good one. However, it is impossible for the students to do that because of the way material is taught. There is too much unnecessary detail that unfortunately is tested on exams. Despite what the lecturers said reading the book in not helpful at all. I feel like I did better on tests what I did not understand the concepts and just blindly memorized the content. I think that this is a clear sing of this course being a disappointment. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very organized. I particularly like the metabolism part of the class because the content circled around a set of themes. ",
            "\u00a0The fine details are insane to memorize ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the 3 midterms and final schedule is definitely way better than the 4 midterms schedule for mcdb biochem, since they have such little turnaround time between exams. Also, it was super nice that this class was only twice a week at 11:35 so you could sleep in. Also, the supplements at the end of lectures were super interesting and provided both a nice way to integrate the material with our future science careers, as well as reducing the total amount of material crammed into one lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would have been way nicer to have section in WLH closer to central campus. Because section was optional, so many people didn't go. I tried to go every week because my TA Josh would help explain things really well and would make worksheets that had lots of critical thinking problem solving exam type questions, but there were times I just had no motivation to go up science hill for late night section. As per grading, it's really annoying that every midterm is only out of 67 points, which doesn't leave very much room for error. If you miss one part of a question 2-5 points, that drops you down a whole letter grade. Especially in such a class where there's no curve, it's really hard to do well when every problem is worth so many points. Last thing is that there were so many professors (4), which made it hard to understand each of their teaching styles. By the time we get used to one teaching style, the profs switch and it's back to square one again. It would be better to have only 2 profs ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the material is great. I really enjoyed what we learned. Weakness- went by way too fast. As it is with many higher level biology courses, they try to shove too much information in each lecture then expect us to understand it to a very specific level, which was quite difficult. The exams this year were graded I think a little harshly/the grade cutoffs were a bit harsh (had to get a 94% on an exam to get an A) since the exams were out of so few points, so maybe in the future if they had exams out of more points I think that would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the test makers should make it clear that the test will test on minute details as well as more important concepts. While the mantra was that the course was not about memorization, there was minutiae from single images on single slides without accompanying text that appeared on the fill in the blank portion of the exams. You basically must memorize everything on every slide to cover your bases. ",
            "\u00a0Well-taught by professors who were clearly engaged ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is how much material is covered. Everything else is basically a weakness. Having 4 different professors teach was confusing for me, because each professor had a completely different lecture style and it was kind of difficult for me to switch so often (every 3-4 lectures during the first half of the course). The biggest weakness for me was Professor Koelle. I really did not enjoy his lecture style, as I felt his slides were often confusing and verbose. He would spend a lot of time on parts of lectures that were more simple concepts, yet speed through the very difficult mechanisms (\"because we need to focus on the big principles!\") yet subsequently test us on those exact complicated mechanisms in very high detail. He was also often condescending when students would ask him questions, in lecture and on piazza, and that personally discouraged me from wanting to reach out for help. It was quite disappointing, to say the least. ",
            "\u00a0I think a big improvement could be having more comprehensive problem sets worth a larger percentage of the final grade. This would 1. encourage students to stay engaged and keep up with the material and ask more questions before exam time and 2. make the exams (and studying for them) less stressful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were structured extremely well  they were fast yet efficient, and presented at the right level and speed. However, I felt that this course way too competitive. Some level of competitiveness was expected because most of this class is made up of premed students. But I still found it to be much more competitive and stressful than it should have been. At the very beginning of the semester, we were told that there would be no strict curve (in order to reduce competition) and that if we were to all do well on the exams, then all of us would get As. But midway through the semester, we were apparently doing too well on the exams, so the exams were supposedly made more challenging. I found this disappointing because it made students even more stressed and competitive than before. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course could be improved by covering a smaller breadth of information, because I feel that its massive breadth sacrificed important depth of understanding. There was simply too much information given to be able to have a good understanding of it. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the lectures, each lecturer was so great and I learned so much from them, none were difficult to follow. Another strength was the amount of past material available for us to practice with. I loved the camaraderie I felt with my peers, and the support I received from the teaching staff! I felt like everyone was rooting for me! ",
            "\u00a0A strength of the course was the weekly problem sets, which helped us gain a better understanding of what the exam questions would look like, while simultaneously forcing us to keep up with the class. One weakness of this class was that the discussion sections were not particularly helpful. They seemed to focus on details that were not very relevant (for both the exams and for general understanding). Perhaps it would be more helpful if the instructors helped develop worksheets for each discussion section, as they are more aware of what the class should be focusing on. A couple of exam questions were also kind of confusing, and difficult to interpret without background knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is optional section. I was a big fan of being able to use section as a resource when I needed, and having the flexibility to skip when things got busy. I also enjoyed having several different lecturers which made the class more engaging. The supplemental lectures at the end of each class were also very appreciated. The peer tutors were also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very clearly organized, and all of the lecturers were clearly very knowledgeable and intentional about their teaching. \r\nThe major weakness of this course was that four different professors with very different teaching styles, slides, and study guides taught it. During this semester, I definitely felt there was a transition period where I had to first get used to a professor before fully engaging with their material. However, I was most shocked by the differences when reviewing for the final, as all of the material between the professors was presented so differently, make it more difficult to comprehensively review and understood. In the future, I think limiting the number of instructors would help and/or normalizing powerpoint slides and study guides. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: by reinforcing a few key systems repeatedly I ended very familiar with the concepts from multiple angles\r\nWeaknesses: I dont love the multiple professor system because it is harder to understand a professor and find a good system. ",
            "\u00a0Very well-structured and regimented, clear feedback and communication from the lecturers. Exam load felt kind of intense, and sometimes it was unclear why some material on the exams was important. ",
            "\u00a0The metabolism part came together pretty well, but otherwise not a ton of positives. Cycling through professors made the class feel super disorganized, and you never knew what to expect on exams. Literally, we would spend like three weeks in class on one concept, and it wasn't tested on the exam. They chose instead to have a big question hinge on memorizing a detail that was mentioned in one class on one slide. Sure, it was cool to learn mechanistically how stuff works, but get ready to come out of exams feeling furious. Koelle keeps preaching concepts, and how there's no need to memorize every detail. Bullshit. I walked into the exam feeling solid on all concepts and having memorized just about everything worth knowing, and that was nowhere near enough. The only way to succeed is to learn all the details by heart and regurgitate them on paper. For a class that endlessly touts mechanisms and concepts, it's hugely frustrating and disappointing. I can't speak for MCDB biochem since I didn't take it, but that's what I would choose having taken MB&B. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organized and structured. The lecturers are pretty great, although the lectures are a bit long to sit through. I liked that the p sets were similar to the exams. That was great. However, I would have appreciated if the p sets were longer or contributed more to the overall grade. I thought that the tests were pretty representative of the material, but my main dissatisfaction with the course comes from the grading policies. Another student and I studied together for every exam, the same amount, the same way. I was confused how I once I got a B+ and he got an A on a midterm, and then for the next time I got an A and he got a B+. The point is that the differences in performance is not due to how much time spent studying, its more a factor of if you have a good test day and how the TFs would grade. The grading margins were also very slim (~3 points between A, A-, etc). After every exam, I had a really hard time predicting how well I did because the grading seems so variable.  Additionally, I thought that section was usually a waste of time, although I attended because I felt bad for my TF that so few people attended section. Head professors should help TFs plan section so that it is more structured. Overall, this class felt like one of the most cutthroat premed classes, which I was disappointed by.\r\nI thought that the class covered so much material that the supplements, while cool, were not really necessary. The students hardly paid attention to the supplements and I could tell that the professors were strained while sharing the supplement because of the restlessness. I think that the numerous MCDB and MB&B guest speakers that are brought in from other research institutions provide students the opportunity for self-selecting students to learn more about applications of biochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: built on itself, the final units did well in combining what we had learned before so I felt I had a comprehensive and not scattered understanding.  The summary sheets we got from each lecture were very helpful in directing my studying.  Some of the instructors were very engaging.  Particularly, I loved every lecture from Prof De La Cruz.  And Prof Koelle's lectures on metabolism at the end of the semester were very elegant in breaking down super complex topics. \r\nWeaknesses: We went into a lot of detail on certain topics but almost no detail on others.  Sometimes, the topics of choice felt very arbitrary.  Also, I didn't how we had so many instructors.  There is certainly some value at having each professor speak on their area of expertise, but I think it was at the expense of consistency in the class experience, which I value. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized. \r\nThe slides could be written better. Sometimes they include too much redundant information, and intentionally omit the more important information. For example, the Q cycle is often tested on exams, but the professor didn't mention anything regarding the location of Fe-S cluster or Cytochrom Bl Bh during class, nor is there a slide that gives proper emphasis to the information. \r\n\r\nI sometimes feel like they are intentionally hiding the information so they can test us on those in exam, which is stupid. ",
            "\u00a0Often, you had to teach yourself the material which was hard when the slides did not provide the necessary information or guidance on what the takeaways were. There is just so much material covered in the class and so many details. ",
            "\u00a0*Strengths:* Professors were extremely knowledgeable, and I appreciated that in class professors were willing to discuss short-comings of current biological theories/models and introduce nuance and the direction of current research; transparency of post-exam Canvas announcements describing how people did, what most people missed on, what was happening next, and the projection of raw exam scores to ones overall class performance; TA's were extremely knowledgeable; tests were given back quickly; Piazza was always active with very fast and detailed replies; most of the material was very interesting and given detailed coverage; homeworks were drawn from past exams and were very doable; readings were appropriate and semi-optional and the reading schedule was given in advance; lecture slides were very well done (clearly a lot of effort was put into making them) and all testing material was from the lecture slides; 1-page lecture slide study guides were also helpful; TA-led review sections before exams were very helpful.\r\n\r\n*Weaknesses:* Grading on exams was unpredictable and arbitrary. Deductions were taken with no explanation. There were times when I would give a response and see that it initially got full credit only for those marks to be crossed out and given a 2/5 with no explanation. Other times I would hold my answer up next to the key and see no difference, and when I brought it to several different TAs, nobody could tell me why I lost points. Also if you write a valid line of reasoning different than the key (but acknowledged to be valid by the TAs) you get absolutely no partial credit, even though in class they discuss and emphasize the variety of biological factors that work in tandem to yield a result/ phenomenon. They grade for vocab words and phrases, and frequently I would write the vocab word two sentences below (i.e. electrochemical concentration gradient), but lose points for not including the buzzword in my first sentence (i.e. concentration gradient) because they subtracted points as they read and didn't go back. There is also no recourse on your grades if you write in pencil. I erase a lot, so pen is pretty much not an option if I want my test to be legible, so even though I felt like I was repeatedly penalized unfairly, I had to just accept whatever grade was on the page even if other TA graders said that I probably should have gotten full credit when I got less than half. I completely lost confidence in the grading for this course and changed it to a credit/D because I felt like what I wrote on the test was only loosely correlated to my grade. Professor Koelle emphasized that \"the course is not about the details but about the overarching concepts,\" but there were a bunch of questions that were kind of directly against that: filling in the literal mV values on the side of an action potential graph (had to be the exact ones from the tiny graph on one slide), and regurgitating the mechanism and role of specific residues of chymotrypsin for ten sentences. I thought that overall, the grading policies made this course unenjoyable, which is a real shame as in general the material is very exciting. I also felt like the metabolism unit we did was kind of boring, just due to us spending lots of time on one single metabolic process, cellular respiration, rather than spending a good amount of time on several metabolic processes. I understand cellular respiration is very important, but it's the same metabolic process that Ive covered in HS Bio, AP Bio, Yale Intro Bio, and now MB&B300, just this time even more in-depth, learning 30+ enzyme and intermediate names. ",
            "\u00a0The course had four instructors which could be confusing at times, as they all had different teaching styles. Strengths included lecture packets, the clear communication of expectations, and lots of support from the TAs and the peer tutor, Ben. ",

Every time I went to lecture with Koelle, Candi, Matt, or Enriko, I felt like I left with a much better understanding of the material. The study guides and section were really helpful for getting me up to speed on what the main ideas/essentials for this course was, since there was a lot of information floating around, and it could be hard to tell what was important to know and memorize and what was less important to memorize.\r\n\r\nWeakness: There could've been more reinforcement of key points that the professors wanted us to know. Maybe this is spoon feeding too much but I feel that there were important concept brought up during lecture that we had to know, and it was potentially easy to gloss over those details. So maybe a ",

However, it is one of the most satisfying courses I have ever taken. I truly feel as if I have gained a wonderful foundation in biochemistry, which is one of the most useful ways to think about how the human body operates. I obviously cannot compare it to the MCDB biochem class because I did not take that course, but from everything I have heard this class is a much better choice.

The material is really interesting and learning about it was really cool. The problems with this class are the same problems found in 90% of STEM classes at Yale / at any university so that probably won't discourage anyone from taking the class. It should probably encourage students to lobby for better STEM education but it probably won't do that either. ",

Though there was a lot (and I mean A LOT) of memorization, there was a focus on the processes and underlying concepts. Unfortunately, it's just a subject where there has to be a baseline amount of memorization before understanding of concepts... The professors, TAs, peer tutors are awesome! \r\n\r\nThe professors seem to be aware of how sensitive people were about their grades in the class, and did an admirable job facilitating the class to be as fair as possible. The syllabus is clear and the class is well organized, with assignments released well ahead of time, making them very easy to maneuver into my schedule. Also, you can drop a midterm (!) which reduced my stress. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate that the professors released past exams from the last three years. They did a wonderful job of recycling relevant big ideas on this year's exams while not copying directly from past exams. The availability of the past exams made the class so much less socially stressful because there are a lot of other classes where only a select portion of students will have access to past exams because of friends or otherwise.

Definitely take this course, regardless of whether you're an MB&B major or not (it counts for chemistry and MCDB for sure, and probably as electives for other majors too!). It was really cool to see the theoretical aspects behind lab techniques we use today, and the applications of said techniques in biochemical discoveries. ",
            "\u00a0You probably have to take this course. I honestly could not say whether it was easier or harder than the MCDB version. This one was at 11:35 on T/Th in LC, and the other was at 9:25 M/W/F up science hill, so... What I will say is that I felt like I was always being tested in this course (three midterms, drop the lowest score, which was a change from years past), and the other one had four midterms, which probably would've made me feel that way even more intensely. Honestly this course was exhausting, but there's no great way around it! ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are an MB&B major, if you are doing this for pre-med just take the MCDB version of this class. ",
            "\u00a0Most students who take biochemistry are doing it as either a major or premed requirement (or both). However, you should be excited for this course! It has easily been my favorite STEM course at Yale so far. The teaching team is great, the content is engaging, and the grading schematic is pretty fair (especially this year after the improvements that they made). Weekly psets are super easy and take ~10-15 minutes, 2 quizzes are very easy if you study, 3 midterms but you get to drop the lowest score, and a cumulative final. Overall I think this was both a fair and fun class that does a good job of making the basics of biochemistry easy to understand and tries its best to make the content medically relevant. ",
            "\u00a0If you're a premed with a good memory, take it. It'll be what you were made for. If you actually like biology, be aware that this class might make you hate it. I was an MBB major when I went into this class, and now I am considering Chemistry or Physics over Biology. It really is a gross game of \"Who Memorized the Lecture Slides Best?\" instead of something intellectually satisfying. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about metabolic pathways, sure. ",
            "\u00a0DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. Take the MCDB biochem course instead. Unless you are ok with taking random exams that do not actually test your mastery of the material, do NOT take this class. The TFs seemed like they were learning everything for the first time and were not helpful. ",
            "\u00a0No, this course is designed to make students fail. Succeeding in this class is near impossible unless you already have talents in biology or chemistry. The TAs were condescending, rude and unhelpful. The way the tests are formulated don't test if you know the material well but instead they test if you can figure out the professors tricks. Instead of celebrating students when SOME did well, they made the test harder and raised the cutoffs. Not only is this punishing students who do well but its discouraging to students that don't. This class is harder than necessary for no reason at all. ",
            "\u00a0LOL. No not at all. First of all, if you have the choice between this class and the MCDB version, choose the MCDB version (this is coming from an MB&B major who had to take this course no matter what). Let me tell you why. I have probably never hated a course so much at Yale (and I love biochemistry and it is the field I would like to go into for the rest of my life). When you walk into the class the first day, they might as well flash a sign that says WELCOME TO BIOL 105 because thats what this class feels like from start to finish (what's the common denominator....... oh right.... Michael Koelle, as that soon will become apparent). In the first lecture, Koelle will tell you a cute lie about how he believes \"students should be working together so therefore the class is not curved and nobody needs to compete for grades.\" That's cute unless you have played Koelle's game before in BIOL 101 and you know what will happen next. Koelle proceeds to make the course *the most competitive and stressful classroom atmosphere* that I/you will experience at Yale in terms of grades. Matt Simon (very friendly and nice) teaches the first few lectures. He does a good job and you feel (falsely) secure. Enrique De La Cruz (hilarious and awesome) teaches 3 lectures on enzymes and kinetic and does a fantastic job (also handled a political interruption with professionalism and tact that few professors [i.e. Koelle] could). Right around this time, the first midterm occurred. You will feel confident until you go in to take the test realizing that Koelle wrote the entire test and Simon/DLC had nothing to do with it. The first exam was one of the most poorly written exams I've taken at Yale and not at all representative of what you could have studied for. You anxiously wait for your grade, only to do pretty decent. Only to *then* realize that Koelle sends out an email with \"likely\" grade ranges based on performance on the exam. You quickly realize that you need to do nearly *perfect* on the exams to get a good grade on the class (the exams are out of 67 points and often times a 97% was needed for an A, meaning you could miss 3 or 4 points [the equivalent of two words to a sentence - no partial credit at all] and still get an A]. \"Don't worry,\" the email will read, \"Sometimes students bomb an exam question so you can drop one exam and these sort of things won't affect your grade.\" Dropping your lowest score is the laziest way to insert grades into canvas and pretend to \"help\" us when all it does is actually just inflate the class average and hurt students performing at average all semester (oh yah, we \"don't look at averages in this class\"). Paulson starts teaching, lectures get exponentially harder, you study twice as much for the second exam, perform the same frustratingly because there are people in this class who came from rich backgrounds who took biochem in high school/other colleges/self studied/are genius/etc. and you will never beat them (especially if you are first-gen, low income, yay Yale). Koelle starts teaching metabolism (horrifically) and the lectures become so convoluted you will spend a week studying the third (very hard) exam and still perform badly in comparison to the rest of the class (fyi at this point, the class average was a 85-87% and that was set at a B/B- per the emails [oh yah no curve, silly me]). Then the final rolls around and is so difficult that *everyone* does badly unless you literally had 3+ weeks to prepare because the questions are that specific. Overall, nothing in this class is that difficult to understand, but there is so much information thrown at you (poorly) that it is impossible to keep up unless you clear your ENTIRE schedule for this class and MANY aggressive premeds will do so, making the class one of the most frustrating experiences ever. I came out of this class hating the MB&B department and wishing I hadn't taken it because it completely destroyed my interest in biochemistry. Hopefully 301 is better ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course over the other biochemistry course because of the way it is designed in terms of grading (not all your grade is dependent on 4 exams). ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this class if you are premed or if you are in biomedical engineering - which both are the case for me, which works out nicely. From what I've heard of this class compared to the other biochem class, the curve is harder, but the class is more organized. I'm studying for the mcat now, and I think I really did learn the material well for the exam! ",
            "\u00a0Do it if you have to ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it! Most pre-meds are choosing between this and the MCDB version; of course no one has taken both, but after talking to friends who took the other one it seems that this one was generally more pleasant (as long as you don't mind taking a cumulative final - I would consider how your finals period is going to be scheduled ahead of time, because it is a lot of material to review.) Although it covers slightly less than MCDB, I think it's still pretty good MCAT prep and really helps you learn how to think through biochemical problems in a more synthetic way. I personally liked that there were psets and quizzes, because it holds you accountable for reviewing the material more regularly. ",
            "\u00a0yes! take even if you're not MBB and have to take biochem for premed/ bio ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you have to, but be prepared for the heavy amount of studying you need to do. This class doesn't have much work (psets are meant to be done in 30 minutes) but the amount of studying you need to do is insane. It's a lot, but if you love the material, it will feel so fulfilling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, super interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone taking this is doing so because they probably need to. The only other option is the MCDB biochem. While I have no first hand knowledge of the other course, I did enjoy the approach taken to biochemistry in this course. ",
            "\u00a0No; I would take the MCDB version. This class has barely any curvec, and there is a huge emphasis on rote memorization rather than larger concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course to any student who is interested in a purely biochemical understanding of how life works. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It gives you a good foundational understanding of biochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student interested in or curious about Biochemistry who has fulfilled the pre-reqs. If so, the class is a great intro to an interdisciplinary field--I loved finally getting to apply what I learned in Chemistry to Biology and think more deeply about things I'd studied previously, like enzymes. The lectures were usually pretty interesting, and the professors made an effort to focus on conceptual understanding and making connections rather than memorization. This class assured me that MB&B is the right major for me. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if its necessary for a major or premed requirement because studying for these exams and doing well can cause a lot of stress. ",

            "\u00a0This course takes a lot of work to do well in. ",
            "\u00a0This is course is extremely interesting. I would not recommend to a STEM-averse person, but if you have any interest at all in how your cells perform their functions this course is for you. In the end, the concepts do not even tend to be hard but exams and midterms will try to blindside you by asking about specific details of stuff only mentioned very briefly. The therefore does require some studying but the payoff is very good. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in medicine, this class is really helpful background. Be prepared to spend time memorizing trivia though. ",
            "\u00a0Not if youre not interested in a ton of rote memorization. There are some interesting things taught in this class, but there is also a tremendous amount of just plain old memorization, and its not very connected to the MCAT if thats what you care about. The MCDB version is less hell and curved better, and youll still learn a lot there. Would recommend that. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0No. If you can take any other course to fulfill you requirements do so. You will at least learn information that will be interesting and not only a ton of details that you will forget the minute you leave the testing room. ",
            "\u00a0Biochem is challenging but I found the material really rewarding. Sometimes tests were kind of stressful, but it's not graded on a curve anymore so you don't have to worry about \"beating out\" the intense pre-meds in the class. I thought the class went really well and you probably have to take it as a major requirement or for pre-med, but it's pretty good! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Even though its hard lmao ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this class over mcdb, Michael Koelle is such an incredible professor. His commitment to making the class the best it can be is really inspiring. Much better than mcdb I think. Also, if you can, try and take this class in conjunction with physiological systems! And please take other guts during the semester with these two classes bc they're really a lot of work. Biochem and physio tie in with each other really really well, so much that you'll learn parts of the same material in both classes, only at a microscopic level in biochem vs a macroscopic level in physio. It's super neat ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would take this one over the MCDB biochem just because it's 3 midterms and 1 final exam instead of 4 midterms throughout the semester. I think having the final helped wrap up all of the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0If you are in the MB&B major, they have to take this.  If you are in the MCDB major, and are considering taking this over the MCDB biochem because you heard it's better/more challenging/better taught, do not take this course. I made that mistake. It genuinely is not worth it, I promise. ",
            "\u00a0Likely it is required for you. I would recommend this over MCDB, especially if you enjoyed orgo or like learning the chemistry behind the things youre learning. I also think its so much less stressful to have a cumulative final than to have your grade based solely on four exams. ",
            "\u00a0Chances are, you have no choice but to take this class. But to be honest, Biochem does give you much of the fundamental knowledge that you need in future courses and in research. Although theres so much information to know, the lectures are really clear and easy to follow. Despite the de-emphasis on rote memorization, Biochem still relies heavily on memorization. I know how much STEM professors hate the word memorization, but there really isnt a way to avoid that. With that said, a lot of Biochem is very interesting and you will only have to rote memorize relatively few things (e.g. amino acids, pKa values, fatty acid structures, glycosis intermediates & pathways). But definitely be ready to put a lot of hours into studying, especially right before exams! ",
            "\u00a0If you're taking it, you probably have to take it. It's a good class, much better than orgo, but it's still extremely difficult. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Every biology major must take this. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn about biochemistry!! I took this one instead of the MCDB version because I knew it wouldn't be motivated to study unless there were weekly psets. The psets aren't difficult but are a good reminder to review the material from lectures each week. The teaching staff are always willing to help !!!!! I loved this class so much! ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if you are deciding between the two biochem classes. The week-to-week workload is super light (3 question psets), and the overall environment is much more relaxed. I am a MCDB major and found no difficulty with the material and definitely had a better experience than my friends in the other biochem. ",

            "\u00a0Its hard to compare this course to the MCDB version. I took this one as an MCDB major because I wanted to take another class that was at the same time as the MCDB version. I would recommend this course only to premed/MCDB/MB&B majors because the environment is not really conducive to students who are just taking the course for fun. Its a grinder. ",
            "\u00a0This class made some very dense material tractable and understandable.  It's easy to fall behind in the class - the pace picks up suddenly and quickly around the halfway point.  But if you stay on track, you will find the experience of this class rewarding. ",

The course itself is not bad  the material is interesting, the professors are top-notch, and theoretically the tests are doable  but test grading (the tests are written by the TAs with oversight from the professors, but scored by the TAs without oversight by the professors) was very unfair and unpredictable from student to student (but this might change with next years TAs), and the tests had a large memorization component on vocab words and specific names of enzymes and intermediates which was very boring. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who knows they are interested in biochemistry or needs it for the MCAT. As an SC credit I wouldn't say it was very fun though, and that is coming from a person that actually enjoyed biochemistry to begin with. ",

There's a lot to memorize, and sometimes that can seem arbitrary, but MBB300 brings in a pretty good balance of memorization and conceptualization for biochemistry. I'm not to love memorization, and I wish there could've been a little bit less of memorization, but there was a good amount of conceptual thinking to make up for it. You will learn to think like a biochemist, especially in the last couple weeks, in which everything you learned in the entire semester comes together as you analyze metabolic pathways. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course compared to the other biochemistry course because it focused more on concepts and themes rather than mechanisms and I felt that really helped my learning and understanding of the subject. The tests are also fair and there really aren't any trick questions. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class if you're interested in biochemistry - definitely the best biology lecture I've taken at yale so far. For me, it really pulled together the last few years of science (intro biology, chemistry, organic chemistry) and made it all feel worthwhile. For the first time, I felt like I was learning beyond the what - we learned how and why things happen. Super rewarding, involves a fair bit of memorization but not unreasonable, workload is manageable - it helps to keep up lecture by lecture, but is also totally possible to cram before the midterm and do well. As compared to the MCDB version, I felt that we went much more in-depth and overall had a much more positive experience, but probably didn't cover all of the content that they did, as this course has a 2nd half. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would. Biochemistry is a difficult topic, and these professors are trying to make it as understandable as possible. There is a lot of organized support for the students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0The class is overall pretty good; it's nice to be able to drop an exam, and there are additional non-exam grades to give at least a little bit of buffer even though they aren't worth very much. The lecturers are all pretty good, but the material does get very difficult and conceptual by the end. There isn't a lot of actual work for the class, but you definitely have to keep up with studying/doing the readings (for me at least) to stay on track with the material. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this biochem course to another student. I think the quality of learning it facilitates is really excellent. It certainly is challenging, but I found it rewarding. "
