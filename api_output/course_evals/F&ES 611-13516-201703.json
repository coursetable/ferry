            "\u00a0I developed a good base understanding about the wide range of topics within data science. Thanks to this class, I know about a wealth of data sources, I know about some helpful tools for working with this data, I understand the language that's used in this field, and I know much more about the resources available if I choose to learn more about any of the topics that we covered. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge of where data science is applied in the environmental and private sector. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about data science and different types of data analysis. I feel like this was a class where I didn't just learn about the course material but about something that's going on in the world and impacting my life (big data collection, etc). Also learned about resources at Yale, which was unexpected but appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This course offered an introduction to a wide range of critical skills in data science / computational social science such as data scraping, visualization, mapping, network analysis, and others. It discussed sources, applications and interdisciplinary dimensions of these skills. It was extremely helpful in getting a broad overview over what is out there, and how to incorporate single skills into one's work. Attending this course also encouraged me to attend additional workshops organized by the DH Lab and CSSSI. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an overview of the exciting field of Data Science in social research. These insights have been inspiring for me and have made me rethink the use of large data for research. ",
            "\u00a0Prior to taking the course I did not have any experience in coding, graphic visualization programs, or data analysis. I walked away with a great understanding of the vast number of programs and data applications available to compliment my future career in environmental policy. For social research to inform effective policy, there is nearly an unlimited number of resources and data collections to analyze and learn from, many of which make more efficient the work currently being done by all levels of government. The course discussions also provided me with valuable tips from professionals working at Google, Yale, and other organizations to help guide my research and exploration of data tools. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I gained a greater understanding of the application of data science, the ways in which it is being leveraged across the university, and the resources available to me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class went beyond my expectations. I thought that we would simply do an overview of topics within data science. The readings were useful, interesting, and relevant. Guest speakers provided valuable insights into how the tools that we read about are actually used in the field. The class also provided resources if we wanted to learn to use those tools, or access unique sources of data for our own projects. ",
            "\u00a0It covered more than I thought it would, which was a good thing! I learned a lot about how to present information effectively. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to get a general overview over computational social science methods and debates - the course exceeded this in a number of ways, for instance by offering additional opportunities and interdisciplinary perspectives to deepen some of these issues. Beyond offering an introduction then, this course can alse be used by participants to either get a more profound understanding of single methods or to engage in the many criss-crossing applications of single methods, both of which are useful and also require the kind of intellectual and sharing-oriented space offered by this course. ",
            "\u00a0My expectations were to go a bit deeper into the tools or data scientists. I did gain significant knowledge but not as many skills. This was how the course was designed and can see the course as a launching point. As a graduate level class I think going deeper would be a good modification and requiring an individual project. ",
            "\u00a0My expectations for the class were exceeded. After taking this class, I feel empowered to access information previously not considered to inform future policymaking efforts. Prof. Farrell and students in class were all beneficial to my learning as they shared resources, tools, and advice. In addition, the course connects students to the vast resources and centers available at Yale including, the Digital Humanities Lab, Yale Institute for Network Science, Yale Center for Research Computing, and more. ",
            "\u00a0They aligned well -- I understood this was a survey/seminar course and thought the class did a great job of aligning with those expectations. "

            "\u00a0Some of the readings were pretty repetitive. I enjoyed the guest speakers but would have liked to hear more from Justin. It was great to have perspectives from multiple schools/fields. Overall I liked the course and would recommend it to people who are interested in social sciences or \"big data\" type issues. ",
            "\u00a0This course features a number of outside guests, which is provides participants with both insights into theory debates and concerns and a hands-on perspective from different applications and fields in computational social science. The selection of these outside guests will necessarily vary each time the course is offered, which reflects ongoing debates and new fields of interest. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great overview of the core parts of data science, good guests\r\nWeaknesses: Not having a final project requirement ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include discussion of an entire field often addressed at FES through courses focusing on one particular program or tool such as R or Python. The course reviews many types of data analysis such as text-as-data and GIS; delves into programs best suited for effective visuals such as tableau, python, and others; and connects students with resources and advice to begin learning about these programs and their applications. Prof. Farrell also offers his full support to student research projects, advising the class on how to enhance research through data analysis. ",
            "\u00a0For what the course set out to do, I think it achieved it well. Depending on what expectations individuals have coming in, however, they might experience strengths and weaknesses differently. Some strengths included the real world applications/research examples, guest lecturers, and dialogue around ethics. I think it could be improved by having an expert on ethics or law come in to share his/her perspective on some of the issues we raised in class. I also thought that some of the reading were less accessible than others but overall were a good balance. "

            "\u00a0I took this course as a public health student, and it was fantastic. I would recommend this to any student who does work related to social sciences and wants an approachable introduction to the world of data science. ",
            "\u00a0It's really different than other courses at FES, which I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0I strongy suggest that PhD students in social sciences in their early years take this course - currently, it seems there are not enough intro do data science courses and too many people have no clear idea of what these methods are and how to apply them. After taking the course, I think it is even necessary to engage in this kind of conversation to be better able to keep an overview over these developing fields - so perhaps this course should even be a requirement for early phd students in sociology and political science. ",
            "\u00a0Be sure to take on a specific project to really get the most out of Justin's knowledge and the course itself. ",
            "\u00a0Whether you have 0 experience or several years of experience working with data programs and tools, this course will open your eyes to the quickly developing field of data analysis for social research. The data and applicable tools exist to enhance all fields of study and Prof. Farrell's unique experience and research help put the possibilities into perspective. For students without a background in data, Prof. Farrell makes himself available at office hours, before and after class, and off-campus to discuss projects and research, and can connect you with the proper tutorials, resources, and training to begin using the programs and tools discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0This is more of a survey course, so unless you take initiative outside of class, do not expect to leave with a skill set in coding, NLP, etc. I would recommend taking this course if you are unfamiliar with data science and looking to explore what it is, how it can be applied to problems you are interested in working on, risks/ethical considerations, and resources available.
