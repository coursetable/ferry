            "\u00a0A small portion of what I learned in this class will be helpful moving forward in a career of sustainability and natural resource management. Mostly though, you learn how to make the most profit from natural resources, not what is actually better for the environment. So be wary of that going into this class. Little of what Mendelsohn lectures and promotes is based on scientifically sound information. You also learn how to exploit climate change for profit; the professor explicitly states that his and the economically ideal amount of global warming is 4 degrees celsius; he's also said global warming will be highly beneficial mostly until 2050, and then we should start mitigating greenhouse gas emissions slowly. Though it's possible to account for human suffering in economics, this course definitely does not do that. For example, when Mendelsohn was lecturing that global warming will be beneficial to colder places because it will increase crop yields (incorrect) and improve tourism, I asked about the indigenous populations that live in the Artic who are suffering greatly because of rising temperatures, sea level rise and loss of ice. He answered that those populations are small and insignificant enough to leave out of calculations. I'm not truly surprised, but this course teaches economics that pretends that it's impossible to include climate justice and protecting vulnerable populations. Like most economics, it also grants corporations the same rights as individual human beings, so just be clear about that going into the course. ",

            "\u00a0While I am very interested in environmental economics and all of the course topics seemed important, I felt like the way the material was presented was very broad and lacking in substance. Professor Mendelsohn often presented conclusions from his research without much justification. For example, he discussed how geo-engineering might be the climate control method of the future. I have no problem with learning about controversial opinions, it was just frustrating to have to accept these claims because Mendelsohn glossed over the details of the environmental chemistry and the economic calculations. He was quite bad at explaining mathematical equations - I wish he had spent more time discussing the derivation of the formulas he presented. ",
            "\u00a0the lectures are arent helpful for doing homework. Sometimes for the psets, we never learn how to do it and the only way of getting it done is by going to office hours which they only have once a week at an inconvenient time ",

            "\u00a0This class had very few strengths. The overwhelming number of weaknesses are too many to list here, but among them are: the professors lack of understanding how to engage with students, poor communication with his TFs, poor communication regarding his expectations of his students, confusing lecture style, confusing and poor lecture structure, and biased messaging without know-how in engaging with students who disagree. ",

I asked the very first question of the whole course halfway through the semester, and I had to raise my hand, wait five minutes, and say the professor's name before he noticed me. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the mandatory section  I think it helped me keep up with the material. However, it was annoying that you couldn't start the P-Sets until after section because no other resources with formulas/methods were posted. I had section Thursday nights while the only office hours were Thursday afternoon, so if I waited until after section to do the P-Set I would have no opportunity to ask for help. That being said, I would often go to office hours and try to do the P-Set without any resources, but this all would have been made much easier and simpler if  along with the p-set  a relevant list of formulas would posted OR if there were office hours on the weekend.

There is no textbook, and you don't really know how to study, since there are basically no practice questions. The final exam was totally random, all the studying of problem sets I did was basically worthless. I have absolutely no idea what grade I'm going to get. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: TAs\r\nWeakness: The structuring of the course is odd. Office hours were held before 4 of the 6 sections, which was a big issue because the material on the problems sets generally tested what we learned in section rather than lecture. It's hard to ask questions on what you haven't seen/fully learned yet. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is the largest issue with the class. His success in environmental economics, while commendable, makes the course seem bias to his approach to environmental economics. He is not critical enough of his conclusions and that is dangerous for a diverse class of students with limited knowledge of either subject who then take his conclusions to be empirical fact. It is of course an economics class, but a more critical lens to these topics would have been preferred. ",
            "\u00a0The professor seemed to include only specific information that was more economical than environment focused/aware. He would lecture without taking questions and did not take recommendations for changes to the course. I asked for an extra office hour option for working on the problem sets because the only one we had was BEFORE the section in which we learned everything in order to complete the problems. He was not open to changing when the TA's mentioned improvements either. The topic and approach are so cool, but it was not what I envisioned.\r\nThe lectures were good, engaging. Sections were the most helpful when it came to understanding topics covered in class or for the problem set work. The midterm exam was disproportionately more difficult than the final, in my opinion. Most of the problem sets had little to do with what we were learning as concepts in the class, the material presented in lecture was more qualitative and the problem sets were qualitative so it was difficult to understand how to begin the problem sets before going to section. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes the material felt hand-wavy and arbitrary. I think the material could be improved to be slightly less abstract ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it provides insight into the ways economics can be used to think about environmental challenges. For EVST majors or anyone going into the green economy or climate policy, it is helpful to learn about the ways in which economists view climate.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness of this course is that it feels strangely defeatist at times, with simplistic answers to complex issues that leave you wondering about the accuracy of the assumptions that are made. For example, Prof. Mendelsohn shows graphs mapping the cost of CO2 emissions mitigation (without explaining the assumptions that the models make about future technological improvement, damages linked to climate change, etc.)  and argues that we should not act in a way that is coherent with a 2C warming scenario because \"it is too expensive - adaptation is much better. Let's aim for 4C.\" Really?? ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The content of the course is extremely interesting\r\nWeaknesses: I think the way the course is taught needs to be improved. These are the issues I had, which are also issues that many other students voiced as well: Many of the Psets were poorly worded and had a number of issues that made them difficult to solve properly (not because they were difficult but because of wording errors and logistics complications). There was only one office hours a week at a time when most students have class. The better time for office hours would be on the weekends or on Friday (after all the section classes have finished). The only time I could've gone to office hours was before my section had even met for that week, meaning I didn't fully know what I needed help on. Lastly, I think the delivery of the content in the course was at times very dry and while the content itself was incredibly interesting, it was delivered in a way that didn't make it engaging. More statistics, graphics, videos, contemporary content would really enhance the course. ",
            "\u00a0More focus on pset material in class ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that the information is presented well and the sections are very helpful. A weakness is that most of the learning for the problem sets was done in section, not lecture. I feel as though the information would be better learned if it was presented in lecture and reinforced in section. "

After taking the course, it's easy to understand why the global environment is being destroyed, since people use economics theories like some of the ones taught in this course. Lectures were infuriating because of the blatantly scientifically and ecological incorrect foundations for the economic calculations, but I suppose it's important to understand how little economists know about sustainability.
