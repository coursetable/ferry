            "\u00a0Continued exposure to high-register Japanese forms of speech and writing. Cultural and historical knowledge also included. ",
            "\u00a0I learned formal spoken Japanese in various contexts, while augmenting on grammar, vocabulary and advanced expressions. I was also able to correct my pronunciation and intonations in a more natural way, and was exposed to Japanese social and political issues through in-class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I further improved my Japanese (especially conversation skills) while also gaining useful insights into the world of Japanese politics, history, and economics. "

            "\u00a0The course was very fluid and individualized to each student's needs, which I greatly appreciated. The topics were very interesting and Prof. Hiroe has been very attentive and supportive. ",
            "\u00a0There are ample opportunities to practice speaking Japanese, both during class and during weekly conversation practice sessions with the professor as well as a TA. Class is also organized so that it's easy to keep up and continuously make incremental improvements through the weekly quizzes (which aren't too time consuming as to be tedious, but push students to stay on task just enough), rotational weekly speeches , and daily discussions. \r\n\r\nAnother plus is that we got to meet some interesting guest speakers who came all the way from Japan and practice speaking with people with different accents throughout the semester too.

            "\u00a0Our class had good relationships among the students, so it was quite enjoyable I think due to the fun banter among us between us during conversations. I wish I had more time to review all of the words we were learning during the year. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor's tailoring the topics to our interest in various aspects of Japanese culture engages the students a lot and created vivid class ambiance. The personal session with the instructor is helpful in having communicational practice as well as receiving feedback from the instructor. Overall, this is a very inspiring and useful class. Professional expressions and phrases regarding debating, news presentation and interviewing with Japanese people are well practiced through scenarios and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It is a great way to improve your spoken Japanese, which is difficult to do so without guidance, and the course is specifically tailored to help students through that. The topics of in-class discussions are also adjusted to meet students' academic interests, so if one would like to practice speaking Japanese in a professional context on topics they are interested in, this is the right course. It gives background information about Japanese society and culture as well, which was a nice plus I did not really expect to be this big. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course. Take it if you want to focus on your speaking and listening abilities. ",
            "\u00a0Would absolutely recommend this course to those who wish to improve their Japanese conversation and presentation skills in a high-level setting. "
