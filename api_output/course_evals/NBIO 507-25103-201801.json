            "\u00a0I was able to develop as a critical thinker. This course challenged me to think deeply about a given body of work. To really evaluate what the presenters are showing me and to ultimately form an opinion on the work that is evidence-based. It also taught many of the tenants of different research topics. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided a broad exposure to various neurological disorders, both degenerative and developmental. The material covered in the course ranged from basic method/techniques used in biomedical research today, to clinical therapeutic development/application, along with everything in between. The structure of the course was very helpful for anyone interested in studying neurological disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent survey of neurological diseases and the methodology used in their diagnosis and modeling. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Not too much of a time commitment (with regards to out-of-class homework), while having the opportunity to learn a tremendous amount from world leaders in their respective fields of research. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to young (1st or 2nd year) researchers interested in neurodegenerative diseases "
