            "\u00a0The great thing about this course was that we started before and ended after the Vietnam Wars themselves, allowing for more context and understanding. I also learned how to conduct historical research and use Yale's archives. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of the Vietnam War, and an introduction to college history and college writing ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to analyze and contextualize historical texts, as well as gaining valuable research and speed reading skills. You learn a lot more than just \"The Vietnam War\" in this class, and it's extremely rewarding overall ^_^ ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the history of the Vietnam War, and especially the factors that caused it and prolonged the conflict. The course provided valuable insight into the role that the French played, as well as the Norths ideology, that makes for a good interpretation of the Vietnam War overall. ",
            "\u00a0This course not only taught me about the very complicated buildup and execution of the Vietnam War, but also many ways to effectively and cohesively convey arguments through writing. I was surprised to see such rapid growth in the way I convey arguments over such a short period of time. The course also opened my eyes to the notion that all historical events can be looked at through multiple, equally valid perspectives--something that I think will serve me quite well in life. ",
            "\u00a0Detailed understanding of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, beginning with a brief look at French Indochina then moving through initial policy, escalation, Vietnamization, and withdrawal. How to write history clearly and thoughtfully. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to research through the archives and also how to draft a research paper in history. I learned about the origins of the Vietnam War and about American foreign policy seen through the war. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about history and to analyze a single period through many intersecting perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn about the history of the Vietnam War and why it became a significant event in world history. ",
            "\u00a0Good overview of the Vietnam war from many perspectives (N + S Vietnamese, US, French). Deep knowledge of research paper topic. Introduction to research methods. ",
            "\u00a0Reading and taking in knowledge quickly, following and participating in a fast moving discussion. "

            "\u00a0Overall excellent course.  I often found the the Elliot readings slow and not engaging.  I wish the course incorporated more scholarly articles to supplement the Young book ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting material, especially if you want to learn more about the War FROM ALL SIDES! Does a great job at looking at the war in different facets, as well as guiding you through valuable college skills like speed reading and researching. Professor Engerman is da bomb and is great to talk to in office hours. HE ALWAYS GIVES COMMENTS ON ASSIGNMENTS AND WANTS TO SEE YOU GROW!!! <3\r\n\r\nWeakness: Ah, I can't blame them but the pronunciation of the Vietnamese names were a little cringe-worthy. Some assignments were realllyyyyyy long and hard to get through (peep that 150 page reading in two days) ... but you can manage it if you work ahead a little. Some discussions were a bit lackluster and repetitive, especially towards the tail ends of the class. But that's not exactly the fault of the class/prof, as it's a class discussion based seminar. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Engerman is a great lecturer and his chosen readings are very effective and engaging. However, the seminar meetings did feel oddly structured at timesfactual questions were asked rather than interpretive, and would always culminate in a brief summary or lecture. Because of this, the seminar were extremely helpful in  catching us up with readings, but for those  looking for more, it felt that there were no extensions of the arguments within the reading. Additionally, the role of the United States is heavily emphasized, and may leave those wanting to focus on Vietnamese politics wanting. ",
            "\u00a0I quite enjoyed the layout of this course with the quick responses followed by short and long essays. I also really appreciated the freedom we were given with the final assignment. By allowing students to choose a topic that fascinated them within the realm of the Vietnam War, I believe, it produced far more interesting topics and a higher level of connection to the subject matter. With that being said, the only suggestion I would have would have been a bit more clarity with the quick responses. It would have been good to garner a stronger idea of what the professor was looking for at an early part of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I thought Professor Engerman designed the syllabus with great care and it showed. The texts (including a novel, which was incorporated very well) and weekly writing prompts were engaging, and he was always well prepared for class. He gave a good amount of feedback on assignments  from overall structure down to line edits. \r\nThe Nixon-era units felt a little rushed compared to the Kennedy- and Johnson- ones. Occasionally it felt like he was fishing for a specific answer to a question. But these are nitpicks. Overall I thought the class was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very interesting material, great professor, \r\n\r\nWeakness: similar formats of lecture may make it monotonous ",
            "\u00a0I think that more factual historical background (provided by the professor) would help contextualize all of the different aspects of this specific historical period. I also think it would be interesting to have students read their own (primary) sources on a specific aspect of the period and then come together in a discussion about it, rather than all students reading the exact same text. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include Professor Engermans ablilirt to keep our class motivated and interested while some weaknesses include he readings that were assigned throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a welcoming environment and generally pretty well structured. The readings were interesting, and I believe I'm leaving with a thorough understanding of the war. The quick responses were nice and low-pressure ways to consolidate assignments and earn a writing credit. However, I think not all the information/helpful small facts/dates etc. will stick as much as I might like because we never really had to learn them ",
            "\u00a0Often I did not have enough time to formulate points. Topic was covered in depth each class. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes. There is a fair amount of reading and writing involved, but if you're interested in the Vietnam Wars, this is a great class to take. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0OMG YOU HAVE TO TAKE THIS CLASS! It's one of the best writing credits around. I've compared notes with friends who are taking other WR classes and this is wayyyyy easier, better structured, and teach you more than the ENG 114 or equivalent classes.\r\n\r\nSuper interesting subject, great teacher, and small class size. What more could you ask for?\r\n\r\nSidenote: Make sure you preregister if you're interested! Don't slack and regret missing this opportunity :) ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for those with particular interest in US experiences of the Vietnam War, military strategy, and Vietnamese experiences (particularly in the South). \r\n\r\nThe course does not cover or go into depth with: specificities in South Vietnamese governments, North Vietnamese politics or experiences, China or USSRs role, the pressures of the Khmer Rouge, or the post-war experiences/legacies within Vietnam. ",
            "\u00a0I would happily recommend this course to any student wholeheartedly. Not only is such a detailed perspective of this period of history invaluable to any global citizen, but Professor Engerman's tremendous guidance provides each student with crucial skills to convey arguments effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, highly engaging and interesting course that develops history analaysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I found the class very interesting and engaging. I think this course is also a great introduction to college writing and forming an argument. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I loved this class. The material was engaging and Professor Engerman was well organized. ",
            "\u00a0I would definetly recommend this course because it enlightens students on a major time in our history while simultaneously keeping the workload very sensible. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I am glad I got to go deep into all aspects of the war, particularly because it remains relevant, and I didn't learn about it in high school. The first year seminar aspect was also nice. ",
