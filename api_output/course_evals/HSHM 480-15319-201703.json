            "\u00a0Everything about everything. Your learn why science is problematic, why colonialism sucks, why apartheid was crazy. It is everything that you think it will be! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the history of science and its relationship to racial politics in south africa. I absolutely loved taking this seminar, it was my favorite class this semester! The concepts and ideas we discussed in seminar apply to other contexts as well which is very exciting. ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely taught be to be a better writer and listener. I also learned to question myself and others. ",
            "\u00a0My history writing improved TREMENDOUSLY all thanks to Efe's guidance and extremely high standards. I was both intellectually challenged and intellectually fulfilled. This course helped me develop a topic for my senior thesis, and even gave me some foundational research for it! ",
            "\u00a0Where do I begin? The course took a nuanced look at both history and science. In most classes, we tend to study these subjects in a bubble, ignoring the inconsistencies and the contradictions that lack of contextualization can present. However, in this course, we were forced to confront our uneasiness and to ask ourselves the hard and most basic questions. What is science? What is race? How is history formed, developed, and told? How is race perceived? Though I cannot confidently answer all of these questions, I also believe the current definitions that we work with are inadequate. There is just so much more and this class forced me to recognize that it is not simple! ",
            "\u00a0Beyond learning about the themes and topics, this course taught me how to think critically. I began to see how seemingly unrelated course concepts meshed together and applied not only to our class but the larger historical and global contexts. It also taught me to question the \"easy answer\". "

            "\u00a0THIS CLASS IS GREAT! You build such a dynamic with the teacher and the rest of the seminar. You get have the most eye opening discussions and also listen to cool music videos that are relevant to the class ",
            "\u00a0A huge strenght was the environment that Efe fostered in which everyone had a voice and we felt like we were having a 13 week-long conversation. The readings were engaging and each week also had an artifact, (which was a song, an artwork, a video,etc.) that we incorporated. We started seminar with a key word which we drew from the readings and the brief discussion of the artifact in the start- this was a great way to hav everyone speak and engage with their favorite parts of the reading as well as connect it to the theme of the week. Each week we also had a different seminar leader which was a huge success too. I just loved it all. ",
            "\u00a0There are no weaknesses!  Reading load was totally manageable, Efe is incredible, and the other participants in the class were engaged! ",
            "\u00a0There were absolutely no weaknesses with this course-- it was a perfect and extremely rewarding class in my opinion! ",
            "\u00a0The course was filled with so many interesting readings and artifacts. The first day of the course we watched four contemporary music videos that touched on some of the subjects that we would be studying this semester. I was blown away. This is also how we ended the course, comparing our knowledge from the beginning to the end of the semester. Each week, we had readings from historians, philosophers, activists, novelists, and comedians and an artifact to study. The artifact was a piece of art (photography, painting, mixed media...etc.) that was closely related to the topic of the session. History is composed of narratives, and sometimes exists beyond a book. The art mixed with the readings provided a complex and intricate way of looking at the material. To be honest, I only wanted time with these people and this material. It was such a great time, that I never wanted to leave! ",
            "\u00a0I really liked that each week had it's own district focus and that was continually expanded beyond the traditional notions of \"science\". I also liked having a new section leader each week. I feel like the readings were a fair length each week and that Efe did an amazing job of asking questions and moving the discussion. "

            "\u00a0YES! unfortunatley the course will not be offered. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Everyone should take this course, especially if Efe teaches it again. It's one of those classes that you walk away from every section in awe. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It teaches history differently than other Yale courses. I learned so much from this class, and honestly loved attending it. The material is important and fascinating. Honestly, the best class i have taken at Yale! Take it! ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES ABSOLUTELY. A true gem of a course. I am so happy to have had the privilege of being taught by Efe Igor. She devoted so much time, energy and care to this course and it was evident in the syllabus and the quality of our discussions. Efe's course proved to be both intellectually challenging and intellectually fulfilling. This was probably the best history course I have taken at Yale in my three years here. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I am so sad that this course will not be offered next year - one of my favorite courses at Yale by far! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. I want to take it again! The material and concepts that Professor Igor introduces are so rich that it would be possible to mine them for years; to turn them over and over and approach them from all different directions, and to never be bored. I was always on my toes in this class, always intellectually stimulated, and completely engaged.\r\n\r\nProfessor Igor is an amazing professor: warm and caring, but also intellectually exacting and highly professional. She is very rigorous in her teaching style, in a way that really pays off for the student. Her feedback is super detailed and it is really clear the amount of time she spends thinking about and working on this class. Her love for teaching is incredibly inspiring, and it makes you want to do the best that you can. Also, she is just a really cool person who brings in all kind of mixed media to class in order to keep things interesting, including music videos, TV shows, and cupcakes. "
