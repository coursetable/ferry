            "\u00a0Math 120 really focuses on multivariable calculus in terms of vectors, vector fields, line and surface integrals, among other things. The class does a good job of teaching some theory and application of what you learn, but it's a mostly technique/calculation based class. ",
            "\u00a0Plenty of vector calculus, calculus in 3 dimensions, line integrals and surface integrals ",
            "\u00a0Multivariable Calculus\r\n--> vectors, gradients, tangent planes, flux, curl, and a ridiculous number of topics ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me many of the things covered in multivariable calculus in a deeper and more comprehensive manner. Having taken multivariable in high school, I expected this class to easy, however it was actually immensely difficult and challenging in a positive way because many of the concepts are covered in a lot of detail. From this class we learned about parameterization, different coordinate systems, differentiation and integration in multiple dimensions, line integrals, limits and so much more. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good conceptual understanding of the topics covered in math 120. I feel that the course did help me understand the concepts better than other courses at other universities did. ",
            "\u00a0Greens, Stokes, Gauss's Theorems ",
            "\u00a0I expanded my knowledge of multivariable calculus, and especially gained insights into its applications in physics. ",
            "\u00a0We covered all common topics of traditional multivariable calculus, including vector fields, line/surface integrals, Green's, Stokes', and Divergence Theorem, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the basic and more complex multivariable evaluation techniques. My understanding of 3-D mathematics improved greatly and I was exposed to several connections between the mathematics of this course and their physics applications. ",
            "\u00a0You get a standard multivariable calculus class, but it's important to keep in mind that a lot of the material is really only applicable to physics or engineering. For instance, much time is devoted to learning how to calculate the flux of a vector field through a surface, which isn't too relevant outside a few specific areas of study. Generally, I think single variable calc and stats are a lot more important to what most people will end up studying. ",
            "\u00a0My mathematical skills have been greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0critical thinking with multiple variables, line integrals, surface integrals. ",

            "\u00a0The class moves very quickly, just by virtue of having a lot of material to cover in one semester. It's not necessarily a weakness, but it does lead to less time in class in which we try to solve problems on our own. For me, it had to relearn a lot when doing the problem set. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very fast paced. I don't know if there is any way to slow the pace, but I think that could help. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very difficult course. I wish that people let me know about this fact when I was shopping classes. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is extremely well-structured. I think, however, for exams, it would be helpful if the grading was less harsh or there were more practice exams available. Or alternatively, more homework questions each week. Also, I am not a fan of the homework being on topics we learned last week (i.e. the homework was staggered so that our lecture would always be one week or so ahead of the homework that would be due for that week). ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely fast paced so while the beginning of the class may seem pretty easy, it quickly picks up its pace and becomes increasing difficult. The midterms are also much more difficult than the homework and coursework, though it is good because two years of sample exams are given for us to practice. One weakness is that not enough feedback is given for the incorrect answers on exams, though there is always an answer key provided and you can always find your instructor if you have questions. The grading is also pretty strict and harsh, which is natural for a class with like 300 students but don't be surprised if you lose 5 points just because you didn't simplify or you made an integration error. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the quality of instruction is fairly variable across the different teachers as I've heard students complaining about their instructor while I thought my instructor was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0From talking to my peers, I have learned that the experiences with Math 120 are very mixed depending on professor. I was very lucky to have Miki, who was engaging and helpful, however others had a less positive experience. Based on my time in the class, I thought the teaching was comprehensive and quality and the problem sets were well-tailored to what we had covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: traditional math class setting, with concepts explained in detail through lecture and chalkboard-use\r\n\r\nWeakness (but not really of the course) - pretty fast-paced, so may be difficult to keep up ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Covers a lot of material. Review sessions can be helpful. Homework manageable.\r\nWeaknesses: Moves very quickly and environment is so that people don't speak up even when clearly confused. ",
            "\u00a0It is really fast paced and there is a lot of discrepancy between professors but the study materials were very good ",
            "\u00a0This class is extremely difficult and not super well organized. Some sections are very well taught and some are taught terribly. The exams are really hard and harshly graded. It was especially hard to prepare for the tests because the psets were graded so much differently and were not similar types of questions. ",
            "\u00a0The material was rushed and felt uninteresting even though it should have been interesting. In the end, I guess I developed a reasonable grasp of multivariable calculus, but the course was structured poorly enough to make that learning unnecessarily difficult and frustrating. It could be improved by having more organized, stronger lectures and more consistent feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I think more practice would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great teacher, thorough explanations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not enough time for questions/discussions/clarifications ",

            "\u00a0It was very well organized. I think there could be more overview of the topics and equations. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths include throughout explanation of the topic during lecture. The instructor was very accessible to students. The course's weakness include the pace at which students were expect to understand the materials. "

            "\u00a0Math 120 covers parts of math that are essential for a lot of fields. I would recommend the course to any student who understands that it will be a significant amount of work, but the payoff will be worth it in the end. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is tough, but if you spend time on it, you learn a lot, and multivariable calculus really is useful for its applications in physics. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is extremely useful and extremely interesting. The only thing I would caution about this class is that the grading is extremely severe. If you miss a question on an exam, your entire grade for the semester is heavily affected, if not completely sunk. The grading seems overly harsh and is borderline unfair, but it is what it is. That's my only caveat to this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it overs the basis of multivariable calculus in an effective course and many of theses skills are needed for further classes in physics, math, engineering and other fields. Miki is also a great instructor and if you can definitely try to shop her sections as she also makes the learning experience more enjoyable! ",

            "\u00a0If you are interested in moving forward with math, this is a very important class to take.  You will learn a lot about the multi-dimensional world.  However, be warned that it is fast-paced and you'll have to work hard. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course if a student is interested in mathematics or physics. This is a good introductory level mathematics course for the college level. Do not take this course for a QR credit. You can always take this course, see if you are still interested in mathematics, and decide after if you want to continue with mathematics. ",
            "\u00a0No not unless its required. Its very hard. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you're interested in studying physics or engineering (or need the course as a prerequisite for something else), I would not recommend it. Even though it may seem like the next logical step in the math sequence that began in high school, stats is much more relevant to what most will study. That being said, if you're very strong in math and are simply looking for a challenging, somewhat interesting course, this should be an option. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it, especially with Miki. It is a good class to get you started with college math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great way to improve critical thinking and math skills for a variety of applications. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this class for people that must take it for their major. It is a very difficult class that was not necessarily fun, but it happened and I learned how to find surface integrals and flux!!!! ",
            "\u00a0No. While Miki is a great teacher, I think the assessments of the course are much harder than the assignments and homework and so it can be unfair. Furthermore the curve is not very accommodating to people who have never taken multivariable calculus before. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if someone wants / needs to continue with math. It's a fairly straightforward math course. ",
