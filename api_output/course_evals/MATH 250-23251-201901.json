The course is essentially calculus but generalized, so you'll have some intuition for most of what comes your way, and the trick is to make it work in \"an arbitrary, n-dimensional space.\"  Also learned psets shouldn't be done in a single night, because that's just no fun at all.

It isn't a linear algebra class, but many computations involving matrices and vector spaces are used throughout the course. ",

Caglar caters to the student's needs and is very responsive to student feedback\r\n\r\nI think the course was not as well structured as it could have been. I felt that we did not go over Generalized Stokes Theorem well enough (we covered it in the last 10 mins of the last class) and it was on the final... ",

There were no peer tutors and the professor had to teach a section since there was no TA. Overall, I could have used a lot more practice on some topics but could not find the resources to do so. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the actual sequence and choice of topics could be more thoughtfully chosen. ",
            "\u00a0The real strength was Caglar, who made the material fun with all his jokes and genuinely caring attitude.  As for weaknesses, there're weren't any specific shortcomings, but I wish we'd delved more into the theoretical aspects and gotten to see some more proofs of where the equations we were given come from. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the professor was excellent; very clear and made himself very available.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- it's a weird class, and the textbook sucks. ",
            "\u00a0The class was extremely unstructured. There was no way to ever see if what I was doing was even remotely right. And when youre taking a math class at this level, you need to be told step by step if youre doing things right. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Great, funny professor who truly cares about student understanding and success. Good introduction to higher-level mathematics.\r\nWeaknesses- Quite difficult and a bit unstructured because there was no guiding textbook. ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught extremely well. Concepts were very clear. The only improvement would be to hire a peer tutor or TA. Often, our instructor was too busy to hold a weekly section, and it would've been much more helpful had there been a peer tutor or TA. ",

            "\u00a0More structure / better textbook, but wonderful professor, needs a TA ",
            "\u00a0I think that the material of this course felt very disorganized as we went from various topic to topic each day and continuously built on ideas. We covered a lot of theorems which were often times difficult to comprehend on their own. Often times I would be writing down the notes for a new concept but have no understanding of what it all meant. Throughout the semester, the course became more difficult in terms of material. I think that this course would benefit from having a TA next year that went over homework/exam-like questions during sections because we wouldn't always go through detailed examples during class. It was also unclear how much we were expected to know from the material throughout the class. ",
            "\u00a0Very well organized. Maybe less material, done more carefully would better. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Excellent professor, approachable & interesting material, calculus and linear algebra-based\r\nWeaknesses: Bad textbook, difficult to find relevant information online, vector calculus doesn't seem like an established course in general ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Uyanik is amazing!!! He's a great lecturer and has an entertaining sense of humor. The class's pace is also very reasonable for an intro proof/theory based higher level math course. Although a lot of class concepts were theoretical and very complicated (in appearance), the psets were all doable (except for 1) and took a reasonable amount of time. The exams were also all super reasonable. I scored above a 90 on all three without an insane amount of preparation. One of my favorite courses taken at Yale\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class was a tad bit unorganized which is normal for the first time teaching a class. Also someone complained at Midterm that the class was too easy (don't know why someone would do that) which made him step up his rigor for the second half. Lastly, it would have been GREAT to have had a peer tutor or TA. Dr. Uyanik was always willing to help, but it would have been much easier to seek help with peer tutoring and TAing hours. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the lectures and found them engaging.  The problem sets were quite helpful and pretty similar to the work on the midterm.  My only complaint is that there was a great deal of variation in problem set difficulty that wasn't always immediately obvious.  Some weeks there were no challenging problems and others there would be two that no one in the class could get. ",
            "\u00a0This course seems to occupy a rather awkward space in the mathematics curriculum here at Yale. It also changes dramatically semester by semester. I chose this class expecting it to be like how Stefan taught it last fall rigorously, and with a strong emphasis on proof-based mathematics. What I got instead was a mostly computational class that combined a lot of information that I learned in the past into not-too-illuminated things. I think the math department should make it clear what kind of class they want 250 to be. ",
            "\u00a0At times it seemed too close to 120 in difficulty and level of rigor. I feel that if 120-225-250 can be substituted for 230-231, 250 should be at least a bit more proof-based. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you liked (and did well) in  math 120 and 222/225 and wanted to understand things on a deeper level. This is conceptually significantly harder than Math 120 or 222, and it also is an introductory class to proofs, which adds an extra dimension of difficulty to the usual computational problem-solving that students might be used to until this point in their coursework. Nevertheless, it maintains a good balance so that youre not thrown into proofs out of nowhere. Good gateway course to 300-level math. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would!! Take if it is taught by Caglar. I think the class was not as well timed as he hoped it to be, but I think we go over really interesting material in the class. If your interested in having a taste in theoretical mathematics, take this course!! It's a nice introduction in preparation for higher math classes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. if you are a math and Econ major it is a prerequisite for real analysis which is required. I don't really recommend it for just fun because the material is not really applicable to anything except higher level math. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0I think by math 250 you pretty much know what you're in for--there's gonna be long psets, tests are by no means easy, and there's a lot to keep up with, but the material is pretty interesting and taught well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good elective class for Economics and Mathematics majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in math. It's a theoretical and application-based class, which is a nice hybrid. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would although I do not think it will really help prepare students for Math 300. It is just an interesting course to take. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that this course is suited for students who plan to continue their studies of mathematics beyond this course. It is a challenging course that covers difficult material, and I would recommend having proof experience before taking this course. It will challenge you to learn new ideas and understand how they work and then how to apply that to computational problems. The course got more challenging throughout the year and I don't know how much the material will help me afterwards. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Caglar is excellent. Very clear in his lectures and always approachable.  The class is interesting and is a good introduction to multidimensional analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student if taught by Professor Uyanik, otherwise the material may be inaccessible or too abstract. The difficulty in teaching \"Vector Analysis\" is that the course is not a foundational field in mathematics, but an introduction to several relevant topics, so it may be difficult to follow. With Professor Uyanik, it was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELYY! 100%. Dr. Uyanik is a fantastic professor! He cares a lot about his students and has an amusing and entertaining sense of humor. The course material is also super interesting without a heavy workload which is a true gem for Yale courses. Most psets take at most 5 hours which means the course isn't regularly too much work. Lastly, this course is filled with students who love math but may not have come in with an extensive background in math (like the Math 230 kids). This makes the class atmosphere amazing. No one knows all the material and everyone is there to learn. For those who like math and are considering, definitely take!! Put in some good work and you should get an A. ",
            "\u00a0yeah, I really enjoyed this course a lot.  It was more interesting than either math 120/222 and quite manageable if you made it through both of those courses. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend the professor, not so much the course. If you're looking for something more representative of what higher level math courses are like, go ahead and skip to 300, real analysis. I don't feel like I gained too much in this class, material-wise; and it doesn't entirely feel like stuff I need to know moving forward. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you plan on continuing to take higher level math and you need 250 as a prereq. If you just stop at 250, I feel like it may not be worth it because 250 seems like a stepping stone between 120/225 and the 300-level math courses, rather than a self-contained math course. "
