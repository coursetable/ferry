            "\u00a0This course encouraged me to think broadly and creatively about picture frames, architecture, museum studies, and conceptual frameworks in the history of art. ",
            "\u00a0New knowledge of frames, better dialogue practices. ",
            "\u00a0This course used the notion of the frame to examine myriad issues in and around the discipline of art history. We considered actual frames: physical frames around paintings, framing devices inside paintings, architecture as a spatial frame, and so on. But we also considered conceptual frames: art history as an interpretive frame. We concluded with museums, which felt fitting since the museum is both a physical and a conceptual frame. The thesis of the course went something like this: the frame operates by circumscribing things, but it itself cannot be circumscribed. This central tension meant that the course cohered less than most other seminars. But, at the same time, it also covered much more terrain than usual. ",
            "\u00a0I learned in this course how to prepare for effective meetings related to final projects with the professor. Professor Nelson makes himself very available to students, and his investment in the student's final research project trains them to receive feedback and apply it. "

            "\u00a0We spoke in class about the strengths and weaknesses of the various topics and readings that were assigned and we agreed that we found useful our discussions on specific types of picture frames such as the Sansovino frame as well as the conceptual weeks on \"frames of art history\" and museum studies. Instead of relegating all of our critical theory to the first week, I would have liked to spend more time unpacking those key texts over the course of the semester so that they could act as regular touchstones for our discussions. In other words, I think it would be interesting to have an intellectual history on frames that paralleled the art history that we covered. For instance, during our week of readings on framing modern art, perhaps if it would have been helpful to read (or reread) Schapiro. Derrida also fell by the wayside over the course of the class and I think it would have been useful to think about his historical and cultural context of writing about frames as we moved into twentieth century museum studies and \"new art history.\" This was certainly an experimental class and an experimental syllabus, which meant that some parts were messy or unclear. On the whole, however, I found the messiness generative. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there had been more about painting frames, I found it very engaging. And more trips to look at frames. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent! Rob is a terrific discussion leader and a terrific person in general. Sometimes, discussion ran a bit dry, but this was not really his fault; it was more an issue with the class composition. We weren't really told until after the first day that there would be weekly summary reports/questions and reading responses, in addition to an end-of-term paper. This was a bit annoying. But, nonetheless, these smaller assignments certainly helped as they forced us to be accountable for the material and to come to class prepared to talk. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very generous in terms of time, approach, and type of frame. \r\nAnother strength of the course was the opportunity to go to the Yale University Art Gallery. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Especially to undergrads. I was an undergrad and I do not regret my decision to take the class. The course is unique because the topic is so broad. For this reason, it enables you to follow your own interests. I was able to pursue an off-the-beaten-track topic that interested me because anything can be considered a frame. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, mainly because of the professor! "
