            "\u00a0I gained more experience in critically viewing and reading. Most importantly, I had the opportunity to write about things in which I was super interested, which made my writing much more passionate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the cultural tropes of the gangster, detective, spy, con man, hitman, et al. I watched some of the quintessential movies of the 20th century and gained understanding of their cultural significance. ",
            "\u00a0This course completely changed the way I look at films. I can now understand the various techniques filmmakers use to make their movies alluring and draw viewers in. Moreover, we learned a great deal about the evolution of films, from noir to superhero to the modern spy. I saw and analyzed many classics, which was very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the genre and general knowledge about films and culture. It will definitely be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Loved this course! Eddy is the man and the films we watch are so relevant and iconic. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate and discuss film in a way that moved beyond \"oh, I liked...\" into a more academic and interesting way. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides good practice in writing, made easier by the fact that Professor Friedfeld encourages students to write about topics that excite them. In addition, this course teaches students to look at films in new and different ways, meanwhile exploring a number of genres and eras in film history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about American film character archetypes.  It was great to be able to track them as they evolved over time as well.  Through the papers I was then able to explore topics that I found extremely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze character types in films--particularly those representing good and evil--and talking about and writing about these archetypes. "

            "\u00a0Super interesting subject matter and easy format/workload ",
            "\u00a0It was super strong in terms of having really interesting books and movies. It could be strengthened by perhaps having the class discussion be a tiny bit more student driven, but in that case we would miss out on Professor Friedfeld's great commentary a bit. ",
            "\u00a0The course has an incredible instructor, Eddy Friedfeld, who is very engaging and pours a great deal of effort into the presentations and classes. There was never a dull moment in class and I was always learning something new and insightful. ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I've taken at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0Really great course! The professor was really knowledgeable and really helpful, especially when it came to writing papers. He gave very clear feedback and was really responsive to questions all along the way. The weekly viewings and readings were great and set me up for a great class and the weekly assignments were a good way of reflecting on the viewings/readings, without having to sweat too much about work. The class really fosters a great community! My only thoughts about that would be that it would have been really nice if there was a bit of small group discussion here and there, I think it would have helped people to clarify there thoughts for a greater class discussion. ",
            "\u00a0My only statement of suggestion is that theres SO MUCH in the way of movie watching per week its hard to keep up i had to fast forward through some movies. ",
            "\u00a0For being such an interesting seminar, there is a decent amount of work. Usually 2-3 movies, a book, and a few quick journal articles a week (definitely on the heavy side).  However, doing all the work helps lead to great in-class discussion.  Also, it pretty fun to be able to say you are watching The Godfather for a class! "

            "\u00a0If you can get in it is definitely worth taking ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend. This course is super fun, and you will produce really good papers if you try at it. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this course! If you have any interest in learning more about film in any capacity, take this class. You watch so many important, culturally relevant movies that'll make you say, \"oh, that's where that came from.\" You get to discuss said movies with a super-engaged class and super-engaged professor, generating conversations that are both intellectual and really fun. Professor Friedfeld is extremely knowledgeable and has a fascinating background, so he brings amazing insight to the films we watch. You can pretty much write your papers about anything you're interested in, so they're not difficult at all. The week-to-week movie-watching commitment can feel like a lot, but it's a really fun way to get your roommates/family involved in your schoolwork. Don't miss this class! ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely fantastic class and I would highly recommend it. The professor is fun and so eloquent and engaging in his analyses of classic films like The Maltese Falcon or Casablanca or Pulp Fiction. Yes, those are movies you see. The films you watch throughout the semester are amazing, and in class we dissect each of them. By the end, you'll look at movies through a different lens and appreciate them more. The workload is not bad at all, especially since you're mainly watching interesting movies then submitting a weekly reading response on them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would absolutely recommend this course to another student who is interested in learning about some of the best movies and books of all time. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely try to take this course! Professor Eddy Friedfeld is one of the smartest and kindest professors. He really wants students to learn and to enjoy themselves. An excellent way to take a writing credit. If you're not looking for a writing credit, still take this class! The work is definitely worth it and the class is super interesting. It's a nice way also to diversify the classes you're taking! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Youll watch awesome movies, talk about them while eating chocolate with an incredibly knowledgeable and engaging professor, and write the best essays youve ever written. ",
            "\u00a0Would 100% recommend. This is a must-take class if you like film and would appreciate an academic way of engaging with them. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt you should take this class if you are able to. Everybody loves watching movies, especially the ones taught in this class, but people rarely get a chance to dive a little deeper into those films. This class allows you an environment to discuss and think about your favorite movies in an academic and exciting way. ",
            "\u00a0Students with all kinds of film background and knowledge will enjoy taking this course. The in-class discussions cover lots of material, from the most basic elements of a film to the more nuanced aspects and historical references that it draws on. Homework typically consists of watching 2-3 films, reading a couple of articles, and writing a two paragraph response each week. I found that in this course I was able to both learn from and enjoy the films we covered, which comprise many classics that everyone is glad to watch. In addition, Professor Friedfeld is very easygoing; he is willing to adjust deadlines to fit everyone's schedule, and is very helpful in giving comments about proposed paper topics. The papers are mostly open-ended, so each student is able to write about a topic that is exciting to them. Overall, the workload may seem daunting, but it becomes manageable as you get used to it, and class discussions are very informative and enriching. Take this class! ",
            "\u00a0This class is awesome! You get to watch great, classic movies and discuss them in an academic setting.  You then get to study topics that you find interesting and write great papers on them.  This is a great class! ",
            "\u00a0A worthwhile course! Very exciting to attend class and do the assignments. Watching a ton of classic movies and getting to speak about them in class is so enjoyable. "
