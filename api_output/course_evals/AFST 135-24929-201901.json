            "\u00a0We discussed and debated various problems that can arise in conflict journalism. The class discussions were interesting and never felt forced. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, not a lot. I wish that he did more talking instead of the students, because at times, it became a bit repetitive. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically think about reporting on war and how the different styles of war reporting impact the audience and vary by genre and topic. ",
            "\u00a0great reading material related to conflict and war reporting. ",
            "\u00a0I read many different types of war journalism and built skills in analyzing their structure, style, and effectivity. I gained insight into how different types of war journalism affect readers and society's perception of war. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different conflict regions and how to critically analyze the journalism that has been used to cover them. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the methodology of reporting and writing in the context of war, but the class also taught good argument analysis skills and introduced us to systemic ways of thinking and tackling issues that will be useful. ",
            "\u00a0This class helps you think about conflict through many different viewpoints, and you definitely gain an understanding of how to more critically analyze journalism of war. "

            "\u00a0The content of the course is really fascinating, even for people that aren't interested in going into journalism. Professor Wood brought in a some other journalists to speak about their first-hand experiences as well. Not to mention the fact that learning from someone as experienced as Professor Wood is an overall delight. \r\n\r\nThe course is designed so that your whole grade essentially rests on the final paper. If that would stress you out, maybe don't take it. Conversely, the reading-load is high, but the writing load isn't horriblethe papers you do write just count for a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Could have been improved with more guidance from him because it was difficult to understand what he was looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I think the topics of the course made sense, and I think the discussion is probably the best discussion in a seminar that ive had at yale. I dont the pieces that were chosen were the most engaging though. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this class were the interesting readings and the meta way in which we analyzed the role of the media in wartime. The class could be improved by more structured and guided discussion. I felt the course themes were really interesting the first few sessions, but by the end of the semester, we reverted back to the same questions each class, just with different readings. It felt a little repetitive and I felt I stopped getting as much out of each session. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are greatwith a few exceptions, they are all works of journalism and are engaging and fascinating. They also cover a wide array of topics and styles, which is nice for variety's sake. The classes also are pretty good, and the workload is manageable since there are really only two assignments. One concern I had was that some of the classes would get bogged down in similar arguments and could get boring, but overall I would say I found 70-80% of the classes really enjoyable. Also, Prof. Wood brings in a couple of guest speakers and I LOVED those classes. ",
            "\u00a0I think certain weeks are just way more interesting than others. I loved certain weeks where we read about more recent conflicts when we read news articles about them, but didn't love the weeks that were more theory heavy with long readings about conflicts from far in the past. It felt that sometimes the conversations when the reading was too dense was a bit forced, but overall this was a great class. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course. Professor Wood is wonderful and has a lot of really interesting insight into journalism. He also makes a real effort to get to know students, which was nice. You really don't have to be particularly fascinated by journalism to get a lot out of this course. I would definitely recommend if you can get into it. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in war journalism (not how to write it, but just the analysis of it), then take it. It is not a course about how media affects conflict, or the responses to war journalism. ",
            "\u00a0the class is great if you are a political science major who is interested in media studies and/or critique of journalism. ",
            "\u00a0It was not the most exciting course I've taken but I did learn how to think about war journalism more critically and enjoyed many of the readings. I would recommend it, but it would be helpful to attend the first sessions to see if you like the professor's open-ended discussion style first. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I loved it, and if you have any interest in journalism or politics you will too. I will offer one piece of advice, though, which is know what you're getting into. This is not a class analyzing war, it is more about journalism and methodology (although you do discuss conflict a bit). So if you're looking for a class that analyzes the causes and course of Vietnam or the Rwandan genocide, this is not the class for you. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in journalism about war, this is a good class to take! "
