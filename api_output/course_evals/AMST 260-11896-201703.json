            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Pragmatism as well as some other American Philosophies that were inspired by the European tradition. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a great survey of American philosophy from Johnathan Edwards all the way to contemporary 21st century thinkers. The course concentrates heavily on transcendentalism and pragmatism but does a good job of incorporating modern ideas of selfhood into the last few lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write for philosophy, which I believe will aid in all analytical writing going forward! I'm more incisive and a better close reader because of this class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze philosophical texts & write about them. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Winkler is invaluable in the individualized time he devotes to you in office hours, which became a natural extension of the course. Critically re-thinking one's arguments was definitely the most-improved skill. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first Philosophy class ever and the first writing I did at Yale! I learned to think critically about ideas I used to accept at face value. I learned to accept that sometimes there is no answer. And there doesn't have to be. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave a great overview of American philosophers and was a great first course in philosophy. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a familiarity with many American philosophers that I had never heard of. I gained a deeper understanding of how to critically investigate ideas. I pondered questions I had never thought to ask. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first Philosophy class at Yale or otherwise, and I mostly learned about what the study of philosophy looks like, how to read philosophy, and logical ways of thinking about other people's philosophical ideas. It was enjoyable to learn about these topics through class discussions. "

            "\u00a0This course is well organized and Professor Winkler is the best. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Winkler is great! He's so knowledgeable about the subject, and super open to any questions/interpretations you may have. He's also so, so helpful during the writing process for your midterm/final essays. He had several office hours nearly every single day, and he'd give really great feedback paragraph by paragraph to my essays when he returned them. It was honestly so helpful.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Discussion could have been more robust. It is a small lecture, but sometimes it felt like only a certain group of people would keep speaking. ",
            "\u00a0The course could've been improved with more systematized, visual representations of the material so as to keep the lectures on track and help people to follow along. Since philosophy can be a difficult topic, it would've been helpful to have some visual aid to help organize the thoughts of various thinkers and to provide overall clarity. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Winkler's lectures are fantastic and do a great job of covering the most important aspects of the readings while still leaving time for students to discuss the material. Occasionally the assigned readings are a bit overwhelming in length, but Professor Winkler always makes sure to indicate which readings are most important for class discussion. Additionally, I appreciated the writing assignments in this class. I thought the prompts were creative and allowed students flexibility to cover any topic they desired. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course. The course syllabus was great, it was well-organized, and the discussions were always productive. ",
            "\u00a0The reading list is great, and prof winkler does a great job explaining complex ideas. The discussion could have been more active and collaborative--though I think this was more the students than Winkler. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave an excellent overview of important topics in American philosophy. I was especially impressed by how well the course balanced the arguments of the readings with historical information and context. \r\n\r\nMy only suggestion for improvement would be to narrow the readings or offer more guidance as to which selections to focus on. While the readings were all interesting, it was sometimes difficult to finish them, and we only ever discussed selections from a few. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed all of the readings and the assignments and received extensive feedback which was great. Professor Winkler also gave massive amounts of his time to office hours which was impressive and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is engaging & well structured. ",
            "\u00a0While I loved many of the discussions of this course, I think the amount of material covered each week should be re-thought. It was not the quantity (the page numbers were very manageable), but instead more the thoroughness with which you were assumed to have acquainted yourself with the material. Classes unsurprisingly became a discussion between 5 people, yet was conducted in a lecture-style room; in my opinion, this class would function better as a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The course allows for deep and meaningful discussion, and Professor Winkler does a great job of facilitating idea exchange. I did keep some tallies early on in the year: About 40% of the class is female, but girls only spoke 18% of the time. This is absolutely no fault of the professor or the curriculum, just a common result of sexist social structures discouraging girls from sharing. There's no quick fix, but I felt this worth noting. The class would have been even more meaningful if everyone felt encouraged to share. Perhaps more small group discussions of a few students before turning to a big class discussion would have been empowering. ",
            "\u00a0I love the half lecture half seminar style of the class. The readings are fantastic and WInkler is an amazing professor. He teaches in a very engaging way and develops your understanding of the readings. My only suggestion would be for him to talk more about the readings assigned that day. We often wouldn't have time to talk about the readings and that can be a little disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the format of discussing reading topics with the whole class but sometimes wished that there was more structure to the discussions. For instance, a summary of the readings or set conversation topic for the day would have solidified those lessons more for me. "

            "\u00a0Great readings, great professor. Isn't that already hard enough to find? ",
            "\u00a0Winkler is the kind of guy you want to have as a lifelong spiritual mentor. He speaks eloquent philosophy without the bullshit, and any ol plebeian can understand him. The content in the class is practical, and the themes shift significantly every few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student who is interested in philosophy regardless if they have taken a philosophy class before. ",
            "\u00a0A++ (that wont be your grade though), highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really interesting thinkers. I'm a philosophy major and loved the material, and my non-phil major friends did, too. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this class to another student. I think this class really helps students understand the philosophical framework that still influences many aspects of American society. Moreover, Professor Winkler challenges students to become better philosophical writers by providing detailed grading and comments. Lastly, Professor Winkler's unrivaled passion keeps lectures fresh and interesting, as he often includes personal anecdotes towards the end of the semester as he discusses his contemporaries. The class is a perfect mix of lecture and seminar; a rare opportunity to have class discussions in a room with over 18 people. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely recommend.  Professor Winkler makes the lectures very interactive and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This class is a great introduction to philosophy if you've never taken a philosophy course. It's also a great continuation of your study of philosophy if you've already been exposed to it. Winkler is one of the best professors I've had at Yale - don't miss an opportunity to take a class with him. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if any of the following topics interest you: definition of truth, arguments for and against pragmatism, arguments for and against pluralism, nature of race and gender in America, New England philosophers. The class does an excellent job balancing argumentation with historical context and biographical information. There are a lot of readings, but they are interesting and relevant to the course. Prof. Winkler is a clear, excellent lecturer and does well engaging students in the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0YEs 100% ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to someone who is interested in philosophy. Professor Winkler chooses interesting texts & is literally just a joy/ hes the main reason I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Winkler is an absolute gem, but be aware of the fact that the material you cover will be intense, and the modes of thinking through that material most likely unfamiliar if you have never taken a philosophy course. He's very available in office hours (definitely take advantage of those), but I wouldn't necessarily call this an introductory course, especially given the number of former DS students who take it. That being said, you will learn to think in a different way than you may previously have through English/History courses etc, and there is definitely a substantial amount of value in that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course without reservation. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. Winkler is a fantastic professor, and you won't get this material in many other classes. ",
            "\u00a0The class allows you to develop intellectually without being in anyway imposing. The readings are entirely manageable and the essay exams are intellectually challenging without being stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a gem. I recommend it to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's really interesting and Winkler is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to beginning philosophers who want to get a taste of the discipline and explore American history with a very broad and general selection of readings. "
