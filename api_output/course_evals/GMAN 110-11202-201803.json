            "\u00a0I greatly increased my ability to read and write German, especially in regards to understanding grammar. I also became better at speaking German as the year went on, but I was never as proficient at listening or speaking compared to reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0It's an intro German class, covering basic vocabulary, the nominative, accusative, and dative cases, as well as the present and perfect tenses. ",

            "\u00a0The course does a good job at teaching German grammar and vocabulary. Vocabulary did become less of a focus at the end of the year, which made it more difficult to keep up, but this was largely because grammar became a larger focus due to learning new tenses. I did not like how the homework was structured, specifically when listening to the faster conversations, since the class often would cover the material in a slightly different order than the book, which means we were lacking more vocabulary than we should have in these listening sections. In class however, I think the structure worked very well. ",
            "\u00a0The course is immersive, which is good for us to practice speaking the language. However, there is a gap between the listening we do in class and that we do in tests, and I feel that the lecturer could have better prepared us for the listening tasks. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think that the class was well taught, and that German as a language is not noticeably more difficult to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- it's overall a well-structured and taught introduction to the German language. I had a couple issues with the way the textbook explains ideas but nothing one can't work through. Excellent overall experience and a good pace to learn new concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, sure ",
            "\u00a0Yes because German is fun to learn! "
