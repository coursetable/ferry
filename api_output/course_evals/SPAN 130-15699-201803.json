            "\u00a0This course taught me the necessary grammar and vocabulary to speak, read, and write spanish at an intermediate level. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a solid review of the material covered in SPAN 110/120, with the addition of complementary grammar and vocabulary.  You learn to understand simple, primary sources in Spanish (with plenty of readings and videos) along with building your conversational skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better speak, read, write, and listen to Spanish using legitimate Spanish tools, like a movie and a book while grasping a stronger hold on the grammatical rules of the language. ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot better at reading and comprehension ",

            "\u00a0I think that more emphasis needs to be put on speaking.  All other aspects were covered well but it would be better to spend class time speaking than going over powerpoints of grammar that we could learn on our own outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nPure repetition\r\nFocus on grammatical structures\r\n\r\nWeakness;\r\nToo much busywork ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with clearer instructions on the tests and quizzes. Also some of the required readings were far beyond the L3 level and required students to look up entire sentences at a time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this course is a rigorous building of language.  The professor (Sebastian Diaz) was fabulous and understood how we would actually learnby making mistakes and not being afraid to speak up (always in Spanish) in class!  In addition, the readings and films we watched were level-appropriate and formative in building advanced skills.\r\nWeaknesses: the workload this class demands is simply too high.  Class meets every day and on some weeks homework was >1 hour per night.  For a 1.5 credit class, this is almost too much work, and the department should reconsider how it spreads out workload.  That said, the pacing of the class was never too fast and I felt comfortable learning the grammar. ",

            "\u00a0Diaz was a great strength and made the course awesome. \r\n\r\nThe cons of the course included the short time to read the book. ",

            "\u00a0If you're looking to concretely build your Spanish skills and understand the workload, yes.  TAKE THIS CLASS WITH SEBASTIAN.  He's an amazing professor who respects his students but also understands their other responsibilities.  I honestly think he made the classit could've been a struggle with someone less knowing of how students learn a language. ",
            "\u00a0I mean, if you have to, then you have to. It takes a lot of time but by the end of the course, you will be pretty good at using conversational Spanish and could probably live in any Spanish speaking country. ",
