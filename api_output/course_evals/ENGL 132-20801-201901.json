            "\u00a0I practiced the skills of literary analysis and reading for craft in fiction, and learned about what makes speculative fiction unique among literature and how it can be a vector for great and deep meaning. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about analyzing science fiction to look for greater themes and about how to write a good essay. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about science fiction! The field isn't too large, so this class gives you a chance to become an expert on a lot of the influential literature and writers. We also learned how science fiction speaks about human nature, identity, and social issues. ",
            "\u00a0How to appreciate sci-fi texts and movies as literature! Also worked on my writing a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't realize how much the world influenced science fiction literature. ",

            "\u00a0Developed thinking on human nature through literature ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history and form of science fiction literature (and other forms of media) and how science fiction studies, challenges, and explores different characteristics of human identity. We also read several pieces of theory alongside fiction and learned how to analyze science fiction texts in light of those theories. We also focused on writing strong analytical papers about the texts we read. ",
            "\u00a0The class helped me to formulate and articulate insights and ideas about literature through science fiction. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first english course at Yale, and it did challenge me intellectually. I was surprised by how many philosophical, historical, and gender themes could be tied into science fiction. It was very enjoyable. I surprised myself in how I could pull resolutions about human nature from these stories about aliens. Professor Guy picked really great videos and books and short stories for us. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about the field of science fiction and a new way to approach essay writing. ",

            "\u00a0Literary analysis of science fiction ",
            "\u00a0This course was a fantastic introduction to the science fiction genre, as well as a great way to develop literature close-reading and analysis skills. The course covered a lot of sci-fi that is outside the standard classics of the genre, which made the course all the more interesting and engaging. The course was also particularly helpful in learning how to structure and write essays involving analysis of multiple texts. ",
            "\u00a0The main benefit of this class is not any \"knowledge, skills, and insights,\" but the opportunity to hear Alfred Guy talk about life, the universe, and everything (but mostly posthumanism, gender, and meaning) twice per week. This class was genuinely a joy to come to every week and spend some time reflecting on the meaning of everything in our crazy, changing world. "

            "\u00a0The largest strength of this course was the teaching team: both Professor Guy and my TF were amazing and provided an inclusive, exciting class that made you thrilled to go to lecture (and section).  The biggest weakness was the organization -- I felt like we were cramming in wayyyy too much content: two (large) novels every three weeks, and a variety of short stories on the off-week.  In many cases we didn't get to talk about the short stories at all in lecture, and then if we didn't get to them in section it was a complete loss in doing the reading.  I'd recommend pruning a few of the short stories (and maybe a novel) to juice more out of what we read.  Also, as an organizational issue: there was one week where an essay was due at the beginning of the week which coincided with a novel -- I'd recommend shifting that essay's due date to later, especially if you prefer we finish the week's reading for Monday. ",
            "\u00a0The course exposed me to science fiction that I'd never encountered before, and challenged me to consider more progressive ideas. For future iterations of the course, would be wonderful to read more SciFi like Octavia Butler's Dawn, which engages the genre from ethnic minority perspective. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of the concepts were very abstract and hard to follow, but class discussions were excellent, in depth, and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The books are probably a strength. Alfie is a passionate lecturer too. However lecture seemed kind of pointless. He definitely steered us in the direction of important themes and ideas related to the texts but given the large class size I feel like the quality of lecture was diminished noticeably. ",
            "\u00a0This course felt more like a seminar than a lecture. The biggest strength of the class is Professor Guy. He is extremely kind, caring, approachable, and willing to help. His lectures are great and he makes the material super interesting and relevant. I cannot think of a single weakness for this course. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very front-loaded in terms of work, which was difficult during the first month of school. However, the TAs and the professor are fantastic and the texts are amazing! ",
            "\u00a0It is very fun just by the nature of the work, but it could do with a little more sturcture and more specific directions for essays. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Guy chose generally pretty interesting texts, and I appreciated how we read some non white male authors in the beginning of the course. Essay questions were a little confusing and vague, though, and to a non-english major deciphering what he/our TA wanted was incredibly difficult. I wish there was more transparency on what exactly they're grading on, before the assignment is due. Also, more heads up on what texts should be read when would be really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The novels were great and the lectures did a great job at bringing in supplemental information ",
            "\u00a0Overall this course was extremely strong! My only critiques were that lectures sometimes felt rushed or occasionally vague in trying to tackle the texts we were reading, and while most texts were analyzed very in-depth, others were only briefly discussed. Also paper prompts somehow felt both very vague but also demanded quite specific guidelines in how a paper should be written that often made formulating the papers difficult, especially at the very beginning of the course when the first major paper is due a week and a half after class begins. ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well organized to set-up student learning. It is one of the few classes I've taken at Yale that took care to make sure the material was being taught effectively from a pedagogical standpoint. The class discussions were well-guided and often resulted in thought-provoking comments and questions. The only think I would have liked was to hear more of Professor Guy's own opinions on the literature simply because I found him to be an interesting and original thinker and would have liked to hear more about what he thought. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how the course was taught in the theatre style room on Hillhouse. It greatly facilitated classroom engagement in a large lecture class. I always felt like my opinion was appreciated and that I could speak up. Also Professor Guy did a great job of allowing us time to discuss our thoughts, ask questions, take notes for a few seconds during short breaks. ",
            "\u00a0Content is incredible. Didnt reay learn much in class, not necessarily a bad thing. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Guy was the most engaging and enthusiastic professor I've had so far at Yale. Each class was interesting and challenging, and addressed the texts using a variety of activities. The texts themselves were fascinating and a fun mixture of books, short stories, films, and television. The only weakness I might find is that there could have been more hands-on student activities, but it was still remarkably engaging considering it was a lecture course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing material, amazing lecturer, interesting and helpful TAs, fair amount of work.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: seemed like across sections grading was harsher than expected on assignments, especially on the first few assignments. 1-page paper isn't really ever a good idea because you can't answer important questions fairly in just one page. Maybe turn this into a creative writing assignment of some kind or a longer essay, but don't do a one page essay. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good introductory course to Science Fiction reading ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course is that it felt like a lot of lecture time wasn't used particularly effectively. The 'think, pair, share' thing that we did a lot is great, but not when it is most of the lecture. I think the most amazing lecture of the semester was the one in which Professor Guy talked us through his own close textual analysis of a passage from The Female Man. I felt like I understood both the novel and the method of undertaking a close reading so much more after that lecture. It would be great to do a bit more of that (even though it may be considered more of a 'traditional' lecture style) to balance out all of the active learning stuff. It is in combination that the two techniques are most effective.\r\n\r\nThat being said, there were so many strengths to the course. Professor Guy's insights and his engagement with the ideas of the students was incredibly fascinating and generous. The choice of texts, the pacing of the workload, and the encouragement to explore interesting and curious ideas/theses were all major strengths. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course is how fun it was. The lectures, reading, assignments, and sections could all mostly be described as \"fun,\" a rarity in Yale courses. For weaknesses, the lecture content was sometimes incomprehensible to those who aren't English majors (such as myself), but no less entertaining for it. The work distribution also skewed heavily towards the beginning half of the class, but that could also be considered a strength for those who appreciate having virtually zero work the last month of the semester. Also, the reading list mostly focused on new or alternative sci fi, which was something new for fans of classic sci fi like myself. "

            "\u00a0Yes, the course is a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely!!  I was dreading my second WR credit, but this class was absolutely worth it.  It's far from easy, but what eased the pain was the enjoyability -- lecture was fun, especially in TEAL, and it was a great environment; this is one of the courses where you'll still say hi to people from your course after the semester ends.  Note that Professor Guy is the director of the writing center, so while you write fewer pages than most courses there's a higher expectation for quality of work.  There's also a lot of readings which we simply didn't get to, so depending on how the course is going you may be able to skim some of them.  Lastly, a note of caution: this year the course's full title was \"Science Fiction & Identity,\" and especially week 3 onwards the course often focused more on the \"identity\" piece than the \"science fiction\" piece -- maybe not a con, but I had to alter my expectations for the course after a few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really cool course, but also quite challenging for people who aren't experienced writers already. The course is heavy on literary analysis, and coming from just ENGL 120, performing deep analysis of difficult-to-understand texts was sort of a kick in the teeth for this CS major.  I struggled a lot with the essays, and was happiest when I was just chewing through the reading list, or writing the short creative science fiction piece that you get to do at the end of the course.  While the readings are excellent, I would only recommend this course to students who feel comfortable digging into texts and crafting arguments based on interpretations of those texts. ",
            "\u00a0One of the best courses I've ever taken. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is excellent  it is a large lecture that feels like a small seminar. Absolutely take regardless of if you love science fiction or not! ",
            "\u00a0If you're an English major, I would definitely recommend this course. This attracts a lot of non-English majors (like myself) so it will likely be an easy A for you. If you're not an English major, only take this if you enjoy science fiction. It certainly was interesting reading a lot of sci fi books but grading wise it's hard to keep up with all the English majors. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you enjoy reading and analyzing texts! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is fun, gratifying and you will walk away feeling like you've actually learned about the world around you. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you like science fiction and want to get into it more, I think the survey in this course is pretty good. If you're a non-english major, though, be super vigilant about your essay work, since you'll probably be at a disadvantage. ",
            "\u00a0I most definitely would if they want experience in reading literature ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for anyone interested in science and speculative fiction, but don't expect this to be a gut! This class demands a high standard of reading and writing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, particularly because I think it is structured well to help you learn how to craft effective arguments through literature. The reading list is also really compelling and interesting and runs through a gamut of topics that provoke great conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another Yale student. It was intellectually engaging, I learned a lot, and it was very interesting. It also felt like a brain break from the horrors of my organic chemistry class. The material is really interesting, such that even things I did not have a chance to read in class, I plan to read this summer. Also, my discussion section was incredible. Had a good book talk going every week. Great feedback and turnaround time on papers. ",
            "\u00a0100%. It is a great low stress writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to anyone interested in science fiction or who would like to learn more. Professor Guy teaches with so much passion, so even if you've never been exposed to science fiction, this class will make you fall in love with it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Alfie is a great lecturer and if you get the chance to take this with him, do it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's not too high commitment and the readings are enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's an amazing class, with a brilliant professor. Even if you aren't a huge fan of science fiction - I hadn't really read or seen much sci-fi at all before the class - it is worth it, since the texts chosen are so enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - by far the most fun class I've taken at Yale (I'm not an English major). At the very least, show up to the first class, and I think you'll know right away if this class is for you. I would recommend this class to both fans of sci fi and those who have never read any sci fi before. The texts are very accessible and engaging, and the assignments are friendly and open-ended. Most of all. Professor Guy is a fabulous lecturer, and I was excited to go to class each week. Though the class brings up more questions than answers, the questions it asks are interesting to consider and relevant to our world, and I would highly recommend this class. "
