            "\u00a0After the first lecture it becomes very apparent that cognitive science is NOT psychology, which was great.  If you're interested in HOW the mind works, not just the resulting behaviors, then this is definitely a great class to take.  There are so many different aspect of cognitive science that you wouldn't realize have so much depth and detail.  Every single lecture was filled with new, surprising information.  Great course. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave you a broad overview of how the minds works by exploring a few of its many different functions. As a psychology major, I thought this introductory course was helpful in expanding my horizons in a way that was very very related to things that fall under the scope of my major. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting introduction to a lot of the core topics of cognitive science. I have not taken a class like this before, and enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some random facts, as Prof Scholl calls them, 'case studies' but mostly everything that we covered in this course were either things I've heard about before or random concepts that were not very scientific or useful. I started off loving cognitive science and the field, and being extremely discouraged and turned off by the subject due to unnecessary obstacles. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many ways in which the mind works. We studied various experiments that showed how brain performs (or fails to perform) certain tasks. There were a lot of nifty / cool tricks that Professor Scholl did during lecture (like the wire cage illusion, the prisoner's dilemma game, the MIB demonstration) that kept the lecture engaging, despite its large size. I learned about a topic I didn't even know existed prior to coming to Yale, which was fun. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about so many bits and pieces of what is studied in cognitive science. It's a great introduction to the area, especially if you might even vaguely be interested. By the end, you'll know what truly interests you within cogsci based on which lectures you enjoyed most. ",
            "\u00a0In this class you learn a lot of basics about a lot of different parts of cognitive science. You don't get to go into a ton of detail about any particular field, and it's definitely a survey course. However, you have your mind blown every day by things you never would have thought about otherwise. ",

            "\u00a0This class showcases a lot of mind tricks and reasons for them, which explain how the mind functions under the hood. I was challenged to question how I perceive the world around me and to marvel at the commonplace. The main skills I honed during this class were learning how to take notes efficiently and how to quickly read articles for their basic gist (or at least enough to be able to have a short discussion about the material). ",

            "\u00a0We covered a lot of interesting material in class. However, I did not feel that i could fully appreciate the information because of the poor organization of the course. I learned how to really listen to the professor to make sure I didn't miss anything (because the PowerPoints sure didn't have very relevant / coherent information to what Brian said); I also learned to see which jokes Brian made the most (because apparently quoting song lyrics that were played once during class is an adequate way to test my knowledge of cognitive science). I learned that Brian loves his daughter and his research exponentially more than he appreciates his undergraduate students (multiple emails throughout the semester with important questions, none of which were answered). I learned how to really manage my time well because assignments had the tendency to be posted hours before the next class, despite it being said they'd be posted before the weekend. I learned not to expect any kind of helpful feedback to improve my learning in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of fun facts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much from this class! Cognitive Science is interdisciplinary, which means you learn things that apply to so many different parts of lifeinfant cognition, to behavioral economics, to linguistics, etc. I understand way more about how our minds work, and what is really going on \"behind the scenes.\" Plus, I got a ton of cool party tricks from this class, as Brian Scholl shows lots of bewildering illusions that will seriously blow your mind. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course that really got me thinking about the brain in different ways. It was the highlight of my semester. ",

            "\u00a0Broad knowledge of the major discoveries in the field of cognitive science and a good grasp of what the field actually is (which is complicated and can be difficult to explain). Learned how to read scientific papers and a lot about the scientific process. ",

From dipping into the disciplines psychology, neuroscience, linguistics, philosophy, economics, and computer science--I felt that I gained an interdisciplinary, well-rounded, simultaneously wide-ranging and in depth understanding of the brain. I've come away from this class not only with new knowledge on how and why we behave, perceive, and approach the world the way we do, but also with a new grasp on the importance--the absolute necessity--of not limiting oneself to one branch or discipline in order to gain this knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0a broad knowledge of cognitive science ",

            "\u00a0This course was excellent in the fact that it introduced us to so many aspects of cognitive science. We weren't \"stuck in one gear\" all semester, rather our topics of discussion changed so often that we got to develop so many ways of learning and academic skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned general principles of cognitive science (like modularity, instinct blindness, etc.) as well as specific areas of cogsci (like infant cognition, perception, etc.) in which the principles are represented. This course made me appreciate the young field of cognitive science in general, learn how it combines and complements existing fields of philosophy, psychology, neuroscience, etc., and \"marvel at the common place\". ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge: a lot of fascinating and counterintuitive principles that govern seemingly simple and quotidian mental activities/capacities like visual perception, language, reasoning and decision making! \r\n\r\nSkills: the reading responses really helped me practice my critical thinking skills as they prompted me to constantly think about important questions like \"how did the author(s) of this paper arrive at this claim? are there alternative explanations for the data?\", \"why is this the appropriate level of analysis for this phenomenon?\", and \"what are the strengths and limitations of this particular tool/method/paradigm?\" \r\n\r\nInsights: Cognitive Science is such a fascinating field because of its interdisciplinary yet cohesive nature. Thanks to the fact that the question \"how does the mind work?\" is inherently one that needs to be addressed at different levels, one really gets to see how different (sub)fields inform AND (constructively) constrain each other. ",
            "\u00a0The value I gained by taking this class is clear from the regularity with which I spontaneously link something I observe or read about to some material covered in this class, or consider the ways in which it could be explained by cognitive science even if it does not apply to the specific material we learned about. Beyond those real-world applications, this course taught me skills in critical thinking around scientific research (for example, by evaluating the successes and failures of experimental methodologies).

            "\u00a0I gained a broad insight into the study of cognitive science, which is fascinating and highly relevant. We touched on many topics, from neuroscience to linguistics to computer science to perception and more. I left with a basic understanding of how the mind works, why we act the way we do, and the promising potential of current and future cognitive science research. ",

Each lecture is essentially a TED talk on a different topic, so if you're into that kind of class, this is the way to go. Unfortunately, we don't go into much detail on any one topic, so you only really gain a cursory knowledge of any one topic. However, our topics of study are well-chosen and engaging for the most part. ",

That being said, by the end you've covered so many topics and are expected to grasp a little bit more than a surface level understanding of all of them. I feel like I have a better idea of what the field of cognitive science is and does, but at the cost of a lot of frustrations with the course. ",

            "\u00a0The course provided insight of so many commonplace activities our brain carries out that we take for granted. It showed us the inner cognitive mechanisms by which we see, reason, love and act. The one skill I got was probably to think critically and apply what we learned in the class to everyday processes in the thought paper and to guess the possible questions for the midterms. The course also provided me with material that I could apply in my other courses such as Computer Science and English. ",

I think this is a perfect introduction to Cog Sci, and if I'd taken it earlier in my Yale career I'd probably be a Cog Sci major. It's intellectually challenging, though, and I'm glad I had taken it later on because I understood the method to Professor Scholl's approach, whereas I think a lot of the first years in the class were kind of shook with their first semester of college.

It is often very difficult to pinpoint what exactly we should take away from lecture and readings in order to prepare for the exam.

Notes or readings with clearer focuses on what we should know would be better than giving scientifically dense research papers from colleagues. ",

I feel like this course gave me a solid understanding of the field of cognitive science and provided a survey of the numerous topics that cognitive science explores. However, I felt like the exams, particularly the midterm, were a poor test of the overall themes that we learned, and merely asked for extremely specific, small facts from lectures, making them unreasonably difficult. Professor Scholl joked about making the test until 5 am the night before the midterm, and I felt like this was reflected in the arbitrary nature of the questions. I also felt like we focused on Turing machines and case assignment too much when we could've used that time for something else, since understanding the computation behind Turing machines and the linguistics of case assignment seemed largely irrelevant for a cognitive science class.

With an exam that is half multiple choice, the course does not allow students to show their thought process and receive partial credit for close albeit incorrect answers. Turing Machine problems for example, should not be multiple choice problems- it is very possible to show a good amount of correct work in solving these problems and still arrive at the wrong answer.  I thought this was a little ironic, not giving credit for thought processes, in a course about a field that was designed to study them. ",

            "\u00a0This course was extremely poorly structured. Starting from the macro level, it was divided into topics that were interesting to the professor and not necessarily relevant to the topic. For instance, we spent 3 classes on decision making/reasoning/perception and generally learned the same things twice because that is the research topic that my professor is most interested in. Instead we could have spent 1 lesson on it and learned some cool topic more in depth like olfaction, or music. Then looking at individual lessons, the slides were very poorly structured: Prof Scholl would present an idea, then move on, then go back to that idea without properly connecting or explaining that he was going back. A lot of the class was bullshit ideas like modularity, and professor Scholl took a very polarized role on fMRI and neuroimaging studies saying they are pretty much irrelevant, which is not representative of the scientific community. In addition the class was in the art gallery basement which was dark and poorly lit, so in addition to the poor teaching and bad lighting and time of the course, every person I spoke to in the class would fall asleep. Additionally, I went to a lot of review sessions and office hours for both the professor as well as several teaching fellows, and due to the poor structure, lack of resources (no textbook or outline of some sort),  I was constantly left confused and unsatisfied with my questions. Additionally there was no help we were given to study for the tests except for significantly reduced class notes that made no sense, making it very stressful and unpleasant studying for the exams. In addition, many topics such as linguistics, Professor Scholl taught way too fast and with too much depth and so it was completely not understandable and he taught it in a confusing manner. Instead if he focused on a smaller breadth of details but focused more time on each one, I would get significantly more out of this course. ",
            "\u00a0It would be cool if major themes of the course (instinct blindness, for example) were introduced at the beginning of each lecture. Sometimes I wasn't really sure what the point of a particular experiment was; sure, I could tell you what the experimenters concluded (individuals miss the yellow dot during the MIB experiment), but I couldn't tell you why it occurred, or what it meant in the broader scope of cognitive science. I wish Professor Scholl would emphasize the take-home point much more clearly after each example (like in big bright red letters or something: \"This experiment is an example of _______\"). This course would really benefit from biweekly review sessions led by a couple of TF's that went over confusing material. It is very tempting to not review notes until right before the exam. ",

The course, however, I believe could be improved by having more resources available if one wants to review material post-lecture--especially a term the one may have missed the explanation of or not heard be defined in the lecture. More detailed slides, or slides with more writing/notes on them, could possibly be a way to provide more review materials. ",

There are recurrent themes throughout the course, and I felt like I came out of the class with a better understanding of what science is about, what science is after and what science is/can be for. Prof. Scholl is also an incredibly engaging and passionate lecturer with amazing eloquence and a charming humor. The exams (especially the midterm) focused on testing our understanding of the material as opposed to mere memorization of facts, which made them fun to complete :D\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I personally did not struggle too much with making connections across the topics presented because of an overarching interest in learning about how the field works and an anchoring entry point that helped me stay grounded, but I could imagine how the breadth of the course could feel overwhelming or even disorienting if one wasn't putting in the effort to engage with the material in a proactive way. ",
            "\u00a0One key strength of this course is the variety in its readings. Having to engage with actual scientific reports, philosophical essays, and news articles gave a richness of perspectives on the subject that could not be replicated in a textbook. It also gave a sense of authenticity to the learning process - that the way in which we were learning imitates (as closely as possible for an intro-level course) what it is like to study cognitive science in practice. ",

The things I didn't like about it had nothing to do with the structural organization but were all centered around the specific topics within cognitive science that I was not particularly interested in as an individual.

Often times the class was unstructured, and it felt like sometimes he went by certain slides/key points too quickly. When looking back at the slides from certain lectures, I was often confused as to what point the professor was trying to make. After the midterm, however, you start to realize what you should take notes on and what is just some random, fun trivia about our cognition. ",

I liked how even though the course was a large lecture, we still did engaging demonstrations and activities. The material is quite interesting as well and the workload was pretty light (short reading responses, a 7-8 page paper, and an in-class midterm/final). Sometimes, though, the professor would try too hard to make the lectures funny so I would not always be able to follow the lecture. The TFs also did not always know the answers to some of the questions raised in office hours or review sessions. ",
            "\u00a0Brian Scholl did a good job of introducing the major themes of Cognitive Science; however, he did so very one-sidedly (counterarguments were brought up for only a single concept and he focused on what he personally thinks is interesting... like bees). It is a great course but very much marked by Professor Scholl's lecture style and personality. Not a bad thing but also not everyone's cup of tea, considering it is an intro course to a field many students haven't been exposed to before college. Beware, the midterm is difficult, and you have to write lecture notes nearly verbatim to study properly because the lecture slides he posts are virtually useless (over half of them are blank) and correct answers in the exams are very much restating what Professor Scholl said in lecture + what overarching themes those concepts connect to.

            "\u00a0As a survey course, this course successfully gave a taste of each segment of cognitive science. Determining each segment's relevance sometimes took a bit more insight, but this really demonstrates how interdisciplinary the field is. Dedicating large portions of class to mastering certain rudimentary skills, like solving Turing machines or case assignment, just to get a single concept across felt tedious at times. This is a nitpicky critique as most lectures were very engaging and I regularly left class amazed and enlightened. ",

I told friends that the reason I got hooked into taking this course was that the class was like a TED talk on the mind/brain for an hour twice a week. The facts are fascinating, but the course doesn't give a lot of structure for in depth thinking about the course which makes it hard to figure out how to study for the tests. ",

            "\u00a0The curve in this course is generous, but the professor makes it unnecessarily difficult to do well on the paper and the exams. You don't get any study guide, topics to focus on, exam structure, sample questions or anything to help prepare for the exams other than \"if I've talked about it a lot, it's probably going to be on there!\" Which is fine, you just have to study everything from all the lectures and readings, but the questions are often asked in a way that if you asked the wrong question about the topic (or whatever it might be) while studying, you're likely to get it wrong. Additionally, the paper is just a \"thought\" paper, in that you are supposed to come up with a new, interesting thought that's not too obvious about the field of cognitive science. There is also no rubric or anything given to give you an idea of how it will be graded. I especially think that this assignment needs to be reconsidered as cognitive science emerges more and more into mainstream discussions, because the number of new, original thoughts is certainly decreasing. The TFs are nice and helpful, but its difficult when some of them have upwards of 50 students. All in all, this is definitely the type of course that's worth potentially credit/d'ing, as you get exposed to a lot of super cool and interesting information and studies, and if you need it for your major just beware that it will take a lot more time and studying than you might expect. \r\n\r\nOne way the course could be improved would be the paper. It would have been great if students could pick from two assignments, or perhaps write a paper responding to one of the reading responses in more depth  the reading responses were often meant to get students thinking in new, creative, and personalized ways about the material we were engaging with, so offering the opportunity for students to write their paper responding in more depth to one of the questions could have been great and would have made the paper feel more exciting for students, but also a little bit more tangible (especially if you come from a stem background, like me). ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are very interesting, almost without exception. They're like cool lil' TED talk videos you come across on a YouTube binge. At the end of every lecture you'll know something cool about cognition - he's been teaching this class since forever so he's got the content and presentation nailed. Lectures are fun and engaging, and the minimal homework (reading some paper or article and answering a quick question) shouldn't take too long (although I've heard some TAs are pretty anal about the content of said responses. mine never returned any responses to my (thanks Cameron) but a friend had every other response returned with an \"I think you should've included ....\" TAs that do this need to chill.)\r\n\r\nHowever, assessments are pretty difficult to prepare for. There is so much content given in class that you can't be sure what will be on the exam. The exams, however, themselves aren't super difficult - very few \"gotcha\" questions asking about specific reading/lecture details, save for details that were explained for a good amount of time. A pretty good rule of thumb is the more he talks about it, the higher the likelihood that it will be on the exams. The TAs aren't very helpful in guiding you towards what to study, but they're pretty great about explaining any specific questions you have during office hours or exam prep sessions. You honestly just kinda have to go through the first exam and experience it for yourself to make your own strategy for the final, which leaves your grade on the first exam mostly up to luck.\r\n\r\nThere's also a 5-6 page paper. That's vague, but not as vague as Scholl is on the actual assignment, which can be to or against your benefit. He calls it a \"thought paper\" and provides a couple examples of high-scoring papers which are all incredibly different from each other. GO TO YOUR TA (OR A DIFFERENT TA IF YOURS SUCKS) AND ASK FOR HELP WRITING IT. Think about something interesting you learned in class and go to them with that and ask them to help guide you in writing your paper; they're the ones that grade it, so follow their advice. Papers range from very academic to very colloquial and fun (I wrote a guide on how to con people using cogsci), and I assume this is mostly due to what each TA prefers. Like the exams, the paper can either suck or be fine, and it's all up to who you get assigned to.\r\n\r\nOverall a fun class, or maybe not, depending on your luck. ",

He also has a lot of interactive activities written into the lectures so the students can feel more involved. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It's a large lecture so you can't really discuss the things that you learn. Feedback was also not very clear for each student bc each TA had so many students to take care of. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- Our daily readings gave us exposure to real, scientific writing, rather than a textbook. The professor is engaging and is able to introduce  a plethora of topics to students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Because the class covers such a wide breadth of disciplines/ideas, it can be difficult to grasp all key concepts at a fast pace. At times, more time is needed to break down these concepts for better understanding. It can also be difficult to see the relations between topics introduced in class; a greater emphasis on this could possibly facilitate better understanding. ",
            "\u00a0It is a broad course that piques the interest of any student and spurs them to take more classes in cognitive science. Being an introductory course, it does not go in depth with the course material and therefore some concepts may remain quite obscure after the lecture. The professor and TFs are however here to carry on any discussion a student may have following the lecture. It is greatly entertaining and interesting to learn the course material. ",
            "\u00a0A great weakness is how unrelated all of the subjects are. It's clear that cognitive science covers a lot of different areas, but if it's a major, the intro class could have better structure. It makes it difficult to study for the midterm and final. Brian Scholl is a strength and a weakness of the course - he knows a lot and is very entertaining, but he's kind of an asshole. Finally, the readings should be emphasized more - there could be more reading questions so you have to read all of it. ",
            "\u00a0I found every lecture to be very engaging, and it was very easy to find everything I needed on the course website, including syllabus, calendar, expectations, example assignments, and so on. I also loved the subject matter of the course, and I found it extremely exciting and interesting.\r\nBecause it was an introductory course, it did cover a wide range of subjects, and I think that sometimes it was a little hard to see the bigger picture and fit everything together (especially when it came time to study for the midterm). However, the second half of the semester I could follow the umbrella organization a little more easily. ",

Weaknesses are that you have to pay very close attention to take very good notes because not much text is on the powerpoint slides, and sometimes the lectures can have some dry spots that make it hard to pay attention, but they do have cool real world relevance. ",
            "\u00a0The tests were graded quite unfairly and bothered a lot of the students. The lectures were interested, but the setup of it was confusing when it came to studying. I never knew quite what to study. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The workload was appropriate--except for the one lecture at the beginning of the course when 6 (!!!) reading responses were due at the same time :((( But in general, there were 1-2 short pass/fail reading responses due per lecture, 1 paper, a midterm and a final. A weakness of this course was that the midterm and final were ridiculously difficult in terms of testing us on highly specific, random aspects of the readings and lectures. I wish we'd been tested on whether or not we understood the core concepts being taught instead of on little details that have nothing to do with real understanding. Also, so many of the questions were TRICK QUESTIONS that there was one on the midterm in which your performance on the question negatively predicted your performance on the exam overall and the TAs got permission to give us the point back. The lectures on the whole were super engaging and interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0I think its well taught, Scholl has great pedagogy even if he is a tad full of himself at times. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Scholl is an interesting yet arrogant lecturer who at times excites you about the material and at other times lets his own opinions and ego get in the way of the material at hand. The lecture style with no sections also make it easy to go through this class thinking you are fine and then doing awful on exams. The lecture slides posted are also awful for reviewing for exams and are meant to be broad so that people come to lecture but end up containing mainly one-word slides that are no help at all. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - it's just really freakin interesting. Brian Scholl is a personality himself and a really brilliant man. He's taught this class many times and has all his jokes and stuff planned out. You will be laughing your butt off during this class while learning a whole lot. I really enjoyed the class, thought that the readings were helpful and that reading responses were useful, and found the exams to be challenging yet very fair. There are a lot of resources in place to help you succeed in this class, so especially if this is your first semester at Yale, please take advantage of them. When the TFs offer to read your draft, take them up on it. Go to office hours, ask questions, go to review sessions. These things will make the difference between doing mediocre and doing great in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - I heard that some TFs were far stricter graders than others. Luckily, mine was not one of the strict ones. Standardizing grades across TFs if possible would be very helpful. Also, sometimes Brian Scholl made a few comments that were a wee bit yikes. He described a study he read as \"I'm not saying I literally had an orgasm when I read it, but I basically did\" which is really awkward and also was talking about how he wore an eye tracker to class one year and then had to terminate the experiment because he was accidentally staring at girls' boobs (at least that's what he implied). Those comments were like super uncomfy, and I don't think Scholl said them out of malice at all, I think he might just genuinely not know. He's really funny and 99% of his jokes are a hit, but those 1% were a somewhat uncomfortable miss. ",
            "\u00a0I do think that the course could have updated grades on Canvas because it was hard to get a reliable indication of how I was doing throughout the semester. Besides that, the grading was pretty fair and the tests seemed to test knowledge and applications of the class well. ",
            "\u00a0Unlike some of the introductory level courses at Yale, this was a very accessible introductory course. The material was very well explained, in such a way that made it easy to understand. Additionally, the pace of the course was excellent: if it was evident that the class was confused or not fully understanding a concept, the instructor was very flexible about spending more time on it.\r\nIn my opinion, the only downside to the course was that there just wasn't enough time to go over everything! I would have loved to have been able to cover more material.\r\n\r\nOne note: for students who have difficulties with reading (for any number of reasons), the workload is pretty heavy due to the weekly readings, some of which are quite long. I personally would have found it helpful to have had some assistance with this, as I definitely struggled on this front. I don't know how this could be improved, but it's something to think about. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that Brian is a very engaging teacher and he presents the material in a way that lets you know that while it is complex, the concepts nest into each other intuitively. The major weakness of this course is absolutely that Brian made several sexual comments and delivered one glaringly  sexist anecdote to the entire lecture hall, disregarding the implications and consequences that his choices have for the ability of women and nonbinary students in his class to learn. The comments of this nature repeatedly disrupted the class for these individuals. ",

            "\u00a0One strength of this class lies in the fact that the class was engaging and interesting. The material was presented in such a way that made it quite memorable. One weakness of the course was that very little information about the midterm was provided, making some students uncomfortable and unable to decide how to truly prepare. It would also have been nice to be informed of which of the many articles that were assigned would be tested on, as not all articles were explicitly discussed during lecture. In addition, Professor Scholl stated during the first few lectures that lecture slides would most often be posted on the class website prior to lecture, but failed to follow through on this promise. Posting the lecture slides would have helped in note-taking and kept the students from taking unnecessary notes and, instead, focus on taking in and absorbing the new information. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting but the course is very ambiguous so you never really understand what information is supposed to be important and what is just conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: You learn some interesting facts about the mind. The lecturers are usually good; some are more engaging than others.\r\nWeaknesses: The class feels all over the place because of all the content we cover. Brian Scholl really hypes up the class during shopping period, but the intrigue wore off a little as the semester went on. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the strengths of this course regard the pacing and workload of the course. A different topic is basically covered each day, with the readings taking up no more than a few hours of the week. A weakness of the course however revolves around feedback, as it is a large lecture class thought in a manner where it tries to mimic a seminar. ",

            "\u00a0This course was very engaging in class. However, sometimes the professor spoke very quickly and if you missed one of his comments, they would not be on the slides (the slides were almost empty). So it's just really important to be laser focused in class more so than any other class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0One strength is that the course includes a wide array of disciplines, which properly reflects the field of cognitive science. One weakness is that students are often expected to understand a nuanced topic within a discipline for the test (ex. Turning Machines from Computer Science, or Case Assignment from Linguistics). The reason this is a weakness is because those topics were used merely a metaphors for the mind, therefore a student's time is wasted memorizing methods merely to extend an already understood metaphor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We covered a wide array of topics.\r\nWeaknesses: The syllabus had no cohesion. The course was not well structured, and every topic was taught at a surface level, but was expected to be known in detail by students. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture content was not well prepared - the slides had too little content on them and some unnecessary digressions took up too many slides. \r\nIt would also be best if Professor Scholl could limit discussion of his personal opinions (e.g. books on consciousness). For instance, the dismissive tone he used when addressing such topics also made it difficult to bring up contradictory opinions. I did appreciate photos/videos of his daughter, though. ",

I found myself confused about how to study for the midterm.  The only reason I had more success on the final was because of my exposure to the midterm test, not because of any resources, helpful tips, or other defined expectations provided by the instructor.  I was stressed about the final paper because although Scholl provided sample papers for viewing, the prompt itself and its requirements were so vague that I struggled to even identify a topic about which to write.  In a course where the grades of these major assignments matter so much because there are so few grade entries, I believe more clarity would heighten student engagement and success. ",

Every idea flowed into the next. \r\n\r\nWeakness: WAYYY to large. 300 people for a class that should be taught in sections of 30. Really difficult to seek help understanding concepts not easily apparent to you (and there are plenty). The tests were overly tricky, asking for precise terminology in answers that were otherwise correct. Tests are noncumulative, but because there are no textbooks and lecture slides have barely any info, so your own notes are the only thing to help you study. Little to no guidance for the exam, which is why so many freshmen fail the midterm. ",

I thought that it was extremely unnecessarily hard and Professor Scholl made me feel dumb whenever I asked questions by saying that what I was asking was obvious when I know I was not the only one with such concerns. In addition I had a special circumstance during the course and he made it extremely hard for me unnecessarily and made me feel really bad about it when it was out of my control.

            "\u00a0If you would like to explore a different avenue of science this is a great course. This course did end up being a lot more work than I thought it would, however, so be aware of that. It is not a \"gut\" class by any means, and requires substantial studying for exams. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every first year student. The contents of this course are so interesting and not too intellectually challenging. It is crazy to learn about an aspect of the mind and then notice it working in society literally the second you leave lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I would. The study of the mind is really relevant in today's world and it's interesting to learn about the mechanisms behind seemingly common (even to the point of boring) phenomena. The course itself is really interesting and keeps everyone engaged. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at all intrigued by the idea of having your intuitions challenged and making the familiar strange, check this class out. I think everyone should be introduced to cognitive science because it is so important not to take things (even things we are \"endowed with\") for granted. Keep the overarching question of \"how do we study how the mind works\" in mind and you're likely to get more out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. It's a super interesting course and Professor Scholl is the best. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It is accessible to students from any background and field, and, given its interdisciplinary nature, likely has relevance to students with a wide variety of interests. The material is novel as it is not a subject taught in any ordinary high school, and the course is structured so as to facilitate learning of critical thinking skills alongside the actual material. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It was a great class. If you are interested in pure psychology, I would take intro psych over this, because that class is more interesting in terms of a psychological study of the mind. But if you're interested in computer science or linguistics as well as psychology, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Even if your major isn't cognitive science I highly recommend taking this course. The information you learn from this class is applicable and relevant to various fields, as Brian Scholl emphasizes throughout each lecture. If you're not an auditory learner, though, be advised that the course might be tough for the first few classes until you get a hang of it. I realized that the best way to study for the exams is by talking with classmates about the topics you went over in the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - everyone should take either intro psych or intro cog sci. Its a good 5th class - not too much work, pretty interesting stuff ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because of the content, but I don't think that the course is taught especially well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because it is a nice introduction to the many dimensions of cognitive science. For the most part, lectures were engaging and interactive and the material was interesting and relevant to our lives. The course is definitely manageable in terms of work and I enjoyed my time in the class. Professor Scholl is funny and a good lecturer but sometimes he can get a bit carried away with his humor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the field of Cognitive Science is fascinating but make sure you know what you're getting yourself into. It's not easy (many people bomb the final) and the material is very much handpicked in regards to what the professor finds interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the lectures are interesting and the class is not the most taxing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. It was a pleasure to be in the class. Brian's ability to speak on the content was amazing, and it was always great to listen in and learn. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course; each class you'll leave with a new insight into something you might encounter regularly. The best moments in the class were the moments of collective amazement when Brian demonstrated some insane phenomenon relevant to the course material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you are at all interested, take it. Lectures often feel like a Ted Talk: exciting and edgy, maybe a little hyperbolic at times, but just keep a sharp mind about you. You may get tired of hearing that \"vision is impossible\" but you won't get tired of the visual illusions. Be sure to invest in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to students who want to major in cognitive science. Otherwise, if you are a student who wants a taste of psychology, then just take psychology. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend the class. Cognitive science involves several really cool subjects that I think many people find fascinating - psychology, philosophy, computer science, to name a few. The lecture is really engaging and Brian Scholl is really enthusiastic about the subject. The workload is very much doable - short reading responses due each class - and it allows you to really enjoy the class. ",
            "\u00a0For those interested in cognitive science, definitely recommend. However, the class is very disorganized so beware. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in gaining a cursory knowledge of the material without really going into depth on any one. Brian is an engaging lecturer, but sometimes the class as a whole suffers from being so disparate and seemingly lacking any central planning. It's not particularly difficult, but sometimes the tests are unnecessarily random and specific, creating a peculiar grading scale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great class that covers how a normal person thinks and operates in the real world. Whereas introduction to psychology covers how people are different and the corner-cases of mental life (developmental psychology, abnormal psychology, evolutionary psychology), introduction to cog sci covers how people are similar (perception, attention, attraction, rationality, etc). Also Brian Scholl is a good lecturer and every class is like a TED Talk. However, the weekly reading responses can be annoying and the exams can be hard to study for. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if they want to learn a lot but possibly as a credit D or if they have an easier overall course load ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student considering the cognitive science major OR any a major in any of the areas that are a part of cognitive science such as linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, etc. It is a great way to gain exposure to multiple disciplines. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend the course if the student was committed to going to office hours at least once every two weeks and was willing/able to engage with the material extensively on their own time. While I loved the content of the course, the lack of organization of the lectures (in terms of discussing how concrete examples contributed to a growing knowledge of common themes) made me very frustrated at the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in cognitive science or want a fun lecture class.\r\nNo, if you have a lot of other heavy workload classes that will make you neglect spending time to extract the key details to study in this one. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I didn't even know what cogsci was before this class, and now I'm thinking about majoring in it. I'd describe it as the perfect course for humanities kids interested in STEM. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student if you are okay with vague assignments and tricky exams (i.e. the types of multiple-choice questions where you have to pick the *most* correct answer), or are super interested in the field of cognitive science. As a cognitive science major, I found the information in this course super interesting and many of the studies we read as well, but didn't like the structure of the course nearly at all. All in all, it definitely is an engaging lecture with lots of illusions and activities (the first half is definitely better than the second half, in my opinion), and if you're interested in CogSci as a major it's definitely worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not. While some of the material is interesting, the course is not designed to facilitate learning and a lot of what we learn is just interesting facts about various areas cognitive science rather than anything cohesive. ",

            "\u00a0Only if you are willing to take it seriously. It's interesting for sure, and may give you clarity about whether or not you would like it to be your major, but there are more worthwhile classes that would be more fun to take and build up to something rather than just giving you a bunch of random knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's not too difficult; so long as you keep up with the readings and reading responses, come to lecture, and pay attention, I think that you will do fairly well in the class. And the material is just really interesting; there does not need to be a lot of manufactured \"exciting\" activities or tangential applications; every single day we are learning things that matter in our lives, and I found it really cool. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. I learned so many interesting things, the lectures were entertaining, and the workload isn't too bad. This class should be interesting to anyone; the information is relevant to all people and helped me better understand the way we think. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because it is a good introduction to cognitive science and will give you a better perspective on if you want to continue studying cognitive science in some fashion, and Brian Scholl is interesting and funny in his own way. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you want to major in Cog Sci... otherwise, it's not one of those general classes that's just fun and interesting for your life like Intro Psych... the best parts of this class were covered in Psych and the Good Life and Intro Psych. (\"Fun\" is not how I would describe this class, although the lectures often have cool trivia-type tidbits about our weird human minds.) It's hard in a petty way but not in a super satisfying \"Oh I understand a new subject now\" way. For instance, they spend a lot of time forcing you to learn how to solve Turing Machine problems (a computer science thing) to prove the point that a device (i.e. the mind) can reuse a few simple components to create myriad different outcomes. Sort of unnecessary in my opinion but my friends who are majoring in cog sci loved this course so I don't know! As a non-major, it was decent, but felt like busywork sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think everyone should take this course. Especially if Scholl is teaching it, his pedagogy is top notch. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you are interested in how and why people think and act the way they do and if you are able to take good quick notes or know someone else in the class that is. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's an excellent introduction to a WIDE variety of fields at Yale. Especially if you don't know what you want to study, take this class and it'll give you exposure to Cog Sci proper and all the fields that compose it - Psych, Linguistics, CS, Neuro, etc. ",

The course teaches students to question what they think they know to be true and question the origins and validity of their instincts. ",

But by the end of the class, I have a hard time articulating what I actually learned. If you're looking for a class with an easy workload, occasionally funny lectures, and tidbits of interesting facts about the mind, take it. Beware that the midterm and final are difficult and needlessly tricky. ",
