            "\u00a0in depth introduction to social network analysis. We spent the first half going over network measures and the second half of the course was focused on papers and different studies. We were not taught how to use R even though the assignments required it and it was not a pre-req for the class. ",
            "\u00a0I got a good survey of relevant literature regarding social network analysis and developed a good vocabulary for discussing and analyzing social networks. I  also got a feel for how those ideas and techniques are applied to practical social network analysis and examining its larger impacts on society. ",

            "\u00a0There could be more clarity on the expectations for the final assignments. A strength of the course was the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the material is pretty cool, and the readings are actually quite interesting as well if you have a strong technical background (in statistics/statistical testing methods). I liked the smaller class size and the open-ended nature of the final paper; I felt that I had actually achieved something after running an experiment and writing my own sociology research paper at the end of the year. Also, the class has a very low amount of work, so it's very chill. \r\nWeaknesses: Even though the class was small, us students never talked to each other! And by never, I mean basically never, except on the last class and during activities where we were forced to talk to each other (we once played telephone in class to demonstrate diffusion). Professor Erikson didn't really take the time in the beginning to force us to get to know each other, so the rest of the class ended up being very much like this: Prof: is this a hard question? Why is no one answering? Us: *crickets, not because it's hard but because we all feel very awkward talking in front of each other* I thought we could've learned so much more had the discussions been real discussions, and had prof. Erikson given us more responsibility to be active participants rather than passive listeners to her talking. ",
            "\u00a0They could make the readings more required so people will actually do them and participate more in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: cool subject, assignments not too hard\r\nWeaknesses: discussion goes VERY slowly, we often ran out of things to talk about during the class. ",
            "\u00a0More engagement for students; its very different than other socy classes so the minimal about of practice made comprehension difficult ",
            "\u00a0The class typically combined a lesson and a discussion of the readings. I found this learning environment to be helpful and to keep me engaged for the full class. However, I felt a little lost with some of the network software, and I think we should have dedicated a little more in class to figuring out how that worked, especially since a background with the software is not required. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the first half of the course had been more structured so that it could have been more beneficial to use when completing the final project. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments are straightforward and introduce you to practical methods for analyzing and visualizing social networks, and the readings are quite interesting. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is the assignments that guides the student and make the student work on its own.\r\n\r\nThere could however be used more time on general terms and less on specific studies. Studies should show an example. ",
            "\u00a0I think the seminar could be taught with a bit more interactive work instead of discussion - perhaps people working on R social network problems together in small groups during part of the class. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This was my first sociology course and I found the topics super interesting and very relevant to current events. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in analyzing data in a very different way. There were many new techniques that I learned as part of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly don't know. I really didn't like that only a handful of students talked in class, even though there were over 20 of us, and I did not like that Prof. Erikson didn't hold anyone accountable for just sitting on their laptops doing other work during a two-hour seminar-like class. I thought the material itself was interesting, and Prof. Erikson is super smart, kind, and eager to teach, but the class in general was just facilitated poorly. ",
            "\u00a0Kind of, I mean I enjoyed learning to use the tools for social network analysis but once we got past week 6ish of the class, I had completely checked out because the class meetings got super slow, you can definitely get away with not doing a ton and still doing well in the class. ",
            "\u00a0If its something youre interested in actually studying definitely yes but as far as a quantitative class, no. There was no introduction to the software like R which was frustrating for someone who had never used it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as they are interested in networks in a quantitative and analytical sense. We did not talk as much about real social applications as I would have thought, and we spent a lot of time looking at data from studies that can be a bit confusing if youre not interested in this type of analysis. If youre just looking a social credit, be aware that this one will feel very much like a QR at times. ",
            "\u00a0Great class for people starting the sociology major! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. To really get a lot out of the class you have to really engage with the readings and the supplemental material, so be prepared to read a lot of research. ",
            "\u00a0I would. Knowing how to do social network theory is very useful and this class is a good introduction. ",
            "\u00a0If they are interested in learning social network analysis for future work, yes. "
