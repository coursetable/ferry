            "\u00a0Strengths: accessible to students with minimal background in math ",
            "\u00a0The homework for the course often required understanding of the math that was far above that which was taught in class (e.g. was skipped over) in order to get the insights necessary to understand how to do the problems. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was taught very well.  I thought it progressed at a good pace, and I thought the material was very interesting.  I thought it was wonderful that almost all of the material for the class was posted online.\r\n\r\nI thought the class got rather biology-intensive towards the end.  I suspect the vast majority of the students were in subfields of biology, but since this class was listed in a number of non-biology departments, I wish there would have been a little bit more support for the non-biology majors.\r\n\r\nMy only gripe was that the papers in particular took a very long time to get graded.  By the time the fourth and final one was due, only the first one had been graded.  It's kind of hard to improve your mistakes if you're not getting feedback. ",
