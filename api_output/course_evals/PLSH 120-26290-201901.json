The course structures is a bit lax, so you could skate by without doing much work. But, if you are committed to learning the language and putting in the time and effort, you will learn a lot. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Krystyna is absolutely amazing and Polish is an amazing language. The class is not difficult (although the Polish language is) and is so much fun. You'll develop a really close relationship with Krystyna and your classmates because there are so few people who take the course. ",
