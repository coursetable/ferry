            "\u00a0I became a much more creative thinker in terms of making connections between literature and art and the environment. Interdisciplinary in the best way, and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so many things in this class! Through hands-on activities and field trips, I learned how to thresh wheat, identify different edible plants, and herd chickens. Readings, mini-lectures and discussions gave me much more insight into the history of Russian politics, culture and ecology, as well as how to analyze literature and art from an ecological lens. Finally, through my field journal, I became more introspective as to how this class (and others in my past and present Yale experience) relate to other aspects of my life, and how I will use what I've learned going forward. Needless to say, it was an awesome semester! ",
            "\u00a0It was incredibly insightful to learn about Russian literature and art outside of the city. The frequent farm trips bolstered the materials very well, and made for an incredibly pleasant class. ",
            "\u00a0analysis, creativity ",
            "\u00a0The main life-time take-away from this course--at least for me--is the appriciation for the environment around us. There is something magic about seeing a tree, and instead of simply a mass of green and brown, knowing the tree has a name, knowing the history of the species, etc. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so, so cool--I learned about Russia/the USSR, but also that \"ecological readings\" of literature can mean any number of things: deep scientific/taxonomic knowledge, an understanding of an experience (like threshing wheat or herding chickens), or even just a consideration of how people interact with the world around them. I loved that this class expanded the definition of \"ecology\" to encompass our environments and our relationships to them, and I definitely see my place in the world a little differently than I did before. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a very broad overview of Russian culture and history. The course also provided a unique perspective through which to view nature and engage with it, and exposed me to many pieces of literature that I would never otherwise have read but am extremely glad I did. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to deep read, and to write more probing, less \"safe\" essays. I was taught how to explore ideas in class that surfaced and transform them into something more full-bodied and developed in an essay. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first class focused on both literature and Russian culture so I definitely got a lot of insight into those. Definitely helped me to see literature through an environmental lens even when it isnt immediately obvious how to do that. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read literature through a different lens, in this case through the lens of ecological engagement. I also learned about the different kinds of ecological engagement at the Yale Farm. "

            "\u00a0Overall, amazing course. The one thing I wish was different is that we read some pretty random, not great lit. I would have preferred a slightly more canonical selection. Otherwise, the hands-on activities, discussions, and projects were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome! The field trips, mini-lectures, and discussions were all great. Molly and Isabel were both very committed to the literature and the class at a whole; the syllabus was excellent, and discussion was often accompanied by delicious Russian treats that Isabel brought or even made herself (pierogi, honey cake, kvass, various pickled things...!). I had so much fun getting to talk about literature while outside. ",
            "\u00a0great course all around, great material, great professors. I would have more guidelines for the final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths in the supplementary activities (every event at the Yale Farm), weaknesses in the discussions. Sometimes (Albeit rarely) it felt there was a 'right' answer that was being looked for, rather than organic conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The field journal was so much fun--it kept me engaged with the course's topics all semester, and forced me to think of ways in which my own life related to our readings and discussions. I honestly wish all classes had assignments like this--a low-stress, creative, make-of-it-what-you-will approach to applying course work to our own lives. It made me much more invested in our readings and conversations, too. I also loved that our discussions began with specific events or topics in Russian culture or literature, but almost always expended to broader, thematic questions. And the activities! And field trips! It was so fun. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was definitely in making you contemplate your relationship to nature. Also, I really valued the exposure to Russian culture. I loved the activity portion of the class, as well. Sometimes I felt like the introductions to our discussions were a little long. Also, I felt that the instructors could've been more active in encouraging an evolving discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I like the hands-on aspect of the course. Every week, we did a new activity that was related to our texts, such as identifying trees, threshing and winnowing wheat, learning about taxidermy or foraging for edible plants. We also had most of our lessons on the farm. I really appreciate the effort that Molly and Isabel put in to making sure that this course was engaging and interesting for us. I also really liked how the course included the field journal as part of its assessment. I was able to synthesize my learning through a series of creative entries, and I really enjoyed that unique way of work. I had a lot of fun putting together all of my entries. \r\n\r\nWorkload is very manageable, 1 field entry journal per week and only 2 papers for the whole semester. Readings only about 50-120 pages per week, sometimes a book instead of readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI feel like this course would add the most value only if you have a decent background in Russian works of literature. No knowledge of that is required for the course, but you definitely get more out of it if you are familiar with some works. Honestly, I felt like the link between nature and some of our readings was sometimes quite forced, and that we were trying to distill something related to nature about the work of literature when there was nothing really there. I don't know how much I really took away from this course in terms of content, and I don't think I learnt as much as I hoped to. Nevertheless it was an interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - cool take on both nature and literature, also the activities were an excellent way to make he course more interesting and more relatable\r\nWeaknesses - ecology is a slightly misleading term, also some of the readings were very tedious and then not discussed at all ",
            "\u00a0This course did a really good job of integrating the cultural aspects and the ecological aspects. Each week was a different theme and was connected to something we could do at the farm, which was really effective. \r\n\r\nIt was difficult on the weeks when it got too cold to go to the farm, and we had to spend the whole time discussing inside. I think it could be improved if some other sort of interactive activity could be found for those weeks that connected to the theme, because the combination of activity and discussion was one of the biggest strengths of this course.

            "\u00a0Absolutely! Fun, interesting, meaningful. This class represents how literature can inform our lives. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone and everyone remotely interested in Russian literature and/or ecological history! It is so refreshing to talk about readings while outside. I found the readings, field trips and field journal all extremely rewarding, and loved the multidisciplinary spread of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It was a great intersection between nature and Russian culture and challenges my views about both. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course! It is a great way to take your learning out of the classroom and be creative. Not a lot of work, interesting material, fun activities. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a wonderful experience, and results in a re-framing of the world through the ecological lens, ",
            "\u00a0Yes--it's a really fun and engaging way to learn about Russia and ecology, even if you know nothing about either of those things. The approach to the material is super broad, in a way that lets you approach the discussions/papers in whatever way you choose. And there are field trips! And chickens! And Russian food! ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course. It provides a very broad overview of an element of history/culture that we normally ignore, and likewise facilitates an increased awareness of one's place in nature. ",
            "\u00a0This was an interesting class and could potentially be a decent gut class. Workload is very manageable, 1 field entry journal per week and only 2 papers for the whole semester. Readings only about 50-120 pages per week, sometimes a book instead of readings. You get to be outdoors on the Yale farm and do fun activities during class.\r\n\r\nHowever, I feel like this course would add the most value only if you have a decent background in Russian works of literature. No knowledge of that is required for the course, but you definitely get more out of it if you are familiar with some works. Honestly, I felt like the link between nature and some of our readings was sometimes quite forced, and that we were trying to distill something related to nature about the work of literature when there was nothing really there. Furthermore, we read snippets from different works of literature every class, so we didn't do a very deep analysis of the works. I don't know how much I really took away from this course in terms of content, and I don't think I learnt as much as I hoped to. If you are just looking for a \"for fun\" course and want to dabble in Russian lit, take this course. But if you want to come away from the semester feeling like you learnt something concrete and in depth, don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0Great course - though a more accurate course name might be Russian literature through an environmental lens. The weekly activities are what make this course stand out, they definitely make the readings more relatable and they are so much more fun than sitting around for the entire seminar. The instructors were both very nice and extremely helpful with their feedback on my writing. Readings vary significantly in length week by week. ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fascinating class. It's such an interesting intersection of ecology and culture, and allows for discussion that is different from what you normally get in this sort of art/literature class because it's so focused on interactions with the environment. Each week was a different theme, and as long as it was still warm out we met at the Yale Farm and did some activity related to that theme or to the readings for the week - apple picking, looking at their chickens, threshing wheat. The workload isn't that bad, just two papers and a field journal that you have to do weekly (but that's pretty chill). The readings were really interesting, and made for some very interesting discussions. If you have any interest in Russian culture, or just want to see the intersection of culture and ecology, definitely take this class. "
