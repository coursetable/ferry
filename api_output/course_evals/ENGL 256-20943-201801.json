            "\u00a0I took English 120 my fall term of freshman year, and it was only fitting that I end with another creative non-fiction class my second semester senior year. Although I initially thought this class was going to be more geared towards the idea of \"family\", I think the distribution between meditating on the different lenses through which one can tackle writing about family and also the polishing of our individual writing voices, styles and structures was well-balanced and constructive. \r\n\r\nThe selected readings were from a wide range, making our inspiration pool pretty deep and exposing us to a variety of voices which we could play around with. At the end of this course, I definitely think that I've improved as a writer (thank you workshops!) but also as an intentional puzzle piece of a family. ",
            "\u00a0I learned various considerations a writer should have when writing about family. Prior to taking this class, I was not aware of how much care a writer took regarding the ethics of writing about certain topics or people. I also learned different creative nonfiction writing techniques (referencing documents, hermit crab essay writing, etc). ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about writing about family and the different ethical concerns that go with it. This class is absolutely necessary for the Yale Creative Writing Dept! Dr. Hopper is so great at teaching us how to craft an essay with public significance and make it well written, but also interesting. She also crafts the BEST syllabi--Fun Home changed my life! ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the complex craft of writing family narratives, including how to navigate the ethical dilemmas of writing about others, how to engage with the liberties one must take in writing non-fiction, and how to conduct interviews effectively. I cannot adequately summarize the amount of wonderful insights on writing, remembering, and reflecting about family that we obtained through class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0No other class I've taken has so effectively balanced content and craft. In each discussion, I emerged with concrete takeaways about how creative nonfiction works: structure, form, audience, research, public point, defamiliarization. But beyond the technical elements of textual analysis, our discussion of the themes of family was rich and deep. I had the sense we were collectively grappling, tackling topics of personal significance in ways that inspired real catharsis and growth in each of us. I've taken other classes (about religion, literature, race, identity) that have allowed me to engage with difficult themes in this way. And I've take creative writing courses that focus on craft at a sentence and paragraph level. But I've never taken a class that has done both simultaneously, all in the context of a community of empathetic friends. \r\n\r\nI think this dual capacity was fostered by the excellent syllabus of Writing About Family and through its structure of discussion and workshopping. Each reading was carefully chosen, from a wide variety of genres, formats, and author identities, to expose us to the maximum range of voice and form. Through works like Andrew Solomon's \"Far From the Tree,\" I gained a vocabulary of \"horizontal\" versus \"vertical\" identity, who I am (or am not) in relation (or not in relation) to my family. Through the graphic novel \"Fun Home,\" I learned the many symbolic ways that a story can be told and explored the ethics of writing about family members. Through countless excellent online essays, we discussed the pros and cons of online publication of personal essays, a genre that is very relevant to college students. The constant feedback from Dr. Hopper and fellow students through drafts and workshops gave me the confidence to practice these skills in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about different ways that writers have thought about and engaged with the concept of family, as well as the different documents that one might use in creative writing. I also gained insight into the ethical dilemmas that writers face in writing about personal issues that are also of public significance. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write about my family in a way that was also writing about myself, as well as how to ethically write about other people and how best to take their feelings into consideration (or not). I also learned a lot about my own family and family history, as well as about myself. ",
            "\u00a0This class is so much more than a class about writing. It teaches empathy and a deep understanding of kinship, then challenges students to articulate those learnings through writing. I not only learned how to write about family but also how writing about family could serve so many functions of telling a story or promoting a wider social agenda. Definitely one of the best classes I've ever taken in my life. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think critically about creative writing and what the ethics of writing about family and friends are. I have never been challenged to explore my thoughts and feelings in such an academic and thoughtful way and cannot speak more highly of the takeaways from this course. I learned so much about myself, my experiences, and learned to write these thoughts down in a powerful and accessible way. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: everyone in the class is very dedicated and supportive of each other. This was a safe and closed environment for sharing personal stories, which many people found very therapeutic. The readings were all carefully selected and were diverse, which I especially appreciated. Dr. Hopper was great at leading discussion; my peers also had insightful comments. The writing exercises and essays in this class helped me see myself in relation to my family in a new way. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths--everything! The reading list was great, Dr. Hopper is the best professor for this class EVER and the assignments were spaced out well and interesting. The workshops were incredible--my best experience at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0This was an absolutely wonderful course in how it engaged with both the crafting and the conceptualizing sides of producing creative non-fiction. I immensely enjoyed some incredibly engaging class discussions and unbelievable reading assignments. I can think of no major flaws. ",
            "\u00a0I alluded to the strengths of the course in my answer to the previous question. Honestly, this was the most well-crafted course I've ever taken. The strengths that stand out include:\r\nThe excellent mix of genre, form, and voice in the syllabus. \r\nThe workshop format and chance for constant feedback from peers. \r\nThe way that the content of the readings-- deep personal reflections-- set a standard for sharing that allowed us to create an open and trusting environment. \r\nThe strong and inclusive community feeling Dr. Hopper created in the course. \r\nThe dual focus on themes of family and personal growth, while also paying attention to the craft of creative nonfiction. \r\nMy only suggestion for improvement is to say that I wish this course went on longer than one semester! ",
            "\u00a0I thought a huge strength of the course was the way in which Professor Hopper seamlessly integrated material from each week into active discussions about important debates in the field of writing about family. A few of my favorite weeks included conversations on race, class, gender, and disability. The course discussed a range of relationships that moved outside of traditional narratives about family to question what constituted the idea of \"family\" to begin with. I don't see any way in which the course could be improved. The writing exercises each week were very thoughtful, the reading list always raised critical questions for discussion, the essays were well spaced with plenty of time for discussion and feedback, and Professor Hopper created a writing environment in which all students felt comfortable and empowered to share their work. The course has perhaps been one of the very few classes at Yale in which I have been able to explore an aspect of my own experience with complete creative control, and I hope that courses like this continue to be part of the writing department here. ",
            "\u00a0The course was brilliantly organized, the reading list was awesome and diverse, and I really liked the feel of the class itself. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major strength of this course that I appreciated each and every week was the diversity of the readings that were assigned to us. The syllabus included excerpts from longer pieces, articles, and sometimes even poems. They were from such a wide range of writers and contributors (so many different types of people), which is fitting because writing about family is at core intimate and personal and there's no one way to represent writing about family. I think Dr. Hopper did a great job of making sure that was an intentional move throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nI also loved the workshop set ups and especially the sharing of readings and relevant articles and resources among the students. Dr. Hopper created a great environment and structure for the students to serve as mentors and guides to each other through this process. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would 400% recommend this course to another student. I think the topic of writing about family yields a self-selecting group of students that are interested in diving into a more introspective, reflective mode of thinking that sometimes takes a backseat at Yale. Although Dr. Hopper provided us with a breadth of intellectual documents, I think the real insight I got was developing my own voice through my writing style and structure that was fed by some serious introspection. \r\n\r\nThe readings are interesting, Dr. Hopper is incredible, and I promise you'd learn more about yourself in a variety of contexts than you perhaps thought you would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is one of the best classes I have ever taken at Yale! I love Dr. Hopper so much and everyone in my class was so amazing. This course is a beautiful opportunity to share personal writing with a group of people in a structured environment. This is also one of the only intermediate creative nonfiction writing courses at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE WRITING ABOUT FAMILY! Dr. Hopper is an absolute QUEEN--the best professor I have ever had at Yale! This class was incredible and fun and we just had a fantastic time. We read such incredible works as Fun Home and Far From the Tree, as well as a bunch of articles that Dr. Hopper is fantastic at curating. Lots of fun little field trips. Best class chemistry I have ever experienced--you really get to know the other students! Most of all, Dr. Hopper is absolutely phenomenal and has the best advice. Always gives great feedback and willing to incorporate your thoughts into the course. Best class I've ever taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES YES. I am so sad to hear this won't be offered next semester, since Dr. Hopper is teaching in New York, but if Yale offers this class in any shape or form in the future, then TAKE IT. Dr. Hopper is an incredible professor who managed to form an incredibly tight-knit community of writers in a semester. I learned so much about writing, about my family, and about myself. One of the best classes I've taken at Yale, and I'm a last semester senior. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course ranks in best experiences I've had at Yale. I wish every incoming student could have the chance to take it. This course is timely and crucial for young adults. The insight we gain about our own identities-- sorting through the complex baggage and past that we each arrive with-- is priceless. To do this in a setting of such diverse and supportive community, while also developing our skills as writers, is simply the best possible experience of a class. I hope this course continues, in semesters and summer programs, for years to come. ",
            "\u00a0One hundred percent recommend taking this course again if you can. It might only be offered during summer session, but if you will be here for the summer, take this class. Professor Hopper is absolutely lovely, and she will help you grow so much as a writer. I had kind of been afraid of taking creative writing courses at Yale because of the reputation they had, but Professor Hopper created a truly welcoming and warm environment for everyone to join. The readings were always a joy to read. You'll grow in important ways through this course--and the essays are a huge part of that. Professor Hopper gives you almost complete creative liberty, provides great feedback, and advice early on in the writing process. I can't recommend her more. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course NEEDS to be taught at Yale in some other capacity after Dr. Hopper's departure. The self-reflection inherent to this course is such a good vehicle to fine-tuning your craft. We were taught how to research (which sounds simple but, trust me, this class gives another meaning of the word) and how to analyze. The different samples we studied (aside from being evidence of the great care Dr. Hopper put into selecting the syllabus) were varied in terms of medium and overall were master examples of the techniques we were using in our own essays. Because of the nature of the course and \r\nthrough workshop you learn a lot about your fellow classmates which makes the class more like a group of friends meeting to improve their writing than a T/Th 11:35. Just. Keep this class at Yale somehow. Please. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, 100%, and I am really sad that it won't be offered again since Dr. Hopper is leaving. If it is offered as a summer course I know that a bunch of people I know would be interested, since they saw how much I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly highly highly recommend this course to another student. I've already had so many friends who have come up to me asking if this course is being taught again, and I've had to disappoint them by letting them know that Dr. Hopper will be leaving! I took this class because I wanted to break into the world of creative writing at Yale, and I thought writing about family would be a good way to start writing at all. The topic of this course is so relevant and so necessary. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would recommend this course. I had never taken a creative writing class before, but the way this course is set up, the class becomes a very intimate setting in which you share a lot with your professor and classmates and people are so supportive and helpful. If you want to learn more about yourself and how to creatively write, PLEASE take this course. "
