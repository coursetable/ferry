While the topics covered were important I do not think I took away anything significant beyond relying on chemists to be better at designing chemicals. This course was not designed for students who were more interested in big picture issues. ",

            "\u00a0The class could be improved by eliminating the final project, and instead rolling out the chemistry at a slower pace.  That, and the readings were totally disconnected from what was covered in class.  I'd prepare for a discussion on recycling or plastic biodegradability and we'd have a class on KOW values or ecotoxisity. It seemed like the instructors tried to pack too much in too quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it seemed that this course was caught between two groups of students with two different knowledge bases. It moved very quickly for students without a large chemistry background, who might have wanted a deeper dive into reactions, molecular behavior etc. Those with more in-depth backgrounds might have found this part of the class to move slow. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe course was clearly laid out and taught readily accessible concepts and tools which students then applied in simple ways.\r\nThe material is relevant and interesting to a wide range of environmental topics and concepts.\r\nPaul and Julie were high energy and readily accessible to students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  \r\nStudents who did not understand concepts slowed the class considerably.  I would expect these students to spend more time outside of class, either in office hours or doing reading, learning these concepts.  There were many classes when the same basic principles would be presented for the first 30 minutes in order to ensure everyone was up to speed.  Greater onus should be placed on the students to use the time and resources available to them outside of class.\r\n\r\nImprovement:\r\nPush students to do more work outside of lectures.\r\nI would have liked to go deeper on some topics, such as the differences between bioavailable toxic and bioavailable non-toxic substances, than we did.  \r\nChoose an indepth case study to explore in the last half (post midterm) of class to discuss the design and engineering aspects of society in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0I think the content was great, and absolutely necessary for any future sustainability manager. Don't let anyone in IE not take this course - performing the alternatives assessment was the best part. I felt like my team still did not really understand the science behind what they were reading for the assessment, which was a little concerning. Perhaps the expectations were not high enough earlier in the course that would force them to learn it better. I would expect a future sustainability manager to be able to read an alternatives assessment to compare two products in the future. ",

It focuses on the movement of harmful chemicals into people/the environment so if that is not of interest then do not take the class.  The chemistry and equations are very simple and accessible, especially since Paul & Julie are so willing to spend time talking through them after class. ",
