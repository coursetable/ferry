            "\u00a0ANTH 471 is disorganized, has poor communication between the department and students, and left students confused about requirements and criteria throughout the term. A big responsibility of structure of course resides between the student and the student's specific advisor, but the department also has a responsibility in providing effective oversight of ANTH 471. There is no structure or guidance throughout the process, and while I see minimal formal structure as a beneficial approach since too much formal structure can be overbearing, the lack of any structure whatsoever was very frustrating.
