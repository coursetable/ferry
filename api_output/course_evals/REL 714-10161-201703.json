            "\u00a0Zhenya was also lovely and very skilled at leading discussion section in a way that was both consistent and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0She was very effective. ",
            "\u00a0Zhenya was kind while still holding us to high standards. Sections were always a high point of my week. She was sure to engage everyone, and make sure we grasped the material. She also seemed to care about us as students. ",
            "\u00a0Zhenya was always enthusiastic and prepared. Even when we were not. She knew the subject matter and how to instigate discussion. She never dominated discussion but always helped us draw out what we thought. She encouraged difference of opinion.  In short, she was an excellent facilitator in a 'section' setting.  Our sections materialized as what they were intended to be.  They augmented the lectures.\r\nI was VERY impressed with the turn around of the final paper submissions and receiving them 2+ days later with substantive and insightful comments. All of our written assignments contained reasoned, attentive and substantive comments. ",
            "\u00a0Zhenya was brilliant in her ability to lead discussion and she always encouraged participation.  The section was wonderful at zeroing-in on issues discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Levgeniia was attentive, present, cordial and knowledgeable of course material. ",
            "\u00a0She prepared well every section. Great job leading interesting discussions. Also she gave a set of questions to consider for readings. This probably helped a lot of us who don't necessarily have the historian mindset. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Zenya is a very encouraging and enthusiastic TF. She clearly wanted us to learn the material and developed a wide range of techniques in section to encourage our learning. She was always available on email and willing to answer questions. I did feel, however, that she graded more and more gently as the semester went on. It made it difficult to tell if I have really improved my writing in that time period. Perhaps she didn't grade easier--I just improved--but several people made this observation. Overall, I really liked working with Zenya this year. She is very friendly and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Ievgeniia was very aware of the content material and she answered questions in a knowledgeable manner. ",
            "\u00a0Thought her questions and class preparation were exceptional. ",
            "\u00a0very well prepared TA, she was great and definitely knew what she was talking about, made the class atmosphere fun and mixed up teaching styles ",
            "\u00a0Excellent in every respect. "
