            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge about the religious history of Europe from the medieval ages to the early modern period, and I learnt how closely linked the Church and state were. Also, I developed my ability to read primary source through the readings we were set and the discussions we had at the beginning of each lesson, which helped clear any questions and solidify the main points from the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Through attending this course I was able to learn about Christianity in the second millennium. The course not only covers general history but also has in-depth discussions about theology and philosophy. Through learning history, I really gain new understandings of many issues in the present society. This course also helps me to improve my English reading skill as well as writing skill. ",
            "\u00a0Critical reading and thinking; dealing with a historical text; knowledge of the Christian religion ",
            "\u00a01. The skill of reading primary documents, especially getting used to the old English translations whose grammar is insane\r\n2. It inspired my interest in the European intellectual history, especially the transition from medieval thoughts to Renaissance and finally to the Enlightenment, and it is my first time getting so close to the works of these historical figures and I am super excited\r\n3. I learned new skills for making jokes\r\n4. I found parallels between different cultures, the most prominent one being the similarity between Machiavellism and the ancient Chinese school \"Legalism\", since the environment in which they were born were similarly chaotic and turbulent, and their teachings were astoundingly alike, including the human nature being selfish and greedy, the necessity of using violence and punishments, the value of military, the advocacy of a shrewd and strong ruler, the thought that what seems moral and good may result in evil and disorder, the emphasis of the present instead of the ancient past, and the need for social order, even the criticism they received were quite the same. A similar parallel could be drawn between civic humanism and confucianism. Also the dissents in Medieval period which interpreted the teachings of Jesus in a different way from the authority and still worshipped the God, were quite similar to the dissents in Confucianist society which had completely different thoughts from the mainstream Confucianists but still regard Confucius as the highest authority.\r\n5. Religious tolerance grew because people were tired of the fightings between different sects of Christianity and began admire the \"pure\" form of worship\r\n6. Protestants were as repressive as Catholics in the reformation\r\n7. The relation between Renaissance and Reformation\r\n8. The radical reforms in the reformation like anabaptists\r\n9. Superstitions of Medieval times and \"time of too many names\", one of the funniest parts\r\n10. Machiavelli was the best Catholic ever (It seems like something is going wrong)\r\n11. A thousand more insights were listed here, click here to view ",
            "\u00a0Before I took the class, I have no idea about Christianism. I felt I've learned a lot about the main ideas/ interpretations of Christianity during the Medieval and Renaissance. Also, I felt by learning these ideas, I can deal with some issues with less anxiety, especially the ideas in Pensees. when I read the articles, I felt they were so boring and hard to understand, but once I understand them, I'm so glad that I didn't drop the class. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills of going deep into historical texts and analyzing how specific choices in the text are connected to a broader historical tradition and pattern. ",
            "\u00a0The course gave me deeper insight into already familiar historical figures, and caused me to more critically examine the role of violence in several religious and political movements.  Rather than the cursory understanding of major chapters of European and Christian history, I was able to stop and explore different thinkers in the context of their times and contemporary forces, using primary source materials.  It was more an intellectual quest, rather than a historic survey.  In that manner, it offered that \"aha!\" realization at the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Christian history this summer with vivid details. This showed me how religion still cast its shadow to the modern world, which is impressive. "

            "\u00a0The material is slightly boring and the readings can be boring. Class was interesting and engaging though. ",
            "\u00a0The content for this course was very fascinating, and the readings set were interesting to read and discuss. The PowerPoints clearly laid out the main points from each lecture and Dr Eire's lecturing was always engaging. The course could have included a bit more about the historical debate surrounding certain events and the period we studied, but other than that, the course was excellent! ",
            "\u00a0The course schedule is generally well-organized with readings that are closely related to each class. The materials are all easily accessible and are really helpful for understanding the history at that period. The class discussion is thorough and Professor Eire answers every question patiently. \r\nHowever,  the last two classes is  a bit rushing due to the limited time. Maybe the readings for the last class could be blended into prior classes. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that the professor provides us a lot of first-hand materials and engages us in lively discussions on the religious history of Christinanity. The second-hand materials are also immensely helpful for us to understand the situation of that period of time. \r\nI think to improve this course, the contents should include some major topics and disputes in the academic field, the development of academic study, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that we get to know a lot of the history of Europe, not only the social but also intellectual, and we get to read so many primary documents. Also the professor recommended many books for extra reading and he wrote many great books himself, I think it would be great for me because I want to know some good history books to read.\r\n\r\nI think the reading assignments of the first several classes about the medieval period could include more secondary sources, especially the history of all the dissents and the Great Schism in chapter 3 of the book Reformations, which was put under the lesson of Renaissance, I think it could be relocated to the first part of the course to help students understand the historical background better. ",
            "\u00a0I guess maybe the intro class can be more \"intro\"????? I mean it's a little bit hard to follow in the first class even though it's already an intro class. Maybe the professor can start with something more basic? or it might be my personal problem because I really don't know about Christianity but want to learn. Also, if the content were more basic, other students who dive into this subject might feel bored, so it might be a bad suggestion. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Eire is masterful as a teacher, storyteller and historian.  He simply knows more about European history than anyone I have previously met, and I was constantly amazed by his detailed knowledge, and ability to convey history in a meaningful and memorable manner.  No matter how often I tried to bring new material to class, he was always already very familiar, which I soon took as a personal challenge, though  I never succeeded in stumping him. I have no suggestions regarding improvements, although the volume of nightly reading was pretty torrential! "

            "\u00a0Yes - I would recommend this course to another student. It was very interesting and intellectually challenging, and I gained a very good overview of Christianity from the medieval ages to the early modern period, which helped me understand why Christianity has evolved the way it has today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes\r\nI think this course really enables students to have insightful understanding of western history as well as western society. Covering nearly 1000 years in 5 weeks sounds crazy but I really learnt many useful things. Professor Eire is also very nice and he shares many interesting stories in the lectures. In addition, all the instructions of the course is very clear online,  and reading materials are easily accessible as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will recommend this course to students interested in history and religious study. The materials covered are essential to an understanding of the history of Christianity, and the course is very well organized. The professor is also very approachable and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because the course is very comprehensive and is helpful for those who really want to learn European history, more helpful for those who want fresh jokes ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this class no matter how much interest you have during that period. If the student is highly interested in Christianity, the student should absolutely take the class because professor Eire is such a knowledgeable and humorous professor. I believe that everyone can learn a lot by taking the class and be able to read a lot of sacred/ primary texts. Also, some Christian belief really helps me to deal with anxiety. some theologians really propose some good ways of consolation. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Eire is a wonderful teacher and storyteller, with truly impressive knowledge of European history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The professor is nice and he clearly masters the details of this course. "
