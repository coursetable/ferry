            "\u00a0I definitely got a lot of practice drawing and learning how to use tone more. ",
            "\u00a0Drawing by using techniques other than contour. Learning how to use tone to create me realistic pictures. ",
            "\u00a0There is always more than one way to see something. This class helps you observe. But more importantly, it helps you discover. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course I learned how to draw lines and shapes and turn them into something drawn from observation, I also learned how to add contrast and use perspective to my piece. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt basic ideas of perspective and composition, as well as how to work with graphite and charcoal. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think my one criticism with the class is that we were never really 'taught' what to do. We had one 5 minute session where our TA showed us how to create a coffee cup just by erasing on a piece of paper blackened by charcoal, and that was probably the most instruction I got throughout the year. The way it's setup, we just got a lot of practice and criticism, but we were never shown how to do different techniques, which would have been helpful for someone like me who had 0 experience. ",
            "\u00a0Overall great intro course that was perfect for me. The only way I could see it be any better is if we had even more freedom to choose subjects, but there was already quite a bit already. ",
            "\u00a0That you have to determine for yourself what you what to accomplish from the assignments is simultaneously the greatest strength and weakness of the course. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was that it taught the basic foundations of drawing, which made it very accessible for students with or without previous skills in art. ",
            "\u00a0The classes in which we spent the whole period talking felt like a bit of a waste of time. I really valued the time we spent doing work in the studio together and think the focus should be put on that instead of analysis of art. While some exercises like watching the Hockney movie and discussing some of the artists were for sure interesting and enriching, I feel they could have been more effective if concentrated into a more fast-paced discussion, with a greater emphasis on dialogue between members of the classes, only slightly monitored by the teacher and the TA. The excursion to the Peabody was awesome though and I really did enjoy the breadth of our assignments, and the creation of our first still life. "

            "\u00a0I took it for my humanities credit. I enjoyed being able to watch TV while I drew, but this may not be the case for other sections, as it depends on your assignments. Time wise I could easily spend a full day drawing and probably more if I endless time, so you do spend a decent amount of time on this. Again, you'd probably spend more time, though, in other sections. All in all I'd recommend it for a fun class, but I guess we'll see when I get my grade back whether that time was worth it! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who wants to learn how to draw. Sophy focused on some of the narrative aspects of drawing, which I enjoyed. ",
            "\u00a0I recommend this course all the time to anyone who wants to take an intro art course. The experience you gain from the unique lessons and experimenting with media you might otherwise not be able to has been very enriching. ",
            "\u00a0If you are at just about any level, you will enjoy and gain skill from this class ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only under the condition that they would dedicate more time to it than I did. ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely! This class is a great introduction to drawing and is very much so a stress reliever. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who has little experience with drawing because it was a great low-stakes way to learn a lot and try it out--my class was mainly non-art majors which created a really welcoming environment, but if someone had a lot of drawing training I could see them getting bored.
