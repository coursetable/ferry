            "\u00a0I have a newfound and much appreciated understanding of historical and political thought since the mid-17th century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a variety of political theories concerning the creation of civilization (the movement from a potential \"state of nature\" into society) and how the many different opinions on this subject interpret the first movement into societies as influencing how mankind lives in the modern age. We also discussed the evolution of different types of inequalities (based on race, social status, gender, religion, etc.) and how these divisions have evolved throughout time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to think about the relationship between a text's small arguments and its bigger, broader claims and themes. I think I've also got a much better arsenal of intellectual tools (weapons if we wish to continue the extended metaphor) for thinking about contemporary politics than I did before I took this course. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good grasp of the overview of evolution of modern ideas from the 16th to 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better writer and became able to think more broadly about all sorts of important issues, not even limited to history and politics. ",
            "\u00a0how to write a proper academic paper, how to reconstruct and analyze arguments, how to trace the development of political thought in different texts ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the historical thought that created Western civilization as we know it. ",
            "\u00a0I became freer in discussion and learned how to write more elucidating papers. ",
            "\u00a0This was a phenomenal class. I definitely improved my reading comprehension, intertextuality, discussion and writing skills. It was a pleasure to attend. I learnt much about the intellectual tradition that underpins and justifies Western government practices, and developed a framework for evaluating any form of human association. "

            "\u00a0The syllabus is wonderful. The class discussions are fruitful. The lectures add valuable insight. Great course! ",
            "\u00a0The course is really well structured. I wouldn't suggest any improvements to course procedures or to the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well taught and very well executed, perhaps more supplementary material could be added to provide some structure for the great and radical differences in thought that evolved over time. ",
            "\u00a0I though it was great. I really likes the way it was set up, the prompts, etc. ",
            "\u00a0provides a great overview of early modern political philosophy. all the texts are farily easy to understand and the papers are not too demanding. some of the texts are too rich and detailed for a week of discussions to do them justice but thats to be expected. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about this class was perfect. I wish it went slower, so that we could have, perhaps, spent more time on the particular readings. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussion, but relatively uninvested teacher towards the end. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic course. My favorite DS class of Spring semester. It was quite enjoyable and very involving, as everyone participated in discussions and I appreciated the instructor's input. I could not envision a better HP class. "

            "\u00a0Take this course! It provides a basis not only for understanding political theory but our international political scene as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, specifically to anyone who took Directed Studies in the Fall semester. I think the syllabus of the Spring semester leads off nicely from where it ends in the fall, and that the focus on political thought (rather than on history, which is what most of the 1st semester was) made the class very interesting and fun to engage in. ",
            "\u00a0I would. It's so darned interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, as long as you know what you want from it! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. The books as well as the teachers and classmates were very engaging and interesting. It's also fun to actually read the things people always talk about. ",
            "\u00a0yes, if youre interested in political science and especially political philosophy. youre exposed to all the major writers like the social contract theorists, Freud, Nietzsche, and Arendt. the discussions are fun and informative and the texts are still relevant to modern society. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! This course is just interesting. If someone likes politics, its great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I think it is essential to trace the development of political philosophy to understand the systems of which we are part of today, and the directions in which they are drifting. Supremely interesting! You may learn about human government, but also about yourself. "
