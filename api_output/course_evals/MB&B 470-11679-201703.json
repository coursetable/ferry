            "\u00a0I have found that performing research here is instrumental to gaining a good understanding of MB&B, and this course was no different. In terms of specific skills, this course definitely helped prepare me to present my results in a scientific format and to gain greater independence in planning my experiments. ",
            "\u00a0I learned lab skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to conduct research in a working laboratory. ",
            "\u00a0Not only was I able to conduct a largely independent research project in my current lab for the first time, but I learned a great deal about presenting and writing up scientific results. Each of the assignments (proposal, presentation, final report) was an informative and valuable experience that showed me the different aspects of a career in basic science research. ",
            "\u00a0Loads of research experience. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an immense amount about how to conduct research in my lab and how to think about scientific questions. ",
            "\u00a0lab skills and experimental design- specifically this semester I worked with liquid growth assays and learned how to make peptides and use a plate reader ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much greater understanding of several important techniques in research. In addition, I learned the process of research: from proposal to experimentation to write-up. Throughout the process, I kept detailed documentation and kept up with literature in the field in order to better understand my research project. Research like this helped me become more independent in my research. ",
            "\u00a0I worked in my lab, gave a presentation, and wrote a research proposal and a final write-up.  In addition to learning a lot just by spending time in the lab, I gained writing and presentation skills. ",
            "\u00a0How to write a good research proposal, and how to prepare for a presentation. "

            "\u00a0The answers to this question will probably vary greatly by different students' research experiences, so it is hard for me to comment generally. If nothing else, I can say that the feedback provided on my coursework was very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is structured well.\r\n\r\nI will say, however, that much of a student's experience with the course is probably determined in large part by their specific lab experience, and that is something that the course cannot control. \r\n\r\nI think the department would do well to provide more structural support for younger students, particularly underclassmen, in choosing a good lab. ",
            "\u00a0If you are in a good lab, it is great.  If not, it isn't.  It is difficult to make generalizations about the course. ",
            "\u00a0The independent nature of the course was refreshing, but maybe one or two scheduled meetings throughout the semester to discuss presentations or the final report with Professor Neugebauer would have been nice. However, the assignments themselves -- and mostly the supplemental documents and guidelines on preparing a presentation and a report -- were very valuable experiences. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of flexibility as to how to fit in your hours and your topic. There was more support, communication, and clarity as to how to submit the proposal versus the presentation and report at the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- freedom to work on a project interesting to me\r\nWeakness- it would have been nice to have proposal feedback earlier in the semester ",
            "\u00a0One strength is the required proposal and end-of-term report, because these kept us up-to-date with our data and analysis. One weakness might be lack of understanding regarding the report requirements, but periodic e-mails helped clarify any misunderstandings. ",
            "\u00a0Some of Karla's critiques clashed with those of the PI, which made deciding on a course of action extremely difficult at times. I believe that there could be better interface between her and the PIs. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend performing research here, and the ability to receive credit for doing so is an excellent opportunity. Especially in MB&B, which has excellent researchers and labs, taking research is a great idea. ",
            "\u00a0I think taking research for credit is a great way of getting credit for lab work you're doing. It is tough to get much done in lab if you only commit the required 10 hour minimum, so I'd recommend budgeting more time. ",
            "\u00a0It is a great way to conduct real research. ",
            "\u00a0MB&B 470 was a very fulfilling experience that taught me a lot about both the process of scientific inquiry as well as presenting and writing up my work. Don't be fooled, though, this isn't an easy A. You'll need to put in the work to go into lab, meet with your PI/mentor, and prepare the assignments. Take initiative and schedule meetings for help/advice on both the project itself as well as presenting or writing a report, something I wasn't able to do as much as I would have liked. Definitely consider this a whole credit worth of work. ",
            "\u00a0I love my labwork and getting credit for it is great. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a lab where you enjoy working, this is a great way to finish an MBB requirement and fit research into your class schedule. I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to continuing research. There wasn't much communication towards the end of the semester, so keep an eye on the deadlines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Research for credit is a great idea, especially if you want to be working in a lab anyways-most of the work for the \"class\" is the lab work, so its not that much more work to get the credit. ",
            "\u00a0This is great if you want to pursue independent research with a professor, because you get to really learn the process of research firsthand. Also, you get good feedback from the instructor and your PI throughout the process. ",
            "\u00a0If you like working in lab, you'll like this course! ",
