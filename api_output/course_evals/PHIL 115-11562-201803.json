            "\u00a0Our lecture was absolutely huge - we had to move from LC102 to SSS114. Although Elizabeth is a great professor, it's just too easy to zone out, check your phone, or skip the lecture altogether, so I saw the size of this course as a definite weakness. The problem sets were fun and helpful, as were discussions. Most of the course grade comes from weekly quizzes, which could be stressful and took a lot of time to prepare for. I wish we had graded problem sets instead of the endless quizzes. Also, the textbook was dense and confusing to the point that I found it nearly incomprehensible. Luckily, the material was always on the problem sets and lectures and the problem set commentary provided enough instruction. ",
            "\u00a0The huge lecture format is always a little tough, but the sections were productive and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was designed and taught excellently. The weekly quizzes were, to my surprise, actually very helpful and useful in this class. While it wasn't the most exciting or engaging class, there's not much that be done to improve that given the subject matter. That being said, I thought Professor did a good job of making it as engaging as it could possibly be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor of this course is amazing. She is literally always willing to help, and she is so nice. She always tries to make our classes more entertaining. Some of the material was interesting too. I also loved the weekly quizzes because they really kept me on top of my work.\r\nWeaknesses: The lecture component of the class was sometimes too much information thrown at us too quickly, and I often felt like I wouldn't understand a subject until I went to office hours and tried out the pset. Some of the material was also very dry and hard to comprehend. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of strengths but a lot of those were likely because of Professor Miller who was amazing. She constantly provided help and resources to make the content easier to understand. One weakness would likely be that it was not challenging enough. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that it was fascinating to learn what seemed to be a new language -- one that combined symbols and some kind of math and philosophy. Learning a new way of thinking -- a new way to break down what people say to see whether it is in fact logical -- was a great experience. A weakness of the course was the textbook we used. I do not think that it added much to the course and did not really think it was necessary as we went over most of the stuff in Goldfarb's book during class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Miller organized this course extraordinarily well. The weekly quiz structure was excellent for keeping me on top of the material. \r\n\r\nI wish we could have pushed a bit further conceptually. ",
            "\u00a0The course moves at a very manageable pace. However, it at times felt too slow. I feel like the first half of the course could have been condensed into a few weeks, which would have left more time to explore quantificational deduction at the end. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the resources offered to students were extraordinary in breadth, but that Professor Miller could've perhaps done a better job in moderating her explanations between the overly technical (towards which they often tended) and the overly simplifying use of metaphors etc. (which also occurred). However, she was incredibly committed and I don't think it would be even possible to ask for more - just some slight changes in methodology. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was really great for the most part. It was intimidating at first, but Professor Miller is super supportive and does everything she can to help her students succeed. Section was useless, but I think that was because I had a last-minute TF who didn't know the material well or how to explain it. Basically, the class was conceptually hard, but once understood, pretty easy, and I think the key to that is finding people who can explain clearly and patiently. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: guaranteed to do well in the course if you keep up with the material on a weekly basis, instructions very clear, weekly quizzes very helpful so that you don't fall behind, lectures very well organized, section helpful to go over weekly psets. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the format was actually wonderful, and would not change it. The quizzes ensured that we kept up with the (good deal) of course material, but were never tricky or punishing and I actually appreciated the opportunity to show what I'd learned throughout. Lectures were good, if sometimes boring (no fault to Dr. Miller, who did a great job with some dry material!) and section was very helpful, but good to be optional, as not always necessary. ",

She provides all the resources that students need to succeed in the course (if they have ample amounts of time to devote to the material, which I unfortunately did not). Her lectures are funny, clear, and cover all the ground necessary. My main problem with the course was the weekly quiz format. It was very overwhelming to learn so much material each week and then have to immediately display knowledge of it. Also, it was hard to miss a class each weekI think it would be better to have bi-weekly quizzes and use the extra class every other week as a review session or an opportunity to spread the material out and go into more depth with it. ",

It's nonetheless a fun and interesting thing to do with your brain, and it's useful to students in pretty much any discipline, since everyone should know what arguments mean and how we use them. ",

She made every effort to make a (100+?) person lecture personal - for example, she called on almost everyone by their first name. She also made an amazing decision by choosing to give weekly quizzes - it made the material easy to follow, and made sure everyone kept up. The material is really interesting, no busywork at all, and the professor is quite possibly the kindest and most approachable professor at Yale.\r\n\r\nWEAKNESSES: While Professor Miller was an engaging lecturer, I think that logic is a difficult course to teach through powerpoint and lecture. Even if you attend all the lectures, you really need to take the time to learn the material on your own. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the format of the class and Prof. Miller. Weekly quizzes really force you to keep up with the material as you go along, which is especially important in a class like logic that directly builds upon the prior concept learned. Without the quizzes, I would not have been as invested in the class until exam time, which is sad to admit but true. Also, Prof. Miller is awesome!! Though I never interacted with her personally, the amount of care she has for her students is obvious. She makes herself readily available to everyone and that is incredible considering it is a large lecture class. She also goes out of her way to make students feel comfortable asking questions, or at the very least feeling comfortable with being lost. I have never had such an involved, caring professor in a lecture setting. ",
            "\u00a0We had loads of opportunities to seek extra help if we needed, and I liked that the psets weren't graded (it allowed us to just focus on learning the material instead of worrying about grades). ",
            "\u00a0I think all of the help afforded to students was very helpful because Professor Miller was very approachable and available to help any student with questions pertaining to any point in the course and also between section, office hours, and lecture, guidance was always provided. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: constant workload in terms of quizzes that forces you to stay on top of the material, solid (and ungraded) PSets, optional sections.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: readings are often difficult to get through (if still using Goldfarb's book) and the course often strays from what is in the textbook. Also can be easy to feel like you are slipping behind if lecture goes too quickly (as it sometimes does). \r\n\r\nI suggest finding a more digestible textbook going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Elizabeth's kindness and energy was a huge strength of the course. Also, the flexibility was so nice -- optional section and problem sets took some of the pressure off, but really encouraged us to be responsible for our own learning and removed any aspect of busywork from the course. I think most people ended up doing the psets and many went to section anyway, but we only needed to do what would actually help us learn. I really appreciated that! A weakness of the course was that I never really got a sense of how First Order Logic was applicable in real life. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: very good intro to logic, substantial covering of logical principles and key ideas\r\n\r\nweaknesses: wish we could've covered other forms of logic than the two that we focused on in class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-paced course and the material isn't impossible to grasp. If you put in some time, you will pass this class without a problem. However, lectures often went too fast to be understandable. A lot of stress for a class that wasn't stressfull. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging and accessible for people with absolutely no background in logic! There were times when I got lost during lecture, or that it moved really quickly, which quickly set me on a spiral of \"I don't understand this\" to \"why should I even bother to understand this.\" I loved the way the first few weeks upended our expectations of how English language works; I wish that carried through further in deduction and such. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and sections were extremely conducive to learning, so it seems like the readings were mostly as additional help. The psets are not graded but they are extremely useful since they prep you for weekly quizzes. The quizzes force you to understand the material, which gets exponentially harder as time goes on. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the organisation of the class -- weekly quizzes and psets meant that it was really easy to stay on top of everything. Elizabeth Miller spend so much time giving so much attention and help to everyone. She's amazing. ",

            "\u00a0Lectures were very fast-paced and did not really go in-depth. The p-sets were good for review, though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really well-organized. I loved the weekly quizzes because I felt that they helped me to keep up with the material and were a good self-check for how I felt I was doing. It was an excellent course. ",
            "\u00a0Loved the weekly quizzes, wish that there was a quiz for the last unit to help me master it before the exam. ",
            "\u00a0If you can think quantitatively at all (I haven't taken a real QR type class since high school but used to be good at math), then this is the QR for you!! It is so, so easy and can be quite interesting and fun. The format of a weekly quiz (70% of grade) and one final (30% of grade) works super well for continued student engagement.
