            "\u00a0Self-directed senior thesis, so it was a topic I was interested in and engaged with for a long time. ",
            "\u00a0Through writing a year-long senior thesis, I learned how to conduct economic research, from data gathering and cleaning, all the way through preparing a finished manuscript. The process was challenging, sometimes exceedingly so, but it was also one of the most rewarding classes I have taken in my time at Yale. I saw the complexities associated with dealing with real data and doing real research and became very familiar with the topic I was examining. ",
            "\u00a0This was a culmination of the skills I learned and that topics I grew more interested in while at Yale. It tied together the different parts of what the Econ major meant for me. It was a project of my own and challenged me in ways that I'm excited to challenge myself with more in the future, primarily data work and developing research questions. I felt nervous at the beginning of the year because we had never done anything similar in a course, but with support from my advisor (much needed and appreciated support) I ended up having a final product I was really happy with and proud of. ",
            "\u00a0How to write an academic economics paper, how to report regression results. Insight: how valuable regression results can be to strengthen hypothesis. ",
            "\u00a0Applying everything I have learnt in my major to a project that I care about is pretty satisfying. Also, I gain some coding experience along the way ",
            "\u00a0I improved my STATA skills, increased my knowledge of procedures for data analysis, and gained practice in academic writing. Additionally, I was able to develop greater insight into the process of academic research. "

        [
            "\u00a0It's kind of a free rein type of course, where you dictate how you spend your time and engage with advisers, which is nice for seniors who like the freedom for exploring one topic on their own time. A lot of other senior thesis classes for other majors had their deadlines in mid- to late- April, and that extra week or two would have been really helpful, since the econ deadline was early April. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of this experience depends almost entirely on your advisor because there is little departmental guidance. This worked for me, but introduces a fair amount of uncertainty for students. ",
            "\u00a0It is what you make of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would have appreciated the opportunity to interact more with the other Economics students writing essays. Besides bumping into other students at office hours, there was not much opportunity for interaction, and I would have enjoyed to learn more about the research my peers were doing. Perhaps some departmental lunch or event could have been organized. ",
            "\u00a0NA ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course is its ability to give students hands-on experience with academic research, which is helpful to those considering graduate coursework. Another strength of the course is that it allows students to work closely with an advisor, which provides an opportunity for learning and mentorship that is difficult to get within a classroom setting. One potential way to improve the course would be to connect seniors working on senior essays with juniors who are considering a senior essay. An informal meeting or meal in the spring semester would be helpful for juniors to get their questions answered and obtain advice as they begin the process. ",
            "\u00a0I know that the academic environment is unstructured and everything, but please, please, please, the thesis needs to have some kind of calendar. I had no idea what I needed done and when it needed to be done. My advisor was very helpful, but he was never concerned at all about deadlines, leaving me in a state of panic just before Spring Break, when I realized that pretty much none of what I had done was going to end up in the final paper. For the month before the thesis, I did all of my writing and relevant research, leaving me at the end with nothing but an unfulfilling, not-long-enough paper that I didn't believe in or think to be at all useful or predictive. "

            "\u00a0Sure, if you're interested in writing a thesis, take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the senior essay to a student interested in graduate school, or who is willing to put in the work. A year-long essay is a major commitment, especially in the second semester, and will likely dominate your schedule (especially because the deadline is so early in the second semester). That said, I felt the work was very rewarding and it was a great opportunity to work closely with economics faculty. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - most rewarding experience at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the Senior Essay to another student if they had a clear topic and mind and were good at motivating themselves to work individually. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to have one unifying piece to tie everything you have learnt in the Econ major, do the senior thesis ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend a senior essay for students interested in gaining research experience and considering graduate work in Economics. A senior essay is a great culmination of the major, allowing students to apply what they have learned in order to produce new insights. Working with an advisor provides a unique opportunity for mentorship and learning that is difficult to replicate within the classroom setting. ",
            "\u00a0Depending on who you choose as your advisor, you need to be self-motivated. I had no idea what I needed done and when it needed to be done, and it didn't help that I was taking five credits during the fall semester. My advisor was very helpful, but he was never concerned at all about deadlines, leaving me in a state of panic just before Spring Break, when I realized that pretty much none of what I had done was going to end up in the final paper. For the month before the thesis, I did all of my writing and relevant research, leaving me at the end with nothing but an unfulfilling, not-long-enough paper that I didn't believe in or think to be at all useful or predictive. ",
            "\u00a0WRITE A SENIOR ESSAY!! Choose your adviser well, make sure that you're researching a topic that you love enough to work on for two semesters, and don't leave everything to the last minute. Don't rob yourself of this experience just because it's not required for the major - this was hands-down the most fulfilling class I've taken at Yale. If you know you want an Econ PhD, this is great experience. If grad school's not for you (I'm not planning to go to grad school either), then this is your only chance to do research like this. "
