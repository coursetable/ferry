            "\u00a0I gained a voice in this class. Drawing on the voices of established writers, this course gave us the ability to explore our own interior and use successful techniques to best express our own thoughts and ideas. This course made me a better writer, but also allowed me to come into my own. The round-table discussion learning style made everyone a more confident speaker, and I felt far more comfortable sharing my thoughts and experiences with the class by the end of the semester. First person narrative is also something that I was not experienced with before the beginning of the semester and I now feel like I have the tools to wield that voice successfully. ",
            "\u00a0I improved greatly as a writer, and learned about various techniques and structures used in writing non-fiction essays. I learned what reading for craft meant and the importance of revision. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much; I learned about how to reflect on my upbringing and journey to Yale and convey these experiences and feelings towards them through writing. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my narrative-writing skills; helped my find my voice as a writer; boosted my confidence in writing ",
            "\u00a0I developed my writing skills a lot. Particularly, I learned how to use the essays of other authors to inform choices I make while writing my own essays and how to think critically about the purpose of every sentence and paragraph. ",
            "\u00a0Its personal to each writer. My biggest gain was learning to discern good writing from bad. In addition to your classmates essays being workshopped, you read numerous published essays. Its interesting seeing the techniques writers use to make their writing more coherent and compelling. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to read personal essays critically, analyze them for craft, and replicate the craft in my own writing.  More generally, I became a much better writer.  We had the opportunity to read a wide swath of styles, viewpoints, and structures, which aided us in finding our unique personal styles.  More than any other class I have taken, English 120 empowered me to have my own personal voice even within the context of an academic pursuit. ",
            "\u00a0How to write with craft, how to make my voice loud. ",
            "\u00a0I learned that my voice was valuablein writing about my experiences, but especially in helping others write about theirs! I learned how to pinpoint what works and what doesn't work. What makes a paragraph tick. I learned to laugh at myself! "

            "\u00a0This course was my most engaging this semester. I was always excited to go to class and you can be assured that you will never be bored in English 120 because you always have the opportunity to speak and to actively participate which is a nice break from the more passive lecture style learning. I think this course's grading also allows you to be creative and irreverent. You do not have to be afraid to follow conventions or research papers or of traditional writing and so one of the greatest strengths of the assignments is feeling that you can write without fear of being chastised for minute errors in formatting or style. I think that perhaps this course could be improved by workshopping more essays to hear more voices and get to know the other members of the class even better. ",
            "\u00a0The readings are really good and interesting, the essay prompts are fun and engaging and the class size allows for good discourse between students. Also, the readings are generally pretty short and manageable. I think it could maybe be improved by a bit more focus on lecturing and less on discussion, but I really did appreciate the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - great fro self-reflection and improved my writing skills A LOT\r\nWeaknesses - too many readings for one class. I love the readings but maybe assign less since we rarely got to all of them? ",
            "\u00a0The readings are incredible; some of the best class discussions; absolutely loved workshops as well ",
            "\u00a0This was my favorite class I've taken at Yale! The readings are wonderful, and completely manageable, and the way that we dissect how they're written in class was very interesting and helpful for learning how to take risks in our essays. The assigned essays themselves were also really fun to write, and I love that we'd always devote two full class periods to workshopping essays every time a rough draft was due. The workshops were some of my favorite classes during this course, because not only do you get to help people with their writing and hear helpful feedback, but you also get to know your classmates very well. ",
            "\u00a0It really depends on your classmates and instructors; writing by nature is very subjective. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the class is the workshop, during which we discuss our fellow classmates' personal essays and reflect on the successes and moments that need restructuring.  Another strength is the breadth of essays we read and discussed, which ensured that several experiences were taught in the classroom, not simply a white, male experience (as is often the case in academia). ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Shifra, a very kind, caring teacher\r\nStrength: Classmates, we got very lucky with the mix of students ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the workshops! I loved my section of English 120 we all helped each other grow as writers and people. ",
            "\u00a0A small class of 13 people made for amazing conversation and great friendship. \r\n\r\nIt might have been fun to have the option to casually workshop even more essays. Like after the drafts were due, to have some google drive or something where we would see everyone's essays and be assigned to leave just one piece of advice! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, English 120 has been my favourite class at Yale. There is no other class, in my experience, that creates the same bonds in the classroom and allows you to be so creative and free in the assignments. The teaching is also excellent and everyone should have the opportunity to work with Shifra during their time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. You will improve as a writer, read some great essays and learn a lot. It is really, really fun, and not too hard, but you will definitely take away valuable lessons and insights. ",
            "\u00a0YES YES YES YES! I'm only a first-year, but this was the greatest class I have taken so far. I was super scared to write about myself and I didn't really want to do narratives or anything, but this class was honestly amazing. I've become a more reflective person and I am REALLY CLOSE with people from my class. HIGHLY RECOMMEND ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to take a writing course at Yale, definitely take English 120!!! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who's considering it - it really was a joy to take. I especially recommend taking it with Shifra if you can! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone whos willing to write an essay a week; you write a draft, send it in for comments, and then revise it for the final. Unlike other writing courses Ive taken, revising my drafts usually meant completely rewriting it - which can be extremely time-consuming if you are taking other writing intensive classes. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a rite of passage for Yale students.  Absolutely every student should be required to take English 120. ",
            "\u00a0Hell yes. Especially if you aren't a writer or English major, this WR course is so worth it. You get to not only write about yourself and maybe thoughts you've been having, but also write about others and the world and get to read your classmate's work and learn about their lives or see their style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ENGL 120 depends a lot on your professor and perhaps even more so on your peers, and with Shifra, it's basically a life-changing experience. Shifra is a complete gem. I can't overstate how valuable her presence is to the classroom -- she guides discussion insightfully without being overbearing, she encourages us all to speak our minds without being judgmental, she provides critical feedback without being harsh. Her relaxed and optimistic attitude definitely spread throughout the class and I'll definitely remember this course as one of the highlights of my Yale experience.\r\n\r\nMore broadly, the modern essay is a very fun genre. You can take it in so, so many directions. I was a STEM major looking to sharpen my writing skills before graduation, and this course definitely did so for me. Do note that if you're not a comfortable writer, the class takes a lot of time, but it's very much worth the work you put in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But the teacher is not the best at providing feedback to improve your writing. However, the section helped me improve my writing substantially! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. With Shifra, if you're that lucky. She really really cares. I never wanted the class to end. The class had that high-schooley comfort of everyone knowing your name and your storybut never your whole story, which makes every essay more and more fun. \r\n\r\nThe class was empowering. Writing \"well\" is so hard. But copying little bits from brilliant authors here and there is so manageable. And letting your classmates know what works and what doesn't work in their writing helps you learn to see your own writing with the same sense of loving but detached criticism. And before you know it you're writing \"well\"! "
