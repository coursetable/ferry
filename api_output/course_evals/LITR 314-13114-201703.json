            "\u00a0I learned more about how class worked in imperial dynamics and how these dynamics played out in interpersonal relationships. I honed my close reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course provided a framework for reading texts not normally included in many syllabi. The inclusion of historical background was especially helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about imperialism and its effects through literature beginning in the late nineteenth century through the modern day.  I learned how to read and think about a variety of texts, including modernist novels like Joseph Conrad's Nostromo and critical histories like C.L.R. James' The Black Jacobins.  I learned how to read criticism and to incorporate, challenge, and build on critical arguments while developing my own in two long papers. ",
            "\u00a0This seminar was one of the most challenging literature classes I've taken, not because the reading load was particularly heavy but rather because it was endlessly complex, because Prof. Cleary held us to a very high standard, and because of how demanding the writing requirements were: 2 12-15-page papers, on which the feedback was at once generous and penetrating. I loved it. Coming out of this class, I feel like I've developed a new set of intellectual and interpretive muscles, and that I'm finally developing a sense of how to respond to postcolonial literature ethically: with an intense concern for, and greater interpretive boldness around, subaltern voices and a sense of the quiet, painful ambiguities of settler-colonial power relations. "

            "\u00a0The course is well designed: two 15-page papers and short weekly responses are the exact right way to allow for deep engagement with the texts without being overwhelming. Discussions were stimulating overall. Occasionally the reading was too heavy, but more the most part Professor Cleary realized when this was the case and adjusted. Also, feedback on the papers and the weekly questions, as well as in office hours, was thoughtful and helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The range of the reading was engaging and allowed for revealing comparisons. The once-a-week seminar format might be replaced with twice-a-week, since covering an entire novel in one class period is very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The course was wonderful in how deeply it challenged me to think about the texts we were reading.  I really enjoyed moving from modernist to more contemporary novels, and appreciated how diverse the variety of voices and situations we drew from was.  I also liked how discussions were oriented, with first being given some background information, then asking questions we wanted to explore and discussing those questions for the bulk of the seminar.  One improvement I would suggest is having draft deadlines for the two papers.  Since they're so lengthy, and there are only two, it would be less stressful to be first required to turn in a draft and then given the opportunity to improve on it before receiving a final grade.  I also wonder if there's any way to incorporate a little more historical background before beginning each book, which would be helpful for novels like A Grain of Wheat or Portrait of the Artist, where a lot of the history is implied or glanced at yet crucial to the narrative.  Finally, I would love to have had more opportunities to read women writers of color in the class -- we had several white male writers, white women writers, and male writers of color, but only one woman writer of color.  Including more would help make the course even more well-rounded in terms of the perspectives we are provided. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting syllabus, intellectually rigorous.\r\nWeaknesses: Energy and engagement during discussion weren't super high, and sometimes the seminar felt more like a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0One of this course's biggest strengths was the amount of time that both Prof. Cleary and Mr. McGowan gave to their students  office hours with both of them could go on and on (great if you're the one who got there first, although not so great if you had to wait outside the door for your time slot), and they were incredibly respectful towards and excited by their students' ideas, even as they pushed them in new directions. I'm honestly struggling to name a weakness, but if I had to say one it might be that, in the first few weeks of seminar, it felt as though we were dwelling inordinately on plot details. Perhaps it was necessary for a novel as complicated as Nostromo, but I would have liked to dive a little more deeply into the text than I felt we did. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course. The readings are wonderful, with lots of fascinating continuities between them that you get to watch develop over the course of the semester. It was a fairly small seminar, which was great because it allowed for stimulating discussion. The workload is just right (2 papers that really let you sink your teeth into the readings). Professor Cleary is tough but fair, and extremely helpful if you go to office hours. If you want to learn more about imperialism, or just read some great books, definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class to another student.  I learned so much from the readings and the discussion, which were challenging but extremely worthwhile.  Professor Cleary and the rest of the class pushed me continuously to refine not just how I thought and what I thought but how I expressed it, and I've come out of the class feeling much more prepared to engage on a high level with any texts I'll be reading in the future, not just postcolonial ones.  Professor Cleary is kind and extremely smart and expects you to give your all, so you shouldn't take this class if you aren't willing to put a lot of time and energy into it to do all of the readings and think hard about them.  That said, if you are willing, you'll be heavily rewarded. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're interested in the syllabus/topic and aren't afraid of a fairly heavy reading load. Course is intellectually demanding but rewarding as well. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Expect to work a lot harder on your papers than you're used to; to grow to love a professor who's at once a genius, a truly sweet man, and utterly impervious to bullshit; and to discover connections you never knew existed between the literature of European modernism and the postcolonial world. If you're up for the challenge, this course will knock your socks off. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! "
