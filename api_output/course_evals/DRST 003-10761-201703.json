            "\u00a0Beyond improving as a thinker, reader, and writer, I learned how to slow down my mind in this seminar. From our first until our last meeting, Professor Eitel sagely encouraged me to step back and listen before speaking. This is perhaps the best advice I have ever received. After a term of close work with Professor Eitel, I have been able to connect my thoughts in a more coherent, logical manner. I am extremely grateful for his help! ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of general arguments of various philosophers in the early western canon, and developed skills pertaining to philosophical analysis in writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make a tight, coherent, and modest argument. The class really emphasized drawing insight from both broad swaths of information and close readings of passages, and that felt really valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to develop a deeper understanding of certain philosophical ideas in this course, but I was surprised at how much it actually helped me think differently about the application of philosophy to my own life and how much it forced me to deepen my analysis of arguments while developing my own argumentative skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about ancient philosophy and the ideas it introduced that have grown and changed over time, different thinkers responding to them in different ways. ",
            "\u00a0As my first foray in philosophy, the course was always enlightening. I gained a working knowledge of the several classical philosophical works and their successors studied. I've learned how to carry out a philosophical analysis. The insights gained are too many to number. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would not change this course. I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course were that the instructor was obviously caring and passionate, and students were always capable of voicing any thoughts they wanted to share in our discourse. However, our discussions on occasions drifted from engaging and pertinent to focusing too intensely on specific parts of the texts, enough so that on occasion we would come out of a class and I'd feel as if we had studied the bark of a single tree in order to understand a forest. Expectations as far as writing were often vague, especially for our first paper. However, the instructor took great care to make sure each student had individual time with him to workshop papers. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would benefit from devoting some time in class towards comprehension of the texts. I had never read philosophy before entering DS and I sometimes felt more of a challenge in comprehending the texts and coming to class ready to discuss than others who had gone to high schools that offered both philosophy as a subject and seminars as a class style. The day when we were just taught about what Aristotle meant in the Physics was amazing and I left that class feeling like I'd learned more than many other class meetings. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Eitel's class. It was his first time teaching in DS, but he did a wonderful job balancing student contributions with his own and was always able to get the seminar back on track when it began to stray. He gives extensive feedback on essays and is very accessible if you want to talk through your outline or first draft, and he provides a lot of resources to help you write your first few philosophy essays in college. Professor Eitel also did his best to connect seemingly esoteric/irrelevant philosophical ideas to our actual lives, which I found admirable and interesting (especially one argument for reframing skepticism as an optimistic, liberal method of approaching otherness). He teaches in the divinity school and has pretty unique perspectives on different philosophical arguments (e.g. understanding Plato's 'allegory of the cave' as an argument for the existence of God), but is very open minded and happy to engage with other perspectives. My only critique is that I feel like we skipped over or devoted too little time to some of the more important pieces of arguments (specifically when focusing on Sextus Empiricus and Augustine). ",
            "\u00a0This is a fabulous course with an excellent, engaging, and very organized syllabus. The one thing that could have been helpful would have been more resources for learning how to write a philosophy paper. ",
            "\u00a0The course is, as intended, a good survey of the philosophical texts in the western tradition. Due to the short time spent on each book, the exact direction and topic of seminar discussions tended to be a bit random, and depended very much on the Professor leading the section. However, when the section was directed, it was a very fruitful and insightful way to engage with the tradition. ",
            "\u00a0The discussion-based format of the course was very apt, given the special place given to dialectic in the philosophical canon studied. The instructor himself was also a major strength.\r\nThe course to me is excellent as it stands. "

        [
            "\u00a0DS Philosophy can be rigorous, though it depends somewhat on your instructor. Prof. Eitel expects a lot, but rewards good effort. If you're prepared for dense readings in the Classics, then this course could be very helpful to your overall intellectual capacitiy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have told all of my friends that Professor Eitel is an amazing instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I would, given they had expressed prior interest in a very close reading of specific western philosophical texts. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend to a DSer that they try to get into Adam Eitel's section. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed Professor Eitel's class.

",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to anyone interested in Philosophy. It's a fabulous way to learn about where philosophy began, and requires no previous knowledge. The small class size makes for fabulous discussion, as well as the close proximity to a fabulous professor. Professor Eitel was a fabulous teacher, and very invested in making sure we engaged with the material beyond the surface level. Frankly, if I hadn't been in Professor EItel's class I would have had a drastically different first semester, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend directed studies as a unique and extremely valuable programme within the Yale community. The Philosophy section is also extremely enlightening and a great way to develop thinking skills. "
