            "\u00a0I really appreciated the way this course was structured and the many interesting topics we covered throughout. I also appreciated how the course assignments were scaffolded so that they all built towards the final project. I think the professor asked thought-provoking questions and varied the course content through the use of videos, guest lecturers, and debates.\r\n\r\nI think that the main way the course could be improved would be to provide better guidance for the debates, including more preparation for debaters and clearer criteria for observers/evaluators. ",
            "\u00a0One reason the course was successful in my opinion was due to small class size -- it was much easier to speak up in class, which is something I rarely did in previous classes. Having weekly assignments to respond to the readings certainly helped with getting me to engage with the material, and maintain my interest and investment in what I wanted to research for the semester-long final paper.

I really appreciated her thoughtful attempts to integrate student voice in the discussion of key concepts in stigma research. I also appreciate her variation of class time through the use of video clips, guest speakers, and time for student sharing. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly, I don't know how this course would have been with a larger class. I think the main reason I enjoyed it so much was because there weren't too many students, so we all got to be quite friendly and familiar with each other. ",
