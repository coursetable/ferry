            "\u00a0I learnt a huge amount about the medieval context and theology surrounding Gothic cathedrals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the theology and history of the cathedrals and who and why they built the cathedrals. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze the architecture and art of cathedrals in the context of medieval texts. ",
            "\u00a0After taking this course I gained a better understanding about the architectural and societal impact of Gothic cathedrals in the Middle Ages. I now have the skills and knowledge to analyze the ornamental motifs that decorate the interior and exterior of Gothic cathedrals. Through literary and philosophical works, I have the knowledge needed to fully understand the reasons Gothic cathedrals had a deep impact on societal beliefs and actions. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to closely read carvings in French cathedrals as well as symbolism imbedded in the architecture of these religious buildings. Also, we read texts unrelated to architecture and theology, like old French fables. ",
            "\u00a0A beginner level understanding of cathedrals in the gothic period along with the religious stories that are represented among them. ",
            "\u00a0I've learnt how to better synthesise and interpret information from dense, archaic texts, and also learnt a lot of socio-cultural and religious contexts from the Middle Ages that informs a sizeable degree of our present day. I definitely now have niche knowledge of the architecture of Gothic cathedrals, and it has helped me to connect deeper with Catholicism. ",
            "\u00a0I got a basic idea of the social and political factors that influenced the building of cathedrals. I learned how to use contemporary literature and personal memoirs to get an insight into the ideas and thoughts of a contemporary man. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: the cathedrals covered are incredible to see in person. Professor Bloch is an inspiring teacher and adds a level of insight to the cathedrals through his knowledge of the literature and history of the period that brings the buildings to life.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the weekly readings were hefty, and heavily theological. I had expected more of an art historical angle to our studies than a theological one. ",
            "\u00a0The excursions were really great as it was very hands on. I think the TF tried to prove her knowledge to the professor, but to the detriment of the student. ",
            "\u00a0It's an amazing opportunity to be able to see the cathedrals in person, and you are fully immersed in French culture as well. As for weaknesses of this course, the 3-hour classes could feel long at times. ",
            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of this class is its organization. Class expectations are clear and the assignments serve as guides when completing the readings. Class discussions are centered around the key themes in the readings and provide clarity on any questions that you may have on the content of the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Strength:\r\n- visiting sites and things in person that we discussed in class and from the text\r\n- professor bloch is very knowledgable about the topics and the locations we visited \r\nWeaknesses: \r\n- the course was not at all what it was advertised as\r\n- lecture was often unstructured and droning in that it was purely lecture with the additional raised-hand interjection or cold-call \r\n- the course was heavily theology based, which was unexpected \r\n- some texts felt unrelated to the course and the sites we were visiting \r\n- grading was initially very unclear because the assignment would ask for a sentence or two as a response, but the questions and grading rubric would demand for a full paragraph response--leading to some poor grades and confusion at the start\r\n- sometimes the workload would be unevenly distributed ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: did not really go into detail about architecture in the course, even though the description for the course discusses this. ",
            "\u00a0I think there was a good balance struck between the number of field trips and seminar hours within the week. I think what also augmented the immersion was the exposure to French cuisine and restaurants. However, I believe that if, perhaps, this summer session was carried out in collaboration with a local Parisian (or any French) university, it could have fostered a more intimate sense of engagement with the city. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: Most of the times the lectures consisted of the professor going through slides and narrating very quietly for three hours in a dark room, so I struggled to stay awake quite a few times. I didn't really understand how some of the readings were connected to what we were doing in class or seeing on field trips. \r\nStrengths: Professor Bloch knows so much! He truly is brilliant, so if you are interested in this area and can manage to stay awake during lectures you will definitely benefit from seeing how he constructs arguments and hearing his ideas. Another good aspect of this class are the field trips. Seeing the cathedrals in person can really help you envision what their significance was. "

            "\u00a0Yes - the chance to spend 5 weeks in Paris with relatively little class time is not one to be passed up. The class has given me a far greater appreciation of medieval French history and of medieval Christianity. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for the experience and for the people that I met, but I think the class was very confusing for the point it was supposed to get across until after I arrived home. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course because you can visit the cathedrals and live in Paris for 5 weeks! Professor Bloch is also great. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for students who want to gain an understanding of the role of Gothic cathedrals in architecture and Medieval society. It is an amazing opportunity to not only learn about these monuments in class, but also visit the cathedrals and see for yourself everything that you have learned. I think that having the opportunity to visit the cathedrals really helps you understand the impact it had on people of the Middle Ages and see up close the craftsmanship of the cathedrals. After taking this class, I now have a new view of Gothic cathedrals and new found appreciation for them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend for the experience of studying abroad in Paris. Don't go in expecting it to be an architecture class. ",
            "\u00a0yes but strictly if one studies religion because a lot of the coursework was based on religious texts ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they have an interest in medieval literature, or Catholicism. I think I've learnt a lot about the Middle Ages, and such exposure to this content in the very city itself has given me a lot of insight and cultural capital. ",
            "\u00a0Be very careful! There is a lot of reading, I would say the average was around 250 pages a week. You don't have to do all of it, but if you want to get the most out of this class it would probably be good to do it. If reading medieval memories, poems and religious scripts is not your thing then there are probably better ways to spend your summer. However, if the material is something that you are interested then you'll probably enjoy this class and learn a lot. "
