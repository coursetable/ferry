            "\u00a0The course was very challenging and engaging. I can't think of any improvements. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the unity of it's vision, concerning authentic and satirical historiography. While there was certainly a focus on grammar and vocabulary, the course successfully surpassed this and allowed us to study the writings and authors, not merely the language. I believe that this really was an ideal course, with a well picked syllabus, good instruction, and a balanced workload. I have no real complaints about either its focus or instruction. \r\n\r\nThe one improvement I would suggest would be more composition assignments. We only did one original composition, which I greatly enjoyed, and I think more opportunities for this kind of practice would benefit the class. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated how much cultural information we went over as well as linguistic. "

            "\u00a0Yes I would. It was very interesting and a great way to enter the Classics community at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0If the student has sufficient knowledge of Ancient Greek, this course is a perfect introduction to some of the most important authors, Herodotus and Lucian, and to the genre of prose history in general.  The workload is not crushing, and the readings are interesting. If you put in the work, you should have no trouble. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Prof. Love was great. "
