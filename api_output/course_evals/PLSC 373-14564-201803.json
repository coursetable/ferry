            "\u00a0I gained the skills to deconstruct a seemingly impossible international challenge into smaller pieces including stakeholders and ways to tackle each piece. I met many people working in international education and was very inspired by their stories and work around the world. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a good insight into the main stakeholders in international education, the challenges that are most often faced and various ways to address these challenges. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the to think critically about education systems, contrasting several international systems with our US education system. I learned to ask critical questions of guest speakers and to see all-nighter people as equal reguardless of education level. ",
            "\u00a0A look at various stakeholders in education globally, of various barriers to education in different parts of the world, and the role of social innovation and entrepreneurship in education. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of exposure to case studies for NGO work, broad exposure to systems in education in countless different contexts ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me about the key stakeholders involved in different educations systems, some of the key challenges in improving education systems, and major difference between education in different countries throughout the world. ",
            "\u00a0So much knowledge on education in different aspects and contexts, it was truly and amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about international education systems. I don't think this course ended up to ultimately be about \"innovation\" in education systems, so much as just discussing issues plaguing different education systems followed by a brief, surface-level discussion on solutions (not necessarily innovative per se) to fix these solutions. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: engaging and interesting material, case studies are always fun ways to learn\r\nWeaknesses: class discussions on canvas did not add to my learning because I posted just to post something and other people seemed to do that too. We didn't engage with each other. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely interactive and discussion-based, which was great for learning. Perhaps more direction could be given with the writing assignments in order to understand just how much detail is necessary to make a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the layout of this course and the way that the class was split up into different sections, it made it very comprehensible and easy to follow. The only suggestion I have would be to make sure the readings are accessible to students by putting them on course reserves. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the quality of discussion, spurred by Casss questions and queries, and the diversity of case studies as well as the guest speakers. As I was shopping several seminars, I could not stop thinking or talking to my friends about this class due to the ease of conversation and stimulation of learning in just the first two classes. I was hooked and knew that this was an important field to study, even as I am an EVST major. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Of the courses I've taken, this had the most well-structured and organized syllabus. The reading load was not too burdensome at all and the readings were carefully chosen to contribute to class discussion and not just to take up time. The syllabus builds upon previous material and discussion each week, and I really enjoyed the arc of the course over the semester. I genuinely looked forward to this class each week because Cass does a great job guiding discussion that invites personal reflection and experiences and observations, but also ties in content from the reading. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I think the syllabus could be more clear about assignments. I know several of my classmates did not know the weekly online reading responses were mandatoryseveral classmates thought the online responses could be done in lieu of in-class participation or vice versa. Also, expectations for the three papers were presented in powerpoints during class, but it would be helpful to receive a rubric or more specific set of expectations in writing as well. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar is extremely engaging and the discussion was lively and driven by passion, both in Prof Walker-Harvey and the students.\r\n\r\nReadings were sometimes hard to access. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class and learned a lot about how to utilize innovation to improve education systems throughout the world. The guest speakers in the latter half of the semester were outstanding, and Cass was a really helpful, engaging, and kind professor. ",
            "\u00a0Cass has an incredible teaching style and was able to keep everyone engaged throughout the course. Maybe having the readings available would make it easier. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the breakup of the course. At the end of the course we got to hear from practitioners which brought all the reading we had done earlier to life. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked it if the links to the readings were included in the syllabus. It was often frustrating to go to a week's assignments and find that some of the material was inaccessible or unavailable. \r\n\r\nCass, though sometimes unclear with her expectations for assignments, offered an array of material that made for research projects/memos. The guest speakers were certainly the highlight of the course, offering a perspective we never get at Yale: THE REAL WORLD.  When I say the guest speakers were extraordinary, I mean it. Truly. I've never had such a strong education in what it really takes to impact  on large and small scales,  in essential ways. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were super fun but challenging depending on the country selected as sometimes the material/ research is not readily available for certain countries, often those who've endured chronic turmoil. \r\n\r\nCass consistently challenged us to think about impact, so by the end of the course you finish with a proposal that might could be enacted. You will have certainly been equipped with the resources and conversation to enter into the world of making things happen with your ideas. \r\n\r\nCass is a brilliant facilitator, and I especially loved how she wrote on the board for use to build upon and reflect over the thoughts of our peers. It felt respectful and considerate of the ideas and vulnerabilities offered in the room. That can be uncommon under the leadership of other professors on campus. \r\nEXCELLENT COURSE- unlike any other at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great survey level course on international education, very approachable for students who might not have taken a previous education studies course before; LIGHT/DIGESTIBLE READINGS; great selection of speakers; Cass has a wealth of knowledge especially practical experience and always made herself available; feedback on assignments was helpful. Weaknesses: classes were very predictable, 9:25 AM in Murray on Thursdays is tough, as attendance definitely grew a little spotty towards the of course; I would have preferred if the course would focus on a select few countries or issues/topics.

            "\u00a0Yes!  It's shocking that this was the first Yale class about international education apparently. Cass is a wonderful human being and has such interesting stores that she shares occasionally. She invites speakers into the class and they're all doing very amazing work in the world. The content is interesting because it's about a new country every week. The workload is not heavy at all. I would recommend choosing your projects based on what really interest you so that it doesn't feel like tedious work. ",
            "\u00a0YES! If you want to learn about international educational issues. Cass is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Cass' guidance and mentorship is truly a wonderful asset.  I really appreciated the opportunity to discuss educational equity/quality issues and interventions under her guidance and to learn from the experiences and reflections she shared with us. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would! This class was a very positive environment in which we had good discussions and were given the tools to create an overall innovative project. I would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend. Take absolutely anything you can with Cass. Or go to her office hours and just be her friend, she is amazing. What a wonderfully crafted course with such depth and breadth. If you can ever find a course on international education systems, take it, no matter what your major! I dont intend to work in the education field, but my mind is so much more expanded because of this class, and I know that these themes with stick with me through my whole careeer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is definitely one of my favorite classes taken at Yale so far. Cass is an amazing discussion leader and instructor, and the content of the course is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Its an excellent introduction to the international education landscape. Seminar discussion is always fun and engaging. Cass is an excellent professor and skilled discussion leader. I really appreciated that she drew on her connections in the field to bring in guests. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn about NGOs or education or both, take this course. It provides a great foundation in understanding the field, and provides a lot of opportunities to think about your own solutions and implementations. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to students interested in the fields of education, innovation, or entrepreneurship. The class discusses topics important for any student to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this class! Was hands on one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and changed the way I look at my life and at education as a way to change the world. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As an Education Studies student this class has been the only class offered that addresses international education, such an important balance to the many conversations we have about the American system. The course was carefully designed -- from the syllabus to the final project -- to enhance our learning. So many times words like \"innovation\" are thrown around in education and other fields and this class gave a nuanced, balanced look at what it means to be an innovator, and how tricky it is. Cass worked hard to create a class culture that allowed for respectful argument that I think really deepened what everyone got out of the course. The coursework was never too much and the professor makes this a 10/10. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! \r\n\r\nTake it! Without a doubt. No matter your major or experience, it is very worthwhile and challenging because it forces you to be creative, engaged, resourceful, and practical. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great especially for a relatively chill fifth credit. The readings were all very light, a lot of research papers that had abstracts and conclusion sections to skim if you're on a time crunch. The case study readings were sometimes a little longer but again, can definitely get by and contribute just from skimming. Don't worry about having not taken an education studies (EDST) class before. The way this course is designed makes it approachable for students from all backgrounds - I appreciated having students from a wide variety of academic disciplines (as well as personal educational experiences) in the room, as it made for more interesting discussion.
