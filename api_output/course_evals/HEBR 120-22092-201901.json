            "\u00a0We covered past tense for verbs and a variety of other vocabulary and grammar concepts. It was a good continuation of what we learned last semester because there was a combination of new and old concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Hebrew ",
            "\u00a0This semester was primarily focused on learning the past tense verbs of Hebrew, but I also gained a lot of knowledge about Israeli culture. My speaking, reading, and especially writing skills were quite expanded this semester. ",

            "\u00a0Amazing professor! Quizzes and homework are very helpful! ",

Orit is the sweetest lady and a great teacher. You get to listen to a lot of Israeli music and learn tons about the culture! Weaknesses: a lot of everyday work, which can be tedious, but is really the only way to learn as much as we've learned in one single semester. ",
