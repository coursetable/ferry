            "\u00a0Sometimes disjointed class lectures ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the study abroad experiences you gain. Having a Moroccan TA the year that I took it was amazing. I think if this course continues to happen every summer, the professor should always have a TA who is from Morocco. Our TA was the best part of the course hands-down. I feel like the instructional style of the professor was a bit all over the place, so if the instructor could maybe put together a bulleted list of the topics they are going to cover in discussion for each day of class, that would help guide the lecture, discussion, and any questions the students might have. ",
            "\u00a0I would've liked to talk just slightly more about other North African countries besides Morocco but overall the focus on Morocco made sense given the location. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really great professors, some interesting readings about topics never really discussed in traditional Western education, immersive environment is a HUGE plus, NADA HEDDANE IS THE BEST TF IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes readings would barely be related to what was being discussed in class, lectures often left little time for students to discuss (to be fair we had plenty of time outside of the classroom to do that) "

            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend this course to anyone who is interested about learning what life is like in Muslim-majority country. Morocco is a wonderful place, yes it can seem a bit daunting at times, especially if you are a woman, but as a woman who was in the class and went on the program, I cannot recommend this experience enough. I feel like my year was especially terrific because we had a female Moroccan TA who was able to not only advise us on personal matters IE places to go/eat, how to get places, how to interact with people in different circumstances, ***she spoke Darija and French which was INSANELY HELPFUL*** but she was also a sort of a mentor in terms of dealing with the parts of the culture that were difficult to adjust to. If you don't see yourself ever visiting Morocco alone because it seems scary and too unfamiliar, please take this course and go on this study abroad trip--it's an experience you will never forget, it will challenge your perceptions of the world (especially if you grew up in a Christian-majority country and were never exposed to the facets of culture that comes with being in a Muslim-majority country), and you will learn a lot about and see a ton of a very cool country. ",
            "\u00a0For sure ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Morocco is such an interesting country with a very rich cultural history. I think I came into the course thinking \"oh yeah, i'm gonna learn about africa now\" but i really learned about the middle east, north africa, sub-saharan africa (there's a really big difference), and even europe. Jonathan is really an amazing professor and you'll meet a diverse group of peers to travel the country with. "
