            "\u00a0I learned the history of the culture of energy and how we can change that in the future. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about American energy production and consumption. The course follows various fuels, and covers themes like political economy and energy justice. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a very in depth overview of energy history in the United States. I was amazed at how many primary sources the professor was able to incorporate, and he obviously has a great deal of knowledge about the subject. I definitely became better at looking at energy as a social and political issue and not one of pure science or economics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned some basics of American Energy History and had a lot of practice with primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0History of energy, interdiscplinary and multidiscplinary history, considering history from many different perspectives. Was able to learn how to write a paper in this course and write a research paper using primary and secondary sources. ",
            "\u00a0Environmental justice\r\nEnergy transitions\r\nEarly energy consumption/supply patterns, where history might repeat itself\r\nNot as much environmental focus until the 1970s, and then again not as much in modern days. Personally, I appreciated the relatively light mentions of the environment, as I had already taken American Environmental History in 2016. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting course. Learned a lot about the history of energy transitions in the US from 19th century to the present day. Favorite topics included Nuclear energy (from Atoms for Peace in the 1950s to plans for the Yucca Mountain Storage Facility in 1987), The Iranian Coup and oil strategies in the Middle East, life at the Lowell Mills in the 1840s, the culture of coal mining, and the 1970s resurgence of solar power. Both documentaries included in the course were particularly memorable: Harlan County, USA explained the region's 1973 coal strike, including the role of women in its organization and the corruption of the national union; Crude explained the legal situation in Ecuador and the ongoing lawsuit between the people of the Ecuadorian Amazon and Texaco-Chevron to clean-up pollution in the area. ",
            "\u00a0A comprehensive history of energy dynamics in America. Class is focused on why things happened more than what happened. ",
            "\u00a0A much deeper understanding of how the world got to where it is in terms of energy production and consumption, and how interconnected just about everything is in terms of changing the way we deal with energy. I also learned how to effectively form a thesis and support it with relevant and varied research. ",
            "\u00a0N/A ",
            "\u00a0This course was so wonderful! The class covered American Energy History from hydropower and dams to current day shale gas, offshore drilling, and solar power. The lessons are very in depth and readings were engaging and relevant. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about energy history in the US, from whaling and coal mining to the Green New Deal, this class had it all. The knowledge I learned in this class is applicable in every day life, especially with the climate crisis the world is facing now. It is extremely important to be educated about how energy has evolved to understand the repercussions/unexpected consequences of a modern energy transition, how energy effects equality, how the government, citizens, and energy producers interact with each other ",
            "\u00a0Developed an overview of the history of energy, particularly focusing on the nature of energy transitions. ",
            "\u00a0The types of energy used, reasons for energy transitions, and factors to consider when new sources are developed were discussed in relation to the energy history of the United States from roughly the beginning of the 19th century to current day.  Many famous and important readings were discussed relating to this topics. ",
            "\u00a0A deep understanding of various energy sources used in the US and their cultural, social, political and economic impact. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much vital information about how energy has sculpted the passage of American history, as well as the complexities that surround energy policy today. ",
            "\u00a0Energy history, energy transitions, how might we suppress fossil fuels ",
            "\u00a0Asides from factual knowledge on American energy history, I learned how to approach our current energy crisis with a different lens. There are many unintended consequences with energy policy and having the historical framework helps illuminate what those might be in today's political climate. I also realized how intentional our current energy systems were constructed. They were not a product of the free market but a deliberate maneuvering of energy producers, governments, and private industries. ",
            "\u00a0We talked about various energy topics in American history, as well as Ecuadorian oil history, and how they shaped American energy culture today. ",
            "\u00a0Energy transitions. How energy influences/influenced economic, political, and social changes in the US. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a lot of knowledge of the patterns of history around energy that I had never even considered before and which are so important to our national (and international ) history. I also gained a lot of research skills, especially around primary sources, which I know is a classic comment for a history class but in this case is really true. ",
            "\u00a0I developed skills needed for talking in groups within class about different reading materials, writing skills, note taking skills and skills required for a creating a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. it was a combination of two things I really enjoy, history and energy/environment. there was so much amazing material we looked at, and I have begun to look at history in an entirely different way, especially in how it pertains to the field I'm going to work in, energy. "

            "\u00a0More focus on the actual history and breakdown of fossil fuels and renewables rather than the cultural side of it would be immensely beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a great breadth of material. Since this was the first time the course was offered, sometimes the structure of it bounced around a bit, but this will be solved the next time it's taught. ",
            "\u00a0Classroom style was great, and I would suggest keeping it in the same room. As I stated, as a history course primary sources should be the focus and I certainly felt that to be the case in this course. \r\n\r\nTo improve, I would suggest adding more modules. These were great and I know they are a new development so I understand that they weren't all complete. However, I hope there are more modules to be explored in the next offering of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Since the course was being taught for the first time, I was a bit disorganize but I'm sure that will change in the following times that it will be taught. I wish the readings had been posted in a more timely manner instead of just the night before some other time that was close to when it was due. The material was pretty interesting, but I wish we had talked about more broad historical information so that I could conceptualize the primary sources. ",
            "\u00a0The course had really interesting subject matter, and some weeks were really strong, but at the end it was tough to see how everything fit together. ",
            "\u00a0TEAL classroom microphones could be improved\r\n\r\nTAs and sections were particularly strong this year\r\n\r\nMore frequent blog posts and encouraged \"replies\", in return, perhaps make the course a WR option ",
            "\u00a0The course simply attempted to cover more material than it really could. I think QUALITY is better than quantity when it comes to learning and find that the things I remember and enjoyed the most were specific case studies rather than broad cultural sweeps over centuries. I also thought the course was post WWII heavy (which makes sense because we spent a lot of time on oil dependence) but would have appreciated more discussion of earlier energy sources and early 1900s. The course could potentially be two different courses; however, it might just be improved by making its modules more specific and strictly chronological. \r\nI also think that it would have been better to switch tables more often to get more perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Interesting subject matter. Online modules with handpicked primary sources that facilitate understanding of the topic. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lectures were a bit unorganized sometimes. Some topics seemed less thought-out than others. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: seminar-style seating and microphones to be able to speak to the whole room. Relevant primary sources to discuss, and efficient discussion sections.\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes the readings were a bit dense, and the lack of a WR classification for the class is a downside as there is still a fair amount of writing. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Sabin is very innovative with the course structure and was fairly successful with the first fun at a mixed lecture/discussion class. The class was always enjoyable and the readings were very interesting. The course was a bit unorganized at times but this was understandable given that it was the first time a class anything like this course was ever taught. ",
            "\u00a0All around great class. The small setting was nice, as the opportunities for discussion are part of what made the class so great. The readings were usually interesting and not too long, and section was always another nice opportunity for learning and further discussion ",
            "\u00a0I loved the interactive nature of the course - it made the material much easier to remember. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the course does not feel rushed and we were able to spend a good amount of time on each of the topics (energy sources).  One weakness is that this class had a midterm paper, a midterm exam, a final paper, and a final exam, which was a bit fatiguing. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was the content. Weakness was at times it was disorganized, but largely due to the fact that it was the first time being ran. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the readings and the discussion sections. However, some parts of the lectures could definitely have been more engaging. I think more group work would have made the course more cohesive! Also some of the guest lecturers weren't that engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course was way too last minute put together. Some units it seemed like we dragged too long on, like nuclear and solar, and others, like natural gas, we barely looked at ",
            "\u00a0I did not enjoy the discussion-based lecture style. I did not feel like the discussions in class were productive, as it mirrored those that we had during section. I would have preferred a more traditional lecture-styled class, because that would have been a more productive utilization of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Sabin is passionate and committed to this topic and teaching it well. Though it was the first time this class was offered, it got better and better as the semester progressed. I'm sure it will continue to improve with each semester. Another strength was the readings. Absolutely fascinating.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Know that this class is taught in a unique classroom environment (the TEAL classroom). Much of the lecture will be spent talking to peers at your table, or listening to peers share conclusions in front of the whole class. If you are the type of person who gets frustrated hearing peoples' thoughts who have clearly not done the reading etc., this might be a point of frustration for you. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was the modules that helped us learn, and the weakness was the lack of engagement from many students. ",
            "\u00a0Structured wonderfully. Classes flowed very smoothly - lecture, discussion around tables, and discussion amongst the class. Readings were solid and the guests lectures were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the lecture was more interactive as well as keeping the lecture and slides format. This is one of my favourite classes i have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0strengths-well structured to cover a lot of time, sections were phenomenal, class was actually so fun to come to....I loved the table design of being more interactive, I made a lot of friends!\r\nweaknesses-homework was hard to follow, online module was confusing to use, readings were too many but super interesting, but challenging to get through all of "

            "\u00a0I would recommend it if you're looking for a survey of topics related to energy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Any student remotely interested in energy or environmental history should take this very important survey of history in America and its societal impacts. ",

            "\u00a0For Energy Studies Scholars: I recommend that you take this course. It's not a re-hash of the Gateway Course or any other \"Energy and Society\" track courses. There's a lot more focus on early energy history, energy transitions, and environmental justice. All of those topics will feature crucially in the energy industry in the coming years, and this course will prepare you well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; I think students who are not even majoring in HSHM, econ, or environmental studies should take this course. The information is so relevant to current political debates on foreign oil and climate change. I learned a lot from the course; its helped me plan for my thesis and provided an extraordinary reading list for future studies in my major (Yergin's The Prize, Weissman's The World Without Us, and Ruth S. Cowan's More Work for Mother). ",

            "\u00a0Yes, for sure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in pursuing a career in the field of energy, even if it's in science or engineering.  This course will give a good explanation why the current energy policies are the way they are and in which directions we can use to change them in the future. ",
            "\u00a0No. Do not take this course. The professor is unorganized, and unclear in his explanation of the content he is teaching. During most of his lectures, about half of the class (25 min), is spent doing in class discussion with our peers. Although this may seem helpful, it is extremely disadvantageous when the content we learn is not reinforced during lecture. Because we spend most of our time talking to our classmates, I feel that we have barely learned about important aspects of American Energy History, and instead, relied on the bits and pieces that our classmates have retained in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think understanding the importance of US energy history is really important in todays society no matter a students area of study. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would! It's almost like essential knowledge for American citizens. ",
            "\u00a0I had high expectations for this course because I'm a first year interested in EVST as a major and hadn't yet taken any EVST courses, but it was kind of boring and disappointing. Sure I came out of it with more knowledge of energy history but class wasn't that engaging, nor was section ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good foundational course for energy studies. ",

            "\u00a0I never really though of how energy influences/influenced economic, political, and social changes in the US. Dr. Sabin does a wonderful job in leading the class and facilitating discussions. Readings were solid and the 3 guest lectures we had were all fantastic. Overall a great class and I have no gripes as a stem major. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It super interesting and you will learn a lot about our energy patterns and how to think about the present day in that context. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was better than expected and really developed my knowledge into different energy transitions, not only in America but internationally too. ",
            "\u00a0YESYESYES\r\nI loved the interactive nature of the classroom, and section was a really good review of solidifying key ideas. The topics we learned about were so cool, and the variety of mediums were engaging and helped for all types of learners. Workload is higher than other courses, but I was able to overlook it because I really enjoy the subjects. Just be prepared to have readings, exams and papers. "
