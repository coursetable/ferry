            "\u00a0R coding, text mining and analysis, lots of great insights about working in development aid and conservation biology. Professor Barbour has had such a long and interesting career, its so fun to just hear him talk ",
            "\u00a0This course basically provides a survey of USAID from inception through the modern day, utilizing at points various textmining methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about development aid, bureaucracy, and conservation. ",
            "\u00a0While this course seemed eclectic, in many ways, there was a method to the madness. Reflecting on the class, I realize that Professor Barbour proffered a complete and holistic understanding of US foreign assistance and international development---from agriculture, to medical care and environmental sustainability, complete with all challenges, successes, and failures. As we weighed assistance programs by the value of their initiative and their ability to afford sustainable help in developing countries, the complexities of foreign aid became self-evident; at the end of the day, were you able to contextualize  individual lessons within the corpus as a whole, this course left you infinitely wiser, changing the ways in which you look at foreign assistance and aid as a humanistic, political, or economic pursuit. If you are someone who cares deeply about pursuing a career in development or state department work, you should definitely take this course. "

            "\u00a0The course structure was very interesting and largely dictated by students, but I think a bit more of a set curriculum would have helped us learn all the information we needed in a more rigorous way.  However, this is the first time this course was offered, so it was amazingly well-structured given this. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course were: (1) The professor's ability to tailor lessons to the interests of the class made the coursework something that you wanted to engage with, fervently---if you've seen Dead Poet's Society, it was something like that, but with US foreign aid instead of English Literature and Professor Barbour in place of Robin Williams. (2) Guest lecturers who worked in different sectors of development added to the tangibility of the course, we were able to ask questions, and the guest lecturers' insights gave us new perspectives to bring into the issues-approach style of this course. (3) The computer programming required for the course (of which I had no prior experience), was intuitive, and gave me a new skill-set that is all-the-more essential in today's job market. (4) Professor Barbour was always happy to meet if we had any trouble; he gave up a lot of his personal time to help us, and we all appreciated it, dearly.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness to this course was the fact that, as lessons changed to benefit us, the syllabus was, at times, unclear. But again, that made this course especially fun to take--if we were more interested in topic A than B, Professor Barbour would give us the low-down on B, then spend a great deal of time discussing whatever it was we were passionate about.

            "\u00a0Please take this! Prof. Barbour is a true gem ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This year, it was a hard-to-find gem since it had never been offered before and was listed as a graduate course. If you have any interest in development, or in the applications of text mining and other statistical methodologies, I'd highly recommend the course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this class is exactly what everyone should want at Yale -- a small class size, an extremely knowledgable and engaging professor, and important material for both intellectual and personal development. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Before coming to Yale, I had expected every course I took to be engaging, filled with conversation and debate, and if you're passed your first-year fall semester, you probably know that to be false. Somehow, Professor Barbour was able to take one motley group of students and one eclectic course and make it the vision of academic wonder that I had coming into Yale. Truly strange how that worked, but if you have the time and the opportunity, you should certainly take this class. "
