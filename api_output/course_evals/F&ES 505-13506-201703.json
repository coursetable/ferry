I was hoping for Mendelsohn to rather create the situation where we should be immersed to reading lots of his research, or perhaps others case by case basis. But instead he opted to settle for us 'grasping' the concept by weekly problem set.\r\n\r\nI know that we could just read his research without he had conditioned the class to.

I'm not sure why we even had classroom time. ",

However, it did not align with my expectation that this course would challenge the current ways of thinking about economics and the environment (which are, in my view, obviously not working).  The course was very market-focussed.  For instance, we were taught that water markets are always the best way to allocate water and that \"poor people will always find enough money to buy water to survive\". I also expected that the course would be backed up by research.  However, it seemed to me that gross generalisations were often given, without reference to papers or books. One example is that \"99.9% of common property regimes fail\", seeming to ignore all of the work that has been done looking at the ability of institutions to manage common property successfully. I also did not expect the professor to only support modest mitigation of greenhouse gases before the end of the century on the basis that climate change will overall be beneficial globally up until the end of the century.  I did not expect to be told that the long term target should be 3 - 5 degrees C above pre-industrial levels, as compared to the 2 degree Paris goal. "

Sometimes I found it difficult to understand a concept if I didn't grasp it during the lecture therefore it would have been great to have something to go back to in this case. ",
            "\u00a0The course was difficult to succeed in. The skill sets for the problem sets were not taught in class, making them hard to complete. I constantly felt lost and confused. ",
            "\u00a0The class is basically divided in three: There is one class taught in the classroom, there is another class related to the homework, and there is another class with the readings. The connection between them is poor, if not inexistent. The TA's had to give their own class for us to understand the--terribly written--homeworks. Such homeworks would require us to do things that were never explained in class, and were filled with mistakes that the TAs would need to email us or tell us in the sections in order to be able to do them. In addition, the things that we were requested to do were written in the most obscure manner ever imagined, and made us waste valuable time deciphering what the professor wanted us to do, and this didn't add any value to the task we needed to do.\r\nThe class was very frustrating. The professor would hardly ever answer to any question made by students, making our involvement futile as we were basically just listening with no possibility of real feedback. Furthermore, the classes were extremely repetitive. We would spend 40 minutes listening the same thing when it could have been summarized in one sentence. All this extra time wasted could have been used to explain the logic behind the homeworks. ",
            "\u00a0I truly do appreciate Professor Mendelsohn's perspective and sometimes uncomfortable perspective on solving natural resource problems. It is important to challenge my own views even if, in the end, I still disagree. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I think one of the weaknesses would be the frequent errors in the problem sets. It was difficult to learn the concepts when there were errors or the TAs were unsure why the solution was the way it was. \r\n\r\nI would also suggest that in the future the TAs be allowed to go through the PSETs step by step in sections or have an alternative PSET to go through with us. Since we don't learn these equations or how to solve them in lecture, we need to learn it somewhere. \r\n\r\nBut again, I have truly appreciated this class and the perspectives presented in lecture! Thank you! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Straight forward expectations\r\n- Wide range of topics\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Information on how to do problem sets was almost entirely taught by the TAs\r\n- Too basic. We are graduate students, not everything needs to be a straight line since that's not realistic\r\n- Lecture had no discussion, just being talked at. If section is supposed to be time for discussion, teach to the problem set in class even just a little bit. ",
            "\u00a0The mathematical foundation for the problem set could be focused more in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think just a little more focus for some of the middle lectures could help Professor Mendelsohn really improve the course. There was just one on climate science that stood out as being more of a basics course than just an economics view. Some of the lectures could have been condensed to get to fisheries, forestry, non-renewables, and other important aspects of natural resource economics. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was the entertaining and compelling in-class lectures provided by the professor. For the most part, they were able to communicate concepts and their visualization through graphs rather effectively. The main weakness was precisely in failing to break down to the students (and from what was obvious, to the TFs themselves) just how these visualization of data came about. There were the lectures in the one hand, the readings on the other (if at all) and the required problem sets in the other, and these made up the worst part of the course, as they usually had no link or stated relationship with the lectures (beside their topics) and a great amount of time had to be invested in merely understanding WHAT they were about and how to go about with them. At times this felt like two separate courses and while the TFs seemingly put a lot of effort into making this work, they often felt as misled and improvising as the rest of us. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the lecture style and the blackboard diagrams. Great attitude from the professor all the time, he really seemed to enjoy teaching the course which really makes it easy for students to be engaged with the material. Great examples from real life. Professor sometimes should have shut down some of the questions quicker to keep us on track. Perhaps a little bit less USA-centered, some of the topics really only made sense for North American environments or businesses. Perhaps the first couple weeks could have started with something more immediately understandable, it was a bit hard to figure out for the first couple weeks and I know a couple people who shopped and dropped it because they didnt realize how much cooler the material was going to get!! Overall though I loved the course and the way the lectures were conducted. So glad I stuck with it! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include coverage of a wide variety of topics such as fishing, forestry, travel costs, land use, pollution control and more; very helpful and accessible teaching fellows; Prof. Mendelsohn's experience and passion for the subject area; and problem sets that allow students to understand course concepts mathematically and practically. The weaknesses of the course include difficulty following course concepts without complementary digital resources (lecture materials only drawn on chalkboard) and the variety of topics covered not allowing for a deep dive on all topics.

            "\u00a0Most of the classes were off topic, we talked about many things that weren't even related with economics. The problem sets were never seen in class, so the homework had nothing to do with what we learned in class. I think that in average, three classes could have been easily taught in one class. We wasted a lot of time going over and over the same topics without even asking about it. Our questions were never answered, he kept on delaying the answer for some reason, but we never understood why. ",
            "\u00a0More focus on economics, less on general climate change discussion. Also, I would have really benefited from the instructor reviewing some of the math we needed to complete models. Having the TAs be the only ones teaching the math was not productive and at times even confusing. ",

            "\u00a0The course felt very disjointed. The math-based problem sets were totally different material than the lectures, but they did not really help with understanding the material (they just felt kind of extra). The main point of the class seemed to be driving home the concepts, not the math, which I think is a good thing, but the homework assignments should still support the rest of the course material rather than just feeling like busywork. ",

The TAs and their discussion groups were excellent. Weaknesses: some lectures were repetitive. The homework was simple and did not require or encourage strong engagement with the material. There was little connection between the lectures and the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course covered a lot of material and provided good discussion points. At the same time, sometimes lectures seemed to be too in depth and not as relevant to the overarching concepts. ",

            "\u00a0This course effectively introduces students to an economic worldview, which I believe is important to understand in order to make an effective case for environmental solutions to decision-makers who are primarily concerned with economic issues. It also covers a broad range of material, and supplementary readings are drawn from leaders in the environmental economics field. \r\n\r\nA weakness of the course were the poorly-structured discussion sections, which could have been better planned and implemented in order to further students' learning. They were essentially problem set review sessions, which seems like something better reserved for office hours. I think they should have included more discussion of the readings assigned for homework, and/or the application of concepts learned in class to current environmental issues and events. ",
            "\u00a0Great curriculum, but delivery could be improved. May recommend establishing a foundation textbook that provides an introduction to environmental economics (covering both basic economic principles which students may not have been introduced to, as well as how these principles are applied in an environmental management context). \r\n\r\nStudents also struggled with some of the mathematics in the course, which were presented mainly in the problem sets. There was significant disconnect between the mathematics application required in the problem sets, and what was taught during lectures (which focused very specifically on the theoretical elements). ",
            "\u00a0Many of the lectures felt very slow, and caused us to get behind in the syllabus. I really enjoyed a handful of the lectures, especially about managing non-renewable resources or common property. \r\n\r\nI was frustrated at times by the lack of alignment between homework problem sets and class content. The homework assignments required math that we never went over during class sessions, and often had to be entirely learned during TA sessions. I would have preferred to get a grasp/introduction to the math in class, and then use the homework assignments as an opportunity to dive deeper and become more comfortable with it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Definitely geared towards individuals who want to understand some economics, but are not looking to become an economist. Even something not particularly strong in math could take the course and understand all the material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The class material didn't prepare you for the problem sets. If the TAs hadn't been so good, I'm confident many of us would have gotten failing grades on the problem sets. We didn't cover as much material as we could have because the professor would get sidetracked. Often he would say he would come back to a question, and then forget. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it covers a broad range of environmental economic issues. The primary weakness is that the lecturer does not challenge the current ways of thinking about the environment using economics. The lectures also did not connect to the course readings - I would recommend linking the readings and the lectures together.  For instance, I would have found it very helpful to have references to papers that supported and disputed the sweeping claims made by the lecturer. I also found the questions in the problem sets and exams to be quite vague - I would recommend that the TAs be allowed to do a test run of the assessments to make sure that the instructions are clear.  The problems sets were also not closely linked to the lectures - it was usually up to the TAs to actually teach us the skills necessary to complete the problem sets. I would also recommend that the lecturer recommend an environmental economics textbook for students to refer to (not just a general economics textbook). Another recommendation is that the problem sets include questions that required written explanations of the concepts we were being taught. As it was, most of the marks in the two exams came from written explanations, even though we had not previously had an opportunity to test our ability to put what we were being taught into words (rather than equations or diagrams).

Economic principles are a big part of the basic fabric of our society/ world and we all should understand the field. ",
            "\u00a0If you are not an economics major/minor and have not taken a course in economics as it applies to environmental challenges I highly recommend taking this course. The content will be beneficial to careers in environmental policy and resource management. I would recommend that students interested in taking this course be prepared to dive into the material, attend TF office hours and additional student sections outside of class, and ask many questions in class until the material is clearly understood. ",
            "\u00a0If you have solid understanding of economic concepts you may not want to take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Shop the course and pay attention to who is teaching and whether you like their teaching style. It could make or break this course for you. ",
            "\u00a0If it's necessary for your degree, or being taught markedly differently, sure, but if it's the same course as fall 2017 and you have any econ experience, take something higher level. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you're new at econ and want to know more. Don't take it if you are looking for challenge ",
            "\u00a0I dont recommend the class, unless you have no knowledge at all about environmental economics, but otherwise take other economic courses with another professor. ",
            "\u00a0Don't, spend 30 minutes on Khan academy and you will learn more. ",
            "\u00a0Only take if you haven't had any previous exposure to economics. ",
            "\u00a0Go into the class expecting to take away broad concepts about environmental economics. ",
            "\u00a0Read the course papers even if they are not required for any homework or discussions. ",
            "\u00a0If they would like to learn about the economics of water, land, and pollution it will provide you with a lot of valuable insight. ",
            "\u00a0It's what we got in terms of foundational econ. ",
            "\u00a0Strongly recommended. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, and I would strongly advise taking it with a open mind. While some of the economic concepts were not in line with my worldview, I was glad to be exposed to the ideas of the class because I recognize that much of our governing structures operate according to the economic logic presented by the professor. I believe it's important to understand that logic in order to effectively advocate for better governmental or market-driven solutions to environmental problems. In that sense, this class is really valuable for providing students with a grasp of basic economic concepts, and how they can be used to address environmental issues. ",
            "\u00a0A promising foundation course. ",
            "\u00a0Good foundational course. I think the content is quite useful, and is probably worth bearing through some of the challenges in how it was taught. ",
            "\u00a0See who the TAs are if it's taught by the same professor and strongly weigh that in your decision. It's a low work load, which is nice, but also you aren't going to be bursting with new information after each class. ",
            "\u00a0I would check who is teaching the class before taking it.  If it was possible to take Economics of the Environment with a lecturer other than Prof Mendelsohn, I would seriously consider doing that. Otherwise, I would say to take many of the sweeping statements made by the lecturer with a grain of salt, so to speak. \r\nI think that taking some environmental economics is worthwhile though. And this was certainly an interesting introduction to the economics discourse from someone who is heavily invested in market ideology. "
