            "\u00a0I learned the context and perspectives through which to appreciate Italian films. I believe those skills could be easily carried over to other films. I also improved my writing skills as an art critic, thanks to the generous support of my TF. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about Italian history and culture through these movies, which were very timely. I also learned about different periods of Italian history, such as neorealism and postmodernism. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great overview of 20th century Italian film in terms of major movements, main actors/actresses, themes, and critical films. I feel very comfortable discussing Italian film now and have become a huge fan of the genre. This course also helped my comprehension of Italian significantly. ",

The films were interesting and, through the course, I learned more about Italian culture and history as well as concepts of film theory and analysis. I was able to work on my writing skills in Italian, since I was taking this course for the Italian certificate, as well. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: great, knowledgeable professor and TF (Anna Marra) \r\nWeaknesses: more class discussion could be inspired ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that the professor and TAs are very nice. The discussions are very fruitful and enlightening. \r\nOne major weakness of this course is that we have a paper due during reading week and then we have a final for this class. Seems like cruel and unusual punishment if you ask me. It feels like I'm back in DS - we've been writing papers all semester but I have to go regurgitate names of directors on a final? ",
            "\u00a0This is an incredible course, and it was very well taught; the structure was set up so that before I watched each film, I gained a working knowledge of the director's style and how they fit into Italian cinema. My only suggestion is that the last few movies (especially The 100 Steps and The Mafia Kills only in the Summer) were not as good as the rest of the movies we watched. ",
            "\u00a0Prof Marcus is the kindest person ever. Love her. Not much to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor Marcus is an absolutely brilliant, warmhearted, and genuinely passionate professor. Likewise, the films chosen were generally extremely interesting, thought-provoking, and nuanced depictions of Italy and the minds of Italian directors. Class time feels very productive (we get through so much in one class) and the papers are spaced out fairly. Furthermore, I felt like the class very conducive to learning for all students, from film buffs to students who had never taken a film class before. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nVery few! Discussion in a lecture-style class is sometimes difficult, as the size of the class can sometimes lead to stunted conversation. ",
            "\u00a0all strengths: i really look forward to the wednesday screenings. They are such a nice break from the otherwise hectic Yale life. I have enjoyed voicing my opinions and listening to other students in lectures. Prof. Marcus is not to be missed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Marcus has to be the greatest, sweetest professor on the planet. She is so knowledgeable about Italian film (just read her articles because they are amazing!). I was left in awe at her analysis of our films, because she considered every detail important. The way she read scenes was so creative and breathtaking. She really made my film writing improve tremendously because she was so detailed. The TAs for this class are also amazing; my TA was especially helpful and encouraging, and he really went above and beyond to help me, not just in writing but also in helping me choose a major. I also loved the movies we watched. Not only are they all very timely and culturally important, but they are just breathtaking, and you get to experience the evolution of Italian cinema with these amazing films and directors. I fell in love with Italian cinema after this class, and to think that I almost didn't take it! THERE ARE NO WEAKNESSES FOR THIS AMAZING COURSE! THIS IS THE BEST CLASS I HAVE EVER TAKEN AT YALE SO FAR! ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Marcus is very knowledgeable and has seen and discussed the films we watched several times. The films are expertly selected and were a real joy to watch - I gained such an appreciation for this genre as a result. I can't think of a way that this course could be improved; the class was about 40 people which was the perfect leminar style to discuss the films. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures being simply spoken and with no visual aids made them rather dry, and it was difficult to understand what information was really important to know versus just interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed all the films we watched. I like having a TA that we could meet with. I think it would have been really beneficial to have our meeting for our essay way more in advance, having it on Friday made the process of writing our essays more rushed. I also think it would be better to have the additional screening during reading period rather than the last week of classes. I also think having the readings on Canvas would alleviate the financial burden of having to buy the course packet from TYCO. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are Prof. Marcus' enthusiasm and warmth for the subject. I wish that we had a section or some other environment to discuss the films in small groups. ",
            "\u00a0While this was one of my favorite courses at Yale, it may be beneficial to add a section every three weeks so that we could have an opportunity for a more intimate discussion of the films in each unit. The pre-writing sessions were nice and the open forum of class was a refreshing way to keep us engaged, but I'm not sure either amount to a perfect substitute for a round table discussion, which I think films really inspire us to have. ",

            "\u00a0<3 ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course. The professor is super nice, the material is interesting, the films are entertaining and emotional. ",
            "\u00a0More in depth analysis of how to look at films versus just analyzing the films we watched. ",
            "\u00a0The student participation during lessons was really great. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the way that  the films selected were often responses to earlier films discussed in the class. I wish we didn't have to include 3 movies in every essay because it was hard to fit all them in 5 pages ",
            "\u00a0I genuinely enjoyed this course, since it was interesting and Professor Marcus and my TA were the best. One way it could be improved would be to set up the days for the writing workshops more in advance, so we would have more than a weekend to work on our essays. ",
            "\u00a0The films are great, the lectures are really interesting, the essay prompts are a complete pain. It's very difficult to write a compelling essay in 1250 words, when you're forced to tie together three scenes from quite different movies all into one overarching argument. ",
            "\u00a0The films chosen for the course were fantastic. However, I had many issues with the essay prompts. Trying to tie together three films into one specific thesis is difficult enough, especially when the only help you have is from a fifteen minute meeting with an already busy TF. I would recommend more lenient prompts that would be better at assessing students and more fun to write. ",
            "\u00a0It was a great class with the general knowledge being taught on Tuesday, watching the movie on Wednesday and discussing the movie on Thursday. The only part that can be improved is the in-class participation as some students (such as myself) came to class every single time but has social anxiety that prevents them from speaking in class. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the entire course, although I think I could have participated more in the discussion aspects of the class. I did not find any weaknesses! "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes! If you have any interest in taking a film class, definitely take this one. It will open your eyes to a new culture in a way that a standard [Hollywood/American] film class will not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. You have to LOVE film to not get bored in this course, and unfortunately I do not feel that I like film enough to get out of this course what I was supposed to. If you like media such as film and television then this course is great for you; it certainly seems less intense than other film courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone who likes movies; this course was terrific, and it was not particularly taxing in terms of workload. ",
            "\u00a0For sure, Prof. Marcus is amazing and the class is v fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student; it has been my favorite class I have taken at Yale thus far. Take it for the professor, take it for the fantastic Italians films--either way, you can't lose! ",
            "\u00a0It's a must-take if you like films but not like the Hollywood type, if you have heard of Fellini and would love to learn more, or if you are fascinated by the tv series \"The Young Pope\" or \"My Brilliant Friend.\" This class makes you happy. ",
            "\u00a0Best class Ive taken at Yale!!! ",
            "\u00a0100% WOULD RECOMMEND! Even if you aren't a big film person, this class is good for anyone who needs help improving their writing, or for people interested in history. Also, this class is worth it for Professor Marcus alone. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. If you are interested in Italian culture at all it is critical that you take this class because it gives you a great foundation to understand Italy's film industry and also political history. ",
            "\u00a0Coming from a non-film major, yes, take this class. It's a great opportunity to learn about Italian film from a cool professor. Screenings are entertaining and  the papers are not bad at all: 4 papers at 5 pages each. Lecture is a bit dry, but it's fine if you go and participate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a wonderful course where you'll learn a lot about Italian film. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Prof. Marcus is a gem and the course itself is accessible and interesting. Don't let the Italian part of the course title scare you, this course is for anyone who is even mildly interested in film and writing about it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is an excellent class with a great professor. The films are wonderful, and Professor Marcus is unbeatable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The class is what you make of it: if you're taking it for a WR/Hu credit, it is a painless introduction to close reading and cultural analysis; if you're taking in as a seasoned humanities student, you are free to explore and experiment under the caring eye of your TA and the professor. Despite it being quite a large class, I really felt that the approach to students was individualized, and almost everyone would speak in class when analyzing films (in a lecture of 50+ people!), which is a testament to professor Marcus' ability to make everyone feel seen and welcomed. You don't have to do the readings to do well, but if you do have time to do them, you'll find them fascinating. The only criticism I have is the extreme dominance of the male point of view in the course -- all the filmmakers studied are men, the majority of the protagonists are men, most of the articles we read were written by men. Women have a role as actresses, as muses, but not as creators. Keep this in mind if you decide to take it. ",
            "\u00a0<3 ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in film or Italian history. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Italian cinema, certainly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! Well structured, well selected films, good analysis and background provided. Learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah probably. It's pretty good but not amazing ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Marcus is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommended! This course will make you appreciate cinema so much more. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I definitely recommend taking this course if you are interested in Italian culture, history, and film and if you want to take a class with Professor Marcus. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you're not stressed by fairly arbitrary grading systems. ",
            "\u00a0YES just trust me and take this class before graduating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I have already recommended this course to other students in my high school. I recommended this course to all the students I know who are allowed to take Yale courses. "
