            "\u00a0My Spanish improved a lot. I learned about the culture and history of Spain and of Valencia in particular. I now have a greater appreciation for gothic architecture. ",
            "\u00a0My fluency in Spanish improved a lot - I got a lot of practice speaking and writing in Spanish.  I also gained a more complete understanding of the history and culture of Spain, especially Valencia. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, my Spanish improved a ton! There was an opportunity to learn something in practically every minute, both inside and outside of class. I also have a greater understanding of Spanish culture and history, and an appreciation for how Spain functions as a society. ",
            "\u00a0Increased fluency, broad survey of Spanish history/politics/literature, lots of vocabulary, some grammar practice ",
            "\u00a0Oral and written Spanish communication skills; knowledge of Spanish culture, history, and contemporary society ",
            "\u00a0The most significant tool I developed was the ability to be truly conversational in Spanish. L4 courses prepared me well in grammar in vocabulary, but this course went the extra step and immersed me in a world where Spanish was not only fun to learn, but critical for communication. Also, I learned about the Spanish culture and way of living. These lessons were revealed through the readings and the work, but more frequently these lessons came from unexpected daily interactions with locals and from simply engaging with the city. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my Spanish ability, primarily speaking, so unbelievably much. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed new vocabulary and a more sophisticated fluency within the Spanish language. I also was opened to the breadth of Spanish history and culture through our coursework and class material. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided me with a broad understanding of Spanish culture and literature. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper understanding of Valencian culture and greatly improved my Spanish fluency. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to speak and communicate in Spanish. I gained fluidity and confidence in my speaking. I also learned much more about Spain and Spanish culture. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: good balance of work and free time so that we were busy but still had time to explore on our own. The online homework helped me remember a lot of small grammatical points that I had forgotten. The blogs were a good way to practice writing without *too* much stress, although sometimes it was hard to find time to write them.\r\nWeaknesses: The expectations were not always clear. Much of the information was on the syllabus/canvas, but sometimes the syllabus was hard to interpret and sometimes what happened in class differed from what the syllabus said. Also, I have little idea of what my grade will be in this course. 50% of our grade was determined in the last four days of the program, and another 15-30% on top of that was \"participation\" or \"blog\" assignments, for which we were not (numerically) updated on how we were doing. Realistically, my grade could be anywhere between a B/B- and an A. ",
            "\u00a0The homestay model, amount of work, and class schedule were all perfect.  Some of the excursions weren't that worthwhile simply because they were so far away and I felt like I spent all day on the bus (the excursion to el parque natural, for example).  Also, it was kind of unclear throughout if this was meant to be a literature course, grammar course, culture course, or other type of language course.  I think it is possible for all of these types of courses to be combined into one, but sometimes these objectives got in the way of each other.  If this is a course to improve our fluency, maybe it doesn't always behoove the students to interrupt them to correct minor grammar mistakes.  If we want to truly study Spanish literature, maybe let the discussion move beyond vocabulary and clarification questions. ",
            "\u00a0I love how this course encourages students to be highly engaged, including blog posts, optional museum visits, and biweekly excursions to towns and cities around Spain. We are given more than enough time to make the most out of the long days, and there isn't an overwhelming amount of homework. I would, however, improve our use of class time. We never got around to discussing any of the texts in depth, which was disappointing because I know my classmates and I had a lot more to say. I would much rather focus on a few texts in detail than many texts on a surface level. I also thought the grammar for the exams was not totally relevant to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting readings, good speaking and listening practice in class, incredible location in Valencia\r\n\r\nWeakness: classes held in room designed for lecture despite being a seminar ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: As oxymoronic as it sounds, the strength of the course comes from the activities outside the course. One can learn a lot in their own way from the excursions to localities inside and outside of Valencia, guest speaker lectures, and day-to-day experiences with host families. \r\nWeaknesses: This course serves as an introduction to many facets of Spanish culture, from the environment to the politics. Students usually become \"jack of all trades, master of none.\" While this allows students to gain knowledge in a wide range of areas, this also leads to a rather cursory understanding of the studied topics. One suggestion to improve this course would be to shorten the time dedicated to introductory material and allow students to devote the last two weeks on a topic of their choice, allowing them to gain a deeper understanding of a topic they are particularly interested in. ",
            "\u00a0This course provides a well-developed glance into all facets of Spanish culture: food, art, literature, environment, economy, politics, sports, government, society, architecture-- it is all covered. However, I walked away with the feeling that none of these subjects were covered in depth. Just about the moment when I wanted to learn more about something in class or in our weekly excursions, we were asked to move on to another activity or discussion. The course load is manageable, but some of the graded assignments will occur by surprise, or when you're unready for them. In general these issues do not destroy the integrity of the program, but they are certainly nuisances that one has to bear. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent introduction to the history and culture of Spanish. That being said, this course failed to truly dig deep into contemporary Spanish culture and events due to other subject matter that was given greater importance. The course touched lightly on several different topics but failed to bring them together in the end or even connect those sub-themes to the Spain we students were experiencing in our day-to-day. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Asensio truly made the course accessible to the many levels of Spanish-speaking ability we had in the class.   The resources on MySpanishLab really helped me with brushing up on grammar review.  We were constantly immersed in the language and I feel like my Spanish improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course did a great job of catering to each student's interests and background. Since students in the class had different levels of experience, Pilar helped each student improve based on their own needs. In addition, we were able to choose topics for our final assignments and blog posts based on our own interests and experiences in Valencia. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the variety of materials and the topics they covered. Learning about so many different topics through several mediums (guest talks, plays, articles etc.) made it much easier to integrate new vocab into both our class discussions and our everyday lives during the trip.\r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course was the pacing. It was somewhat unclear when we were moving onto a new topic. Often times our discussions felt cut short, so we would continue them the following day, which caused us to fall behind on the material, which we could have understood better. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was set up well. I did think that some of our readings in class seemed very disjointed and I was never sure what exactly was the point of the particular reading. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great opportunity to explore Spain, and my Spanish improved a lot. The work was not overwhelming, and I was able to explore a lot. I very much enjoyed the excursions we went on and the local professors that came to talk to us. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for the experience of being abroad in Valencia.  I had a few issues with the way the class itself was run, but the model and concept of the course are both great. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing study abroad course! This course is amazing for improving your Spanish because you speak it with your host family, professor, and classmates. Valencia is a wonderful city, small and intimate enough to get to know very well by the end of 5 weeks. And Pilar is incredible! I couldn't have asked for a better professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - if there's a real interest in increasing fluency. The history and culture aspect of the course is very interesting but used as a method to learn the language ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you wish to practice your Spanish language skills in an authentic environment and get to know Spain, a country rich in culture and history, you should definitely take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! If you want to become conversational in Spanish, this is probably your best option. ",
            "\u00a0If you are serious about improving your Spanish speaking ability definitely take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend that any Yale student study abroad, if given the chance/opportunity. I would not, however, ever recommend that another Yale student take this specific course. My disdain towards this course is primarily due to Profesora Pilar's handling of the course itself. She failed to give clear instructions or clear feedback to her students; thus, making it harder for us to remedy what she thought were our shortcomings. It was made incredibly obvious throughout the course that Profesora Pilar picked favorites and let too many of her personal sentiments spoil her role as an unbiased supplier of knowledge and teacher. The course itself would have been a wonderful overview of Spanish history and culture -- only if given by another Professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially those just starting at the L5 level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class was truly an immersive experience and my Spanish improved greatly. Speaking Spanish with my peers all the time, as well as with my host family, was crucial to improving. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. The immersive experience was invaluable in learning to speak the language with more fluidity, and though it was not the focus of the course, our vocabularies grew immensely with words that are much more relevant to day to day life in a Spanish speaking country, because we were forced to look for the words we most often lacked in casual conversation. ",
            "\u00a0Living in Spain was an invaluable experience. I would highly recommend this to another student. "
