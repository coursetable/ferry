            "\u00a0I learned about the craft and structure of television writing as well as how the development process works on the writing side of television. ",
            "\u00a0TV writing is a lot more intricate than I had originally thought. There is a loose step-by-step process that comes with turning an idea in the shower into an actual dialogued story. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the proper formatting of a script and the process of writing and selling a TV pilot from start to finish. The in-class writing exercises were also super helpful for sparking creativity and practicing certain elements of the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0I gained valuable insight into the process behind television writing and storytelling, and as a result, I am now more acutely aware of the way in which scenes in my favorite television shows are crafted and can articulate what makes a scene (or even a whole season-long plot) work. I also learned about my own writing abilities and how to craft well-rounded characters and thoughtful storylines, and I learned how to utilize certain steps in the process of television writing (such as story areas and outlines) to build on my initial ideas. Lastly, I learned a lot about the television industry and how shows are produced and conceived. ",
            "\u00a0I learned soooo much in this class -- the importance of character, having a clear want and need, making every scene have an element of conflict, seduction, or negotiation, how to pitch to execs and lots of other useful tips about the industry, and SO MUCH MORE. ",
            "\u00a0Before this class, I had already had a great interest in TV shows but after this class, I had a much much greater appreciation for the scripts behind it. I learnt that TV scripts can also be written in a very literary way. I also learnt how to create convincing characters and plots. Professor Tracy also taught us more about the industry itself and what it takes to get a show on the air. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me more about writing than any writing class I've taken at Yale. I learned to apply my analytical skills to shows, to pitch a story, to write a compelling narrative, and to spin out an idea in a way that sustains it and builds it into something people might want to watch. I gained a huge appreciation for TV writing and the field of entertainment as a whole. "

            "\u00a0A real strength of the class was the discussion. Every discussion felt focused and I always felt like I learned something new about a pilot after we talked about it. Another strength was the writing assignments and their progression. I liked the sequence of pitch, story area, outline, script. At the end of the semester writing the script felt like the culmination of a semester long project that I had put a lot of time and effort into. Having lots of working writers at various stages of their career visit was great for getting perspective into the entertainment world and their craft of writing. I would have liked for the class to have had more workshop time. Also, it would have been helpful to get comments on writing back sooner. I often received them a day or two before the next assignment was due so I didn't always have time to incorporate them into the next project. ",
            "\u00a0We did a lot of script reading for this course, which helped a lot for those who were less exposed to this medium. I think, however, that spending a little time talking about the history of TV drama might help students conceptualize why some of these scripts are crucial to the progression of the genre. ",
            "\u00a0This class had no weaknesses. It was incredibly engaging and fun, and was a valuable learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a perfect balance of learning how to read and analyze scripts (and how to have fruitful discussions about them) and learning how to write various elements of a script, from monologues to wordless scenes. I really enjoyed the writing exercises we did and how they related to scenes that we had discussed that day, and I also loved having the opportunity to workshop our ideas and our classmates' work. There is not much I would do to improve the class--maybe we could have had another day to conduct a mock writers' room? Other than that though, I really thought it was well-constructed and catered to a variety of different skills necessary for reading and writing scripts. ",
            "\u00a0This class was so great. Can't really think of any weaknesses. Maybe wish we stuck to the syllabus more (we got off track towards the end of the semester) and read less procedurals / CBS shows. Other than that, everything was great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Clear lessons and workshops to practice writing. Detailed feedback on our scripts and submissions. Famous people from the industry like Emily Nussbaum, Paul Attanasio and Michael Rauch. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about this course was really wonderful. The scripts we read were carefully curated and led into discussion beautifully, the assignments logical, well thought-out, and extremely helpful, and the teacher incredibly talented and knowledgable. You got the sense you were learning to write for life, not just for a class. \r\nThe only thing that I would have liked to have seen is more mock writer's room (that was so fun!) "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in television writing, or television more generally, absolutely! You get exposure to a lot of shows and gain experience in the process of developing a pilot. I left feeling like I had a deeper understanding of plot and story structure. I really enjoyed the class, it was a highlight of the week for me. ",
            "\u00a0Apply, get in, take it. Honestly, just do it. There was a good balance of humanities and stem students so everyone had a unique idea to bring to the writers' room. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who has any interest in TV, screenwriting, or the entertainment industry should take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. It was the most fun class I have taken at Yale, and it also felt like a rare class: it is very difficult to find classes about television at this university and at others, and I am so glad I had the opportunity to learn about this field. I also thought that it was a great choice to count the class as an English department class, because--as Professor Tracy said on the first day--there's a certain way in which scripts are works of literature and should be treated as such. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you can get into this class, definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you have any interest in going into writing of any kind definitely take this class. Or even if you just want to learn more about what makes good TV good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are at all interested in TV shows or writing for TV, definitely take this class. Professor Tracy is such an engaging and helpful lecturer and all the scripts we read were so interesting. Definitely a class I looked forward to every week. ",
            "\u00a0A thousand times yes! You don't have to really love TV to take this course . You have to really love stories because in reality this is all about stories, creating them, receiving them, selling them, and figuring out how to most effectively capture the story you want to tell. Most creative writing classes either go too heavy on the formula needed for a good story or leave you with only a couple of guidelines- Professor Tracy gives you such a great toolkit and framework while allowing maximum creativity. So so so highly recommend- on of my favorite courses by far! "
