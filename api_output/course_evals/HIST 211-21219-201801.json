            "\u00a0I'm not primarily interested in this section of history, but this course gave me a lot of important background information, especially as relates to politically- fueled religion. I feel better equipped now to examine European polity interactions in the later centuries. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about medieval history, especially in areas I would have never thought about on my own to learn about. ",
            "\u00a0historical analysis, learned how to engage with primary and secondary sources ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about the formation of early modern European economies, as well as more about the social structures in Medieval Europe. It was a very enjoyable class to be a part of. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an in-depth understanding of life in medieval Europe and enhanced my document analysis skills through close reading of primary source texts. Because of my interest in gender studies, I had the freedom to further my knowledge in the field by exploring its intersection with medieval society. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of the Middle Ages and the lifestyle and culture of Medieval Europeans. Topics included the relationship between church and state, the crusades, Black Death, feudalism, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Medieval history ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the Middle Ages, and I developed my research and writing skills, especially when analyzing primary sources documents. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the predominant themes and milestones of medieval European history, which I feel have given me deeper insight on the following ~500 years of European and world history, politics, and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I discerned important historical trends of the Middle Ages and how they contributed to the Renaissance and future time periods. I learned how the Crusades and the Conflicts of Church and State shaped Medieval Politics. I realized how the businesses of Medieval Europe first developed the fundamentals of modern business: contracts, shares, insurance, interest, and banking. States began emerging because Learning moved from Monasteries to Universities which helped improve the administration of the government, as well as the Church. A great course if you are interested in European History or anything above. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good introductory historical framework and a lot of substantive stuff about European history. ",
            "\u00a0Improved knowledge of Europe from 1000-1500. I also improved my understanding of events in Europe that lead to the state of the world today. ",
            "\u00a0Very good. Really great overview of Medieval Europe. Paul Friedman is amazing. I think hes so engaging, funny, and makes the material so interesting. ",

            "\u00a0This course was pretty expansive and comprehensive, and I appreciated the attention to social history. However there was very little attention paid to women throughout the entire class, and I think some of the lectures could be swapped out for an examination of women in this time period, like Eleanor of Aquitaine or Blanche, in a more in-depth fashion. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of the course is Professor Freedmans limitless enthusiasm for the course material and his wealth of knowledge. One weakness is the organization - the course often jumped around thematically and chronologically, which made it somewhat hard to study for / understand. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I think it lecture notes were given out going over the agenda for the day, that would be super beneficial to students to better understand what exactly the take-aways should be from lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I felt lectures could have been made more engaging with a PowerPoint or some other multimedia presentation. Professor Freedman is a fabulous lecturer, but slides with images and the occasional date or name (sometimes hard to follow, especially when difficult to spell or remember) would be immensely helpful and certainly enhance the classroom experience. ",
            "\u00a0The course could use a little thematic focusing so as to construct a more coherent narrative of what's actually going on between the course dates - at the start of the syllabus we have a very good idea of what's happening (Empire-Papacy struggles & differently-minded reformers within the Church) and who the major players are in the growth of states (England, France, Spain, & Flanders lectures especially, but we definitely could have used more of those), but moving into the back half of the course it sort of becomes decoherent. May be best to put lectures on thematic aspects of culture/economics/academics/law nearer the beginning of the course so that material about those can be incorporated when talking about the actual major players in the high middle ages. ",
            "\u00a0Almost no weaknesses! Well-organized course with interesting readings and lectures. This course changed my outlook on the Middle Ages and history in general, especially the information about the Catholic church and peasant life. The hardest part is the 10-15 page paper due the week before reading week combined with a final during finals period but in the end I found it to be manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Great content, great lecturer!  Would love more in-depth looks at many of the topics though ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely enjoyable, and I attended every lecture because I found it fascinating and engaging. It's clear Prof. Freedman has been doing this a while, and he has perfected it-- I have no criticism to give that should really be taken into account. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed the format, pace, and topics of the lectures and sections, and don't see any glaring weaknesses to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0I think the Birth of Europe was a great history course. The readings were not extensive and fit-in very well with lectures and sections. The Exams were fair. I do not see any weaknesses in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Ugh at 10:30- aka too early ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very engaging and the workload and readings were manageable ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this class, Professor Freedman is a very knowledgable lecturer and he struck a really nice balance between talking about learning/culture, church/state relationships, social aspects and the politics of the Middle Ages. I don't think it can really be improved much. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main strengths of this course was Professor Freedman, whom I will discuss in more detail later. Another is just the body of knowledge itself - I think that the Middle Ages is under-studied in today's day and age, and that is a real shame. I appreciated that the course comprehensively sketched the latter half of the Middle Ages, the half closer to and more relevant to the modern era. The assignments were also reasonable, two papers and two exams. I think the main weakness of the course was the amount of reading. Some weeks the reading was rather reasonable, and I appreciated certain primary sources, especially Lancelot. But there are a few readings that felt unnecessary, and these were often the longer ones. I got practically nothing out of the murder of Charles the Good. Hatcher's Black Death, while interesting, was incredibly long, and the same ideas could've been conveyed in lecture or in a far shorter reading. Finally, while I appreciate reading primary sources in Tierney, far too many were assigned on a given week - because they are so dense it takes a long time to read just a single page. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you're a history major or genuinely very interested in this material. It can be a little dry at times although Professor Freedman's lectures are entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0This was basically AP Euro. Take that as you will. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Birth of Europe is great, and I definitely learned a lot about the late Middle Ages and how the beginnings of what we know today as Europe came to be. Professor Freedman is a fantastic lecturer, and you really feel like youre being immersed in medieval society just by listening to him. The course has a midterm, final, short paper (5 pages), and an open ended longer research paper (10-12 pages), which is pretty reasonable. One thing to be aware of is that the course jumps around chronologically and thematically, so it takes some extra effort to study for. Everyone in the Middle Ages also seems to be named Henry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it has very engaging lectures and you come out learning a lot about medieval history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great survey course on medieval history ",
            "\u00a0I would. But I would again stress that the class could be improved if a short list of notes or ID's were passed out or sent out via email for each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Would certainly recommend to anyone interested in medieval Europe! This course will offer you a broad survey of the period and you will emerge very knowledgeable in the field. The readings Prof Freedman assigns are all very interesting -- especially the primary source texts. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course is excellent, especially if you like history and/or the Middle Ages. I took it for fun as a CS major and I really liked it. I will say it takes time to do all the readings, and some of them aren't as interesting as others, but I don't think the reading load is that unreasonable. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to take a quintessential Yale course, take the Birth of Europe with Professor Freedman. Not only does Professor Freedman make the subject matter fascinating with his lecture style, but the readings were selected to be interesting in addition to being informative. Even as a history major, rare is it that I actually look forward to doing the readings for a class. We also did a research paper ona . topic of our choice, which was difficult at first, but was definitely helpful in improving my writing and research abilities. While this course is fantastic, you will need to put in the work. Pay attention to when papers and assignments are due, and you'll do well! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any Yale student, regardless of major, with an interest in European history and politics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! As my first History Course at Yale, I thought the Birth of Europe was wonderful! There is a good spread of age, level, and interests in the class. Especially if you like the time period, you will find the readings interesting. Though it is an exam and paper class, the weekly workload is just the readings, which are frequently less than 100 pages, so the extra time on the essays really is not too bad. the Course was very well taught, with lectures strongly reinforcing the reading. Sections kept us up-to-date on the main take-away of the week, and the professor and TFs are extremely knowledgeable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course is engaging and taught well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Medieval Europe is so important and you should take this class to learn why! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in history ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. It provides an illuminating view into the medieval world at a critical time, and provides a balanced (for the most part) account of the events that occurred. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, the material is interesting, Professor Freedman is beyond engaging as a lecturer, and the Teaching Fellows were extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fascinating look at a period that is rarely covered in Yale history courses and does a nice job balancing between regions and aspects of Medieval History. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in history, particularly Western/European history. The Middle Ages is an important period of history that is not studied enough frankly. I will say though that someone with no interest in history will probably not enjoy this course. "
