            "\u00a0Techniques and applications related to spectral theory, banach spaces, and hilbert spaces. Different topologies such as strong, weak, and weak* topology. Different operators and functional spaces. Compact operators, bounded operators, and also dual spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of functional analysis and spectral theory ",
            "\u00a0So much. A whirlwind tour of things anybody aspiring towards higher mathematics (applied, stats, pure, you name it) ought to know. Impeccably crafted course which built on itself very naturally without eliding crucial details. Very well-designed to maximize student learning; very few wild goose chases trying to work though abbreviated proofs. Cannot recommend highly enough if taught by Hoskins. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a LOT of functional analysis - Banach/Hilbert spaces, Hahn-Banach theorem, projection theorem, dual spaces, weak and weak* topologies, Baire category theorem, compact operators, Fredholm operators, spectral theory...and I probably forgot to list a few. Also gained greater familiarity with some standard proof techniques in the field, and how some of these areas connect to applications. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a good deal about functional analysis. I also realized just how damn hard upper-level math can be. "

            "\u00a0It was wonderful with good problem sets, lectures and a quick pace ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n1. Quality of instructor. Professor Hoskins was outstanding: charming, clear, invariably well prepared and always accessible to students. His objective was clearly to impart the material, not to flaunt his (considerable) intelligence and/or impose draconian course policies.\r\n2. Use of Examples in class. Some people didn't like the PDE examples (I did), but more broadly, Professor Hoskins really grounded the often head-spinningly abstract material in real-world spaces and settings. Intuition, while it must be held accountable to mathematical rigor, is crucial, at least in my experience, and the examples helped develop it.\r\n3. Exams. For whatever reason, once you get passed the 300 level, math classes stop giving regular exams. This is to the department's detriment. Having 2 midterms really motivated me to keep pace with the material and upped the amount of information I will take from the course.\r\n\r\nI struggle to think of significant ways to improve the course. It is undoubtedly one of the two most useful/well-executed courses I have taken in the department, and I've taken about 10 or 11. The material from the course was very self-contained, so it wasn't a huge problem that we often jumped across texts, but occasionally it would have been useful to have been directed towards the textbook which most closely hewed to the presentation of a given unit. ",
            "\u00a0This course was almost all strength, largely owing to Professor Hoskins' excellent teaching. The material is coherent, interesting, and challenging. Problem sets were challenging but appropriate, and same with exams. If anything, sometimes the material felt too rushed, because we truly covered a lot in one semester -- it might be worth excising some of the minor asides (just spitballing: polar bodies, or some of the final continuous spectral approximation/calculus? business), to spend more time on the important topics. There were just a few too many exercises left to the class for my taste, but maybe I'm being picky. It's also not the case that everyone in the class has taken, or remembers, PDEs and measure theory, which might be good to keep in mind in the future. Overall: amazing course still! ",
            "\u00a0Organization could be better and problem sets could probably afford to be shorter. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in higher level mathematics, moreover their applications to the real world, functional analysis is a must take. The techniques and ideas you learn in this course are essential to many fields of study. This is the course where you will finally understand Hilbert Spaces which are immensely important in physics and chemistry. Moreover, fourier series, while not explicitly covered are discussed and many techniques that can be applied to them are discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Hoskins is great and the material is very interesting and useful for many further parts of analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Undoubtedly. If you're a math major, have succeeded in other analysis courses, and intend to pursue any higher STEM education, this course is a no-brainer. It's the nuts-and-bolts of a ton of higher-level math. If you can take it with Hoskins, all the better. It's a lot of work, so don't take it lightly, but the material is objectively beautiful - get ready to do linear algebra in infinite dimensions. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. It's a lot of work, but (1) is very cool, (2) has clear applications, and (3) if taught by Professor Hoskins, is guaranteed to be excellent. You should be very comfortable with analysis, proofs, and filling in the gaps yourself. ",
            "\u00a0Functional analysis is really cool, so if you're interested in general vector spaces and linear operators on them, give it a try. Do be warned that it's very hard, so if you're taking it make sure you have enough time and energy in your semester to dedicate to understanding the material. "
