            "\u00a0The syllabus was often hard to dissect. And the rescheduling of multiple classes made it all the messier. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot stress enough how confusing and difficult the syllabus is to read. It is my understanding that it has been attempted to be changed by TAs and nothing has stuck. I strongly encourage a redo of the syllabus for a more typical structure and style. ",
            "\u00a0The way the syllabus is laid out is very confusing, especially when it needed to be adjusted. I understand the desire to split it as two classes for one session, but it is unnecessary and makes it more confusing than needed. "

            "\u00a0Andy is very knowledgable about how NYC works. While that is okay, it would be really nice have more examples and general awareness of the country at large. When we checked in about what was happening in the world of theater, it was always what was in the New York Times or on Broadway. Students would have to bring up things outside of New York. It might be worth surveying the class to see where they might want to work in the future and do a little bit of crowd sourcing about fundraising as it relates to those areas. ",
            "\u00a0The class moved very slowly without matching depth, so it was difficult to parse what was actually central/key. There was also a dissonance between the progression of assignments and progression of classes. We were frequently asked to do assignments about material we had not yet covered. (And while this is sometimes effective, in this case it felt more like a failure in planning.) We also had an inconsistent schedule, due to a mistake on Andy's end. And while I understand that it had to be remedied, it was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0It felt often that Andy relied on his students to do the most teaching in discussions as opposed to lecturing us himself. ",
            "\u00a0Andy was prepared and willing to answer questions as they came up. The course seemed to focus a lot on New York specific topics, which was not helpful for those us not aiming to work in New York. It would have been helpful to go over more general grants and topics than using New York as the main example. "

            "\u00a0It was good to have a class to get the general run down of how development works in theater. That being said, we were often asked to do tasks like write letters for different groups of people without having much of anything for reference of how to tackle these assignments. They made them extremely difficult to do and I couldn't figure out why we had to do them before we learned about how to do it versus being taught how something like how a foundation letter should be written then being tasked to write one. \r\n\r\nAlso, I want to say that I do not understand why we have to watch each other give our pitches to Andy in our final class. He didn't give feedback between them so I do not know what I was learning from watching. It was extremely awkward and uncomfortable and it felt like that was on purpose but I don't know why. Also, one longer pitch would be preferable to two shorter pitches. Trying to do even one when we haven't been taught how to do them in 7-10 minutes was stressful enough so doing two was difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I frequently felt that there wasn't room for me to apply the learning outside of the direct circumstances Andy was describing / with which he had experience. This made the content less useful, and the classes more frustrating. It felt as though Andy was more interested in making us effective in one very specific environment, rather than the field overall. ",
            "\u00a0It was very surface level, I don't know if I truly learned anything that may be useful to me in a future career. ",
            "\u00a0The classes seem to mostly feel like a discussion rather than teaching us about the material. As our assignments often were related to the next week's discussion, I felt as though I had to teach myself a lot of the material. As I did not have much exposure to Development, it has challenging to do some of the homework assignments with little to no exposure to the types of writing and forms we needed to do to complete it. While this is not a grant writing class, I would have greatly benefited from going over tips for completing development writing, as our assignments required us to do that. "

            "\u00a0Simpler and clearer assignments. Clearer syllabus. Assignments in response to classroom content rather than anticipating it. ",
            "\u00a0Please please please revamp the syllabus, please don't have students create their own theater, please don't require all students to sit in the room on the final presentation day to watch everyone else's presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Creating our own theater companies provided challenges that made it difficult to truly complete the assignments. I found myself spending more time making up details for the theater rather than focusing on the true purpose of the assignment. I would have benefitted more by using an existing company and crafting language around it for the grants. Assignments like creating the board was a useful exercise with the made-up theater company. Writing an individual letter and the foundation/corporate grants were hard to truly complete because of the amount of details that had to be made up. To really craft the language and programming for the grants would have been helpful to have a base line of a true company. "
