            "\u00a0Even as a senior English major I learned so much about close reading and crafting an argument. Professor Brisman is a classic professor, super old school and so so helpful. I learned about the history of the Bible and biblical scholarship. ",
            "\u00a0Mr. Brisman's ability to put different passages within the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, and, at times, between both cannons, in conversation with each other was compelling and instructive. He also offered remarkably helpful  albeit occasionally harsh feedback on our writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is the most intellectually challenging course I have ever taken at Yale. Professor Brisman, who has been teaching the class for over 40 years, has a precise agenda for every single class and every single passage we discuss. By narrowly focusing on differences in biblical translations and multivocality, I constantly asked myself if my interpretation made sense, and whether it would change if I considered a similar passage, or read a key word in a different way. I also learned that Some Matters of Form is the other Bible of this course. It is crucial. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deeper knowledge not only of the Bible as a group of texts, but also of how to read the Bible (and even, more broadly speaking, of how to read in general). I learned how to hear different voices speaking through a composite text, disagreeing and mingling with each other. I now have both a sense of  the greatness and fascination of the Bible, and of how to interpret and question it. ",
            "\u00a0Besides learning a ton about the English Bible, one of the most important skills we developed in this course was close comparison of two different translations of the same passage. We examined how minute differences in translation can have an enormous effect on meaning, and these changes can carry big consequences. We learned a really incredible amount about the collection of the different parts the Bible, as well as how their redaction has come to affect how we understand different elements of religion today. All in all really amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0I became a more creative reader and a more careful writer. Professor Brisman models literary analysis that is innovative and surprising without sacrificing any rigor. I also gained a deeper understanding of texts whose patterns and figures feature in much of the Western canon. The themes of the class will continue to inform my reading. "

            "\u00a0It's the best class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: everyone should study the Bible, and, regardless of your level of familiarity with it, you'll learn something new from the class. Mr. Brisman is an excellent teacher who seems to genuinely care about his students.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: it's a very strong course, overall. I would probably have substituted Ezekiel or Jeremiah for the Psalms and tried to squeeze a class on Leviticus in there somewhere. I know Mr. Brisman is more inclined towards engaging with biblical narratives, but some understanding of ritual law is critical to an informed reading of the rest of the text, and, without it, Luke et. al's representation of the law as cold, unimportant, and unfeeling doesn't get meaningfully counterbalanced. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: efficient class agenda, engaging class discussion, and challenging essay assignments. Weaknesses, or, should I say, improvements, to be made: I would appreciate a few more shorter assignments like reading responses, and/or class discussions that depended more heavily on what we learned about the documentary hypothesis or the synoptic problem. ",
            "\u00a0This is a wonderful course which teaches a wide array of skills and which deepens one's life. One of the best classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the essays seemed to be assigned on relatively short notice, but had I been a little more on top of the syllabus it probably would not have been an issue. If you take this class, make sure you check carefully when the assignments are due, because the professor rarely reminded us about them in class (that being said, he was extremely responsive when asked directly about the essays/writing assignments). ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus has been carefully crafted and revised over many years, and class discussions were always fascinating. The number of writing assignments is greater than in many other literature classes, but this facilitated my understanding of the texts as I read rather than hindering my ability to read as thoroughly. One suggestion about logistics: sometimes the essay topics were not handed out far enough in advance and deadlines had to be extended. To avoid confusion over deadlines, it would be better to hand them out further in advance or at least announce when they'd be sent out, so that students could plan better. "

            "\u00a0Guys. Take. This. Class. I could have failed this class for all I know (grades are available upon request, but are you really gonna ask?). It doesn't matter to me at all. This class is so fun, and I learned so much. I would go into class thinking I understood all the reading and knew all there was to know, and Professor Brisman consistently blew my mind. He knows the text inside and out. The seminar is taught kind of lecture style, and then Professor Brisman will pose a question and we discuss and make our best guesses until he'll reveal the answer or congratulate someone on getting it right. It's awesome and fun, and we avoid people just talking out of their butts for a participation grade (you know who you are). Professor Brisman, like Jesus himself, will often teach in parables and metaphor, and he connects to politics and current events. This is not a religious class, but some sessions felt like a religious experience. I was legitimately moved by some of the things we discussed. What a rich text! What a profound history! I knew some of the Old Testament, but this class taught me a million new things. I'm so happy I'm more familiar with this text, and the workload was so so so manageable. It's three short papers, but Professor Brisman is the most generous with deadlines of any professor I've encountered at Yale. I said some Stupid Things in this class, wrote a terrible paper, and had to read Paul talk smack about women for paragraphs and paragraphs and STILL this was maybe my favorite class I've taken. Take it. Just do it. Don't miss out. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this course if you want to discuss the Bible in an academic context, develop and refine your analytical skills, and write some killer essays. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely would. This should be a foundational course. It familiarizes you with one of the bedrocks of Western Literature, hones your critical thought, and deepens your life by connecting you with ancient and powerful texts. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. The Bible has had such a massive influence on Western literature, and this class will help you understand so many allusions and references you may have been missing your whole life. If you want to learn what the Bible is all about, this class will do it. This class is also unique enough that even someone who has studied the Bible in depth would find it very interesting and challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. You don't need to be particularly excited about or familiar with the Bible beforehand to love this class. You'll get excited and familiar if you do the readings and prepare well for each class. (It generally is a small class, so each student's engagement is important.) Professor Brisman does assign more writing than many other English professors do, so if you expect a heavy course load, this may not be the right choice. Taken in the right semester, this course will improve your writing and spark your imagination. "
