            "\u00a0I learned how to be extremely bored in a classroom three times a week and still have the tenacity to show up. I also learned how to be talked at by a professor all class with no variation in tone or queries for student input. ",

            "\u00a0I learned the conceptual background, including rationale for technological improvements over time, for NMR, ESR/EPR, MS, X-ray crystallography, microwave spectroscopy, and IR. I also feel more comfortable learning how to predict NMR spectra for first order cases and understand the advantages and disadvantages of each type of spectroscopy in addition to the theory behind them.

            "\u00a0This course covers an extremely important topic in science in a terribly ineffective way. The material needs to be presented in a way that is more clear and applicable to students, instead of being told as a series of historical anecdotes that have nothing to do with the way spectroscopy is used today. ",
            "\u00a0weaknesses: read from the lecture slides. strengths: easy ",
            "\u00a0The class  usually considered an easy Chemistry spring elective  was quite hard this year because the midterm was unreasonably hard. The class is also incredibly boring and I could never pay attention to anything. However, the Chemistry department sets a pretty low bar (please dont major in Chemistry) so this is still a good deal.\r\n\r\nInstructor:\r\n\tProfessor Saunders is sweet, smart and hardworking. He can teach very well if you ask him one-on-one and give him a chance. He is incredibly insightful given his endless years of experience in math, science and Yale. He is a bit of a childhood genius so definitely pick his brain!\r\n\tUnfortunately, he is not the best lecturer and I was asleep in several classes / it is impossible to not be. Everyone else was on their phones/laptops or doodling on their notebooks\r\nAssignments:\r\n\tThe class had one problem set that was never checked. It was quite difficult and nothing in it was ever taught during lecture. I never did it\r\n\tThere was one exam that had 3 questions. At first glance, I could do zero of the three questions even though I prepared extensively and knew his slides cold. It felt like the ultimate waste of effort and an insult to ones intelligence. The class is so random and unpredictable that it is tragic\r\n\tThere is a final exam where you have an interesting conversation mostly of your choosing with Professor Saunders and he asks you about your life\r\n\tClearly the class has incredibly low workload but it is a blackbox and can be a serious hit or miss. Would one really want an A-/B+/B in this class? Would you really want your hard work to be of zero use?\r\nContent (lectures):\r\n\tThe lecture slides are sadly a disaster. Slides are a visual medium. They cannot be just sentences and walls of text. That is pedagogy 101. I cannot believe no one in the Chemistry department has intervened. Extremely visual concepts (spectra, trends, molecules (hard names)) are all only explained in text and for me, were impossible to understand. Everything had to be Googled and the internet does not have a lot of information about things like advanced 3D NMR\r\n\tIt is impossible to not fall asleep with the black and white monotony that are the slides "
