            "\u00a0Learning to critically examine and work with archival documents, and also learned the fundamentals of writing a biographer. Considered the moral implications of writing a biography as well as the practical how-to's. ",
            "\u00a0Gaddis emphasized good writing techniques in a way that I have never experienced at Yale. This was incredibly useful! ",
            "\u00a0I think my writing skills improved. ",
            "\u00a0Even though practical in-class discussions of researching a biography were fairly limited, the experience of spending a lot of time in the Beinecke digging through papers to weave into a narrative was invaluable, and I (unexpectedly) felt prepared to do it.\r\n\r\nAlso, Ill treasure the writing checklist! ",
            "\u00a0This course offers insight into performing rigorous research, storytelling, and understanding how imagination and reality come together when writing history. It demands and develops the analytical eye of the historian as well as the creativity and sense for drama of the novelist. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the opportunity to really dive into the archival resources Yale has to offer. If you love to write like I do, the opportunity to write a big biography for a class is actually a really fun challenge and was a strength of this class. Great reading (1 biography/week).\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion. I don't know if people were just scared of Gaddis, quiet, never did the reading or what, but the discussions in this class were really weak. Don't take this class if you need to have mindblowing discussions every week. Gaddis doesn't seem to care a whole lot about his individual students and can create sort of a tense seminar environment so that's definitely something to consider. For me, it was worth it to get to learn about biography from him and to write my own, but he is a divisive personality for sure and not a gifted seminar leader. Maybe it wasn't all his fault though. Maybe my class was just really quiet or something, but the conversations were horribly boring at times. ",
            "\u00a0Really loved the books ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Gaddis is brilliant, format is really smart, books are on point. Its also just cool to write a biography.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there were a lot of classes that I left wishing Id heard just a bit more of what Gaddis thought and a bit less of what my classmates had to say. Its wonderful that he wants to hear from us, but I want to hear from him, too! ",
            "\u00a0This course has been tested and sharpened by time, but has in no way remained static. It is a \"classic\" that engages with timeless themes without ignoring the present. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, but with the warning that class discussions will not be the best part of the class. For me, my favorite parts were actually outside of the class in the Beinecke and writing my biography. Take it for the chance to talk about biography with a Pulitzer-prize winning biographer, to do your own research, etc. but don't have \"great seminar discussion\" be your main incentive for taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is basically a book club with John Gaddis. You read a biography each week, talk about it, compare it with the other books you've read for the class. The discussions were often interesting, but we didn't talk much about the actual mechanics of writing a biography. Professor Gaddis is an amazing man, and getting to take a seminar with him was a great experience- but the seminar was not exactly suited towards maximum learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The syllabus was well thought out, and I was truly engaged by every book this semester. The autobiography we had to write at the beginning of the semester was one of the most interesting and thought provoking assignments I have done at Yale. The final paper, a biography, was a hefty assignment, but was very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was interesting and unique. ",
            "\u00a0Totally! Make sure youre up for the tasks at hand (both the reading and the writing), but if you have the time, definitely take it. Its not as hard as folks make it out to be and is one of those classes that youll just regret not taking. ",
            "\u00a0This is not a course for the faint of heart, but any student serious about history or writing should it. This course does not just teach the art of biography  it teachers the art of good writing, archival research, and storytelling. It is all the while engaging and full of energy. It is an incredible learning experience full of great stories. This is one of the best courses offered in Yale College. ",
            "\u00a0Take it if you are prepared to invest your heart and soul and a lot of time into the final project. I took it in spite of a busy season for extra-curriculars, and was left a bit disappointed at the project not turning out quite as well-polished and 'great' as it should have been. If you do take it, you will love the class itself (the project is done entirely on your own time, so the seminar is a relatively separate experience). Don't expect a technical seminar on biographyit's really just a book club where you get the chance to join Gaddis in some indulgent pontifications. If that sounds cool to you, you'll enjoy it. "
