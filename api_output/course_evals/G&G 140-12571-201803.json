Calculations on atmosphere (mass of atmosphere, concentration of pollutants), oceans (Ekman balance, sea ice melting), energy (power of hydroelectric plants, solar flux) ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about earth systems, physical processes of the atmosphere and ocean, and general facts and information about climate. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a very thorough, comprehensive, yet accessible understanding of the physical and chemical processes that constitute the atmosphere and ocean. These ideas were then combined in the last portion of the course with understandings of climate change policy, renewable energy, and the science of greenhouse gasses. After this course I definitely improved my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, and I feel confident in performing the math behind the models of the atmosphere and ocean. ",
            "\u00a0The class provided a strong overview of atmospheric and oceanic science, without delving into great detail in any one area. The class incorporated basic algebra to help demonstrate the relationships between certain variables. ",

            "\u00a0Because of this course, Id say Ive gained a very good (though not mathematically detailed) understanding of the atmosphere, oceans, and their general circulation about our planet, along with the general characteristics and drivers of climate and seasons.\r\n\r\nI also learned that, because of adiabatic cooling, air doesnt rise very far in our atmosphere it it's only HOT, which is cool.

            "\u00a0The content of this course is very interesting and important. However, there is a strange balance between learning to perform rudimentary calculations and thorough conceptual mastery and understanding. I think the class would benefit from focusing more on the latter, however I understand that this course has been taught for many years and that to overhaul it would require a lot of effort. I heard that last year this class was taught with a required lab. I think it was much better to not have to take the lab, according to the experiences of several of my friends who have taken Atmosphere and Ocean in the past with the lab. Finally, although the topics of the course are all very important, there is simply WAY too much jammed in to one semester for there to be deep and adequate understanding. ",
            "\u00a0the course material itself if the strength, because it's all really interesting AND important; the weakness is the assessment of understanding these dynamic processes. all of the empirical formulas and information given in lecture have no corresponding systematized materials, and that would have been very helpful. grading is really subjective even though we are learning \"objective\" facts about earth science ",
            "\u00a0I think that the problem sets (and to a lesser extent the test questions) were graded rather harshly. It seemed like they were looking for a couple key words instead of grasp on the overall concept. The calculations were rather simple which meant they couldn't compensate for marks missed on conceptual questions. Professor Smith is a good lecturer and taught the material in a way so that all things in the course were interrelated. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent overview of the atmosphere, ocean, and climate change. It is very well organized and gives a good mix of general information and some trickier physical concepts. The combination of powerpoint presentations, demonstrations, and work in the whiteboard was great. I do think that grading started out quite easy at the beginning of the term and got progressively harder even though the quality of the submitted work was the same or higher, so it didn't really reflect how much I felt like I was learning and taking away from the course. ",
            "\u00a0The best strength was definitely the amount of engagement we had with practice problems each class period, allowing us to be more comfortable with the material. Outside help was also accessible through office hours and a video series of open lectures from a previous year (2011). \r\n\r\nThis class did not have glaring weaknesses that I could see. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was engaging, especially when working through problems. More demonstrations could be utilized. The problem sets were very helpful for learning the content. The second-half of the course was less engaging than the first. The shift to powerpoints and away from drawing out diagrams and equations on the board was unfortunate because it turned into mostly just reading off the slides. Also, I think the content on atmosphere, and ocean to a lesser extent, were much stronger than the rapid-fire topics that we only spent a class on (ie. population, energy). These secondary topics felt somewhat off-topic and more like an environmental studies course, especially because we didn't cover material that was new to students. The grading in this class was much harsher than I expected. Unless you can explain concepts exactly how the professor had in mind, points will be docked from p-sets and tests, and there is no curve despite low class averages. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture slides were very detailed and the lectures were very interesting. I found that the board work also helped me better understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are a little dry, and the textbook and lecture dont align. ",
            "\u00a0It had a very nice structure of the course but the exam questions and grading were very hard and unfair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: perhaps one of the best taught classes I have ever taken at Yale. \r\nWeaknesses: The grading is way too harsh, and considering that the class did not find out the grades weren't curved until the day before the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The material is great, and Professor Smith does a good job of presenting it.\r\n\r\nMy only suggestion is that Prof Smith (or whoever teaches the class after his retirement) HAS to include units in their calculations on the board.\r\n\r\nWhile the professor might have been using the same constants and equations in a class like this for the past 30 years, its often the first time (or the first time in years) students have seen these equations and constants. Unit-checking provides a valuable way for them to verify that the equations make sense and that the constants theyre using are correct. ",

            "\u00a0I think students should be familiar with the material taught in this class, which covers everything from meteorology and air pollution to climate change and ocean dynamics. However, because of the broad nature of the course, there is little time and room to acquire a deep understanding of the material taught. There is simply way too much that is jammed into the course. The grading of the problem sets and exams is pretty harsh and sometimes felt arbitrary (-6 points for getting a sign wrong). The exams are very long and do not test for understanding as much as massive memorization/ability to perform basic calculations. Probably the greatest weakness of the course is that the TAs did not seem to have a lot of prior experience with the course content at all, which was unfortunate, and was also evident in the grading. The professor, however, is clearly very experienced, knowledgeable, and generally explains things in a clear manner. Overall, though, I did learn a lot from this course. I would recommend it to G&G and EVST majors for whom it is required as it is a considerable amount of work for students with merely a passing interest in the atmospheric, oceanic and climate sciences. Be sure to be extremely detail-oriented in this course, as missing very small, arbitrary things can have a significant effect on your grade that unfortunately may not be reflective of the effort you put into learning. ",
            "\u00a0not if there aren't more resources invested in student learning, such as bringing back a lab or section (this was the first year without one?). I would recommend there be revise and resubmit options or extra credit exercises. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! If you like science in any way, this class is good for you. The material is very interesting and Professor Smith is great. My one complaint would be that some of the short answer questions felt like they were looking for a specific word or phrasing and if you didn't have it you got marks taken off even if you understood the concept. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This class was a great introduction to and overview of these topics. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this class is very informative and allows students to see the dynamic physical and chemical interactions that exist in the air and water we rely on, highlighting the critical importance of these environments. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very good explanations on important topics about weather and climate. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good class that helped me understand all the systems that create the atmospheric conditions we take for granted. It has caused me to look at clouds more and consider weather maps to wonder how certain events are happening. It's an important base for more complex atmosphere or ocean classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I found the lectures to be very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it as the knowledge I acquired is vital not only for anyone interested in environment but also for all humans that would like to be engaged with the world around them ",
            "\u00a0No ",
            "\u00a0I would. I think the course does a LOT to develop ones intuition for how the atmospheres and oceans move and why they do it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the student knows theyre particularly weak in mathematics (and have forgotten much of basic calculus), I wouldnt encourage them to think of it as an easy QR.\r\n\r\nOne other piece of advice would be that Professor Smith's office hours are GREAT  pleasant, helpful, and if one is really interested in atmospheric science, VERY interesting.
