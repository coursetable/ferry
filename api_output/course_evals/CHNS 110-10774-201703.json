            "\u00a0This was one of the most value adding courses at Yale so far. All the professors were amazing. However, I was more focused on learning to speak Chinese than to learn to read and write. Perhaps there could be a possibility of offering a separate course only focused on speaking and listening (assuming that there are other students also interested in this)? "

            "\u00a0yes!!!! this class was organized extremely well and taught in a way that was clear and made sense.  there were tons of opportunities for one-on-one practice and the teachers really do want you to learn! they are all really kind and funny and are not afraid to correct you! definitely worth the high work load ",
            "\u00a0If you're a student interested in learning Chinese, I highly recommend this course! It is well organized and well taught, but be sure to prepare yourself for the rigorous workload and fast-paced learning. You have to really commit yourself to CHNS 110 to get a lot out of it. But the reward that comes with making progress in Chinese is so satisfying! ",
