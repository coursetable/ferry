This course is essentially a Calculus II curriculum, with math 112 being Calculus I. I learned about more complicated subjects in calculus, including how to solve more complicated integrals, sums and series, and polar coordinates. "

            "\u00a0A strength of this course is the order in which the material is taught. ",
            "\u00a0This course equipped me with many techniques for integration and series evaluation. The explorations helped me to understand the proofs/basis for many concepts we learned. However, I think they should be optional, as many explorations were redundant to the course text. Also, polar coordinates and parametric equations should be discussed much more thoroughly and much earlier in the course. It is a huge shift from thinking in cartesian, unparameterized coordinates to thinking in polar and parameterized coordinates. When studying for the final exam, I discovered so much more depth to polars and parametrics than what was discussed in lecture and on psets. ",

In contrast, Abbythe peer tutorwas literally the only good part of MATH 115. I learned a lot more from her during peer tutoring hours than I ever did from going to class. ",

            "\u00a0I think the course could be improved by spending more class time on the theory behind the concepts, instead of simply focusing on practice questions. I do not necessarily think a flipped classroom is a great way to teach calculus, and I would have enjoyed going over both concepts and doing practice questions. Dr. Rosenthal did a good job of trying to do both, but I still would have enjoyed more explanation before the practice instead of explanation during the problems. "
