            "\u00a0I developed much stronger writing skills and a greater ability to bring sources into conversation in my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely got better at writing.I also, maybe more importantly, learned what Yale was expecting from me, as well as built confidence in my ability to write analytical essays here. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned to write academic papers through putting different sources together and analyzing them. I have also learned how to garner sources for a research and how to present my argument effectively. ",
            "\u00a0This class was instrumental to my career at Yale. It taught me how to write an essay that is college level rather than high school level. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to build an argument and provide structure to my essays. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course certainly elevated my writing skills and has prepared for writing lengthy college papers. To be more specific, its made my writing more persuasive and has helped me to make my writing concise yet very meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0This course is really great for developing writing skills needed throughout the rest of your time at Yale. Though it depends on the section you are in, overall its a good writing credit and a very interactive class. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about education and the forces that work behind the education system. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a new perspective about college writing, especially about how to structure my arguments in a way to both innovate and create an impact on the reader. ",
            "\u00a0This class really helped practice your ability to analyze some higher level texts at first, but as the course went on the readings got much easier. The course also provided a lot of insight into many different perspectives on higher education. It challenged you come to also come up with your own ideas and opinions and question the practices of Yale. The course also really improved my writing and seminar discussions. Overall, it was a very good introductory course to take. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I have explored many readings discussing the American higher education system, both as an institution of individual organizations as well as a unified philosophy. This course has taught me both how to read through academic papers as well as how to construct effective arguments by synthesizing sources and working through the writing process. I also have a better understanding of the way that the educational system works, and also how it connects to our own university. Some of these topics include the political implications of different curricula, as well as the origins of the economic aspects of the education system. Additionally, as expected from any introductory writing class, I benefited from a thorough discussion of writing techniques, both mechanical and stylistic. "

            "\u00a0I found the writing instruction to be strong, but at times the class itself was boring. I think student engagement was a challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked this course. It was definitely a lot of reading, and I guess I wished we'd focus a little more on writing. With that said, we got a lot of great feedback on our writing, so I can't really complain about that. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies within the teacher's feedback as it provides specific advice. The subjectivity of grading is probably the courses greatest weakness. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely helpful for people who are specifically looking to improve their writing and it accomplishes this task very well. It is not the best option for those who are simply looking to fulfill their writing credit. It requires serious work. ",
            "\u00a0This course really allowed me to develop my writing skills and get used to writing papers frequently, especially argumentative ones. However, at times it got a bit tedious since it is a course made for teaching writing skills and wasnt the most exciting at times. ",
            "\u00a0The seminar size of the course was effective for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths are Prof. Krontiris' ability to structure classes really well, prompt interesting, lively discussions and provide students with excellent feedback. There were few weaknesses in the course, but I think it could be improved if the deadlines for sending out the grades were respected. ",
            "\u00a0The course was much more geared toward discussions on higher education than improving writing, most of the time this was a good thing because every individual in the class had different areas they needed to improve on. The only time allotted to improving your writing was office hours with lizzie, and peer reviewed feedback on your essays. There were a lot of readings in the class and the level of engagement in them was very high at first, but as the semester went on gradually decreased and you could tell by the class discussions. The strengths of this course was the interesting readings we had that led to great discussions, the small class size, and the feedback on assignments. This class could be improved with less assigned readings and allowing students to talk about some of the information they found during the essay research to class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The readings were very insightful. The class was well-organized, particularly in its structure. Each reading built off of prior readings and contributed towards forming the overall structure of the class. Lizzie was also keen to point this out, and many of the assignments actually focused on synthesizing different readings.\r\nWeaknesses: At times, the readings were a little dry. Also, I felt that the scope of the course was slightly limited (but not particularly so for an English 114 class). At times I hoped that there would be more practical knowledge as opposed to theoretical study. Sometimes, during class discussions, the procedural aspects (intended to make discussions more equitable and increase participation) were overbearing and detracted from the substance of the conversations "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. It was a fascinating subject and Ms. Krontiris did a great job facilitating conversation and pushing us to challenge preconceived notions about education in the United States. The readings were thought provoking and I genuinely learned a lot in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend. Learn how to write at Yale! Get detailed feedback on several long essays from someone who really cares about your success! What else can you ask for! It's not easy, but its worth it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if a student wished to improve their writing and has an interest in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class, especially with Lizzie, whoever students should be prepared to do a lot of work. ",
            "\u00a0I really would, especially if you get Lizzie as your professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this source to a student interested in education. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it truly allows a student to improve his or her writing skills, and Prof. Krontiris is extremely helpful when it comes to providing us with feedback. However, the course does demand a lot of work on a daily basis, and it sometimes seems as if you have no break from countless deadlines. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great introductory writing course that helped you improve your writing, get used to a small seminar, and learn a lot about the debates around higher education. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class on the merits that it has markedly improved my writing skills and increased my knowledge about the higher education system. However, this specific topic is quite nuanced so I would only recommend it to students that have interest in the subject. "
