            "\u00a0Obviously, galaxy formation and evolution. The man himself, Franciscus vdB, wrote the dang textbook and lemme tell ya, it's the best one available presently on the market. I mostly gained a better appreciation for the baryonic processes involved in galaxy evolution, and polished some of my cosmology background along the way. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent lectures, great problem sets, an overall good approach to a term project\r\nWeaknesses: perhaps too few problem sets, maybe 4 or 5 instead would have been better for the purpose of cementing some of the more complicated topics into our minds\r\n\r\nImprovement: building a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation would be a great idea, so whenever Frank has time to put together that component for a future rendition of this course, I think it would be very helpful as a 5th problem set. Also, perhaps there is too much material in the class? I feel like we spend a very small amount of time on any one thing in particular, and I probably could have learned more overall if we had focused more time on individual topics instead of covering so much stuff. ",

            "\u00a0Yes definitely. This is by far the best course I have done in Yale Astronomy. Instructors taking other Astronomy courses should learn from the organization and presentation of this course. ",
