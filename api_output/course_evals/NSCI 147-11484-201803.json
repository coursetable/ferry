            "\u00a0I learned about animal minds and how we can use animal models to learn about drug addiction in humans. ",
            "\u00a0learned a lot about how brains function with disorders and how animal models help us to better understand these disorders and how t develop better treatments for them ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the brain mechanisms behind disorders such as drug addiction, depression, and schizophrenia, which was surprising since I don't have much of a background in science and was afraid I would be out of my element. I also learned how to read and write about scientific papers and studies. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me understand the neural basis for many clinical disorders that are prevalent but never quite explained. Incredibly useful information. As a psychology major, learning about these disorders through the context of animal models also helped me gain a better understanding of experimental design. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about numerous mental disorders and the way they are studied and treated through animal models. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different underlying causes of disorders like drug abuse, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. Learned about how we use animal models to discover underlying causes of disorders and to find possible treatments for these disorders. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a beginning understanding of the neuroscience behind drug use, depression, Alzheimer's, anxiety, Parkinson's, and schizophrenia as well as how we use animal models to understand and develop treatments to counteract said disorders. ",
            "\u00a0Learned very in depth information about different disorders and how our brains are impacted. We gain a lot of information on disorder treatment through animal models. Definitely an emphasis on the biology and neuroscience of these disorders and treatments. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of the value of Animal Models, why we create them, and how they work to tests new drugs ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to critically evaluate neuroscience studies/papers and to develop new and effective ways to study different neurological disorders using animal models. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course! It was amazing and so interesting to me. I feel like my interest in neuroscience was clearly challenged and the course overall did a great job of teaching me about the field of neuroscience. ",
            "\u00a0I had taken a Psych course in high school, and this was well positioned to build from this and bio knowledge. I know feel I can read academic papers in the subject and understand them at a fairly high level, as well as gaining a rudimentary understanding of different brain regions and what we do and do not know about how the brain functions. I also learnt how to evaluate an animal model, and determine what it does and does not tell us. "

            "\u00a0I think the class is well structured. ",
            "\u00a0well taught, simple material. \r\n\r\nboring lectures ",
            "\u00a0The lectures weren't always very dynamic or engaging, but the material was interesting. My biggest problem was that there were set due dates for the two papers/set dates for the 3 tests, but these dates ended up changing a lot pretty last-minute, which was annoying because I chose my courses/schedule in part due to the way the assignment dates were organized. The new dates made for some stressful weeks. But overall the class was interesting and not too much work at all. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Donegan's notes were the most helpful part of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It was interesting to study these different mental disorders through the lens of animal models. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It would be cool if the students were allowed to select the last disorder to study based on class interest. ",
            "\u00a0Strength of the course is the engaging course material; it is very interesting to learn about. Although it is a lot of overwhelming information at first, the professor reviews material every class so that students understand what was talked about last time. The professor's notes for the slides are also helpful to students in preparing for exams.\r\nA weakness is that there is not much room for discussion in the class, as it is a small lecture class and there is a lot of information to cover. Additionally, students were often left not knowing how to analyze animal models on their own, especially when it came to writing the paper. Perhaps better clarification and guidance for this would be helpful for future students. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the exams and essays are appreciated and the topics are interesting. That being said, the way the material is presented is very dry and hard to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures are very engaging, the class is challenging, but very interesting. It is formatted well, and if you are attentive in class and study hard, you can do well on the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The information/content itself was interesting but the lectures were very dry and not engaging ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were very effective and informative, because our professor presented the general structure through which neurological disorders are studied using animal models and then showed the components of that structure for every disorder and study that we discussed, making it very easy to apply that in the papers we read to write our papers. Also, our papers were closely and clearly critiqued, which was so helpful.  I didnt really see any weaknesses in the class; it was great. ",
            "\u00a0I think it is a very good course. Professor Donegan is a great lecturer who ensures the students understand the material presented. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how the slides were posted in advance. The freedom to write essays on what you want was very enjoyable and helped ensured you were really interested in what you were writing on. I would prefer if instead of a final exam, we wrote another paper. "

            "\u00a0Only if you are desperate for an elective, definitely easier science classes to take ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is helpful to understanding aspects of ourselves. ",
            "\u00a0yes. don't be daunted by the fact that it's a neuroscience class. Great class for non science people who need a credit. Professor is very available for help on the papers and always posts notes so it makes reviewing for exams easy and straightforward. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this for somebody looking for a science credit - there's no section, and as long as you take notes/pay attention to lecture then review well before the tests, you'll do well. There's really no work outside of the 2 papers and the tests (there are occasional readings but you can get by without reading too carefully), so it's a great class to learn about current scientific research without being overwhelmed with work/feeling out of your element. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course to another student if they have an understanding of AP bio before this, but this is outlined in the syllabus. This is also sometimes complicated material to learn so if you have an interest in mental health/clinical disorders that will definitely help you engage with the nitty-gritty of this course better. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Donegan was the best professor I've had in my 2 1/2 years at Yale. His enthusiasm about this course made the class something to look forward to every Tuesday and Thursday. I've never met a professor so willing to meet outside of the classroom just to make sure you understand the topics that are covered in class and/or to review research papers. Contrary to what many other course reviews have said, a background in chemistry is definitely not necessary. Ultimately, the course is what you make of it...as long as you are willing to put in the effort, there's a lot you can learn from this course & Professor Donegan. A wonderful guy, an excellent professor, and a fascinating course- definitely take this class if possible. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. I think it was eye-opening, and I enjoyed writing about different mental disorders in a scientific way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who has interest in learning about the latest findings and treatment options for these disorders. It was a very interesting class and I would recommend it to anyone who has partially or completely finished the intro bio sequence. ",
            "\u00a0It is a good psyc science class but difficult. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend if you are willing to take a challenging course. You definitely have to put in work to do well, but this has been one of the most interesting classes I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a good course if youre interested in neuroscience or psych. You dont need to be a sciences major, but it is also by no means a gut, so be prepared for that. The lectures are pretty dry and I learned most of the information on my own by reading over the slides later, but if youre okay with that, then take this course for a good science credit that is not impossible but still really challenging, and the content you do learn will be interesting ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you like neuroscience or psychology and want to learn skills that will help you be a better researcher in the future, this class is for you. You do not need a lot of science experience to do well either. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend the course to other students. I loved it! ",
            "\u00a0It is a good science credit that is very accessible but also rewarding. "
