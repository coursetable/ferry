            "\u00a0This class offered an exciting opportunity to think about the objects in poems, which was a totally new way of approaching poetry but one that I will keep continue to think about thanks to this course. This course also helps develop writing skills because the assignments are never just a standard essay and instead involve research and label writing, for example. ",
            "\u00a0I gained new ways of thinking about poetry and objects and about the two together. I also learned how to find and handle materials in the Beinecke and in the Art Gallery, as well as how to write exhibition text. I felt that through this course, I became better at writing and critical reading. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to approach archival research on two levels: I learned the actual mechanics of calling things from the Beinecke (easy but also, somehow, something that takes practice), and I learned how to begin to ask myself the conceptual questions necessary to guide this kind of research.  I left this class with a totally new and wonderful way of thinking about the objects in the world around me, as well as new and exciting ways into reading poems. On a personal level, this class made me think about the way that I archive things and that my family archives things in a totally new way, and overall, has had a genuine impact on how I see myself existing in the world in relation to history and others. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Roffman once referred to this class as \"studies in description,\" and I think that's the most straightforward explanation of what exactly it is. In \"Poetry and Objects,\" I learned to play with description, to look really carefully, to engage with the moments or qualities of something that stand out to me rather than brush them aside, and, most of all, to describe things more concretely, concisely, and inventively. ",
            "\u00a0Poetry can be sometimes daunting. In this course I learned to how to properly approach writing and deciphering poems. ",
            "\u00a0This class is about description  how we talk about and describe objects in libraries/museums/poems. I learned so much about archives and museums and their collecting and curatorial processes. Meeting with curators at the Beinecke and the YUAG every week was a once in a lifetime experience, and I got to see so many interesting objects at both places. I learned less about poetry, but we did read some great 20th and 21st century poems which I enjoyed, even if we didn't discuss them so much. The class visits from poets Ann Lauterbach and Terrance Hayes were so insightful. The final project was such a good exercise in curatorial research and exhibit writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a tremendous amount about using the Yale library services, particularly accessing the Beinecke collections, which already helped me complete projects in my other classes. I also learned a new approach to analyzing artifacts and poems. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much! How to conduct research on objects, how to examine objects inside and outside of their function and purpose, how objects interact with language and poetry, how poems can be objects and vice versa, and the truly surprising amount of objects within the Beinecke's collection. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt so much about archival work and the inner processes of the Beinecke and the Art Gallery. I also learnt quite a bit about American decorative arts, and the process of exhibition curation. The class is completely focused around looking at poetry through the lens of inanimate objects that are not the center of the poem, so it also provided a really unique way of analyzing literature and thinking about points of entry into works. This was a really fascinating---if at times difficult---exercise. "

            "\u00a0This course was amazing because we got to spend so much time in the Beinecke and the art gallery classrooms. Professor Roffman is so enthusiastic and makes the course very exciting and welcoming for everyone. \r\n\r\nI think that maybe I would have liked to just have all the assignments due on the day of class rather than interspersed throughout the week but that is a minor detail. ",
            "\u00a0This course was always very interesting. No matter where our course was meeting or what the topic was, we were always looking at interesting objects and learning about them. I liked the writing assignments, and I also liked getting to meet and talk with poets. I do wish we had gotten more time to talk about the poems, as we read a lot that never got discussed. I would also have liked more opportunities to write poetry, as I enjoyed the few times that we wrote poems as our assignments and would have liked more chances to get feedback on my writing. Additionally, I didn't initially realize that our initial research was for a final exhibition. I think if that had been clearer, my exploration of the Beinecke's materials may have gone differently. ",
            "\u00a0This was easily one of the best classes I've ever taken, and one of its thrills was getting to see the pedagogy behind how it was structured coming together over the semester (as this was the first time it was taught.) The weekly creative assignments were fun and always taught me something about how to read the material for the week, and the opportunity to interact with objects at each institution, as well as talk with the poets about how their archives had been created, was incredible. I think this class would benefit from being taught twice a week, or just from having a more enforced separation during the class period between time spent looking at objects at each of the institutions and time spent discussing poems. I felt like the weekly assignments were so generative and so inspiring, that it would be been helpful to have the opportunity to discuss them as a class and push some of the discoveries I had working on them individually one step further. I also think that the arc of the major assignments in this class could be made more clear, maybe in the form of a concise outline of how each exhibit will build on the next, in addition to the extremely detailed assignment materials provided at each individual step. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it had a respectful and open class environment and facilitated group learning and contribution. I just wish there was more discussion time. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me so much, and Professor Roffman is an absolute joy!! She really cared about each one of us and the work we were doing. Her feedback was so thorough and so helpful through every assignment. There are small assignments every week but just a little bit of reading. Every assignment and every class was entirely different from the last, so it was an adventure the whole time. However, we didn't have enough time to discuss the poetry we read, so it wasn't always as much of a focus as I think it was intended to be. Also, it was not clear that the midterm research assignment was the basis for our final research project, so everyone ended up with a topic they weren't entirely passionate about. ",
            "\u00a0One clear strength of the course is that it meets in such unique spaces where students can learn from their resources and staff. I think the weekly assignments were also a strength of the course, but I think it would be interesting to devote more class time to sharing some of the thinking that went into those projects (as a side note, it was very reassuring to have them be pass/fail particularly for the sonnet sequence assignment). The research projects were a really fantastic open ended assignment that allowed students to pick a topic and learn a great deal about it, but I would be more explicit in the assignment of the midterm research project that the objects and poems that students pick will end up being ones that they spend a lot of time with. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of the course (if you can really call it that) was a shortage of time. I know we discussed it as a group, but I would like to reiterate that adding a class period or discussing fewer objects would leave more time for some of the really interesting conversations we had about the poems that I wish we could have spent more time on. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushes you to do a lot of research and thinking, but you care so much about the project that the work doesn't even feel like work. I wish the class got to meet more than once a week to discuss the poetry readings, but overall the class was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing for Prof Roffman's exceptional effort and care in curating it. In this iteration of the course at least every week met either in a study room at the Beinecke or the Art Gallery in which we would look at and discuss items from the collections with in house professionals---allowing for an exciting blend of literature, art history, and history. The variety in assignments from creative poems and free writes to more formal papers also allowed for constant engagement with the class despite the fact that it only met once a week and spoke to the studious and creative aspects of the course itself. I think this course could be improved by some more time spent discussing in a group and collaborative work. By the end of the semester it was really exciting learning about everyone else's projects and I think that really fostered a meaningful sense of community among us which fostered our individual pursuit of our exhibitions. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. Professor Roffman is so caring and invested in every student's learning and she is so helpful and available to provide feedback and help students improve. The subject is really fascinating and worthwhile and a really unique approach compared to other poetry classes! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to anyone looking to explore the resources of the Beinecke and the Art Gallery, as well as to read and think about a lot of poems. I enjoyed the materials we read and the things we looked at, and I thought the concept of juxtaposing poetry and objects was a new way of thinking that I hadn't considered before but that ended up being quite intriguing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! The work of this class asks for creative and genuine effort but always feels rewarding and helpful. I wish I had taken this class earlier in my time at Yale, as it has totally changed my relationship with the YUAG and the Beinecke and made me much more aware of how I can use those resources during my time here. As someone who has had multiple opportunities at Yale to interact with visiting poets/hear them read, the discussions we had with poets in this class felt more honest, personal, and productive than any others I've had here. Coming to class every Friday was something I genuinely looked forward to--something about the nature of what we were doing made the class feel like a community in a way that was really wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was wacky and wonderful and really forced me to push the limits of my own thinking in ways other courses at Yale had never demanded of me. The assignments were the kind of challenging that is also a pleasure, and each class was exciting and new in a different way. But the main reason to take the class is for Professor Roffman. She is truly one of the best professors I've had at Yalecommitted, generous, thoughtful. She fosters a kind of incredible learning environment; her classroom often felt like an opportunity more for shared exploration than anything else, each week filled with its own funny moments and serendipitous delights. Coming to class in the Beinecke or YUAG each Friday was a treat. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it only to people who I think would appreciate it. It was a privilege to work with the YUAG and the Beinecke. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! If you have any interest in poetry or museum/library exhibit curation, this class will open up so much thought for you. Professor Roffman is so kind and such a good teacher, AND you will learn so much from the Beinecke staff, YUAG American Decorative Arts curators, and from the poets you read. This is my favorite class I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another Yale student. The material, format, and overall experience were incredibly unique and refreshing. It was a class simultaneously on library research and exhibition development, while also covering the promised poetry and objects. Professor Roffman is incredibly thoughtful in curating the materials for the course and has done an excellent job pulling together disparate resources from various corners of the university. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course was my favorite that I took this semester, and one of my favorites that I've taken at Yale. It's a very intimate and surprising class--the small number of students creates an environment where it feels possible to be exploratory and experimental. The poetry selection is excellent, and the approach to each poem is incredibly unique. There is also the chance to meet well-known poets and pick their brains about their own poetry and objects, which seems like a once-in-a-lifetime experience. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing! You will learn so much about archival work, get to meet and talk with really talented poets, and be able to develop your own research project over the course of the semester. Prof Roffman cares so much about the course and her students which means everyone grows as a group and on their own. Do be warned that the class is pretty intellectual---we are looking at poetry through objects which means that many classes are spent looking at household objects. This is not for everyone! I can understand how some people could resist the extreme focus on the quotidian. However, if you are willing to give this a chance, and embrace the idea of examining the mundane and looking at poems in a completely different way as a fruitful exercise, you will learn a lot. Research is also very self-driven so you get to put your own spin on what we learn and discuss in class and this can make it feel really meaningful. Much of the writing is also about honing description and being concise (think 200 word object descriptions) which is super useful given many literature courses focus on expounding. "
