            "\u00a0As a medievalist grad student hoping to specialize in Middle English, a knowledge of the poems of Cotton Nero A.x. is crucial for my intellectual development. This class provided just that, and then some. I FINALLY got to read Pearl and Cleanness all the way through, and Patience (and of course St. Erkenwald!) for the first time alongside Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. I gained a further grasp on the thorny alliterative language of the poetry, the paleography and images in the manuscript, and also got to get a bit of a grip on debates of authorship and literary analysis I'd only been a fly on the wall of before now. It was great. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of insights into late medieval England were picked up with the scholarship along the way, so some history and some philosophy and some cultural norms. Definitely got insight into middle English (the Gawain-poet's middle English, at least), and learned how to deal with translations, which were a constant temptation during primary reading. Lots and lots of close-reading done during seminar and then for the protocols and paper. Bibliography was touched on too, which was good. ",
            "\u00a0I gained quite a bit of knowledge about the works of the Gawain-poet, including the additional poem \"St Erkenwald,\" and about Middle English alliterative poetry in general. I had not read any of the poems before besides \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,\" so it was very interesting to compare the other poems in Cotton Nero A.x and \"St Erkenwald\" with \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" My ability to read dialectal Middle English also improved considerably, as most of my work in the past with Middle English literature has been with Chaucer or other poets writing in the dialect of London. The class thus helped me to better appreciate the diversity of Middle English poetry. "

            "\u00a0Strengths! One incredible part of the class was Professor Brantley's assignment of \"protocols,\" writing assignments that were assigned alongside the poems we read that were designed to spark discussion and, more importantly, hone an ability to write crisp and concise thoughts in a lucid and presentable format. Admittedly, this latter objective was a bit of challenge for me, but it was great to get a clearer view of some of my own weaknesses as an English student and medievalist while also being able to engage with the thoughts and approaches of other classmates. Long live the protocol! Otherwise, the class was great- a good mixture of reading, writing, and socratic discussion. It was also a really interesting feature of the class to be roughly 50/50 split between grads and undergrads. This gave me some much-needed exposure to the way undergrads approach medieval literature; in some ways it was as much a teaching observation for me as it was a class. Professor Brantley was able to bring together all registers seamlessly in the class. I was so happy to take it! ",
            "\u00a0This was an exciting and accessible introduction to a poet that was unfamiliar to many of us--I really enjoyed our conversations. Protocols were a great way to experiment with a style of academic writing that is, in my opinion, too rarely discussed or explained in our classrooms: the conference paper. I did sometimes feel that the size of the class (and thus the volume of protocols, class presentations, etc) slightly impeded our ability to talk about the poems. Perhaps a solution to this could be requiring shorter protocols, or eliminating/re-framing the presentations? ",
            "\u00a0The emphasis on close-reading was a big unexpected strength, as well as the methodical pace through some difficult poetry. The criticism chosen for us to read was in general very good (Bahr, etc.), but some of it felt a little bit dated--probably because of the state of Gawain-poet criticism, to be fair. Discussion was basically good, and protocols were a good way to get everybody to participate. The length of the protocol (four pages or so) was somewhat at odds maybe with the restrictions on content (an analysis of one line or section rather than a broad argument). \r\n\r\nMaybe an open question how profitable for either group it was to combine grads with undergrads; interests and participation levels seemed to differ pretty distinctly.\r\n\r\nMight have liked some parallel poems by other theological or romantic vernacular poets for context; could generate good discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course lay in its extended focus on the varied works of a single poet and in reading the poetry in the original language, when so many medieval literature courses do not. We had many fruitful discussions about the Gawain-poet's works and everyone contributed regularly with insightful comments and questions. It was also a strength of the class to include frequent writing assignments and occasional practice at presenting, since these are two important scholarly activities.  The course could possibly be improved by devoting more time to working on the final project, such as by sharing preliminary drafts of the final paper with classmates for feedback towards the end of the semester. Discussing ideas for the final topic in small groups was helpful, but I ended up not receiving feedback from my peers outside of class. The course could also possibly be improved by a trip to view Middle English manuscripts at the Beinecke, such as to compare the illuminations of Cotton Nero A.x with the work of other artists. It might also be fun and interesting to watch some clips from film adaptations of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight in class, perhaps after watching the entire films outside of class. "

            "\u00a0An emphatic yes. I'd recommend any course by Professor Brantley to anyone; this class is a great learning opportunity, both for grads (and undergrads) more familiar with medieval literature, and those exposed for the first time. Between the reading, the professionalization, and the constant encouragement to share thoughts and speak out, this class is a great space to hone all kinds of professional and intellectual skills, medieval credit or no. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introduction to a poet who is less well-known than Chaucer, Langland, or some of the department's other standbys in the medieval offerings. I am so glad I read these weird and wonderful poems, since the regional dialect is fascinating. The reading load is light, and if the shorter assignments (mainly reading responses and oral presentations) can feel a bit onerous at times, they provide lots of helpful opportunities to think through the final seminar paper. Jessica Brantley is a very generous teacher and a great discussion leader. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend, though differently to undergrads than graduates. For graduates, a good course for their medieval requirement: tough, but not overwhelming, especially in the amount of reading. The focus on the Gawain-poet might take away some value from medieval specialists. Would recommend as well for undergraduates interested in medieval poetry, but have to contend with graduate students. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in medieval literature, especially Middle English literature or alliterative poetry more generally. The course was challenging but not overly so, it taught reading skills in another stage of the English language, and it encouraged the development of writing and speaking skills as well. It also worked well as a joint undergraduate-graduate course and seemed well-tailored to both levels. "
