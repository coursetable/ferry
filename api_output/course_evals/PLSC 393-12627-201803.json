            "\u00a0- Developed writing skills\r\n- Developed communication skills in seminar\r\n- Lots of reading, really challenged me to get everything done ",
            "\u00a0General overview of current constitutional structure and challenges in the G20 constitutional democracies. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned so much in this course, about our own constitutional democracy, and about others in the world. As a scholar interested in early american history and constitution making, this course allowed me to learn about other systems of written constitutions and governments to learn about various theories of judicial review, rights protection, and to be critical of our own system of government. Overall, I cannot stress how much this course challenged and encouraged me to think about my own jurisprudence. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how our Con. Law. compares to that of other countries'. Seeing the difference between legal institutions and practices we take for granted in the US and the equivalents in other countries was really eye-opening. ",
            "\u00a0A fascinating introduction to the constitutions of the G20 countries in comparison to that of the US!! ",
            "\u00a0Constitutional law; writing about law; thinking across nations ",
            "\u00a0This course is great at learning about the constitutions, history, and government processes of other nations and then seeing how they compare to each other. I think my constitutional interpretation of documents improved as I was finding myself more able to communicate my reasoning and judgement in the seminar space. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\n- Very compelling reading\r\n- Interesting papers to write\r\n- Fun seminars\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\n- Would have loved to ENGAGE with the material more, ie more assignments to test and develop our knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Professor Calabresi is awesome and does a great job staying objective during the class conversation and presenting clear points to support any and all of the arguments he makes ",
            "\u00a0Each class section offered little opportunity to contribute to the discussion. The professor would lecture for a while and then ask overly vague or overly specific questions to the same students. Improving the in-class experience would make this course much better. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the discussions more as the class continued. At first, I was a little stunned by the fact that Professor Calabresi cold calls students, but it encourages everyone to speak up and participate. Also, I wish that discussions could be a bit more organic with students just chiming in whenever, but I guess it is difficult to implement because then you run the risk of no one participating. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of material and its comprehensiveness were great. The class as a whole was really interesting. There was a lot of work, and because we covered so much, I feel like there was a lot we didn't get to discuss as thoroughly as we could have. I'd make the class twice a week if possible. The amount of reading was also burdensome (though still really interesting!), and I think it could be condensed in a way that slims it down but keeps the important points. ",
            "\u00a0A little more guidance on the written assignments would have been wonderful! ",
            "\u00a0Course was extremely strong. I enjoyed all of it. Could have more feedback on papers. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a great course with very compelling material. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a hit or miss, to be completely honest. Professor Calabresi is incredibly nice and a renowned expert in constitutional law, and that does make for an overall good experience. But each class session left something to be desired. Professor Calabresi would go through a brief outline of the casebook readings and then ask either overly broad or overly specific questions of the same students each week and not really engage the rest of the class. Assignments would be returned with no comments or feedback at all. I would not recommend the class without some background in Con Law, otherwise, it is very difficult to get a word or comment in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course, get to know Professor Calabresi, who, by the way is so accessible and humble, and become a more informed global citizen. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great discussion! ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It's really really interesting. Changed the way I see our government, the rest of the world, the role of law in society... I can't say that all of the questions I have were answered, but just opening my eyes to those questions and talking about them was great. It's plenty of work, but it's not too difficult grade-wise. Would def. recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! The readings were interesting and Calabresi's reflections, insights, and anecdotes spiced up our debates beautifully. A must-take course for any future lawyers. This course truly makes you question your own morals and values in relation to the law. ",
            "\u00a0If another student was seriously interested in law, I would recommend it. It's a very specific course that requires a deep level of commitment and engagement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is amazing for anyone considering Law School. Professor Calebresi is amazing and always willing to help you in any way he can. I also believe that the seminar structure of the course makes this class even better as it forces you to improve in your reasoning of certain constitutional judgements. Moreover, the essays are rigorous, but if you genuinely enjoy constitutional law, they can be a lot of fun to write and research. "
