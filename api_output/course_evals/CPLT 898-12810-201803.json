            "\u00a0The course provided an overview of the major literary and aesthetic movements of fin-de-sicle France (naturalism, decadance, symbolism) and an introduction to its relevant secondary literature. The course also touched on important cultural developments, including colonialism, anti-semitism, the rise of 19th-century scientific and pseudo-scientific discourses, and technological innovation. ",
            "\u00a0I was glad to have had the opportunity to work on a shorter and a longer paper in this class. This helped me to test myself on different styles of research and especially made me rethink how to prepare a close reading. I also got useful feedback from Professor Samuels about my presentation that I will take with me going forward. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an excellent opportunity to learn more about the \"cultural\" approach to literature. It was an exciting journey through the period of the French Late Century. With a representative selection of books and literary documents mixed with contemporary theoretical texts, the programme was very relevant and gave rise to very interesting discussions. The course framework has been clearly defined and open to the various research interests of students. ",
            "\u00a0This class was invaluable for its introduction to literature at the fin de siecle, as well as the broader cultural and social milieu. Each novel was contextualized through weekly student presentations, and novels/authors/literary movements were compared to previously studied material over the course of the semester. The course offered a nice juxtaposition of the Naturalist and Decadent schools, and also presented works of literature that fell in between the two styles, offering engaging class discussions. "

            "\u00a0The course was well-organized and effectively paired theoretical or literary-historical secondary texts with aesthetic works (novels, poetry, art). Student presentations also allowed for coverage of relevant topics that enriched, or supplemented, those treated on the syllabus. \r\nI would have appreciated more sustained engagement with the formal qualities of fin-de-sicle works ",
            "\u00a0This course covered a nice range of authors. I was happy with the cultural history that accompanied each text we treated. The class taught me valuable lessons in the importance of historical context in assessing works of literature. I felt Professor Samuels estimated an appropriate amount of reading that was manageable each week. Overall, it is hard to find fault with this class. Perhaps some visual documents or a visit to the Beinecke could have been part of the syllabus, but the opportunity to explore these options was made available in the presentation assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- breadth and quantity of material, excellent introduction and contextualization of the novels at the beginning of each class (this was my favorite aspect of the class -- I almost wish these were presented *before* we read the novel because it made the novel come to life in a much richer way), great primary and secondary source readings that accompanied the novels.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - Quantity of reading material each week was overwhelming; even if the books were in English, I would have felt the amount was high, but in French, it proved even more challenging. "

            "\u00a0Yes-- the course is an important counterpoint to Prof. Samuels' course on modernity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, when you take a class with Professor Samuels you are in good hands! Good feedback on work, interesting, rich and well-prepared discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend -- engaging class discussions; fantastic reading selections; helpful, clear, and insightful professor. "
