            "\u00a0How to protest efficiently and effectively. Which strategies are useful and which don't work as well. We dove especially into the philosophy of protests, which can be difficult to parse, but is interesting to see how the theories hold up, or don't. ",
            "\u00a0More comfort with reading social science papers, a variety of new ways to think about political protests. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the dominant theories explaining protest behavior. It's a very exceptional class to learn how to break down the building blocks and ideas behind a protest or social movement to see what makes it successful or a failure. ",
            "\u00a0Everything! I realized so much more about protest movements and everything to do with them. There's so much interesting about the methodology. ",
            "\u00a0Political Protests was an absolute joy to take.  It offered a nuanced view of protest action as well as social movement mobilization.  From a number of theoretical models to case studies, the class provides an helpful guide to these topics, all under the guidance of a thoughtful, challenging, and intellectually nimble professor. "

            "\u00a0This course was phenomenal! The topics of discussion were always interesting. ",
            "\u00a0It's very discussion-based, which can be tough if there aren't a lot of motivated students to carry it on. Sometimes the reading can be easy and fun, but other times it can be laborious and the class has a difficult time staying on topic because of how dense it was. ",
            "\u00a0It's an interesting challenge to have this sort of a class as a seminar, because a lot of the readings were pretty technical. I think the seminar style worked best when we were talking about particular movements/actions rather than drier methodology stuff. ",
            "\u00a0This is an absolutely incredible course! Strengths? Unreal professor, wonderful class discussion, engaging class activities. Weaknesses? We did not have enough time. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: An Interesting and fair amount of reading material, constructive conversation, and great instruction. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: 2 Hours is too much time for one seminar ",
            "\u00a0I can't even think of any weaknesses. Professor Hierro was amazingly kind, and she always made sure to bring her A-game to each class session. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this class if you're interested in learning a lot about the study of protest and social movements without doing a ton of work. This class is not a gut and some of the readings are very dense, but the class was never too demanding. Professor Hierro is very nice and very knowledgable on the subject, she leads good class discussions, and she gives good feedback on reports and presentations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! I have not had much experience with political protests, and it is an illuminating course on how to analyze the extensive and varying amounts of protests and social movements we are seeing today. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to any student who is interested in understanding the nuts and bolts of the philosophy of protests and how they work. However, your experience will vary according to the investment of your classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a010/10 would recommend. Professor Hierro is an incredible human being and teacher. She loves to learn from all of the students in the class and truly cares about your development. The course material is very interesting and she really helps you glean new knowledge every class. Take this course and you won't regret your life choices! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was an amazing course, especially under Professor Hierro! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take this course.  Professor Hierro is great with leading discussions, giving precise feedback, and challenging students points.  But, she does this all while being approachable and very invested in her students' futures and their success in the classroom. "
