            "\u00a0Because of Crippen's passion and knowledge, I have become more attracted to linguistics. He provided knowledge and skills from the Indigenous perspective, not a white, academic perspective. Professor Crippen's ability to bring culture and academia is unmatched. That alone allowed students knowledge, skills, and insights that are often overlooked. I learned a lot and wish he could stay and teach more courses. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned a lot about Native American languages overall and a lot of specifics in various languages across the world and continent. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt much more about the features of language which is the most interesting and crucial feature of linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I reviewed essential linguistic topics while learning a great deal about Native American languages and cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned not only of the vast diversity in pre-colonial North American languages and the wide variety of linguistic expression therein, but also of the deep cultural significance of language in a community and issues indigenous peoples face as a result of systemic oppression. ",
            "\u00a0I learned linguistics basic concepts while also learning about indigenous North American languages and problems surrounding them. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I gained valuable research skills. Having never done research into a language before, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. However, I have learned that the struggles that I went through to do my own language research were necessary. When it realistically relates to languages that do not have a large number of speakers, additional documentation and research takes time. I wasn't supposed to have all the answers, but the pure effort was enough. It's definitely okay to make mistakes because only by making mistakes can we learn. Though that sounds trite, I could relate one hundred percent. Even when I was apprehensive about how I would perform on an assignment, I think it was necessary for me to take that courageous step and just try. I didn't have to shoot for perfection. I shot for my best. And that led me to appreciate the whole process of language research. ",
            "\u00a0This was really interesting because it had an interesting mix of linguistics and instruction surrounding culture and history of different indigenous groups. ",
            "\u00a0This course offers an incredible introduction into linguistics and indigenous languages. A lot of misconceptions about Indigenous languages and the study of Linguistics are debunked and explained. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: the topics included in the course, the passion of the teacher, the material.\r\nWeakness: the level of engagement\r\nImprovements: handouts are given to students and be more engaging students; other than that I enjoyed his class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great lecture in a small class with interesting topics\r\nWeaknesses: Assignments could be difficult and time consuming, but they were worth the effort in order to get to the cool parts of the language you chose to study ",
            "\u00a0Is not an intro course. If someone has never taken a linguistics course, which should be normal for the literal lowest level LING class, they would probably be completely lost. ",
            "\u00a0Very disorganized. You never knew how well you were doing or what to do, really. It is more designed for people who already have a background in linguistics. I think most people were sort of feeling aimless in this class ",
            "\u00a0It was a one-off so I'm not sure how useful this is...\r\nI liked that the class was very interesting without taking a lot of time, but I would have liked a more regular schedule of assignments, and feedback on the ones I'd completed. A lot of the problem was because the professor was finishing his dissertation while also trying to teach the course. ",
            "\u00a0One good strength of the course is that it provides a basic introduction into linguistics with the added bonus of having a focus on Native American languages. Another strength would be that because Mr. Crippen is a member of the Tlingit Nation, his knowledge of the Tlingit language and culture provided nice examples and context to some of the more technical aspects of linguistics (i.e. aspect, tense, pronouns, etc.). A third strength would be that although the class is titled \"Indigenous Languages of North America,\" you don't have to speak a Native American language or identify as being Native American in order to make the most out of the class. Mr. Crippen endeavored to make sure that both native speakers of Native American languages and other students could learn. Those of us who aren't Native American learned from our classmates who are. And even then, those of us who aren't Native American still had our own experiences to share, whether that be knowledge on some other language. There really isn't so much a weakness to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the linguistic concepts could have been better explored in class for those of us who had never studied linguistics before. Also, the assignments were hard because we had little guidance and no feedback. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated this course very much. My only critique is that I would have liked to have a little more discussion rather than lecture. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. It should be offered more. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely! I loved learning about the language I chose to study throughout the semester as well as many other languages and phenomena in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course material was interesting. There aren't many classes on morphology at Yale and this one focused a lot on morphology. However if this is taught by Crippen I would absolutely not recommend it, unless you want to sit through an hour and 45 minutes of ranting and teaching material that s not even relevant to the assignments, and then when you do the assignments, get absolutely no grade or feedback for the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you're really interested in indigenous languages or already have a background in linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely, but I think a lot of the interest was in the professor's captivating anecdotal lecturing style. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend indigenous languages of North America to another student, as it broadened my perspective and understanding of the languages spoken on this continent, but the nuance of how cultural and linguistic phenomena interact, as well as the ways in which culture and an individual is independent from linguistic patterns. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Everyone living in North America should know more about the indigenous people here and this is a great way to gain some of that understanding. ",
            "\u00a0I would for sure recommend this class to students simply interested in languages. Even if they think they wouldn't be interested, I'd encourage them to take it anyway. For starters, I see it as a privilege that I had the opportunity to take a class called \"Indigenous Languages of North America.\" It's not everyday that I can sit down and hear from an expert (Mr. Crippen) who has done extensive study on Tlingit, one indigenous language of North America. I do have to say that although the class is labelled as an introductory course, I would advise future students to expect a challenge. However, the thing is that the challenge is the whole point of the learning. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Everyone interested in language should take this course! "
