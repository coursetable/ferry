            "\u00a0Developing macroeconomic theories using mathematics ",
            "\u00a0We started with basic macroeconomic skills like calculating GDP and inflation price indices, then moved to model-building, which was the bulk of the class. Such models included the real intertemporal model of a closed economy in equilibrium, the AD/AS model with unemployment, the dynamic AD/AS model, and the Solow model. It was really interesting to learn the reasoning behind each curve and axes and to finally understand how real-world phenomena like the Great Recession occurs from changes to these models. ",
            "\u00a0Multiple models for studying macroeconomic phenomena. Beginning with macroeconomic accounting, we then went through intertemporal budget constraints and consumer choice and multiple aggregate supply/aggregate demand models (static, dynamic-taking inflation into account) and how to derive the curves in these models through the loanable funds market, money market, etc. Also looked at implications of these models on both fiscal and monetary policy, and finally, at how well empirical data backed up these various models. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my understanding of fundamental macroeconomic principles. I gained a broader perspective on the role of macroeconomics and how it works as a discipline. I improved my ability to reason through economic problems and think about how they affect society as a whole. I deepened my appreciation for the field of economics, its beauty and importance. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: class slides were very clear, professor gave after class updates that were extremely helpful for noting our progress in the course, tests were given with ample preparation and information beforehand\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good professor, reasonable assignments, small class size\r\n\r\nWeakness: none ",
            "\u00a0More interactive class rather than lecture-style classes ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Professor Bachmann is very thorough with his notes and announcements, so even if you have a hard time keeping up in class (which will probably happen at some point), it is very easy to review material on your own from his lecture slides. The class is curved in terms of points (eg. everyone who ends up with over 100/130 points gets an A- or higher) but not in terms of other students, so everyone just tries to do their best and gets rewarded for their efforts. The class is also very small--less than 25 students even though it's listed as a lecture--which is great, because you can actually ask questions in class (!) and personally talk with your professor (!!). I also found the material to be much more digestible than Intermediate Microeconomics, maybe because Professor Bachmann was so good at responding to emailed questions/office hour questions. If you know what you're doing or have a smart partner (you work in groups for psets), the psets also don't take too much time; I spent around 2-3 hours per week on them. My only suggestion would be to have time during class where students can go up to the board and try to build graphic models themselves, bc I would sometimes get lost in the process and be too timid to ask the professor to go through it again. Overall, though, highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - good lectures and notes made the material very approachable, although I didnt find it always engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - psets were too easy, didnt help develop comprehensive understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized materials online for studying, learning, and review. \r\nWeaknesses: The slide material is a bit dense at times. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are extremely clear, thorough, and engaging. The problem sets are interesting and developed my understanding of the material. The professor was extremely helpful and accessible. In my view, this is how economics courses should be. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! A fantastic course made engaging by the professor - be prepared to grapple with the graphs but be rewarded for a truly fundamental understanding of macroeconomics ",
            "\u00a0I would--Prof. Bachmann is a strong lecturer and the assignments are very reasonable and doable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good problem sets and class. Exams weren't too difficult and I learned a lot from this class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class. The class is small and intimate (<25 students), the professor is very organized and timely with grading/answering questions, and the material is very evidently applicable to real life. While I don't think I'll be going to grad school for Economics and probably won't really need Macroeconomic Theory knowledge later in life, I feel like I learned an incredible amount from this class and suffered much less than in other Econ classes for it. The tests (there are 3) are also difficult but really engaging (and graded generously), and I always feel like I have learned something new from them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Though most students who take this course are applied math or econ & math, I really enjoyed the intellectual challenge and the small lecture format. If you're bored of the big econ lecture format and want to actually learn what macroeconomics is, this is the course for you! ",
            "\u00a0If you're choosing between this and the large lecture, I don't think you could really go wrong with this one (although it might be different with a different instructor.) Even though this is technically a \"math-intensive\" version of intermediate macro, it really wasn't terrible as far as math was concerned, with a lot of algebra on problem sets and some relatively fundamental calculus concepts. Overall, you will learn a lot about how/why we model the macroeconomy in multiple ways and gain a little insight into previously faceless economic phenomena. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student interested in deepening there understanding of how society works, and what role economics plays as a discipline. It is taught extremely well, not overwhelming, and is incredibly well organized. You will learn a lot and enjoy doing it. Professor Bachmann does an excellent job. ",
            "\u00a0ECON 126 is a great class. I took this class only because the other intermediate macro class conflicted with my schedule, but I'm really glad I took ECON 126 with Professor Bachmann. He cares very much about the content and works hard to help you learn the content. The problem sets helped solidify the content but weren't too challenging and the exams were fair. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to another student. I believe that it was taught in a well-structured manner that allowed me to take away several overarching ideas from the course. "
