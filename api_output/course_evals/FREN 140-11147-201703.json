            "\u00a0My familiarity with French grammar significantly increased during this course. In addition, the literature read proved to widen my perspectives on francophone culture. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my French language skills ",
            "\u00a0In this course I read for the first time entire books written in French. It also made me aware of my problems in pronunciation and writing. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to understand spoken and written French increased dramatically throughout the semester from having a native French speaker as a teacher and watching movies. I learned a lot about the French-speaking world outside France, such as Senegal and Algeria, through the stories we read. I also improved my oral French and grammar. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more French, really. "

        [
            "\u00a0The online portion of the course was not that helpful and the identifications did not contribute to how closely I read the texts. ",
            "\u00a0This course is helpful in training oral skills in an intimate learning environment. It also develops the students' ability to appreciate literary works, historical work, and films in French. If the course could be made better, I hope the professor could provide more course materials or detailed advice about vocabulary building and listening skills--two important areas that the students are in need of after finishing learning the grammar. Reading French newspapers, or listening to radio shows could be a part of the class. Class meetings could have been much more efficient. Since oral practice only constitutes a tiny part of each session, most class activities could be completed by students alone at home. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the course requires active participation, which is key to learning how to speak the language. All the stories we read were engaging and appropriate. I don't see any weaknesses with the course, I was very happy. ",
            "\u00a0It's honestly pretty well-run. It's quite annoying to have daily class and nightly homework like it's high school but it feels like a reasonable setup for the class that it is. "

            "\u00a0Koundi is good - nothing special, but she does a good job and clearly cares about her students. The class is fine. You read some interesting stories and books, you learn some reasonably dry grammar, you know, the things you'd expect in a language class. This class isn't a reason to take French but it also isn't a reason not to take it. "
