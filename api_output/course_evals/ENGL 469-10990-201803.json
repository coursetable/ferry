            "\u00a0This class was a life-changer. I learned so much about the craft of writing and how to be a writer -- how to juggle a million things at once, work through failure, and innovate. This class was extremely difficult, but so is writing. It was so great! ",
            "\u00a0469 absolutely made me a better writer. You will learn structure, organization, mechanics, and reporting. If you get into the class you probably already have a strong sense of your style, but 469 almost certainly will improve that too. I also learned discipline and persistence in the reporting process, and became a better and more thoughtful editor. ",
            "\u00a0You learn how to write. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better writer on the level of the sentence and on the level of ideas and structure as well. I learned quite a lot about what makes literary journalism work, through reading and writing my own essays and having room to make mistakes.\r\n\r\nBut I didn't only come away a better writer I feel that the class made me a better person more humble, better able to listen to people, better able to ask questions that led to important answers. ",
            "\u00a0ENGL 469 will make you a better writer. You will learn how to pick the best (not the fanciest) word. You will learn how to write about a place with verve. You will learn how to construct a profile with all its important components. You will learn how to interview someone about their life and profession. And you will finally learn when to use \"which\" and \"that\" in your sentences. ",
            "\u00a0A much better knowledge of long form, nonfiction writing ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a more careful writer and a more conscientious editor. Short- and long-form journalism now feels more doable, accessible, and fun. I also gained the crucial ability to see myself as part of a community of writers working together toward mutual success, rather than as one competitor among many. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an amazing amount about writing, revising, editing, and myself, including sentence-level and structural guidance (end sentences with nouns, make sure the beginning and end relate to the central theme/feeling/idea) and my own personal pitfalls. I gained familiarity with memoir and the personal essay form, which helped me develop a stronger voice in my journalistic writing, as well. I became a subtler reader and a more careful editor for myself and others. I've never learned so much in a single writing course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The strengths: Anne, the reading list, the visiting authors, the PEOPLE. The ability to work on a single project for so long, to get so deeply invested in a piece of writing, and leave the class with something publishable in professional publications. ",
            "\u00a0It's a brilliant class, and the strengths are many: great community, incredibly engaged and intelligent professor, strong reading list. It's also a really good class for creative writers (fiction, poetry, etc) who are interested in writing nonfiction -- Anne doesn't assume you know anything about journalism, and the assignments are about half personal essay and half reported work, so it doesn't feel too much like being thrown off the deep end. If you're at all interested in creative nonfiction this class is a must-take. Weaknesses: the class definitely has an aura of exclusivity, which MOSTLY stops once you're accepted, but there's still a whiff of it. If you're particularly sensitive about your writing and don't like being (implicitly) compared to your classmates, you may find aspects of the class difficult. Overall, though, it's a really positive vibe with a great community, and Anne very obviously wants everyone to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely well-structured and planned. Anne was incredibly dedicated, as were the other students, which made for an intense, wonderful classroom. Although it was intense, Anne also managed to foster warmth among us, through jokes, through encouragement, through assigned partnerships. I also felt that the assignments pushed me in a way I hadn't been pushed before and made me think harder about every interview and every sentence.\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I didn't always feel that our conversations about the assigned readings were the most rigorous. Occasionally they felt a bit scripted, as if Anne had an answer in mind when she asked a question and would guide us there no matter what. I understand that she was trying to teach us specific information about the texts, but then I would have preferred if she had stated the information she wanted to share with us herself and allowed us to explore those ideas more deeply. When the conversations felt scripted, they felt limited. (This comment does not apply to all our discussions, though!) ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is its pacing. The first three essays (spaced two weeks apart, with a revision every other week) helped me find a writerly rhythm. This leaves plenty of time for the Yellow Pages project, which, while certainly demanding, is excitingly so. Meeting individually with Anne was another boon to my writing and motivation. In a workshop course, one's classmates are also one's instructors, and I couldn't have asked for better classmates this time around. So, whatever criteria is used to select students for this class, I'd say keep using them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the one-on-one evaluations, the incredible depth of critique \r\nWeaknesses: The teacher wonderful but cultivates a sense of competition in the class, and really chooses favorites ",
            "\u00a0This class shines because of its studentswho are unequivocally some of the kindest and most insightful at Yaleand because of its one-on-one conferences with Anne, one of the most precise and clever teachers/editors I've ever had. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard to think of a weakness. The syllabus is so carefully planned and crafted that it is nearly perfect. Unlike many reading lists I've been handed in Yale classes, this one felt totally purposeful; every single choice, from which book or author to which pages, seemed to have been considered and reconsidered. That epitomizes the level of respect, enthusiasm, and care that Anne shows for the class and her students. Even the sentences in the syllabus are immaculate. All of this makes for an unparalleled learning/writing community in which students put almost as much, if not as much, effort into advising others as they put into writing their own pieces. The only suggestions I have for improvements are very micro-level, such as switching out \"Voyeur's Motel\" for a piece that could possibly teach more and including Canvas comments as homework for each week on the syllabus. I've communicated those in a separate, more detailed course evaluation provided by Anne. This course is a masterwork. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!! Take this class if you can -- no other course I've taken has left me feeling like I've been given skills for life. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class to anyone who gets in--reporters and non-reporters alike will learn a lot from it. It definitely is tailored towards students with serious writing ambitions, though, since it's by far the most work-heavy writing class I've taken at Yale. If you're stuck between 469 and another class, keep in mind that 469 is much less about in-depth reporting and much more about developing a great, creative, specific nonfiction writing style. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course is an experience (and I use that word deliberately) not to be missed. It's a ton of work (though not one iota of that work is tedious), so try to take it in a lighter semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! I've never been in a class with such driven, talented fellows and such a driven, talented professor. Anne gives tons of individual time and thought to each student, and the reading and writing assignments are always interesting and meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you get in, take it. If you're on the waitlist, be persistent; make your interest known, but don't be pushy. You will leave this course a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I really learned microedits and sentence levels changes. However, its a ton of emotional and writing work so beware of your course schedule ",
            "\u00a0A thousand times yes. If you get in, take it. It's unlike any other writing course I've takenI'm so sad it's over, and that I won't be seeing all of these amazing people every week. If you want to learn how to find better stories, how to discover exactly the right word to convey your meaning, or how to give and receive more cogent edits, then this class is for you. ",
            "\u00a0A million times yes!! I didn't know I could grow so much as a writer and thinker in one short semester. You'll leave this course with work you feel proud of and, more importantly, dozens of *actually helpful* strategies that will stick with you for the rest of college, surely, and probably for life. Over the course of the term, you'll have several dedicated partners (Anne, your three essay critique partners, and your Yellow Pages critique partner) who will devote substantial time to helping you defeat your process demons and strengthen your writing muscles. By doing the same for others, you'll become a better editor and friend. I loved this course so much that I would take it every semester for the rest of college if I could. "
