            "\u00a0How to read texts closely. How to develop a argumentative interpretation of a literary text for an essay. How major classical works in literature have influenced each other. ",
            "\u00a0I became much better at close reading texts in order to develop a cohesive argument regarding both large and small themes; I became much better at building arguments regarding these ideas and finding a niche into which I could develop an essay; I became better at understanding the texts and became more aware of the ambiguities inherent to literature. ",
            "\u00a0Essay writing, literary analysis, understanding of intertextuality between important texts in the Western canon from Petrarchs Rime Sparse to Walcotts Omeros ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to engage with entirely different books from different times and places but at the same time could clearly see the thread and connection of ideas and thoughts between the books. Seeing the same problems or issues discussed in different ways by different authors was exhilarating. I never would have read any of these books otherwise but am so glad I did. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from gaining experience writing essays, I learned how to write a well-developed exploratory essay, focusing more on a topic than a thesis. I got even better at close reading because we were told to bring in passages for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to synthesize multiple texts at once, which is even more pertinent in literature because many themes and styles of writing are handed down and adjusted. I also learned how to place emphasis on beginnings and the introductory theme of a work. "

            "\u00a0There was not enough time to read texts deeply. But I also understand that there is a merit to trying to go through many works so I don't necessarily think it can be solved without compromising what is good about DS. \r\nThe lectures were always very helpful as it allowed for deeper reading of the text. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very rigorous, which comes with benefits and weaknesses. The final exam portion is the most worthy of criticism, as any quote based examination is asymmetric with the rest of what DS is about and should be reexamined. For instance, the final could consist of more essay questions or there could be a final essay for each DS course rather than a strangely formatted final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus structure encourages analysis of intertextuality. On the other hand, some of the readings, especially Don Quixote are extremely difficult to complete within the time frame in any depth. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great book selections, relevant ideas and interesting content\r\nWeakness: some of the reading lengths were simply unreasonable so should either be cut or we should be given more time to read. ",
            "\u00a0Per usual, its too much reading. Omeros is amazing but too much to digest in full. For literature, its especially painful to suggest reading only excerpts, but excerpts are better than pure skimming or not reading much at all. \r\n\r\nAside from that, the syllabus does a good job of variety of genre and time period (although some more racial and gender representation could easily be achieved). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great books and great discussion\r\nWeaknesses: too much assigned reading so often times our analysis was shallow "

            "\u00a0Yes. I liked many of the texts we read and I think this course really pushed me to look beyond the surface, to think deeper and to articulate developed thoughts more clearly. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Directed Studies only to students who are interested in at least two of the disciplines involved. If the student is only interested in one of the courses, I would recommend they avoid Directed Studies and find similar courses elsewhere. However, for those who are involved and interested in multiple of the disciplines, Directed Studies can serve as an amazing developmental tool for the beginning of their Yale experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for an introduction to many fascinating literary texts in the Western canon. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the content is extremely interesting and relevent, and you would probably never read these books otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0Of course. For a prospective humanities student, there is no better way to get a survey of literature, and it comes with high-level discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely, because it has given me a new love for literary theory and analysis and an equal love for literary appreciation. "
