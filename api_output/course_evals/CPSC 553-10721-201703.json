Assignments are well-designed and helpful to getting familiar with these methods. However, the professor went over some of the contents too fast. It would be better if these could be explained in greater detail. ",
            "\u00a0Writing our own code was very useful but lectures often took too broad brush a view of the information and/or assumed the level of knowledge of the students was higher. I received feed back on only one assignment, so it was difficult to improve some aspects of my work. ",

            "\u00a0The weeks where the course was taught by the instructor were superb. The guest lectures, though, seemed uncoordinated and led to a large redundancy in covered material. This led to me disengaging with the course during those weeks. "
