Too often, it felt like working through a (not excessively user-friendly) textbook more or less alone, occasionally watching videos and leaving a trail of feedback, always a little too late to be very helpful.

            "\u00a0There were often spelling mistakes in the French texts of powerpoints and homework assignments which, given that this was a language translation course, increased the difficulty in an unnecessary way. Feedback was often delayed by two weeks or more or not given at all, including a lack of feedback on the midterm before the final exam was due. This seems unacceptable given that this is a course with assignments every weekday. ",
