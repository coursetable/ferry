The TA team were all great, very helpful and organized. The final project was rewarding, but we could have received better guidance on structure and expectations for the project. I also sometimes felt that there was an over-emphasis on the manufacturing environment and industrial operations, and I would have liked broader exposure to how environmental concerns play out for diverse types of companies.

Andy Winston, Ann from GE)\r\nWeaknesses: Sometimes poorly organized with readings assigned the night before\r\n\r\nIssues surrounding corp envi strategy & sustainability lend themselves well to discussion, so it would be beneficial to have more opportunities for structured discussions rather than some of the in-class activities, which were less valuable.

I particularly enjoyed working on the case study homework assignments - I thought that they provided interesting real-world context for the concepts that we learned in class throughout the semester. I feel that the course could be improved with clearer and more specific guidelines for the homework assignments and the final project. ",

            "\u00a0The assignments were interesting and engaging, and TAs were very helpful. The group project was a good way to apply the lessons learned in class. Sometimes it felt to me that the class and the way it was taught was too trusting of corporations and business actors. Clearly, corporations are working hard to improve their environmental performance, but it's also true that businesses have caused significant environmental damage, and I was somewhat frustrated throughout the course with what I interpreted as an overall message of \"Oh, they're doing their best, so let's give them credit for that.\" I know that businesses are absolutely vital, but in thinking about systems change and the lessons learned in the Perspectives course, this message was unsatisfactory to me. Perhaps I had somewhat unrealistic expectations, but I was anticipating more of a critical lens being brought into the discussions overall. ",
