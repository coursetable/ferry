            "\u00a0I was able to build a website by the end of the class. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course, I developed a basic knowledge about coding, including HTML, CSS and Javascript. Also, I have gained an insight about a graphic designer's life, what specific skills are required for the job, and how all people have a capability to learn to code and design websites. ",
            "\u00a0We learned some history of the internet and internet art. We learned how to write HTML and CSS documents and how to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript and jQueryusing a series of artistic projects. ",
            "\u00a0great intro to html/css/javascript for students more interested in the front-ned/design side ",
            "\u00a0I learned quite a lot from the knowledge and tools required to design an effective website to the basic skills and strategies of web design and design in general.  You walk away from the course with a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are the three major coding languages required to design a website.  Many of the readings were thought-provoking and allowed students to develop further insight into ideas like the nature of symbols and the current climate of coding. ",
            "\u00a0I have picked up the basic usage for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, they are all very useful and basic website programming language. I also learned that it is the meaning we gave that makes a piece into a form of art, but not merely the appearance of the piece. ",
            "\u00a0Basic html and css and a little bit of javascript. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought it was a good course overall! I wish we could have talked a little bit more about design of websites, but because this was only 5 weeks i realize this is hard to incorporate given that we also learned how to code a website. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are that it teaches you how to code, introduces you to a world of coding and graphic design, and provides you with interesting readings to do. However, sometimes students can get really stuck during the process of debugging, so I think holding more extra help sessions would be very helpful for the future of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Fabulous course! Sometimes it was a rush to get through all the class material, but being a summer class, this was bound to happen. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course is that you leave the course with a definitive skill, i.e. designing a website.  You also gain a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which is enough for you to develop on your own after the course if you choose to do so.  You also get feedback about your web design and get to see those of other students, which together create a nice space for bouncing design ideas and thoughts off of each other.  A weakness could be the debugging element of the course, but that's just a part of any coding. ",
            "\u00a0Probably the pace of the course is a bit too fast, we had to pick up 3 programming languages in 3 weeks time, but it is so much fun, and since the deadlines of most of the assignments are made to be the last day of school, it allows us to have more time to reflect and improve on our designs. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging and the online resources were really useful. I think we could have spent less time on the earlier topics of the course and started on javascript and a little earlier. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It was definitely outside my comfort zone but I really enjoyed it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course is excellent for students who wish to learn more about the world of graphic design and coding. Even if a student is not majoring in art related subjects, this course will give them a basic knowledge about computers and coding, which is really helpful because we use softwares and computers all the time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to learn web development and are interested in visual art & design. ",
            "\u00a0absolutely\r\nnice overview of skills needed to facilitate design on web-based platforms ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course for any student that wants initial exposure to the world of web design.  While having some coding experience is beneficial, it is not a necessity.  I think anyone with peripheral or greater knowledge of other programming languages would especially thrive in terms of challenge and potential from the course. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very rewarding course where you can really see and experience your own work, you can tell clearly what you have learned and what you have done. The skills you learned will be very useful and easy to pick-up, with imaginations and the help of the instructors, you are able to unleash your imagination, and present your very own website. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you want a good intro to web design that isn't very CS heavy, this course is great. "
