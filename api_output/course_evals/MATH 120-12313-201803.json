I did learn about dealing with a class of such a nature, although it was a difficult to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Math 120 has a lot of content. You obviously learn multivariable calc, but really I learned about the importance of going to office hours with this course. It's essentially the only way to try and understand the material rather than just memorize it. "

            "\u00a0Your MATH 120 experience is definitely very dependent on the teacher you end up with, because it goes very quickly and it's easy to fall behind. I also wish we could have proven more things throughout the course of the semester, but if I really wanted that I could have taken MATH 230. You get what you sign up for, and if you want to become extremely comfortable with multivariable calc, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is just really, really hard. It could definitely be slowed down to incorporate more time for practice (essentially nothing was practiced in class, so it all had to be done in homework or office hours). The homework was also significantly harder than the coursework and, often, the exams. The class did, however, move in a clear progression and there was a lot of support available (it was just a matter of finding the time to use it). ",
            "\u00a0PAM SARGENT WAS THE STRENGTH OF THIS COURSE!!!! Pam is an incredible teacher who cared for us not only as students but as individuals as well. Her lectures were so clear, and she had soooo many office hours each week. These office hours were so, so helpful, and she was always more than glad to stay after class and ask questions about the material. Pam is such an amazing teacher, and Yale is extremely lucky to have her. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, Math 120 is a very challenging course. It covers a lot of content in a relatively short amount of time. Many have criticized the course for being so fast-paced, but it is already hard to fit multivariable calculus in one semester, and I personally cannot see what could be cut out of the curriculum in order to accommodate this request. That being said, students should be aware that the course is very intense and broad in what it covers. The problem sets can be difficult and long, but are manageable. The onus is on students to correct and fix their misunderstandings, as everything is very cumulative. Confusion on any one topic can hinder understanding of the rest of the course's content. A fair share of review lectures and notes are made available before exams, which is a strength of the course. Additionally, online modules are present to help students review concepts learned in lectures. While the course is difficult, it is possible to succeed if one is disciplined and has a good level of mathematical intuition. ",
            "\u00a0Math 120 covers a lot of topics that build off of each other, but a lot of the work tends to feel tedious. Class time doesnt always feel conducive to learning because of the sheer amount of material that needs to be covered. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course was my teacher. Pamela Sargent managed to teach us all the material quite well which allowed us to execute it well. I liked that we covered a lot as it gave me a strong mathematical foundation for my other classes. As a physics student, everything we did was super relevant to my Physics 260 class.\r\n\r\nThis course had many weaknesses. The teaching was not one of them as Pamela Sargent was great, although I heard other teachers were not as effective as she was. The biggest problem was that it turned into a memorization marathon instead of a learning process. By the end, we could execute a vector surface integral (and physics students like me could relate to its importance in measuring flux), but we never truly understood how its equation was what it was, or how it connected to the other integrals we learned. We understood there were 6 (or 8 depending on how you counted it), integral types, but we did not understand how the related to each other. I tried making a chart connecting them through the different \"fundamental theorem of calculus\"-esque theorems, like Stoke's, Greene's, Divergence. Now I know how they connect in the most basic form, but I still do not really understand how they connect and where they all originated. This is the nature of a non proof-based course, but it made this material so much less useful that it would have been had we been given more support as to the significance of these integrals. This was clearly a problem with the syllabus not our teacher.\r\n\r\nThe second biggest problem with this course was the algebra. Each week I probably spent 3 hours correcting algebra mistakes in the homework because this would be the only way to get a good score on the homework because partial credit was sparse. I admit this is partly my fault for making many algebra mistakes, but I really believe there was not enough emphasis on actually understanding the process as opposed to being able to do algebra. On the first two midterms I got lucky and only made two small algebra mistakes. I did well on the test but I was not challenged in anyway but multiplying numbers together. Instead of varying questions on exams, the questions are just the same as on the review sheets with different numbers. This makes the tests extremely boring and based on memorization not understanding. On the final I got less lucky. The numbers were not working out for me and I definitely did not do as well. I understood the process for every single problem and knew every step easily. But I just could not execute them because of algebra mistakes. I think the only way to fix this problem is to really give problems that test how students thinking and not how well they can mimic calculators. After all, I understand how to execute a triple integral. If I were to set it up correctly, wouldn't that be enough? (I was quite glad to see that just setting up a triple integral was a question on the final). But even this is not good enough. Calculators can execute all types of triple integrals themselves. Why isn't a real skill tested? Something that synthesizes the information instead of forcing us to regurgitate it. I think of our exams like multiple choice on a history exam. Its important, but it should not be the focus. Instead the focus should be something bigger. Something that really teaches. Something that would prove students understand the concepts more deeply than being able to execute an integral. Because executing integrals is great, but it is not the core of the material we should have learned. Hearing stories about math 230 I really wonder why Math 120 has to be so dumbed down. ",
            "\u00a0The course is truly interesting with regard to content, but I feel that there's simply too much to cover in the short time that we have. I also think that this course should exclusively be taught three days a week for 50 minutes each as opposed to 2 days a week for 75 minutes. It's simply to much material to digest and not enough repetition. ",
            "\u00a0Too much information in too little time. ",
            "\u00a0Moves extremely fast, but only focuses on the necessary stuff which is good ",
            "\u00a0It was well taught by Pamela, if not a bit dry. That being said this is math and all the material was sufficiently covered. ",
            "\u00a0It was unfair that many people taking the class had already taken it, and that messed up the curve for everyone who'd never taken the subject before. I think this discourages students who are new to this type of math from taking it, since they can never do better than people who already know it and will not be able to benefit from any curve. Also, I think the pace should be slower. ",
            "\u00a0It's well organised. No weaknesses to speak of. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well-designed. I took it with Professor Sargent, who is the best mathematics instructor that I have ever, ever had in my entire life. There are tons of practice problems provided also and office hours everyday, which is all super helpful. However, the class is simply taught at a pace that is neck-breakingly fast, which is perhaps the challenge/fundamental design of it. I have also heard tons of complaints year-to-year about the differential quality in teaching across sections. I also think there is something to be considered for changikng the way in which grades are calculated- it feels reductive to me to devote 50% of the grade to the final exam. Often, students learn so much through class, office hours, psets, which may not be accurately and wholly reflected in one test grade. ",
            "\u00a0Homework should be worth more. It's a lot of work and it's not reflected in grading. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength is the usefulness of online resources.  The biggest weakness is probably the lack of teaching ability of some instructors (some were much better than others). ",
            "\u00a0The course did a good job teaching all of the material, but the fast pace of the class left little time for a deeper understanding of the subject. We were prevented from completing examples during class due to our need to finish material, which was rather disappointing. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of the course was Pam. She's has such a bright personality, and she is exceedingly dedicated to ensuring that people that demonstrate extra interest receive the help they need. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think this stuff is important to know, and this course wasn't particularly hard. Definitely worth taking. It's not nothing but psets take 4 hours or less, and exams are a solid day of studying. ",
            "\u00a0I personally took this after AP Calculus BC thinking that would be a natural progression. I'd recommend against this- it is significantly harder than that class, and the material is condensed into way less time. I would only recommend it to a student looking to study math or someone who knows they have a very high natural aptitude for it (or with previous familiarity with the material). ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course if you take it with Pam Sargent!!!! She is so, so, so kind and friendly and her lectures are so clear and she is always more than willing to answer questions. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who enjoys math and is willing to put in the work for a challenging course. In order to succeed in this course, you need to be very disciplined in how you approach the content and be willing to work on problem sets that can be long and difficult. However, the content is quite interesting! I personally found the course to be intellectually challenging, in the right way. People who are not mathematically inclined may struggle, and I would not recommend the course to them. ",
            "\u00a0I would beg any other student to avoid this class at all costs. Why subject yourself to a math memorization clinic when math 230 is probably one of the best freshman classes. (The best introductory math class by miles). If only I had known. Now I do and am looking forward to math 225 in the spring. I understand it might be difficult, but I would rather struggle in a good class than coast in a shallow class. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but only if you have taken multivariable before. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course does a good job of teaching the subject. ",

            "\u00a0Yes it is a good way to further one's study of calculus. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course for someone unless it was required for their major. Otherwise, it is too difficult and stressful to spend time on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's good fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. But only if they can take this class with Professor Sargent (or Sudesh). I would also advise taking this class after first-year fall. I think that most of the students (who are first-years in their first semester) struggle because they have not yet developed the rigorous study skills necessary to keep up with this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this was a well-taught, intellectually challenging course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class if someone is truly interested in math and calculus. However, if it is not your passion, then it is probably not worth taking. I found out once I began taking it that I did not enjoy the subject, which made for a difficult semester. Therefore, make sure you want to study multivariable calculus before you take the course. ",
            "\u00a0It honestly depends on your professor. I know Sudesh was a big name, especially when choosing courses, but Pam really deserves to be recognized as a fantastic professor as well. \r\nNo matter who your professor is, however, be prepared to attack a lot of content in this course. "
