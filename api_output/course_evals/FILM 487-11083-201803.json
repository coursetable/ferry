            "\u00a0This class lent itself well to developing each person's skills since it was small. The workshopping process was helpful for me even when my work wasn't being workshopped. Professor Lapadula brought in some great guests who shared their perspectives on screenwriting, and the other students always had great questions and feedback that facilitated the process of improving as a screenwriter. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the first steps to creating not just a screenplay but a feature-length screenplay, as well as knowledge about the industry. ",
            "\u00a0In the process of learning how to write a feature-length screenplay and I am excited to continue that work next semester in this year-long class. ",
            "\u00a0I am crafting my storytelling, as I write a full length screenplay. He has taught story structuring and writing concise screenplays well. ",
            "\u00a0Advanced Screenwriting is a great capstone and necessary class for students wanting to pursue screenwriting. It serves as a balance between the academic and professional world. It allows you to work on your craft while getting the valuable feedback of your peers in a writing room style. Not only do you gain valuable feedback, but by reading your fellow classmates scripts you become more adept at learning what makes a good story in discussing their script with them. Other professional screenwriters are brought into the class which serves as a nice balance to hear what the industry is currently like. "

            "\u00a0The course is great how it is, except that the time conflicts with athletic practices, just like every other creativity based class Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I'm a big fan of the workshop environment that this class fosters. It could use more structured exercises, though. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Class speakers, class engagement \r\nWeaknesses- It should be once every two weeks during the first semester, as most people do not have a screenplay written ",
            "\u00a0The course is very strong overall. My only suggestion is that it would be nice to have an occasional lecture for a change of pace, but I understand how this can not always be the case since we need to get through every students script. "
