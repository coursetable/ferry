            "\u00a0I appreciate the way this course made me consider the politics of comparative literature. For too long I had conceived of comparison as an entirely literary pursuit. The syllabus was a nice mix of readings I had expected and others that broadened my understanding of the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the aims and techniques of literary comparison, and some of the tensions which accompany it. ",
            "\u00a0That comparison is a lot more complicated than we assume it to be. We compare all the time, and yet in so many different contexts and ways, all carrying different implications and purposes. We explored everything from comparison between literary texts to theory on exoticism. This is a fundamental course for the comparative literature and should be kept. "

        [
            "\u00a0I wish we had done more the the reading posts. I felt that people spent a lot of time writing and thinking about them. Sometimes too bad that we didnt share them. I wish that we had better treated the filmic and operatic texts. ",
            "\u00a0The class was a weird mix of theory and practice. Its structure was very similar to How to Read, especially in the beginning, and it kind of felt like a continuation of LITR 130 instead of its own course. Also, the organizing theme of the course was \"how to compare,\" but I don't think the course answered any of my questions about the value of comparison/comparative literature. It posed a lot of great questions, but I was really hoping for some answers. Finally, I wish there had been more flexibility/options regarding our essay prompts. ",
            "\u00a0The course was good overall and many of the readings were interesting. However, in the beginning of the semester, it felt like there wasn't a lot of coherence in our readings and discussions from week to week. Also, the quality of our class discussions was fairly inconsistent sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths -- ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Much better than How to Read, with a clear(er) purpose and a more specific topic that underlies the major. Two professors coteaching were great to have as they were able to supplement, support, and check each other during class.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes the discussion got quite heady and some of us lost track of what was being discussed/what was at stake in the conversation. There is no real way to avoid the theory, but it does get a little tedious sometimes in a way that discussing primary source literature does not.\r\n\r\nSolution: Perhaps explain even basic concepts to those not as familiar with the world of literature? I know it's Yale, but this is (or is at least advertised as) an introductory, prerequisite course after all. It's not really fair to people who are not as well-versed in the history and theory of literature to assume that they are and conduct a conversation that sometimes ends up being exclusive based on this knowledge. We can find simple ways to level the playing field in the classroom, and this may be one of them. Overall though, the course pushed me positively. "

            "\u00a0I would not have taken this class if it weren't required for the major. But I am so glad that I did. And I highly recommend it. \r\n\r\nThe professors had such a sharp dynamic. Great co-teaching experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if Marta is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone thinking about majoring in comparative literature. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it is a good course to begin with and as the years go by, it will improve (since it is a new course). How to Compare is not easy. There's a decent amount of reading, much of it densely theoretical, so be prepared. The paper topics, especially for the final paper, can be challenging. But the content and the professors provide a stimulating environment that gets at the root of comparison and its consequences. "
