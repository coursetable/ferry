            "\u00a0More structure with readings to enhance lecture would be helpful. I thought that problem sets worked well, but could also be used as an opportunity to look at raw data and understand the applications of isotope theory. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- instructor with in depth knowledge of subject matter, availability for questions, excellent textbook and online resources that were informative and provided multiple modes of explanation. Problem sets were educational, and aligned with the course learning objects. Enjoyed having post doc presentations to learn about other research in the department. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- student background was a little disparate, especially between graduates and undergraduates. More clarification would have been nice IRT what sort of equations were necessarily to memorize etc. "

            "\u00a0Yes! Alan is an entertaining lecturer and an understanding instructor. He is approachable and clearly loves to talk about geochemistry. This is a great course to take if you are entirely unfamiliar with isotope geochemistry. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, isotope geochemistry was a useful course and there were plenty of resources to delve deeper into the material than could be covered in lecture. ",
