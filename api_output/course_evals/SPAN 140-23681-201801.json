            "\u00a0I developed my Spanish grammar greatly, specifically in the area of subjunctive, past and present, and if clauses. I also developed my vocabulary and fluidness when speaking in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0After this semester I definitely saw an improvement in my conversational skills especially because of the discusses that were held after readings. ",
            "\u00a0Conversation, reading, writing, and critical thinking in Spanish. Probably the best Spanish conversation course I've taken so far. ",
            "\u00a0Improved my Spanish speaking, writing, and reading skills. ",
            "\u00a0Spanish language, grammar, culture, etc. ",

            "\u00a0I think the short stories were very interesting and our discussions on them helped me improve my oral abilities, but sometimes the class seemed too rote in that we did the same assignments for almost every reading. I think there could have been more variety. ",
            "\u00a0I think compared to L3 -- this course is less organized. For L3, it was really clear what we should study for each test and what the objective of certain lessons were -- but this class was overall less organized. It was still fairly structured though -- and improved our grammar by repeatedly testing the same concepts. I think it could be improved though by more clarity on what to study and more flexible rubrics on grading (often times points are deducted when you demonstrated correct thinking due to rigid rubrics). ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more activities and applications of grammar during class and in class. I also do not think vhl is a great platform to learn skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great for discussions and I felt that all the assessments were fair. Mostly, I was very engaged in this course. The second oral presentation seemed very daunting, because it asked us to summarize incredibly broad topics (\"Mexican Political Issues in the 1950s,\" for example), of which we had no previous knowledge or coursework. I also strongly suggest that we stop watching \"Fotonovela.\" It's inane and unfunny. ",
            "\u00a0well-organized, less homework than previous classes (which is a positive as you could focus better on each assignment), great texts ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely well organized and Maripaz was always looking for ways to help her students improve. There were plenty of exercises and grammar activities to reinforce lessons, as well as interesting questions. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of focus on vocabulary and reading.  The stories are interesting and the assignments are fair.  The organization of the class is definitely a strong point.  That being said, there is very little development of on-the-fly speaking ability. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a big focus on grammar. The weaknesses were the methods the material was presented. It was all power points or call and response on worksheets which favors a particle type of learner. I was not one of those learners and therefore struggled heavily and unnecessarily with the way the material was presented. I'd highly consider the ways Maripaz structures her classes, as the way they are done now favors a certain type of gregarious student with a certain skill. "
