            "\u00a0Learned Rotoscoping animation, how to use Maya 2018 fundamentals and also explored a great variety of contemporary animation artists ",
            "\u00a0I got to learn a lot technical aspects of unity, maya and lots of hands-on work with stop motion and rotoscope. ",
            "\u00a0A greater ability and confidence in my artistic ability. ",
            "\u00a0I learned what contemporary animation looks like in fine art. I learned that there is a space for it, and a history I can dig into to inform my work. I really enjoyed the course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This was a very well done course, I think the hardest part is that it met for 4 hours on a Friday. But overall, a really good strength of the class was the professor's proficiency in other contemporary animation artists and the breadth of talent that we got exposed to over the course of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course lies truly in the students. The course allows for students to interpret animation from their own artistic background, ranging from virtual reality to sculpture animations. This made the class experience much more meaningful, because I had the chance to see what my contemporaries were up to in their own practices. However, this is also a weakness, because there is no formal teaching of the concepts of animation. This was exacerbated by the professor's absence most of the time. I believe with more structure and a professor that is more present, the class can improve. ",
            "\u00a0Great course with incredible guest visits. Professor was very helpful "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students if they are willing to take some of the class's learning into their own hands outside of the classroom. ",
            "\u00a0definitely a fantastic way to increase your engagement and develop your comfort with building an animation comfort level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Because of the time involved in making an animation requires the structure this class offers, especially if you're working towards developing your own voice. You need the loose structure for the time to see labor intensive processes through and time to react to the discoveries. ",
            "\u00a0This class was mostly an opportunity to develop a relationship with Fed, who is a successful artist in nyc right now. "
