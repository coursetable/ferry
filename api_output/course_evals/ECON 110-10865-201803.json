            "\u00a0I learned about Microeconomics and its implications on behavior of people and firms. As the semester went on, we saw how the mathematical models we worked on in the beginning of the course, predicted and shaped what we actually saw in the real world today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Microeconomic skills from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Through this course, I developed skills in understanding basic microeconomic concepts. As a consumer, the idea of maximizing utility, including now vs. in the future, and analysis of firm supply, demand, and costs were all touched upon. The course requires critical thinking to really get these concepts down as well as helped with graphical interpretations. ",
            "\u00a0This courses introduces a covers a multitude of important economic topics, but more importantly enables you to think and analyze the world as an economist. ",
            "\u00a0I developed knowledge about basic economic patterns and trends. ",
            "\u00a0Aside from learning the rudimentary basics of microeconomics, I developed skills in answering certain types of questions. I figured out how to read each part of the question, simplifying it, and then using what I've learned to attack each part. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic insights into economics, mostly learned how to interpret certain graphs in relation with economic principles and problems. ",
            "\u00a0Basic economic problem-solving. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first economics course I took and I really enjoyed it. I learned a lot about my own study habits because the textbook was a bit dense, clunky, and full of unnecessarily long explanations but it was impossible to understand everything through the lectures and study guides alone. ",
            "\u00a0Basic microeconomics ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn the foundations of and the theories that underlie microeconomics. I was able to think critically about how many people make everyday decisions and the interesting aspects of behavioral economics that are expectedly \"irrational.\" ",
            "\u00a0Like high school IB HL Econonics but with a lot more math involved, including partial derivatives. (Plus more concepts regarding game theory and such) ",
            "\u00a0I learned the fundamentals of the study of economics, and how to think logically to apply ideas to real-life examples. ",

            "\u00a0The class forces students to work together to answer mini questions to check their comprehension during the class. I found these very helpful, and they often explored hidden nuances in the theory or assumptions of our models. The professor and her TA were also available for office hours.\r\n\r\nThe class is taught through powerpoint presentations. While the professor explains what is on the slides very well, having slides is not that engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the course gave me a good understanding of microeconomics. I had previously taken the course in high school and this course strengthened what I already knew and then some more information. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very thoroughly explained both in the book and in each class. There were several examples of each concept that facilitated understanding. One weakness of the course was the reliance on memorization of formulas. ",
            "\u00a0The course needs a lot more practical application of the theory. Very few examples were used in class and we did not spend very much time on them when we did use them. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps if the slides were a bit more informative it could be better: even if one is in class and paying attention they're bound to miss something so it would be nice if all of the information was on the slides as a safety net. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that there are weekly problem sets that arent too difficult. If you need help with the material, the professor and grader are available for office hours. However there are a few weaknesses. Many of the topics in the textbook are covered superficially during lecture. A lot of the time the work seems repetitive, plugging numbers into equations to get an answer. Another weakness is that if you dont know how to complete a problem from exposure during lecture then it is difficult to figure out the steps to solve it. This could be resolved by going over more examples during class. ",
            "\u00a0Its like bitter medicine that I know is good for me, but has very little sugar to help go down. ",
            "\u00a0The information was presented well, but it was hard to retain since every lecture we were shown a bunch of graphs, models, and line names we had to memorize. It would help if there was a review sheet or handout summarizing relationships. It was also hard to know what I didn't know. I came into exams thinking I was fully prepared and I left them thinking I answered everything right, but I ended up getting poor grades on those exams. ",
            "\u00a0Some concepts were not well explained ",
            "\u00a0Strengths include obtaining a large breadth of information within the microeconomics field. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses include learning content that does not seem to be very applicable in real life. Daily reminders of how these \"perfect world\" and \"rational\" topics are relevant to real life would facilitate learning. Most of the time, we're just learning theories that are not applicable and helping students see why these theories are important would definitely help. Another weakness is the course relies too much on the textbook which is dense and sometimes confusing. A ",
            "\u00a0It feels like some concepts could have simply been explained better, but at least there were review sessions, office hours and tutors to help students along the way. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is in its seminar style, which is conducive to student participation. I liked the fact that students could freely ask questions to the instructor. Still, the course was mostly conducted as a lecture with minimal student input. I would like to see more vibrant class discussions in this regard. ",
            "\u00a0The material could be dry at times and the lectures were not always very engaging. Also, the same students who had prior experience with microeconomics would often dominate class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the presentations could be made more engaging, certain topics could have been better understood and more practice/samples for the final test could have been made evident. Strength was the organization and consistency. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend this course. It is good for beginners with little to no previous experience with economics and eases you into the basics. It is also good to start thinking about how it is that economic interactions are maximized on the consumer and supplier side. ",

Although there were some interesting applications to the real world, most of the problems and solutions were very unrealistic. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its valuable knowledge, but beware of snakes. ",

            "\u00a0Yes very useful ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who needs it for their major or someone who has a passion for economics. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it. It was hard and confusing and you don't really learn concepts that you can apply to real life, except for the one unit entitled \"behavioral economics.\" ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who wishes to build solid foundations for the study of economics, as long as they do not care about the class curve. ",
