            "\u00a0This course gave me a very detailed method by which I can approach learning new repertoire. I learned six pieces myself, and heard much more about the history of folk songs (my semester's theme). I also learned a lot of technique from listening to other students workshop their pieces, and tried to speak Hungarian on top of it all! ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how to healthily sing and how to sing in other languages. ",
            "\u00a0Singing skills in a classical sense ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to study, learn, and perform art song literature. I learned about folk song tradition in vocal music. I also furthered my skills in learning German and Hungarian. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a bit about music theory and a bit about different dialects, but almost nothing about singing or performing. ",
            "\u00a0Not much. This course is mostly listening to recordings, other singers, and how to pronounce a few words of a different language for a song. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Professor Lalli is a great vocal coach and an enthusiastic teacher. The repertoire, both available and suggested, was an incredible selection, and such a treat to sing. The one weakness in the course is the amount of time listening to other students, but with this design of the class, very little can be done about it. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives great personal feedback and helps us learn to conquer any stage fright by making us sing in front of the class every week. However, the class itself can get a little boring while everyone else is singing, especially because it is a two hour class. However, it is worth it for the vocal improvement! ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is great because of the performance opportunities. However, it is pretty demanding because of the rate at which music needs to be learned. ",
            "\u00a0The course did not focus on performance or on vocal technique whatsoever; it was a lot more centered around memorizing songs and mastering different dialects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are: the talent of all the people in the room and the type of music that we study. Weaknesses: lack of technical training, practicality of learning to pronounce a few words is low. There was a lot of busy work and what felt like arbitrary memorization. "

            "\u00a0Take it! Professor Lalli is such fun to work with, and the repertoire he makes available is really incredible. You'll learn so much from the semester, in singing technique and in odd facts or histories of your pieces. If you learn music easily, the class isn't too much work; if you don't, it takes time but can still be wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0No. In my opinion, the professor was catty and he rarely helped us directly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take this class! It is a little strange in how it is organized but it is so amazing working with Lalli and Sara and you will grow so much so fast as a singer, even if you've never sung classically before. ",
            "\u00a0I do not recommend this class to another student. Some people take this class more than once, and I really dont understand why. The class is overall excessively demanding and expects an unfair amount from non-classical singers. The feedback is poor and the grading is harsh. At least one student this semester dropped this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a relatively interesting course with a very nice professor who clearly cared. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to be a better singer, definitely take this course. It will make a better and more intelligent performer. ",
            "\u00a0No. The course was about busywork. ",
            "\u00a0No. It was fun at times but I didn't feel that I learned very much or acquired any useful skills. "
