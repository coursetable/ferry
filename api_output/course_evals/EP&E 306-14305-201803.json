            "\u00a0- Greatly improved my writing\r\n- Fantastic discussion in class really helped me better articulate my ideas \r\n- Gained better ability to identify what's important when reading a court case\r\n- Legal citations ",
            "\u00a0I developed an ability to understand the similarities, connections, and differences between law and ethics in more detail, and learned a lot about what the First Amendment says we can and cannot do. I also learned to write in a more clear and straightforward way, and communicate complex legal insights in a way that can be understood on paper and in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Breaking down legal cases, understanding the complexity of First amendment rights, and balancing the public interest to make that judgment. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the nuances of the First Amendment and its application to various dynamic and sophisticated Connecticut Supreme Court and US Supreme Court cases. Professor Goodrow creates such a positive learning environment that promotes input from all perspectives on personal and moral ethics and individual regards on how the First Amendment is reasonable applied today. ",
            "\u00a0Knowledge about the First Amendment tradition in the American constitution and the way ethics are embedded in legal interpretations of the constitution. ",
            "\u00a0We would discuss both the legal and ethical obligations of the cases we read and discuss whether or not we agreed with the court decision. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome foray into First Amendment law. You definitely learn how to synthesize and analyze lengthy and complex legal cases in a matter of sentencesa  crucial skill for anyone interested in a law career. You will also be well-versed in First Amendment history by the semester's end. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a long discussion about First Amendment restrictions, what they are, how the case law developed, as well as what are the limitations, what should they be, etc.  It is a primarily analytical discussion-based class.  You will walk out with an understanding about the complexities of First Amendment cases, this class is much more about honing discussion (read argumentative) skills than a First Amendment caselaw history class.

            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n\r\n- Karen Goodrow's passion for the subject is contagious, I found myself very involved in the material\r\n- Great classmates, great discussion\r\n- Reading was very fun\r\n- Enjoyed the assignments\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\n- Some of the classes could have used more structure; they often strayed from the material and the law in general\r\n- Overall fantastic course, fantastic professor ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that everyone in the room had an opinion to express, so our dialogue as a class was really interesting and exciting and I felt incredibly engaged in class when we would talk. I also think the essay assignments were interesting and we received really great feedback on them. I also think Professor Goodrow was fair about the amount of reading she assigned and was fair about understanding when students did not understand every aspect of them. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course is that I wish there were a little more room to debate about free speech and its ethics in a more contemporary way! Instead of writing an essay on Lenny Bruce, I think it would be interesting to take an issue that is more prevalent in current culture and have us analyze that (or, having us pick our own issue and analyze them using First Amendment concepts!). ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor - she's just simply amazing. I feel like others can testify about the strengths of a professor who is still working in her field.\r\nWeaknesses: I think the professor might let the students talk a little too much. I would have preferred the professor to have said more comments to lead the discussion that, when done, always pushed my thinking. ",
            "\u00a0No kidding, this class has ONLY strengths. Professor Goodrow is the strongest strength Her teaching style promotes such a friendly, warm, and inviting learning environment that makes all perspectives feel welcome. Her expertise as a judge allows for the course to move beyond scholarly observance to real life experience. She is one of a kind and Yale is lucky to have her. ",
            "\u00a0The assignments in this course were fun and a little challenging. The perfect mix. ",
            "\u00a0Class discussions were fascinating and always rife with interesting contrasting viewpoints. Written assignments were similarly engaging. I loved when Professor Goodrow intervened during in-class debates to twist the hypothetical somehow it was an excellent analytical exercise. Really no suggestions for how to improve. An outstanding course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Judge Goodrow is a great professor.  She loves class, is very passionate about the material, and truly cares about her students.  If she cannot answer a question immediately, she will take the time to research it and come to the next class with an answer.   The class can be dominated by certain speakers, which can get a bit stifling, but generally very good discussions in class and class is always engaging.  Feedback is good.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Not many.  Sometimes class can get dominated by some people, and discussions can get into a tangent, but usually a very good tangent. "

            "\u00a0Would strongly recommend, it's a fun, challenging course with a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in learning more about the ethical basis of things in society, as well as case law and different facets of law as they apply to our free speech rights. Anyone also interested in having interesting and engaging discussion in seminar should really do this, because the class really tests your understanding simply in discussion. ",
            "\u00a0YES. 100%. Even if you're only slightly interested in law and/or fundamental rights. I almost fell into the trap of law school taking this course. ",
            "\u00a0YES, if you can get into this course, absolutely take it. You'd be a fool if you didn't. Even if this course isn't entirely relevant to your major, the exposure to Professor Goodrow and her expertise is once-in-a-lifetime Yale material. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you can get in. The cases are interesting and the discussions we had were fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You come away with a deep understanding of the United States' extraordinary commitment to free speech, and the social/cultural controversies that commitment naturally incites. Class discussions were a great opportunity to demonstrate both your mastery of the readings and also your logic/reasoning skills. Written assignments were fascinating and often even fun to complete. Professor Goodrow is wonderful: approachable, but not afraid to firmly dispute your thought process (often for the sake of debate). A great class to challenge your modes of argumentation. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student.  Judge Goodrow is a fantastic professor and it is such a great experience to discuss these issues every week with her.  It is a high-energy class, and people do not hold back on their viewpoints.  Be prepared to be assertive. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is a great overview of First Amendment case law, and provides a really solid background of the key issue areas related to current free speech debates. Professor Goodrow is excellent and really cares about her students. She took the time from her busy schedule (she is still a judge in addition to teaching on the side) to go through my midterm with me line by line. She makes seminars fun and engaging, and this has honestly been my favorite seminar experience at Yale. If you're really interested in the class, I'd highly suggest pre-registering if at all possible, as it's often in high demand. "
