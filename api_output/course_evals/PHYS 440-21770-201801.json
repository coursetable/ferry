I have a fairly good grasp basically all of the topics covered, from the time-independent Schrdinger equation to angular momentum and spin in 3 dimensions. I also feel like I understand in general how quantum particles behave and how they are so different from classical objects. This class made me interested in quantum physics, and I would like to take more courses in the subject. ",

            "\u00a0Professor Skiba is a fantastic lecturer. The best thing about him is how he encourages question. There is not a single professor at Yale who is as accepting or encouraging of questions as Skiba. Every class, he will almost always force people to ask questions. I've never felt uncomfortable expressing my confusion to him. However, this does come at the cost of class time. Every class, people would ask so many questions that Skiba would rush through the last ten minutes of class due to running out of time. I think Skiba can encourage questions, but he should recognize when he's taking too many. If he told people to come to office hours or ask after class, that would make lectures feel less rushed. That's my only qualm with the class but it's not a deal breaker. ",
            "\u00a0Skiba! Is! The! Best!\r\nIt also really helps that he follows the Griffiths textbook so closely, which makes it very easy to check back for notes. ",
            "\u00a0A good first semester in quantum mechanics. The questions are often quite interesting - the most fun material is in the discussion of harmonic oscillator and hydrogen atoms. Some of the other toy examples feel a bit contrived at times, though of course they serve as simple systems that help us understand a more general picture. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, based off of an excellent textbook, well-taught\r\nWeaknesses: assumes at times a greater level of student mastery of prerequisite material than might be expected (granted, I also did not take the physics prerequisites, so I may just be an outlier, but I did find the mathematics to be a bit over my head in any case) ",
            "\u00a0The curriculum covered is thorough a a good semester's work. However, towards the end the course felt rushed and could probably be paced better. ",
            "\u00a0Could go a little faster. We do go a bit slow through the material. Would also be nice if we used Shankar instead of Griffiths. Griffiths is nice, but Shankar is really clear when it comes to formalism. ",
            "\u00a0Such an interesting subject. The material was fascinating, although sometimes, it would have been nice if the physical meaning of the math we were doing was reiterated because often I'd lose track of what the numbers meant. Lecturer was excellent and class was very enjoyable! ",
            "\u00a0Good lecturer, psets were very interesting, material very interesting\r\n\r\nLoved the teaching style of going quickly then stopping for questions ",
            "\u00a0The material and problem-sets were great. It was also nice that the class followed the textbook closely. ",
            "\u00a0Really interesting material! The lectures could be a little more coherent at the beginning of the semester, but by the end of the semester they had definitely found their rhythm and were lining up with the textbook nicely. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Skiba is extremely engaging, personable, brilliant. Insightful homework. Lectures are very clear and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to have spent more time in 3-dimensions. I felt that the linear algebra review could have been compressed. MATH 222/225 or physics equivalent should be a prerequisite. Either you know it or you don't, and there's no sense in devoting 3-4 classes to this, and then rushing the last unit. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting material and fair pace of learning\r\nWeaknesses: Occasionally the concepts became very involved and the intuitions behind these concepts were essentially lost. More emphasis on recapping how to think about certain concepts would be a great help ",
            "\u00a0This course was a little fast paced, and Professor Skiba said this is basically a 3 semester course in 2 semesters. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures for this class were a lot of mathematical proofs, it was very difficult to understand how to do problems given that teaching. This is a general flaw of the physics department at Yale: lectures don't teach us the steps on how to solve physics problem, just proofs and theoretical framework. It would be so much better to have a class that says \"for a problem like this, you need to first do x, then y, then z, keeping in mind...\" to show us how to actually do these types of problems. Also, the homework problems don't correspond to the exam problems. I found the material very interesting and I enjoyed the professor a lot, I just felt like I wasn't learning because the material was so difficult to sift through what is or is not needed for problem solving. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are that the textbook is thorough, so even if you miss class or do not understand something from class, the textbook will almost always be a huge help. Additionally, the professor is engaging and spends as much time as necessary answering any and all questions during class. The TAs were also very helpful and always posted solutions for the problem sets and were available outside of class to meet if you needed extra help. The weaknesses are that it seemed that the class contained students with a large range of previous knowledge, and sometimes the students who were newer to the topic struggled to keep up. Very often, the more knowledgeable students would ask many advanced questions during class which only confused other students more and made it intimidating for other students to ask more basic questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well balanced, but I think it could use getting to the formalism slightly faster. As long as you keep up with the work you come out with a solid understanding of quantum mechanics on a theoretical level. That said, there is very little relating it back to the physical world. ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures are very interactive and students asked a lot of good questions. ",
            "\u00a0The course was incredibly theoretical (math focused) and I feel as though at times the explanations could have been supplemented by examples of experiments that either proved or demonstrated the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness with this course, at least in my opinion, was the amount of time we spent learning linear algebra. I could be wrong, but I felt that that part of the course could have been sped up. ",
            "\u00a0Great course. Great professor and insightful homework. Textbook was also very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course; I appreciate how Skiba's lectures followed the text, without mimicking it. Honestly, on both the midterm and final, I felt more confident with the physics than my grade reflected. I think, in both cases, some of the problems demanded intense calculations (i.e. solving a nasty system of equations, and diagonalizing a tricky matrix) that clouded my ability to showcase my knowledge of the physics. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths is Skiba's deep willingness to answer questions, which isn't often the case in STEM classes. This is something way more teachers should encourage. The lectures are alright, generally pretty similar to the textbook. The PSETs are good for understanding the material in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0It's very helpful that it follows Griffith's so closely. Otherwise, it's just kind of a hard subject ",
            "\u00a0This was an exceptionally strong course. The workload was very intense but doable and very suited for the level of the course. The professor was incredible and it was very well taught. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the lectures (Professor Skiba is a great lecturer) and the problem sets were fun. I actually looked forward to doing them on occasion. One weakness is that the exams are only 3-4 questions long, and for being such a large part of your grade coming from 7 questions, it can be stressful. ",
            "\u00a0Skiba is a great teacher, but the in-class material can very easily go over one's head because of how much algebra (especially linear algebra when it comes in) is involved. It's easy to get hung up in the math and not understand the lecture, which is bad because the conceptual questions on exams typically come from more involved questions of what he talks about in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0its good ",
            "\u00a0This course is hands down the best undergraduate physics class. The material is fun and engaging, and because the topics are spread across two semesters, it really allows for an in-depth formulation of quantum. Nothing needs to be changed. "

            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Don't take 439, get the real deal in 440 and 441 ",
            "\u00a0A good introduction to quantum mechanics! An axiomatic approach to working with the wavefunction: issues of time-dependence, and then various potentials in which to solve the Schrodinger equation. ",
            "\u00a0As a non-physics major interested in QM, I'm very happy I took this course and would definitely recommend it to another student. I was in a bit over my head, having skipped out on the physics prerequisites, and often times the math was faster than I could actively keep up with, but during the final I remarked that I had actually developed a good initial grasp on the conceptual and mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. The class itself is exceptionally well-taught; Skiba is entertaining and insightful; and perhaps most importantly it's based on students asking questions about the material (Skiba requires a question be asked at least once every 6 or so minutes, or he'll threaten to sit in silence until someone does...while more relaxed in practice, this demonstrates the importance of questions to the function of the course). This really enables the curious student to take advantage of their class time--this isn't another, ordinary lecture, but also an open forum where one comes to learn and to resolve their misunderstandings and hazy spots. The workload is greater than most classes, but it won't take over your life. The exams are heavily weighted but generally very fair in terms of difficulty. On the whole, I've learned a lot of new mathematics (which will help me in my future as an engineer), hopefully some cool physics too, but best of all, quenched a long-held desire to formally study QM. I can't wait to take 441. ",

It's a really interesting look at physics and a fun way to see how higher mathematics really does have consequential applications. It's pretty cool to understand where the Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes from. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in a growing field but also ready to put in the work in running your brain against concepts that don't quite make sense as we're used to then yes. The course really stretches you in figuring out a way to understand very complex concepts. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Quantum is so interesting and the conceptual stuff is pretty mind-blowing =) ",
            "\u00a0No, don't take this unless you need to or are very interested. It was endlessly confusing and lectures didn't teach you how to do the homework. I genuinely thought the material was interesting, it just was so difficult to get meaning out of it in order to do problems. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The material is really interesting, and the more you study and read about it, the more fascinating and exciting it becomes. Just be warned that the math in the first half of the semester is very long and tedious but not difficult. The math in the second half of the semester is less tedious but more advanced (linear algebra). ",
            "\u00a0If you know some linear algebra and multivariable calculus, I would highly recommend taking this course. Even if you aren't a physics major, quantum mechanics is trippy and fun and a good challenge as a mode of thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will definitely recommend this class to other students as I think Prof Skiba is a very good professor. He is very good at explaining the physics of a problem. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to any student with a half decent math background who wants to learn the basics of the quantum world. It is a very interesting class for the most part. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely take this course. The material is fascinating, the professor is helpful and kind, the homework is insightful and helps with understanding the material, and the textbook is well-written. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely; Professor Skiba is an engaging lecturer and the course itself is very intellectually rewarding. While the exams were quite difficult, the problems sets weren't overwhelming (though, in some cases, they were a bit algebra-intense). We didn't really deal with any 'deep' math, but our flirtations with linear algebra were quite rewarding in their own right. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Although much of the initial part of quantum mechanics is a slog, there really is some profoundness to understanding the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics and the way that uncertainty arises from non-commutativity. Would recommend reading some of the MIT Quantum Physics lecture notes from OCW, as well as reading the textbook very carefully and understanding the concepts covered in PSETs as deeply as you can. The course takes a fair bit of work, but Skiba is one of the rare profs who does give a strong effort at answering questions. ",
            "\u00a0Im happy I took this course even though I don't think I necessarily did that well, and I will take the second semester in the fall ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course for those with great math/physics backgrounds. The problem sets are the right level of difficulty and fun (at this point, if you are considering taking quantum, you like solving this stuff).  Prof. Skiba is very nice and is enthralling lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to anybody with a strong math and science background. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to all who need it/ have the time to put into it. If you're planning on having a very busy semester, do not take this course and expect to do super well in it. The weekly problem sets are difficult and time-consuming, and the exams are fair/challenging but the conceptual questions will eat you alive. I took this course credit/d and ended up having to put as much effort into it as my other more important courses because of how much time the problem sets took, which was pretty frustrating. I advise you to find a good study group early. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course if Professor Skiba is teaching it.  He makes lectures fun and engaging, while still managing to teach you a ton. Regardless of who is teaching, this class is one of the better classes in the physics department because of how the class is structured: it is split into two semesters. In addition, the topics discussed are some of the most fun physics you'll learn. "
