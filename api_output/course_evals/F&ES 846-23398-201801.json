            "\u00a0Interdisciplinary look at looking at environmental justice issues: public health, qualitative, quantitative, social science, environmental science. Deep analysis and reflection required every week on readings which helped me gain analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to learn the fundamental principles of environmental justice and how to use those principles to evaluate other situations and recognize environmental justices happening in other communities. ",
            "\u00a0Writing skills - with weekly writing responses and feedbacks from the professors.\r\nCritical thinking skills\r\nKnowledge about Environmental justice. ",
            "\u00a0Much and many. I learned about the history, theory, and practice of environmental justice theory and activism in the US, about research in the social sciences and in public health aimed at identifying and remedying environmental injustices, and about cases of environmental injustice around the world. ",
            "\u00a0This class nicely merged the social aspects with the technical aspects of EJ. It highlighted the difficulties in addressing both and offered solutions to overcome them. ",
            "\u00a0This is a fantastic class that has been really inspiring and helped change the way I approach and consider environmental problems.  Essentially you learn that there is (primarily) racial inequality in essentially every environmental issue that people face today and throughout history, and through this class you explore the roots of the environmental justice movement which also focuses on the history of environmentalism and the civil rights era, major EJ issues today, and tools and methods (both successful and less successful) that have been used to address them.  This class is applicable to essentially anything you might be interested in because many of these issues are both intersectional but also very interdisciplinary, so law, medicine, forestry, public health, even economics are relevant. "

        [
            "\u00a0Everything aligned but I did think I'd gain more of a concrete knowledge on the law aspects of environmental justice rather than just one class period of it. ",
            "\u00a0My expectations for this course were fully met. I expected to learn the fundamentals of environmental justice, how these principles are used to bring awareness to other injustices, and how best to deal with and provide remedies for environmental injustices. ",
            "\u00a0This course fulfills my expectations completely. ",
            "\u00a0Fairly well. This was not a statistics or public health course, but I expected to learn more about quantitative methods in environmental justice research. Or rather, I expected to learn more about Professors Doolittle and Bell's research. ",
            "\u00a0Very well. It was exactly what I expected. ",
            "\u00a0This class exceeded expectations--I did not just learn about certain environmental justice issues but learned to approach issues in new ways, to identify events as representative of environmental justice and symptoms of a much larger problem, and to really adjust my thinking.  I loved that our professors came from such different disciplines--social science with qualitative approaches and climate/data science with very quantitative approaches because this class was unique in giving you the tools of both for the same issues and events.  This class has been inspiring. "

            "\u00a0I think bringing in outside speakers would be great instead of having so many student presentations. Getting people of color to come in to help inform students on environmental justice issues is imperative. Also I thought there was too much student presentation; I wanted to learn more from practitioners and professors rather than students. ",
            "\u00a0A major strength of the course was definitely the focus on student participation. I thought discussing these topics with my student peers allowed me the opportunity to analyze class issues more thoroughly and from different perspectives. It allowed me to be more well-rounded when approaching these issues. Another strength of the course was definitely both Professor Doolittle and Bell's lectures. Having lecturers from different backgrounds teach on the same subject from their perspectives was eye-opening and invaluable. \r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of was the lectures were sometimes too short. Adding more case studies and really getting into the details of some of the topics would have been really helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I like the ample time for discussions during classes. I hope there could be more debates and different perspectives during the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The course is pretty involved in terms of leading a class, writing a paper, and the weekly responses. I think all aspects of the weekly response were good, but maybe more of a focus on the final project earlier -- it felt like it kind of creeped up at the end and was fairly stressful. I think people didn't start earlier since the coursework is pretty involved (in a good way). Maybe around that February deadline or earlier ask for a rough draft so it's not like everything gets written at the end during a stressful period? \r\n\r\nIn terms of class discussion, there was a lot of good conversations -- so definitely keep that as a focus for lecture. All of the power points were pretty good and informative, though sometimes just a little quick. There was definitely a desire to get to the conversations in the second half, though maybe a little less time on those could make them more focused? \r\n\r\nOverall, very few complaints about a first time course. Just balancing some of the lectures, more focus on the final earlier, and maybe a little slower on some of the lecture portions. Some more feedback is useful and helpful -- sometimes did not feel like we had enough of it. ",
            "\u00a0Covered really good material. Some class conversations were better than others, but overall I liked the format - half professor lecture, half student run discussion. I didn't receive much feedback on written work. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course. As I said in the mid-term evaluation, this course was well-conceived and well-executed. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic lectures from Michelle and Amity.  The readings were always engaging, interesting, and thought-provoking and were very manageable, and the content, lessons, and discussions were meant to change the way we approached topics.  The only weaknesses I can think of is maybe a little more coordination between lectures and discussion leaders but this was only an issues a few times. "

            "\u00a0Don't be afraid of asking hard questions! ",
            "\u00a0I would say: this is a great class and the type of background that every F&ES student should have. However, I would also say that 1) you will not feel super great after coming out from these heavy topics and 2) this is going to be quite a bit of work so make sure you leave time for it if you want to get a lot out of it!\r\n\r\nAmity & Michelle are fantastic, so passionate, and inspiring. So great to learn from them! ",
            "\u00a0Really good class. Start your final paper early, and meet with the professors for feedback. ",
            "\u00a0This class should be core to the FES curriculum. The EJ lens now informs all the work I do. It is truly valuable and you should take it! ",
            "\u00a0Take this class!  It will make you a better person by forcing you to confront issues that much of the world (even those involved in environmentalism) easily disregards, for apathy or ignorance.  This class is not only engaging but will force you to be a better global, local, and environmental citizen. "
