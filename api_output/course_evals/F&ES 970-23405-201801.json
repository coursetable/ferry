Had my client been distant and distracted like in the case of some other teams, I would not have considered this class worth my time. Luckily, my team was reliable, and moreover, my client was committed to ensuring we receive necessary guidance while also allowing us to assert ownership of the project. ",

            "\u00a0The once-a-week classes are sometimes informative and other times difficult to stay engaged. I wish the speakers were not all representing the public sector. Despite EPC serving public sector clients, I wish the outside speakers that were brought in were professionals with private sector consulting experience, especially given most of us do not have that kind of formal training as \"consultants.\" ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: ability to choose a project that you are interested in/care about; instructors as resources ",
            "\u00a0Some of the class lectures (such as the one by Dave Hawkins) was not very engaging. I also didn't think the \"career chats\" with guest speakers were very useful. ",

            "\u00a0The in-class time for EPC is a definite weakness of the course. If students are on their computers checking email or skipping class, the question should not be: how can we make class mandatory or how can we ban computers from the class? Rather, it should be: why don't students find class engaging or worthwhile? It's harsh, but true. Class doesn't feel useful or relevant. I would suggest making class more about how to best deal with clients and work in groups. That is the kind of information that would be useful to EVERY group. Maybe there is a way to draw on some of the coursework for a class like \"Foundations of working with people,\" taught by Stuart Decew and Brad Gentry. I class that merged \"Foundations of working with people\" with \"EPC\" would probably be stronger than either class is currently. There is some important synergy between these two courses that should be explored. \r\n\r\nThe course could also be improved by offering projects with smaller environmental groups. The projects list is dominated by the \"Big Greens\" (i.e. NRDC, EDF, TNC, WWF, etc.). These groups don't need free labor. Small environmental justice groups need free labor. There needs to be better outreach and support for groups like that. They are the ones that Yale and Yale students should be assisting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lectures, real experience working with a client. Weaknesses: Given that the topics of the projects were diverse, some of the lectures were not relevant for some of the projects. ",
            "\u00a0It is mostly client work - the lectures in class were not very engaging nor useful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the potential for deep, impactful work through the client based projects. Weaknesses is that some of the lectures can feel a little irrelevant. Also the noon class time is challenging given the high number of events scheduled at that hour. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the client-facing, project-based components. If you get a good project this is all great. The possible weakness is that you don't get a good project and all of these things become issues! I do think there are ways in which the project vetting process could be improved (for instance, making sure that the client has a concept for where the Yale team will find information and how they will answer the question that has been asked).

            "\u00a0Make sure you choose a project you really care about (and ideally connected to your desired \"specialization\") because you're stuck with the topic the whole semester. I chose a topic not related to my primary professional interests, however, I still learned a great deal, and I am extremely proud of our final product. ",
            "\u00a0If you look at the project offerings for the course and something stands out to you, I recommend that you go through the bidding process. It's a rewarding and great learning experience. It's also very different from your other classes which can be refreshing. ",

            "\u00a0I think EPC is not worth the risk. There is a small chance you have a great group, a great client, and a great project. If all three of those things are in place, you'll probably have a decent time. If one of them is bad, the experience will probably not be great. That tends to be the case. ",
