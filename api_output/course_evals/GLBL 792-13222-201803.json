            "\u00a0This course provided frameworks to consider and approach ethical decisions when there are no easy answers. This course provided me with concrete methods for how to identify ethical dilemmas, think through problems, and act. I have been able to apply this learning outside of the classroom. "

            "\u00a0Streghts: High level of participation from students, opportunity to work as a group and create a simulation to apply class concepts.\r\nWeaknesses: Main concepts could have been summarized in digital or paper handouts and diagrams to faciliate visualization. Classroom size was challenging for a big group. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions making up the bulk of the course we're excellent - both in elucidating the relevant parts of the framework, but also in developing a deeper understanding of the specific issues at hand and in learning about ourselves. The reading material, even if we didn't make it to everything in the class itself, was always informative, and pushed us to think about the ethical decisions others have faced. \r\n\r\nThe material was well paced to develop the framework gradually over the semester. The one improvement I would suggest is to somehow incorporate a visual for the framework as a function of time (as we discussed in our final class); it can be helpful to organize all of the parts of the decision. Keeping in mind that some students may not want that visual, it might be worth thinking about how to present the visual piece-by-piece as subsections are taught, without making it \"the framework.\" My initial thought would be just at the end of each section (e.g. Promises, the Sources of Obligations, then Weights, then Cures) to just visually depict them relative in time to each other as they're taught, and gradually develop the complete timeline of the framework. ",
            "\u00a0I think the simulations are quite excellent -- and the opportunity to work on one as part of the class is a useful experience. As others in the class have mentioned, it would have been helpful to go over the framework concept at the outset, but I recognize that others may not necessarily feel the same way. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of discussions was consistently high throughout the semester. Simulations were not only engaging, but also informative and thought-provoking. Eric put together an excellent group of students for this class, and it definitely showed in so many different ways. Overall, very good course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course to all students. The topic is applicable across disciplines, as ethical decisions will occur in every leadership role that Yale graduates will face no matter their course of study. "
