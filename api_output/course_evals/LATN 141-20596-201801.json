            "\u00a0This course did an excellent job of teaching me how to interact with Latin text beyond just translation. Being able to do close readings of small passages, or even of a single word within a passage, is a skill that will be applicable both in future Latin courses and in other writing courses outside of the Classics department. I also think my translation ability improved greatly. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to translate Latin on sight (rather than writing out translations beforehand). I also learned how to write philological commentaries based on a close reading of just a few lines. Most of all I learned how beautiful Vergil is--I was pleased to learn thousands of vocabulary words that added color and dramatic flair to the poetry. "

            "\u00a0A weakness is that we did the exact same thing every day with no change at all throughout the semester. Come to class, translate, leave class. ",
            "\u00a0The material itself was standard; the trajectory and pace of the class was utterly absurd. ",
            "\u00a0The analytical work we did with short passages of text were really interesting and rewarding. The instructor's firm grasp of both Latin and Greek literature/history, as well as his patience with students, made the class interesting and useful. I also liked the distribution of weight on the different assignments: the quizzes gave us lots of chances to focus on shorter chunks of text, and I thought the grading was very fair. I wish we had not had to translate so many lines, though: it was hard to keep up with the workload. "

            "\u00a0No, it's boring and graded quite harshly ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students - it's fun, engaging, while not being overwhelmingly difficult. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY NOT. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to students who want to improve their translation ability. But I would recommend it particularly strongly to students with a genuine interest in reading Latin as literature, not just a philological exercise. "
