            "\u00a0I learned so much about Jewish life and culture in 19th/20th century Europe. I learned how to analyze and connect different media (memoir, philosophy, painting, etc.). I learned how to contribute affectively to discussion, but also when to stop and listen. ",
            "\u00a0broad historical overview of European Jewry, intro to some Jewish thinkers and their ideas, paper writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the process of Jewish Emancipation in Europe and how Jewish cultural production evolved over this time period. I got a lot of practice putting seemingly disparate works from across various media into conversation with one another and understanding, from looking at a piece of art or writing, how the artist is responding to the world as it changes around him or her. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Jewish culture in Europe from the 1780s-1930s. I continued to develop my analitical skills and my ability to relate figures to their historical contexts. This was a topic that I knew very little about before taking the class, and it was a unique way to explore European history from an outsider prespective. ",
            "\u00a0This course pushed me beyond any of my previous studies in history. My skills at historical argument and synthesis greatly improved, as did my understanding of methods in analyzing primary source materials. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a deep understanding of the development of Jewish identity in the past couple centuries, and a deep understanding of the larger European political and intellectual forces and their effect on changing Jewish views over time. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I love the structure of this course. It approaches Jewish history and culture in Europe through 5 different media (memoir, philosophy, painting, novel, and history/theory), which provides students with a consummate understanding of the different ways in which Jewishness was represented and discussed. ",
            "\u00a0This course was wonderful. Professor Sorkin was an amazing guide to the subject, and broke down a complicated history into comprehensible narratives. Turning in a draft of the papers before the final version is also a fantastic policy, and I felt my writing improved as a result. In addition, the organization of the class is highly conducive to learning. Professor Sorkin lectures for one day on each reading, and leaves one or two classes open for discussion. You will get an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of the material in class, and this made writing the papers easier and more enjoyable. \r\n\r\nI would only suggest having the seats arranged in seminar style seating so that students can more easily talk to each other in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good balance of learning from the professor and learning from the comments of my classmates. Very interesting and well-curated syllabus. Reasonable and well-guided written assignments. \r\n\r\nWeakness: the course, in my opinion, relies on students having a pretty solid background understanding of European Jewish history, which could be challenging for some students ",
            "\u00a0This course was very interesting, compelling, and fun. The material coupled with a smaller class size led to a setting in which discussion flowed easily and classtime passed by very quickly. This class in particular felt like a community of people in addition to an opportunity to learn, more so than any other class I have taken so far at Yale. Overall, the course was excellent. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Sorkin strikes the perfect balance between discussion and lecture, and students benefited from both types of learning. ",
            "\u00a0As this course is primary source focused, we were able to get to a deep level of analysis and discussion of the works studied, but sometimes at the detriment to the historical context. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Sorkin is brilliant and so nice. He really tries to tailor the class to what the students want. Also, as a Jew, it was so nice to be in an intimate space with other Jews learning about our history and culture in Europe. The one real issue I had was that the professor did not give great feedback on my essays. He would give a short, paragraph-long commentary after the first draft (which was somewhat helpful), but then for the final draft (which was 8-12 pages usually) he'd give only two-three sentences worth of general comments (no or few specific comments). His comments were somewhat general and mainly positive, although I never got an A on a paper so there was clearly something I could have improved upon. When I asked him if I could improve upon the essays, however, he said no. So, in summary, Sorkin is a great lecturer and a super kind man and professor, but don't expect to get extensive feedback on your essays. ",
            "\u00a0Without a doubt, this was one of the strongest courses I have taken at Yale. Professor Sorkin is a gifted discussion leader, and moreover he cares deeply about his students' engagement with the course. You get to turn in drafts of all the papers, which Professor Sorkin comments extensively on. As a result, my writing improved tremendously by the end of the semester. In addition, the organization of the class is highly conducive to learning. Professor Sorkin lectures for one day on each reading, and leaves one or two classes open for discussion. You will get an opportunity to develop a deep understanding of the material in class, and this made writing the papers easier and more enjoyable. The topics discussed could not be more interesting, and Professor Sorkin blends the literature, memoir, philosophy, and art we read and looked at into a beautiful narrative. I felt that I learned a great deal at the end of the course. Plus there is a visit to the Jewish Museum in NYC! \r\n\r\nMy one regret of the class is not talking more directly to students during the discussion days. I think this could be fixed if the seating in the class were arranged differently.  Take anything with Professor Sorkin! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, very highly! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It was a lot of fun and a very interesting topic - to explore European cultural history from the perspective of an outsider was something that I had not done before, and, in my opinion, gives rise to questions that are very pertinent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Sorkin is brilliant, and everyone in the class was passionate about the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in Jewish thought and art, or Jewish life in the 19th century, I'd recommend this course. The subject matter was rather specific and the reading was pretty dense at times, but I felt as though I had learned more in this course than most other courses I had taken. I walked out of every class feeling smart. "
