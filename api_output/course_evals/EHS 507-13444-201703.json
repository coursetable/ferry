            "\u00a0The homework assignments were useful.  The lectures . . . were not, honestly.  More feedback and structure, I think, would have been helpful (i.e., perhaps a handout on what to consider when evaluating an environmental epidemiology study design).  I'm a little worried that the grading of the final papers is going to be rough. ",

            "\u00a0very good ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the material covered in this course, but I wish we had gotten more chances to apply quantitative methods. I found it weird that we spent a semester talking about epi and statistics, but didn't actually use these skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very disorganized, class was constantly cancelled and the professor rarely lectured herself. She relied heavily on guest lectures, which while interesting  made the class lack cohesiveness. The assignment deadlines were not stated at the beginning of the semester and each weeks readings were posted the night before the class, making it very difficult to actually complete them if you are the type of person that plans work schedules ahead of time. I also thought it was a bit ridiculous to cancel so many classes and then hold class during reading week. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The PowerPoints were well-organized and thorough.\r\n-- The group project was a good way to interact with and learn from classmates.\r\n-- The coursework involved exercises that were relevant to the real world, such as critiquing research papers and compiling a research grant application  probably among the most useful classes Ive ever had in that regard.\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- I wish descriptions of things like the final project were written up and sent out farther in advance. I had a complicated schedule this term, and time management was difficult when I could not prepare farther in advance.\r\n-- There was little accountability for the readings. I would have liked 5 minutes each class to discuss 1 reading that had been marked in advance for peer discussion in small groups. That would ensure that students keep up and engage with the reading. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a poor level of instruction. The professor's ability to lecture in English is limited, as her accent makes understanding her points an exercise in futility.\r\n\r\nA vast majority of research discussed is the professor's own work (regarding pollution in China), instead of seminal works by other environmental epidemiologists. \r\n\r\nThe attendance policy is unclear, and as a result, classroom attendance diminished by approximately 50% during the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I don't feel that I learned much from this course, though it was interesting to go through the process of writing a grant application. The course felt very broken up given the guest lectures and frequency with which we didn't have class. ",
            "\u00a0the course is good and well-organized, and the content is very important and useful. ",
            "\u00a0Course met relatively few times during the semester, and many instruction sessions were \"case studies\" or presentations, which weren't particularly interesting. Course could deliver much more content, both in terms of environmental health problems/areas of study, and especially in terms of epidemiological methods. I expected the course would focus on methods, but this was not the case. It could be improved by becoming more of an EHS/epi methods type of course. ",
            "\u00a0While this course covered interesting content, it was missing key foundational lectures and you are never taught the information for doing the homework and must rely on previous courses. ",
            "\u00a0The course unfortunately seemed lacked commitment, as many of the classes were cancelled. It was difficult to remain invested in the class when it seemed like a majority of classes were either guest lectures, cancelled, or student presentations. the homework assignments also didn't entirely relate to the material in the class-especially the SAS assignment which seemed a bit unfair. I'm not sure what the main takeaway of this class was. "

            "\u00a0Professor Zhang was very kind and understanding. She was also extremely responsive to email.  She rarely lectured ( I think a total of 5 classes - and that includes the first lecture which was mostly just describing the class). This would not have been as much of a problem had she stated in the syllabus that this class relied heavily on guest lectures. That is why I ended up not taking the other EHS class, but had I known they were both guest lecture heavy I would have opted for something else. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\n-- The lectures were engaging, telling a memorable story about each topic rather than drily reciting facts.\r\n-- The professor made a point to meet multiple times with each group for the group project, and was accessible, organized, and friendly.\r\n-- The professor provided positive and helpful critiques of our group projects.\r\nWEAKNESSES\r\n-- There was not enough engagement with students during class. I recommend 5-10 minutes during class for students to work through quantitative or qualitative questions in small groups, before sharing with the larger group. Also, incorporate methods to gauge the classs understanding of the material during the lesson, and adjust course accordingly (if 90% of students answer a question correctly through a polling/voting/handraising system, move on to a new subject; if 30% of students answer a question correctly, the educator has not effectively conveyed the concept and must backtrack, rephrase, explain, elicit questions from students).

            "\u00a0Dr. Zhang is very knowledgeable and great in small groups or one-on-one, but unfortunately, the format and size of the class made it difficult to learn from her. "

It is not an \"epi\" class like epi I or II, in that we did not use quantitative methods in class or for most assignments. I would recommend this course if you're looking for more of an intro/overview of the topic. ",

There were some interesting guest lectures and opportunities to learn about Dr. Zhang's research, but students were not engaged and discussion was lacking. YSPH needs to not increase class size to the point that it fundamentally changes the class and makes it so the professor cannot teach it to the best of their ability. "
