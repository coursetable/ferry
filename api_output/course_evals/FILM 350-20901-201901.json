            "\u00a0I was able to develop the skills to create a short screenplay. ",
            "\u00a0I completely learned how to write a screenplay for one, but more importantly, I learned how to analyze films on an introspective level. ",
            "\u00a0- formatting a screenplay\r\n- character development\r\n- story structure\r\n- reading screenplays for craft ",
            "\u00a0We learned what screenwriting is at its core. We focused on character and plot development, mostly by reading and analyzing industry scripts. We learned how to perform coverage, which is a skill that will come in handy should I choose to start a career in Hollywood. Most importantly, I learned that there is no formulaic approach to writing. Everyone has something to say and the way that they choose to say it is entirely up to them--the script and writing process looks different for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to perform script coverage, which is one of the most important skills for people going into the industry! I learned correct screenwriting format, how to write for the screen and avoid prose within scripts, how to give constructive feedback, how to structure a short screenplay, and lots and lots about my own writing process. Earlier classes, Marc did lectures on movies that blew my mind and taught me so much about good writing and pointing out what that looks like in a movie. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to format a screenplay, brainstorm effectively, create a fully fleshed out story within the span of several pages, and give and receive constructive screenplay critiques. I also familiarized myself with some wonderful, acclaimed films and screenplays through this course. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot. Feel like I'm ready to tackle a feature length. "

            "\u00a0Perhaps the lecture format was a little much for a 2 hour class, but I enjoyed the workshops a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the ability to engage the students; there was never a dull moment in the class and Professor Lapadula truly gave great feedback and guidance throughout the course\r\nWeakness: none, i absolutely loved the course ",
            "\u00a0- high level of engagement with professor\r\n- high level of peer review and workshop\r\n- diversity in activities and structure\r\n- animated, enthusiastic teaching style ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of the course is the focus on analysis at the beginning of the semester. I found that understanding certain film conventions made writing my short script more exciting and provided for more nuance in the narrative. We also spent a lot of time working on character development, backstories and reading scripts that inspired us. \r\n\r\nI would have loved, however, to have had more direction in the best approach in building a narrative. It was difficult anticipating where certain landmarks in narrative structure should go according the page number. i found it difficult to thus gauge how quickly my story should have moved through the 12 pages of the screenplay. I would have also liked to have had more insight into how narrative structure applies to feature length films. ",
            "\u00a0A great strength of this course is the professor, the content, and the work we are required to do. I learned an INSANE amount from doing the midterm portfolio: the script coverage and the reading of the scripts taught me the most about screenwriting of anything. Also the seminar every week was amazing. I had so much fun every single time and learned so much about movies it blew my mind. The beginning of the course is a lot of movie breakdowns (which are so interesting and educational), and once the workshopping starts it only gets better. However, I think the course could benefit from some more structure. It would be nice if Professor Lapadula could go over script coverage a bit in class, even if it was just to say that you have basically unlimited artistic freedom in how you do it. He should have also mentioned something about the film studies events we had to attend because by the time everyone remembered them, there weren't enough left to go to. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Small size allows for good discussion. Homework can be paced out across the semester. Wonderful opportunity to give and receive specific, helpful screenplay feedback. Youll be introduced to amazing films and scripts and encouraged to reflect on your own writing process along the way.\r\nWeaknesses: While I wouldnt change anything, students should be warned that this is a work-intensive, writing-intensive class.

            "\u00a0Yes! Take this course if at all interested in stories. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, even if you have no experience in the art of Screenwriting, take take take the course. Absolutely my favorite course from Yale in my four years and I went in without any previous experience. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Whether you are generally interested in the course to learn how to write a short screenplay or want to pursue a career in Hollywood, Lapadula teaches the craft in a way that is fun, enjoyable, and approachable. Great introduction into screenwriting. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student. The structure of the course allows for creative exploration and honest feedback. We learn the basics of screenwriting through practice and by reading scripts. Even though the class is nearly two hours, the time flew by quickly. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. If you have any interest in screenwriting, take this course. Your peers will be brilliant and you will benefit so much from reading their work and also the professional scripts that you have to read for the screenwriting portfolio. It is such a practical course - script coverage is an important skill for any aspiring screenwriter. The reason it is like this is because Marc not only has a lot of teaching experience and has many students who go on to be professional writers afterward, but he has written professionally himself as well. Take this course if you can get in, although you may have to be a film major and definitely have to take film 150 first. I'm going to take his intermediate screenwriting course, too. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Screenwriting changed the way I watch and write films. The opportunity to study the craft so intensively and get a wealth of helpful feedback on an original script is unparalleled. "
