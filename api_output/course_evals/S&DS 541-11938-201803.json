            "\u00a0Strength: Slides are very clear and posted in time\r\nWeakness: Too many people in this course and not enough professional office hour so that we can get only very limited help during the office hour ",
            "\u00a0most of the students, including myself, were confused all the time, and office hours were not helpful at all. My suggestion would be scheduling one of the office hours as a review session to go over the material and make sure all students are able to follow. I had to spend so many hours just trying to understand course material by myself and most of the time I felt like I was wasting my time. \r\nCourse has lots of office hours and teaching assistants but the goal should be how to assign them in a most effective way. If OHs are not useful there is no point of scheduling them at all. ",
            "\u00a0Instructor is so tough. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the course covers a lot of material. However, most of my time is focus on understand the theory but have no time to do some practice. Also I think the final examination is too difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The homework is hard for seemingly no reason. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We get to practice our skills and strengthen our understanding of the materials through pretty difficult home work.  \r\n\r\nWeakness: The instructor mainly read through the slides during lectures. I think a probability course could use the blackboard more. Also, the TA led discussion session is useless. The final exam is beyond what we have learnt in the course. I feel like i need more lectures or discussion sessions from the professor. ",
            "\u00a0The final exam is far too difficult! ",

I think the language/accent barrier with the professor and TAs added to communication difficulties, but overall they seemed to be trying their best to teach, it just didn't click well with me as a student. I found it much more productive to read the textbook to figure out the homework than to try to follow notes from lecture. ",

            "\u00a0The course teaches important material but doesnt prepare you for it. The material is very dense and there is no adequate preparation in class. Even after studying the lecture materials and reading the textbooks, the homework is still very hard to do, and sometimes even the TF doesnt know how. ",
            "\u00a0The course materials are very clearly organized, which is great. I wish the instructor could understand us students better as we are not experts in this area, and we sometimes do not understand certain ideas which might be obvious to him. The final exam is so hard that most of us feel desperate after taking it. ",
            "\u00a0The class after midterm is too difficult to understand for a student majored in MPH. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The course is rigorous and prepares student with important concepts of probability. Moreover, it teaches very essential ideas that are related to other important statistics courses.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Due to amount of material covered, course lacks focus and there are way too much materials that could be daunting. Unlike other courses, it requires understanding of many inter related concepts. can be a challenge to some students ",

The slides are organized and well prepared, and most topics for probability were addressed in this class. \r\nWeaknesses: it is fair to assume previous knowledge for this class, but it seems that the instructor expects students to possess a high level of mathematical knowledge and sense, which, sadly, some students didn't really have. The course starts with a very accessible pace, and then the level of difficulty suddenly rises, and culminates in something that I was totally lost in the last few lectures. The proof was mentioned very tersely in the class, with jumps in steps, so it was very hard for students to follow. Overall, probability is a hard class, with arcane materials and abstract concepts that take some time to chew and absorb, but I feel that the class didn't help me organize and understand the knowledge well. I need to read the textbook to get a coherent picture of what's going on and how relevant concepts could tie together. The homework takes too much time to do, with a level of difficulty that surpasses what was taught in class. It is a good try, but I wish the instructor could include more examples with a comparable difficulty of the homework. The final exam was a disaster. I feel that what was tested had little overlap of what I reviewed. It passed beyond \"basic concepts\" (i.e. points that could be easily gained) and tested on advanced topics such as convolution. "
