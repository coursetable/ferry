            "\u00a0Wonderful class! The topic is fascinating, the assignments and readings each week were manageable and improved my writing, and having the opportunity to do a full systematic review with a partner was so satisfying! ",
            "\u00a0Good but the weekly reading summaries were excessive and unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class is just interesting if you have any interest in maternal and child health. I liked that the weeks were divided into topics that we explored in great depth. The deadlines for different aspects of the final paper were useful and kept me on track.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The midterm. I honestly didn't and still don't understand its purpose (despite doing quite well on it). In no world would you have to regurgitate memorized knowledge from a single article and complete a whole exam about it. We already did enough work on the weekly summaries, and the midterm did not enhance or build upon any other skills in the class. It also isn't necessary--we have plenty of grades for other assignments as is. If you are going to keep it, at least give students the ability to have the original article with them while completing the midterm. Epi 2 does it that way, and it works out fine. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nInstructor had hands-on experience in the field, which made a lot of the lectures feel so much more meaningful (i.e., I wasn't just learning about theories of maternal and child public health nutrition, but had the opportunity to better understand how they applied in practice) ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was an engaging course, with interesting topic material and discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent course, very informative. I enjoyed learning more about Rafael's own work. ",
            "\u00a0This course was extremely informative and well structured! I enjoyed the work and really thought that completing a systematic review was an asset to the course as it helped me learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This is an interesting class, especially when you hear about the professor's experiences on guidelines and interventions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: It is not a technical class. You wont become an expert or extremely knowledgeable on issues regarding maternal and child nutrition. \r\n\r\nThe evaluation method warrants improvement. The midterm is an epi II exam, which seems inappropriate since this is not an epi class. In addition, the evaluation method seems opinion-based (also inappropriate). A systematic review is 50% of your grade, however, you never actually learn anything about systematic reviews or how to conduct them. Only around 10% of the whole semester is dedicated to this. ",
            "\u00a0Instructor is wonderful and very interesting course material. Relevant and correct amount of reading. ",
            "\u00a0Rafael is great, incredibly knowledgeable about the topic, and super interested in helping students. He was too busy though and always seemed to be running to and from class. Learned a lot in this course and liked the format forcing us to read the articles and present. ",
            "\u00a0I was really looking forward to learning a great deal in the course, particularly in relation to systematic reviews. We received a lot of information on child and maternal health, which was great, and we completed systematic reviews as a final project, but we did not learn much about the systematic review process. Systematic reviews are highly regarded because they follow a very specific and rigid methodology. Each week, in the course, we examined various peer reviewed articles on maternal and child health, but we did not routinely focus on systematic reviews. Since systematic reviews were 60% of out grade and Professor Perez-Escamilla has a lot of great experience surrounding systematic reviews, a systematic review focus would have been much appreciated. The side course session on the systematic review process, which was not mandatory, was not enough. "

            "\u00a0Excellent. Very knowledgeable and engaging. Would have loved to discuss more challenging topics. ",
            "\u00a0Rafael is a wonderful instructor. He is kind, thoughtful and cares deeply about his students. I really appreciated when he brought his real world experience and projects into the classroom, because it helped reinforce the material. ",

            "\u00a0A fantastic course in terms of both subject area (really interesting topics each week, didn't feel repetitive though topics did relate to one another) and skills you will gain (systematic review, critically reviewing articles, presentation skills on papers and your review). Would definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Good, recommend especially if you want the opportunity to write a narrative systematic review as it is a good skill to learn. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in maternal and child health, I recommend taking this course. The systematic review is a lot of work, but you will gain valuable skills and you will get to know Rafael really well, which is always a treat. ",
            "\u00a0This course on maternal-child public health nutrition is predominantly lecture-based, though class opens with student-led discussions on the readings.  You'll provide a weekly, critical review summary that provides a good opportunity to engage with the material for the course.  Final systematic review does take a lot of work, however it helps that the assignments are spread out throughout the semester and you receive a lot of guidance along the way.  Would recommend this course. ",

            "\u00a0Great course if interested in child and maternal nutrition talking on all the big topics and interest of Rafael. Get exposure to the always running man. Awesome work. Yes, would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a good overview of maternal and child health with a very focus on breastfeeding. If students are interested in maternal and child health, and specifically the role that breastfeeding plays in the promotion of maternal and child health, they should take this course. Students should not take this course if they really want a deep dive into the systematic review process and if they are looking to employ systematic review methodology in their final thesis project.
