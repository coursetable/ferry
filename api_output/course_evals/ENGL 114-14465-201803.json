            "\u00a0Improved organization, idea development, and prose in essays ",
            "\u00a0I improved my critical reading and writing skills. I got a lot of practice reading excerpts critically and being prepared to discuss them. I also got good feedback on my writing, and improved several aspects fo it. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about the various philosophers and methods of memory. I learned how to focus my writing more to make it clear to the reader. I learned how to compare different points of view about memory and its function. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what it means to compose college-level writing, which was the aim of the course. The critiques I received allowed me to move my papers forward step by step, at each I learned the nuances of how to formulate and edit going forward in my college career. ",
            "\u00a0My reading comprehension and argumentative organization skills have improved. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about memory techniques and how ancient philosophers used them. ",
            "\u00a0My writing abilities noticeably improved during this class, and I got to experiment with different kinds of writing. "

        [
            "\u00a0I liked how the course was set up in terms of having readings before every class that were discussed during the class, and thought that all of the essays were helpful to write. I also enjoyed the level of feedback and instruction I was able to receive because of the small size of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the number of interesting topics and articles we read and learned about. I enjoyed the topic more than I thought I would because Professor Verdolini made it interesting and engaging through the papers he picked. Not sure of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the section on memory was very interesting, yet some parts could have been better tied to current events. ",
            "\u00a0Each assignment felt distinctly challenging, which I enjoyed. A weakness was that sometimes the readings and our in-class analysis of them became redundant at times. ",
            "\u00a0As in any english class it can get boring at times so that is a weakness but prof v made the class fun and we joked around at times so that was a strength ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions were very interesting, though it was also very easy to lose track of the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Although this was supposed to be a writing course I frankly learned very few things about actual essay writing. Most of the classes just consisted of the Professor rambling on and on about topics only tangentially related to the our topic, memory. I felt like sometimes he was just showing off his knowledge and had little interest in us learning anything. Also, the feedback I received on my essays was almost always very vague. I had to always go to office hours to clarify the comments and even then I was bombarded with a stream of strange language that consisted of metaphors and similes that ended up making me more confused than I was before. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but the experience seems to depend heavily on the professor. Shop the class a few times before taking it for sure. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great class. Glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you find a topic you are interested in, and a good professor like Alex, then English 114 is a great class. In Alex's section the readings were interesting and the in class discussion was very stimulating. Feedback was constructive and clear, and so were expectations. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, especially if they are interested in psychology. I am interested in majoring in psychology and this class gave me a different perspective on the subject. It was also an overall fun class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Though the focus of the section may feel niched at times, it allows for a deeper understanding of a subject matter not analyzed often. The specificity of the angle taken also streamlines the learning curve with improving your writing rapidly over the course of a short semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone looking to improve their reading and writing skills., ",
            "\u00a0Yes I feel like it is necessary in order to get a good literature and writing foundation ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I really enjoyed \"The Artifice of Memory\" taught by Alex Verdolini. ",
            "\u00a0It depends a lot on the professor. I wouldn't do so with Professor Verdolini. "
