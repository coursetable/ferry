            "\u00a0Broad geographic area covered, interesting comparisons of various national contexts. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think hemispherically about 19th century Atlantic history. I learned how to connect theory with historical monographs and learned how to think both broadly and narrowly about the thematic topics we discussed. I learned how to articulate my project and my ideas to people outside of my discipline or outside of my field of study and also gained valuable insights on other people's research connections to citizenship and belonging in the 19th and 20th century Americas. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like the course title gives it away. Gave me a well rounded understanding of the process of emancipation and the effort to incorporate the emancipated as citizens across the Americas  and Caribbean. Gave me deeper insight into citizenship as a category. "

        [
            "\u00a0Lots of different perspectives and scopes of knowledge of different students (South Americanists, Caribbeanists, Americanists, etc) was both a strength and a weakness--lots of good comparisons and different perspectives, but  sometimes conversations got lost in all the different knowledge bases.  Perhaps sticking more closely to discussing the readings would be helpful for keeping students closer to being on the same page since background knowledge is so diverse. ",
            "\u00a0Overall I learned so much from the course and appreciated everything I learned from it. I thought the readings brought together so many different regions and themes and helped me think more expansively. I also really appreciated Professor Eller's guidance and her insights into the topics. She always had amazing references and was committed to hearing all the students' connections and ideas relating to the topic at hand. I really appreciated her desire to think across nation-state borders and across empires, because it really helped me see connections and differences. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the breadth of societies it covered and introduced students too. However, that also proved to be a structural challenge for the course. Everyone was pushed outside of their area of expertise, which sometimes made people reluctant to participate in discussion, for fear of misrepresenting the larger context of a country or region. Also, some of the books were very recent, and they were not always the right books to introduce the topic. There were books referenced in class that werent on the syllabus that seemed to be important/seminal works that may have been preferable. But i get the desire to read and discuss new works too. "

            "\u00a0Interesting course for learning more about the broad range of emancipatory experiences across the hemisphere.  Great comparisons and lots of knowledge, but be prepared for much of the class having different focuses in their own interests which both adds to learning but can sometimes be confusing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I think that all students should be committed to thinking outside of their fields and disciplines and this course helped me see how this came be done. I think Professor Eller is an outstanding professor and facilitator and I learned to become more articulate about my own course of study and the stakes of my project and research. I also really appreciated being given the opportunity to learn about a variety of locations and time periods as I believe this really helped me contextualize my project historically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it for sure - it's a great introduction to post-emancipation studies and focuses on various regions and methods. It's a good introduction to new literature and to get a handle on how historians throughout the Americas discuss post-emancipation processes. ",
            "\u00a0I think you get out what you put in. If you read and participate, you will get a deeper more nuanced understanding of how race, slavery, and citizenship are connected. "
