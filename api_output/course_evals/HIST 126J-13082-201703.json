            "\u00a0I learned how to absorb tons of dense reading quickly and formulate arguments/opinions on them. Prof Tran also helped me grow a ton as a writer. She is such a detailed and engaged professor that she really helps you learn. Also, everyone in my seminar was BRILLIANT so I learned a lot just by hearing what they had to say in discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Broad survey of the American conservative tradition, starting with Agrarians, moving through Rand + Libertarians, pitstopping at Buckleys synthesis. Heavy emphasis on reading primary docs from conservative writers, supplemented by either examples of intellectual histories or other cultural histories of the US from the 50s-70s. ",
            "\u00a0I got a lot out of this course. While I've taken seven other history courses at Yale, this was my first in intellectual history. I was a little hesitant at first, but I'm coming away with a better understanding of conservatism(s), political life in America, U.S. history, and intellectual history broadly. It's helped me to develop a greater appreciation for ideas, and also a greater appreciation for political discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This class provided a tremendous overview on modern American conservatism and allowed students to discuss openly and freely. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught me the importance of the intellectual in understanding and responding to history. Conservative intellectual history is so undervalued at Yale that this was such a refreshing opportunity in understanding the other side. I loved getting to interact with texts and history in such a physical way, understanding how events have compiled and shaped the past and the present. ",
            "\u00a0Because I have primarily taken courses that offer a leftist perspective on American history, this course filled in many gaps in my knowledge and understanding of American politics. By the end of the course, I felt I had a solid grasp of the ideas that have driven the conservative intellectual movement and that are still powerful today. Furthermore, I developed the critical thinking skills necessary to analyze political theory. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was honestly FABULOUS. Not much I would say to improve it. Sometimes I thought Prof Tran could intervene a bit more to keep the discussion more historical, but overall it was seriously so fabulous. Everyone should get to take this course, and take it with Prof Tran. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent and everything a History seminar should be: a strong mix of text-based discussion and ideological debate. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well rounded and balanced course. Would have liked to have read more secondary sources rather than so many primary docs. As one would expect, the course attracted a lot of Yales deplorables. Professor could have done a better job at moderating the conversation so that their voices wouldnt unproductively dominate the  conversation. ",
            "\u00a0The only thing I would change is to introduce some kind of primer or introductory readings for students who haven't studied philosophy or conservatism before, because there were people and topics important to political philosophy that we discussed well into the term that I still don't have a great (or even cursory) understanding of. The class kind of tried to do this with a terms sheet, but we sort of dropped that idea; I think a more comprehensive intro at the beginning of the course would have been more helpful. In any case, this course's strengths far outweighed its weaknesses. We had fruitful and generally civil discussions about controversial ideas (especially this year, especially at Yale, and especially in a context where many of us were not conservative). That says a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Engaging professor, good syllabus, good content and material.\r\nWeakness: Could have been guided more constructively during seminar discussions ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Trans and this class were in perfect harmony. Prof. Tran structured the seminar in a perfect combination of the thematic and the chronological. It was amazing to understand conservative intellectual development through the readings she chose and the questions she posed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There are some weeks when I felt so overwhelmed with the readings that I was demotivated and extremely stressed. The material is so interesting that I wanted to read it all. But with the density and the size of the readings, sometimes it just wasn't possible. Which was saddening. I'm not sure how to fix this problem but just wanted to point out how it made me feel. ",
            "\u00a0This course's strength lied in Ms. Tran's masterful syllabus and effortless manner of guiding class discussions. Every week, it seemed as if there was more than enough content to discuss in class, which, in my experience, is rare for a 2 hour seminar. The only suggestion for improvement I can think of would be to maybe limit the length of the weekly reading responses. Because there was no page or word limit, there seemed collective pressure to write a lot each week. "

            "\u00a0YES! Everyone should take this class! It's super valuable for a few reasons: 1.) You learn to absorb vast amounts of dense information very quickly and form intelligent arguments about them. 2.) Learning about intellectual history is super important and surprisingly applicable to everyday life and thought. 3.) Conservatism is something we all should know about, especially given our political climate today. 4.) PROFESSOR TRAN IS THE BEST BEST BEST PROFESSOR EVER! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0It is very philosophy-based, so if that is your thing, go for it. Professor Tran is great. ",
            "\u00a0Andrina is a thorough, supportive, and communicative professor. Even if you dont jive with the class dynamics, she makes sure to make space for your individual growth and development. Tentatively reccomend this course, but would encourage students to compliment it with a course load that includes classes taught by other scholars of the 20th century US who take a more urgent look at the ways in which conservative ideologies have been mapped into society and dispossessed many. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course if it's offered again. That said, I don't think it will be, but I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. I was generally unfamiliar with basic ideas of conservatisms and the practice of intellectual history before this semester, and I learned a ton, about these things and myself. Although none of the content really changed my views, it was a great way to explore how American politics has developed and arrived to where it is today. Also, Andrina really cares about all of her students and is a fantastic teacher. Great readings,  great instructor, and great classmates. My favorite this term at least. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. There are few opportunities at Yale to have intellectual conversations about conservatism and especially American conservatism. This class provided me with a great background into American conservatism and the intellectual history. ",
            "\u00a0YES. Take this course! Prof. Tran is amazing and one of the BEST seminar leaders I have ever had. The material is extremely interesting, an excellent study of the intellectual/ideological's role in shaping history and the physical. Conservative history is a fruitful field and I came into the class wanting to learn how I, as a liberal, could understand the conservative movement. I was blown away. There are so much depth and value within the material we covered. I learned not only about ideology but broader history and philosophy. Amazing class to get you to think about the 20th century of American history in a new, invigorating lens.\r\n\r\nMy writing has been strengthened enormously, as Prof. Tran is a thorough and fair writing grader. She provides great feedback and has helped me target many of the crucial errors I've made in my own writing. I owe her so much. SO, take this class if you can! It's phenomenal. Couldn't give a better recommendation honestly. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because I think I learned a lot about conservative theory and that the class set-up was very useful in interrogating and analyzing those theories. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. It was one of the finest and most intellectually engaging course I took at Yale. While the reading load was sometimes heavy, the material I was reading made it worth it. The class exposed me to intellectuals that are out of the liberal mainstream and made me question my own political beliefs. Aside from that, understanding the development of the ideas of one of the two mainstream political movements of our time is essential for understanding our current political situation. 10/10 would recommend.
