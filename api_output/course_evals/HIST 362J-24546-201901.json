            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Colombian history, and also about environmental history in the 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the many different conflicts Colombia has seen since it's colonization and how the geography and history of the country contribute to the conflicts to these days. ",
            "\u00a0I feel like I acquired a full grasp on Colombia's history, and in particular the historical foundations that underscore its chronic violence and conflict. Additionally, I learned how to discuss books and other academic works from a wide range of genres to fully understand the extent of the conflict. I also believed my writing skills developed and improved as a result of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the complicated history of Colombia and its many civil conflicts, as well as developed my critical reading skills ",
            "\u00a0This class introduced me to ideas and events that I would not have had exposure to otherwise. It taught me how to engage with realities that are so different from my own to begin to ask engaging questions of the past. ",
            "\u00a0I now understand Colombia's rich history and the nation's social, economic and military history. I developed writing skills and analysis through Colombian literature and a variety of anthropological sources. "

            "\u00a0Strengths of the course: really interesting topic, kind and engaged professor, many good readings.\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes the discussion in class was not great, some of the readings were not as strong, and I wish there were more consistent writing assignments throughout the semester, which I think would have helped us better understand and unpack the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the class is the readings. Some of them are very dense, however, they do a great job of tying together so many of the complex factors that go into the conflict of Colombia. The idea of two students leading class was also good and encouraged discussion during class. ",
            "\u00a0I thoroughly enjoyed this course and the course material. However, I believe that for students to fully grasp the information, it might be best to start with an introductory lecture to make sure all students are on the same page. As a Colombian, I believe I had a better understanding of the overall contemporary situation in Colombia, which made it easier for me to follow along with the course material. A lecture introducing the basics may be beneficial to students without prior knowledge of Colombia. ",
            "\u00a0Well-organized and interesting, but sometimes discussion fell flat ",
            "\u00a0All of the material shaped my exposure to the topic perfectly. Professor Lorek also created a good balance of types of sources, ranging from academic reports to songs. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was in the material and the classroom environment fostered. Students were compelled to talk about their honest opinions and the books sponsored great discourse with topics that were highly mature and of fascinating nature. I believe the only weakness of this course was rather that once in a while, some diversity in the Harkness table format could be offered. We could have more videos, personal testimony and different educational sources for the curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0This course is organized extremely well, and provides an excellent history of Colombia. The readings were extremely interesting, and Professor Lorek did a great job leading discussion every week. It balanced political, social, and cultural histories very well. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student of Latin American history at Yale. This course is a really unique opportunity to learn more about a country that is basically not covered in any other Yale Course. Professor Lorek really knows his stuff, and is quite relaxed - so the course will never stress you out too much. This being said, you definitely will learn a lot every week. I am really grateful to have had the opportunity to learn about Colombia with Professor Lorek in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Latin American history is something often ignored despite the rich history of many of these countries, Colombia included. The course was also well-organized. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely will recommend this course to other students. However, I would say that students must have some interest in the topic because of the nature of the course. Students wanting to take this course must expect to do the readings, which are lengthy but worth it, as well as participate in class. If students are truly interested with the material at hand, those things shouldn't be an issue. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it is very interesting and well-taught ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, this course was a highlight of my Yale academic experience because it allowed me to engage with the history of Colombia in an academic setting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Colombia is the most interesting country with the most tragic and yet misunderstood narrative. I highly recommend anyone interested in government, anthropology, Latin American affairs, social economics to take this course. Colombia is a country that is so mysterious that academics must explore it in a class setting with guidance by someone like Professor Lorek. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really great course that I am very glad I took. Having no background in the subject, I had few expectations before beginning, but this ended up being my favorite course this semester. The course was organized very well, which really makes or breaks a lot of History seminars. The readings were very interesting, and the workload was manageable. I learned a ton, and am looking forward to continuing with more classes on Latin America. I definitely would recommend taking this seminar (it's a shame Prof. Lorek won't be returning to Yale next year). ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is the first course offered at Yale undergrad about a singular Latin American country that isn't Mexico or Brazil. If a class like this presents itself, you HAVE to take it! You will be looking into regional differences and cities and real nitty gritty details which is incredible. "
