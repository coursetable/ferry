            "\u00a0Professor Pepi taught us how to write a proposal and also taught us how to do methods and research. It feels like busy work at times but I at least have something to do when I actually am now on the ground doing research. "

            "\u00a0strengths: great way to form community amongst fellow majors (who are awesome folks), real practice in methods relevant to your thesis, actual time to plan out (as well as repeated advice, feedback on) research for the thesis, reading workload low to allow you to do readings for your thesis, professor really wants you to succeed, workload distributed extremely effectively so that you're not slammed at the end of the semester\r\n\r\nweaknesses: doing the weekly methodology assignments can become quite stressful (although they are good practice) partially because of all the adulting you have to do to get them done (you have to be on top of scheduling stuff, and definitely can't get stuff done at the last second) ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I feel like I really learned how to write a research proposal and how to conduct research. I just feel like I grew as a person and was treated fairly but also as an adult. Weaknesses: I know that methods are theory, but often reading from textbooks is not incredibly engaging. So even though those readings were short and easy, I felt I put them off because I had a hard time focusing. But thats on me I guess. I also thought maybe there could be another check on our doing independent reading  maybe having one annotation due every week with our field notes? ",

            "\u00a0There was definitely more work than the other seminars taught before this one. I know Professor Pepi struggled with having so many different people to teach, but overall I feel comfortable with writing research proposals, which will help me a lot senior year when I apply to postgraduate fellowships.

            "\u00a0it's required for and limited to wgss majors, so you definitely don't have a choice. however, i'd still recommend it, especially because of the way it encourages you to get to know and come to rely on your fellow majors ",
            "\u00a0Theory & Method is somehow one of the easiest and most difficult classes Ive ever had at Yale. As someone who struggles with small weekly tasks, following a calendar, turning things in on time, and who also often skates by grade-wise with stylistic flair or exciting ideas in my writing to get by, it was incredibly challenging, even though the assignments and readings themselves were not that hard. But I feel like I really learned a lot about putting the work in and finding a way to discipline myself, and that is going to be a big help for my senior essay. Its definitely a strict class, and I resented that sometimes, but ultimately I think it helped me grow and learn more than most other classes Ive had here. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a pretty dry overview of methods in WGSS. You basically have to take it if you're a major, and I wouldn't really take it if you're not a major. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take this if you're a WGSS major. Warning though, the way it is designed has many small deadlines which benefits neurotypical people. I suggest going to Professor Pepi's office hours often to make sure you are working on the assignment correctly. The major benefit you gain from this class is learning how to write a proper research proposal. "
