There was not a lot of feedback in the class though and for assessments it is hard to see what the right answers were for questions we got wrong because there are no answer keys for the quizzes and thus its hard to learn from our mistakes.

Shankar) is really bad and not easy to use when studying for exams and tests. ",

The material is interesting, but more challenging than the first semester of fundamentals, and lectures were sometimes a bit disappointing in the treatment of the complex topics of E+M. I would have liked to go more in-depth in our understanding of the math of Maxwell's equations and how it connects to physical reality, understanding the line between what we observe empirically and what we think is the explanation for those observations.

            "\u00a0I thought this was a great course - as an engineering student, I learned a lot and felt very engaged with the material. I was so happy I took this over 180/181 because the psets were intellectually challenging, as were the tests, without being intimidating. I liked working on psets with students in the class, and I learned so much through that. I felt as though the first test was unnecessarily harsh in its grading, but I understand that grade stratification has to happen somewhere. Sarah is a great teacher and I was able to learn well from my notes; I rarely used the textbook. However, I felt as though students would ask useless and distracting questions in class, and Sarah was too nice and answered all of them, but it really disrupted the flow of the lecture. Overall, wonderful time! ",
            "\u00a0The difficulty of the quizzes are quite variable, One was too hard, one too easy.  The lectures could be more engaging. The professor is nice ",
            "\u00a0I think that the strength is in the number of TAs and peer tutors. I think it goes over excessive amounts of material ",

            "\u00a0I loved Sarah. She is a great lecturer. I was always very engaged in class time, and that was the most interesting part for me. Also, I think a strength of the class was that the exams were always the right difficulty-- I could show what I knew but they were never too hard. A weakness was that I felt like the problem sets were sometimes boring compared to the lectures in class, and I was not always that excited to do them. I am not a physics major though, so maybe that is why. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course was the difficulty balance of the exams. The final was significantly harder than the second midterm, which happened only a few weeks before the final. Some of felt that therefore did not devote enough time to preparing for the final. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how this course had study groups where I could finish and ask questions on homework. It would have been nice if there were even smaller review sessions in addition to lecture classes. ",
            "\u00a0I think that, because our professor was so nice, many people assumed that she was a great teacher, and blamed themselves when they didn't understand the material. I was lucky enough to have taken AP Physics C in high school, and the contrast between my high school teacher's and Professor Demers' teaching ability was unfortunately very stark. Professor Demers rarely did anything but derivations of the equations already derived for us in the book. So yes, we learned to use equations like bean-counting monkeys, but this approach was incredibly unhelpful to our conceptual understanding of the deep reasons why the world is the way it is, which is supposed to be what you learn in physics, isn't it? Honestly, I think a lot of the problems in this class would be solved if the professor used a different textbook. Shankar's book is one of the most useless pieces of garbage I have ever had the misfortune of coming across. It is literally 100+ pages of straight algebraic derivations. Very little conceptualizing and no examples or applications. What the fuck!\r\n\r\nI will say, however, that the study hall system was very helpful. Working through psets during study halls were when I actually learned the material. I still would rather learn in lecture and use the homework to apply my knowledge, but as it was I found a collaborative homework space to be absolutely essential to get through the course. ",
            "\u00a0shes a decent lecturer and the material is organized fairly well but shes not very organized ",
            "\u00a0I thought, for what it was, it was taught fine. I wish it was a little more advanced, like a little more in the middle ground between 181 and 261. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the study halls are super helpful, the lectures are good, the psets are a good length, the exams are very fair ",
            "\u00a0This class is pretty much as effective as possible for its purpose. Its main strength is its professor, who clearly cares a lot about teaching the subject well. Feedback is good throughout the semester. Perhaps the class could have moved a little bit faster in the beginning of the semester since it is billed as a class for students that have already taken physics, but this fixed itself later in the semester when newer material was introduced. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are slow because students interrupted a lot, so it always seemed like we didn't cover enough information. The problem sets were posted very late. Having lecture notes posted online or having a Piazza page would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is great but her lectures are not always the most engaging. It would be cool to have more demonstrations in class and if she was a bit more organized. ",
            "\u00a0It provided a good overview of various physics topics. It got a little confusing and disorganized at the end, but it was taught very well. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that the textbook was rather meandering, and I'd appreciate a more straightforward text ",
            "\u00a0It's taught super well, paced well, content's great. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Good level of challenge, none of the work is excessive or busywork you can tell that every problem is picked specifically to help ground a concept in a new or interesting way, lots of support from the professor and TFs through office hours and 3 weekly study halls, clear and straightforward explanations in class Prof. Demers is never hesitant to take a pause to answer any questions students may have and yet she somehow still manages to finish the most important parts of lecture in a way that's digestible and she's also a very enthusiastic lecturer! The class is set up to encourage collaboration and camaraderie between students as well, which is really nice especially when the course content gets difficult.\r\nWeaknesses: Long lecture times (especially in combination with heavy algebra and calculations) make the class hard to sit through sometimes but that's mostly an issue with my own attention span which is embarrassingly short for someone of my age and schooling. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Demers, though very enthusiastic, sometimes does not explain the concepts very well, and moves through equations rather fast. As such, sometimes it is not as engaging as it should be. "

            "\u00a0Yes, relatively easy and psets were very manageable ",

            "\u00a0Take this course over PHYS 181 if you're interested in quantum mechanics. The content is pretty much the same, but taught at a faster pace to accommodate for 2 weeks of quantum mechanics at the end. \r\nThe textbook - Fundamentals of Physics II by R. Shankar - is pretty bad when it comes to actually using it to study for the test. It is humorous and interesting to read, but it's supposed to be a textbook, not a novel. Shankar digresses everywhere and sometimes presents disorienting and distracting analogies in the name of humor. Even stuff that is explained is done so in a roundabout way. \r\nFor the quantum mechanics part of the course, we were given a handout from \"University Physics with Modern Physics\" by Wolfgang Bauer and Gary D. Westfall. This book was very clear and explained everything in an easy to follow manner. Would recommend using this alongside the course for the entire course. ",
            "\u00a0I think 200/201 was a good middle-ground intro physics course. It's impossible to accurately compare to 180/181 and 260/261 without having taking them,  but I felt like at least I knew that I would have lots of support in this class--I could always get help with psets, always ask questions after class, always watch Shankar lectures if I didn't understand material. And the groups of students was fun and eager, not as large of a class as 181, and not as difficult as 261. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Take this course if you need introductory physics; it comes with none of the stress of 180/181 and is much more conceptually sound than 260/261. This class is perfect for engineers and Sarah explains all of the concepts in-depth. Psets are handleable as well as conceptually challenging. Make sure to go to study hall if you're going to take this course; it helps a lot, and the TA's were wonderful (especially Emma!) ",

I took this class knowing that I probably would not go on to major in physics, and I still really liked it just for being interesting. The lectures are awesome and you will learn a lot about the physical world and quantum mechanics. I think students should be prepared for the workload, though. I never felt like it was enormous, but sometimes the psets just took a little longer than I would have wanted. ",

The perfect person to take this class is one who has taken AP Physics C (or other previous E+M courses), needs physics for a requirement, is worried that 181 will be too simple/tedious, and worries that 261 will be too much work/too difficult/too theoretical. This class is far less work and gives you way more bang for your buck. ",
