            "\u00a0i learned how to read a political science paper correctly and to value the data and methodology of these papers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about reading political science papers and how to interpret statistics and data analysis, in the context of judicial activism, wrongful convictions, and biases that influence the judicial decision-making process. ",
            "\u00a0I leave with a better understanding of how to analyze political science research and quantitative information, as well as a deeper understanding of the American judicial system. ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned about the ways in which U.S. courts operate and how this might contradict initial expectations. We specifically analyzed how judge bias, inter-branch relations, and judge career advancement impact decision-making. More concretely, I learned how to read, outline, summarize, and critique empirical papers (which before this class were a major weakness) and how to use very empirical papers to write my own essays. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and critique empirical political science papers, a more nuanced view of how different factors shape judicial behavior. ",
            "\u00a0I gained an understanding of the structure and functionality of the U.S. court system. In doing so, I developed understandings of the dynamics surrounding judging, from the ways in which judge characteristics influence case outcomes to broader normative questions surrounding the political nature of contemporary judging. Through the quantitative lens of the class, I learned to understand the different methodological approaches used to explicate these dynamics, including game theoretic and regression models. ",
            "\u00a0This course really helped me figure out how to read, understand, and think critically about empirically-driven papers through the lens of the U.S. judiciary. I found this incredibly valuable, especially since that's a skillset even some intro polisci courses assume you already have. On top of that, the visits from judges and lawyers were a really insightful look into the mindsets and challenges these people face. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided insights into both the theoretical and empirical political science of courts. On the theoretical side, I learned the foundations and theoretical reasons for why courts exist (in general and in the US specifically) and how that role has evolved and changed, as well as why different judicial institutions are important or needed. On the empirical side (the main focus of the course), we learned about various exogenous and endogenous factors that affect the judgments of judges (such as biographical characteristics, court structure, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0An excellent combination of empirical and theoretical study, this course is a wonderful introduction into the ways in which statistical analyses of U.S. courts shape one's understanding of the personal biases and human error inherent in the system. Professor Beim is incredibly helpful in reviewing how to read a statistical paper, and will always thoroughly explain complicated mathematical theories to better enhance one's comprehension of the reading.

            "\u00a0this class is excellent because it teaches you the content (political science literature on courts and the american judiciary) while teaching you about methodology used in political science. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the readings for this course were very interesting and thought-provoking. I really liked being required to write reading responses, because it definitely helped me get a better understanding of the material--the responses forced me to think about the material and its implications before class, allowing me to comment better. I also liked how Professor Beim would reference reading responses in class to sort of guide the discussion. I'm not sure what could be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class. Take it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I thought this was a great course with a syllabus that was well organized. The weekly reading responses were helpful in organizing my understanding of the course content and material. I do feel, however, that I have left the class without a significantly different or increased understanding of the courts and challenges that lie ahead for them. I think at times the course focused too much on the quantitative analysis and understanding political science research than the actual content. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course because Professor Beim is amazing! She is not only very warm and inviting, but is devoted to making sure that we learn in her class. She constantly welcomed questions and helped me think through specific readings at office hours. She made sure I never felt dumb even if I struggled a lot to understand the empirical portions of specific readings. This course could, however, be improved by not having an extended reading response and final exam almost a week apart. I definitely struggled working on two major assignments in such a small period of time for the same course. ",
            "\u00a0The course's strengths were definitely its varied and interesting readings, as well as a great professor who brought in some awesome guest speakers. No weaknesses immediately come to mind; I thought the class was very enriching. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus was very well-designed for its subject matter. The organization of its themes gave the course a particular fluidity that allowed us to synthesize each week's major findings into an overarching conceptualization of judging and the courts. The guest speakers, particularly the judges, provided both fantastic insights into judging and the courts not contained in the readings and enabled us to contextualize the findings of our readings in the experiences of these judges. The course did not have any discernible weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course was great as-is; I almost wish we had more days to meet since it was so rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the weekly response papersan efficient way to synthesize complex readings, and very helpful during class discussions. Guest visits from judges and others connected with the legal system brought a much-needed human angle to the course, and allowed us to test the theories that we had explored in class on legal experts. A wonderful class all-in-all; I have no real issues with the running of it. "

            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to another student, especially one interested in a legal career. This class informed me a lot about the judicial system--it seems to need a lot of reform. We got to speak with several judges, which was informative and inspiring. I thought Professor Beim conducted discussions very well. She had a fair and balanced outlook, and kept class focused on the quantitative methods and analysis in the papers we read. The readings are very important for class discussions. We did a lot of assessment and critique of the political science papers assigned. ",
            "\u00a0Take it for Beim, who's an incredible teacher, and the subject matter totally comes alive. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, yes, I really liked the course and Professor Beim is really great. However, the course does seem to focus a lot more of the process of political science research, evaluating research, and understanding quantitative analysis, particularly a regression analysis. I leave the course with a much better understanding of how to evaluate research but I learned considerably less on the actual subject matter of courts and judges. The inclusion of guest speakers was a really great addition that added depth and perspective to the research that we read. That said, I thought it was a good course and would encourage others looking for this particular type of experience to take the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course teaches you a lot about judges and courts (although not too much about controversies). Professor Beim is also very warm, welcoming, and committing to making sure you learn something while at the same time challenging you a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! The readings are interesting and complex (but the professor, who is amazing, does a great job of priming you to read them and helping you understand them). In addition, the guest speakers were a great addition to the course, and helped us get a real-world view of the phenomena that we were studying in class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is essential to anyone whose studies incorporate the judiciary in any facet as well as anyone hoping to study law. It provides fantastic insights into the normative and positive dynamics that govern judging, the courts, and the consequent development of law. While its heavy focus on quantitative methodology was daunting, Professor Beim was an incredible instructor and aptly guided us through the and statistical and formal models of each of the week's readings. I would recommend this course and its instructor without reservation. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely would recommend! It's challenging at first, but it's organized well so that you can get the hang of the readings really quickly. I had next to no experience critically reading empirical papers before the class, and I now feel that's completely changed. It's definitely a \"learn-by-doing\" course - you're building the skillset week-by-week, reading-by-reading. Professor Beim is extraordinarily helpful, and the guest lecturers she brings in are amazing. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to any student interested in the US court system. Note that if you're merely \"pre-law\" you might not necessarily like this course: it primarily focuses on empirical (statistical) political science. Professor Beim is wonderful and provides great feedback and effective in-class discussion. The readings and class content were all very interesting. Of particular interest to any shopping students may be the fact that this course features multiple (when I took it, three) visits from legal professionals (we had two judges and a lawyer), who speak about their profession, and give advice, tell stories, etc. This definitely helped add a very human dimension to the usually empirical and mathematical nature of the course and was really quite cool. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. A fascinating foray into the intricacies of U.S. courts, this course is well-run, intellectually stimulating, and packed with material that will prove useful for anyone interested in any sort of legal career. A great balance of theoretical discussions and statistical analyses. The class does require a weekly response (2-3 pages) synthesizing normally around 150 pages of readings, so be sure to plan ahead. The response papers are excellent ways to synthesize your thoughts for class discussion, as well as an opportunity to earn points towards the final grade. We had a host of amazing guest visitors  judges, lawyers, etc  that very much enhanced class discussion, and allowed us to explore the analytical questions we had been asking in class with experts in the field.
