            "\u00a0I thought Becca presented a well-rounded program that incorporated many different facets of her ministry. I thought it helpful that she had a colleague with her to share thoughts about the ministry as well. I really liked that each session included the presentation of material, open discussion, real examples, and active exercise (creating oils, blessings, drinking tea, etc.) Becca engaged the group well and encouraged creativity in different ways to include sharing with the knitting/stitching group. If time had not been a limiting factor, we could have continued the conversation for several days past the end of the program. "
