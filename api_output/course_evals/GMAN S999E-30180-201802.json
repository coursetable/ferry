            "\u00a0I really disliked the textbook for this course. It was full of mistakes (often misspelling words in the vocab list) and passages with some racist overtones. It often felt very Eurocentric and whenever the subject of any non-white areas came up (often Africa, but sometimes also the Middle East), it left me cringing. The midterm passage was not from the textbook, but felt even more racist -- calling Africa the \"black continent,\" defined by \"crisis, wars, and catastrophe.\" Overall, many of the texts we translated often made me feel really uncomfortable. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well organized, and clearly structured. Feedback from instructors was consistent and timely. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the system of translating and getting feedback in Google docs. I found the video discussions the least helpful part of the class -- they relied too heavily on a strong internet connection and I felt like I was less likely to watch other people's videos carefully compared to reading their written discussion comments.

            "\u00a0Perhaps -- if they need to learn German quickly it is an effective way to do so. But I would include a strong caveat about my discomfort with the textbook. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, it was well structured for graduate students who need to learn to read German quickly. "
