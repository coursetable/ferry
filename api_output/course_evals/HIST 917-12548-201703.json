            "\u00a0The seminar focused on the diverse ways of documenting, classifying, displaying, and knowing the natural world, with a particular focus on the Early Modern period. \r\n\r\nThrough our weekly respose papers, we honed our abilities to review scholarly monographs, and to engage with secondary sources with a critical eye. The chance to organize an exhibit allowed us to engage with primary sources, and made concrete many of the theoretical notions discussed throughout the seminar (i.e. curation, exhibition, display, narrative, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I feel I developed as a historian and delved into a topic I had no previous exposure to. ",
            "\u00a0I deepened and expanded my understanding of both natural history and of the early modern period in general through this course. I also got a better sense of how to look at physical primary source materials and how to use Yale's libraries and archives to do so. I also learned how to summarize my thoughts about a book through the book reviews each week. "

        [
            "\u00a0Really can only say positive things about this.  A course rooted in a historiographical way that also orients us toward working with primary source material. ",
            "\u00a0My only suggestion might be to more fully integrate the final research paper/project into the course as a whole, for instance by dedicating (part of) one or two classes to a sort of round-table or works-in-progress so students can present their work as it stands and provide/recieve feed back. ",
            "\u00a0I very much enjoyed starting each class with a review of primary materials - this was by far my favorite course this semester! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course. I really enjoyed the student engagement portions--both getting to look at primary sources related to the book we read (or gathering them) and having the student-led discussions. Paola fostered a comfortable and engaged classroom environment that resulted in productive and enjoyable conversations. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely.  If not just to be familiar with all of the wonderful resources at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course, even to students without an obvious interest in the Early Modern period. The course is structured in such a way as to allow for each student to explore their own interests against the backdrop of shared readings. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students. Whether or not they are explicitly interested in natural history or the early modern period, there is a lot to learn about working with primary sources and about how to engage with a scholarly book in our field. "
