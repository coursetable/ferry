            "\u00a0Pretty much no knowledge/skill/insight developed in this course, aside from grids and simplicity being important. This course is a joke and doesn't teach you anything useful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the principles of design in architecture and UX origins. The course helped me gain a more holistic perspective on what design is ",
            "\u00a0I learned interesting views about design in the world around me. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Gelernter has a vast wealth of knowledge about both modern and classical art and architecture. However, he struggles to formulate his ideas into coherent thoughts, often posing questions which he never ends up answering.\r\n\r\nTHE REVIEWS ARE ALL TRUEBE WARNED. ",
            "\u00a0This is a really frustrating class. While the teachings are relevant from a general design point of view, there is no focus on the User Interface, and the assignments are often times vague and frustrating. The feedback on assignments was entirely subjective, and often times I would classify incorrect. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot to improve on. Next time, skip the whole architecture / grid half of the semester. No one cares, and it really doesn't relate to UI. It shouldn't have taken up more than one or two class days. Please teach design principles from an actual book / source material. Right now it feels like Gelernter is just making up things based on subjective feelings; a lot of the examples were actually ugly/not user friendly or it wasn't clear why the problems with some UIs he showed were actually problems. The psets need to have clear rubrics / expectations laid out; currently no one has any clue the kind of score they will get. I also think this course would be a lot better if it went through design principles first, then showed old UIs with technology (e.g., old websites, embedded systems, etc.) and critiqued those, but spent more of the course on modern UIs and trends. ",
            "\u00a0Great overview of the architectural sights and history ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting pertaining to the design of buildings, objects, and early computer interfaces. However, more modern user interface concepts could be focused on. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the grading seemed random at times and grades often came back late. I received all of my grades back but have little knowledge of what my final grade will be. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. The worst part of the class is the poor and subjective grading that doesn't have a clear basis - there also seems to be a different grading perspective when the TA Lihi grades it, and it's frustrating not really knowing how to do assignments based on lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is not pure UI but it is fun and interesting ",
            "\u00a0Currently, this class claims to teach students about design principles and the history of user interfaces. We did get a little bit on the history of user interfaces, but Gelernter doesn't teach design principles in a clear or reasonable fashion. It frequently seems as though the design principles he teaches us are subjective to him. There was never a clear rubric on what was expected from us on the psets; scores were always a surprise. I scored better than some other students on designs I submitted that were ridiculously simple, ugly designs that I would not be interested in interacting with as a user; whereas other students submitted beautiful, slightly more complex ui designs and got poor scores. A lot of times he gave us examples of designs that were honest-to-god ugly. As a UI course, this is a bad thing. \r\n\r\nOverall, this course is extremely disappointing. Take it if you want a super chill, super easy CS elective credit. Don't take it if you actually want to learn something / don't want to feel angry every time you do a dumb pset that doesn't have clear guidelines for what is good or bad. There are much more interesting courses that are still pretty chill. ",
            "\u00a0It is a fairly easy class that will give you a good grasp on architecture and history of design. The projects are interesting to work on. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, as it was interesting and Professor Gelernter is a fun lecturer to listen to. "
