            "\u00a0This class was really good about discussing the theory of documentary film. I learned a lot about filmmaking in general, though not a ton about the technical skills required to make a film. ",
            "\u00a0Primarily through the readings from the beginning of the semester, I learned a lot about story telling. ",
            "\u00a0How to put together a story ",
            "\u00a0Basic shooting and editing techniques; how to craft non-fiction narrative; elements of powerful storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0constructing a documentary narrative and using premiere pro. ",

            "\u00a0One of the biggest strengths of this course was an enhanced understanding of how to tell a story through film. Two ways the course could be improved however would be 1) More openness to peer feedback, it often felt as though Professor Luckow was forcing her opinion on the class. 2) We were often told that we would learn the technical skills necessary to use a camera or microphone, but we never did. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof Luckow gave very good feedback, the class progressed at a manageable rate for an intro documentary making class, there was great support from other students, and I learnt a lot about how to structure and plan a documentary\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: We did not really learn practical skills, like how to use a camera, how to work audio and how to edit. This would have been super useful for an intro class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: creative, fun assignments; enriching to be able to develop skills in shooting, editing, and directing. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because of the nature of filmmaking, I would have liked a little more guidance. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the assignments every week, access to quality camera eq, technical readings; weaknesses: not enough tech skills developed, had to learn how to use premiere pro and the cameras we used on our own ",
            "\u00a0There needs to be more hands on learning classes like this in the major. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would, as it is a good opportunity to get exposed to film production, however you need to be willing to supplement some of the learning to get the most out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Intro Documentary Filmmaking was a good class overall, and I would definitely recommend it to aspiring documentary filmmakers, or to someone who is just curious about filmmaking. In terms of story-telling and planning, this was a really good class. However, in terms of technical skills, like camerawork, audio and editing, this was not a very useful class.\r\n\r\nProfessor Luckow was a really good professor, although slightly controversial at times. She has worked in the film industry for a while, and so has real and tangible advice to give to students.\r\n\r\nPeople of all different skill-levels were in this class and everyone seemed to manage okay. If you are going in with no experience at all, it might be difficult for you at first, but the course moves at a really steady level. For example, we didn't start using sound until the third week or so. You will have to self-learn a lot of things, like editing and audio techniques. \r\n\r\nOverall, this was a good and challenging class that took up a lot of time but was worth it. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in documentary making, or directing, then yes, take this course. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely if they are interested in the material and wanting to learn how to tell documentary story "
