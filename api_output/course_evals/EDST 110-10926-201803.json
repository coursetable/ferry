I had no idea of the inequality that has always existed and that persists in the education system in America, of the various reform movements that have tried to address this issue, of the key questions that shape the education debate today. I learned so insanely much in this class, I cant even do it justice in words.

            "\u00a0Strengths: lecture style, content, and assignments. \r\nWeakness: too many readings. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the information was extremely interesting and relevant. I think more in class discussion would improve the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course can feel a bit scattered and sometimes a bit biased.  Other than that, it is really enjoyable and insightful and lectures and readings are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0My favorite part about this course was having section. The readings were super interesting, and my TA was an incredibly brilliant resource. I was less of a fan of lecture just because it was so easy to get distracted/bored, but not much can be done about that. ",
            "\u00a0Section wasn't super helpful; I would rather have a 75-minute with more time to cover material. ",
            "\u00a0The course had several high quality aspects: good TFs who were willing to engage in interesting and productive discussions, the real-life experience of a classroom observation, and a variety of interesting assignments. Nonetheless, the class did not feel well-organized. The effort to produce a seminar experience in a large lecture often led to perfunctory and brief discussion and rushed presentation of the lecture slides. Even reduced from previous years, the readings were too long relative to the time spent addressing them; the lecture content summarized the readings in a way that often felt one-dimensional. Feedback on academic work did not provide much useful praise or criticism, leaving me stuck in a grey zone of doing fine but not great. The class environment as a whole did not encourage genuine critical questions, since certain positions were subtly but clearly taken on major issues. Direct, personal experience validated any opinion and left discussion feeling more like story-telling than productive debate. \r\n\r\nThis class could be improved by focusing lecture time on actual lecture and basing discussion in section. If the lecture focuses on dynamic, multi-faceted presentation of a variety of issues and the weekly section focuses on the readings, students will be more intrinsically motivated to do the readings in the first place. Also, the course should sell itself as what it is: Historical and Contemporary Issues of Inequity in Urban American Education. A day on international ed, a day on rural ed, a little bit of dabbling in pedagogy does not make this class a true survey of Education Studies. ",
            "\u00a0Too many readings and some of them were slightly repetitive. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe final project was a great way for students to explore a particular education topic of interest (it was just a little long). \r\n\r\nThe presentations would have been more effective if the rough draft wasnt due the day after the second group got to present. ",
            "\u00a0There were sometimes too many readings. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a very broad overview of everything about education - I definitely learned a lot of new material and enjoyed the readings, but there was not much room for meaningful discussions of the readings.  The midterm exam felt quite surface-level. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Debs!!!! Also the class visit and the assignments were pretty fun ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and deadlines were fair. The only thing I would call a weakness would be the lack of time that was spent on some aspects of education such as special education and ELL. ",
            "\u00a0This course packs a lot of content, and the readings are generally well-selected and engaging. This course hit on all the important topics that I wanted to learn about, and I actively looked forward to going to section. I didn't think the midterm was quite as useful or interesting as the essay assignments, and I wonder if the course could drop the midterm, add another medium-length paper, and get counted as a writing credit (maybe also introduce more reading quizzes to ensure students do the readings). ",
            "\u00a0Bland, poorly structured lectures, only made worse by Professor Debs's encouraging students to share personal experiences/discuss reactions to readings in groups, which left very little time for her to actually teach. There were many occasions on which a significant portion of the slides were simply not taught. A lot of work for an introductory class. Some of the readings were quite interesting, but they were literally never discussed in sections (which were a total waste of an hour). This and EDST 210 totally turned me off to Ed Studies. One cool thing from this class: the school observations! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Mira Debs was a good professor and she made the effort to learn all our names. The students in the class had a very diverse set of life experiences and it was great to hear their perspectives on the education issues we discussed.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- A more honest title for this course would be \"Educational Inequity in America.\" The focus is on the history of education in the US (we barely talk about other countries), the racial achievement gap, school choice, etc. I think this totally fine but not really in line with a course just called \"Foundations in Education Studies.\" For example, we don't discuss active learning, STEM education, or gender at all, and these seem like huge topics in education. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture was often not very engaging and didn't require us to think very hard. I also wish we had more concrete assignments (maybe weekly reflections or something) instead of just readings. This was my first class where we had a heavy emphasis on selected readings from many sources, and it was hard to grab the \"important\" information from each reading because I just didn't know how to do so. A weekly directed assignment along with the readings could help with this. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course is strong in that we covered many, many different topics in education, and I feel as though we learned a lot about each one. I also think that the classroom observation with a partner from the class was an incredible opportunity. Perhaps that could be expanded upon for later years. I think the assignments, readings, and tests were all slightly difficult to manage but clearly not intended to make us fail, which was really nice. The midterm and our papers were designed for us to give our opinions on current interesting subjects in the field: it was not about memorizing and regurgitating information.\r\nOne weakness is that I think we focused a lot on multicultural education and efforts to desegregate, which meant that other interesting topics, like rural and international education, were given only 1 lecture each. The special education lecture was crammed into half of one 50 minute class period, which seems unfair to people who took the class hoping to learn a lot about special education. The only other weakness is that I think most of the class focused on US education, which is fine, but it shouldn't be advertised as a class about education in general, because that might make people think that they will learn about Finland, East Asian, or other international education systems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that the class was engaging all semester with varied topics. A weakness was kind of an excessively egalitarian stance, that because the TAs couldnt possibly read every draft, they wouldnt read a draft from anybody. That seems silly to me. How many people do they think will write a draft that ahead of time to go over it with a TA? ",
            "\u00a0Overall, great course. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: Take away the quiz! Didn't help me think any deeper about the readings/materials, only added stress to a class that already has a high demand on your time with readings and lots of written work. ",
            "\u00a0The course mainly focuses on U.S. education and barely touches on the international ones. A huge part of the class is devoted to discussions about equity (especially on ethnicity) ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this class did a great job at covering a lot of material and gave a really strong survey of important topics in education, but I felt that at times this class moved too quickly to really think deeply about certain topics. I thought that sometimes, it would have been helpful to cover less material but go more deeply into those topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- I have a very basic knowledge the education system and its many problem. \r\nWeaknesses- Lectures were rushed. ",
            "\u00a0The course aims to provide a broad overview of education in America, but a semester is not enough time to dive into all subjects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the readings were really eye-opening and interesting, and the class had a lot of cool opportunities such as the New Haven classroom observation. The lectures covered a huge scope of topics and were well planned out. Weaknesses: I felt that the discussion aspect of lectures took away from us learning more material. ",
            "\u00a0I started off this course with really high hopes. It sounded like an amazing class that covered a range of topics in education and would help educate my opinions on those topics. I was really excited about Prof. Debs but her teaching (especially in the latter half of the semester) ended up being my least favorite part of the course. She presented some pretty biased opinions and her ideas for how we would be receiving feedback showed that she tried to treat the class as a seminar rather than a lecture. At the beginning of the course, she said that we would receive periodic feedback that would help us improve as writers but this was not true at all. The grades on our papers were somewhat subjective and there were rarely comments so it was confusing how I was supposed to improve. For a class on education, I was disappointed by the way that it was organized and did not think that it was structured in a way that efficiently facilitated student learning. \r\n\r\nThe reading load of this class was also pretty high -- Prof. Debs said she cut it down from past years but instructed us to practice \"Harvarding\", or just skimming for the important things. I found this kind of strange, especially because there have been so many articles criticizing \"Harvarding\". You could get by without doing all of the reading, so that in combination with the absurd amount of reading she often assigned encouraged most students to just skip many of the articles. Many of the readings were interesting and valuable but I just didn't agree with her idea that we should be skimming them rather than actually trying to read for deeper content. Another random criticism I had was the way that she dealt with guest speakers. We had two guest speakers during the class and Prof. Debs took up a lot of the already really short class time talking/ making up for topics she hadn't had time to cover in the last lecture. Dean Quinlan came to speak but had to cut off time for questions because Prof. Debs had spent 20 minutes at the beginning of class covering her own mini-lecture on college admissions rather than give the time for Dean Quinlan to talk. \r\n\r\nStrengths were that the classroom observations were really cool and I thought the TAs were all incredibly qualified. They all have interesting stories and backgrounds in education and I loved hearing what they had to say. They were incredibly receptive to feedback as well. I enjoyed section and I thought I developed a lot of my opinions despite the way that Prof. Debs presented them. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more space to engage in conversation with what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course is incredible. I do feel at times the ways in which time was allocated for certain topics was unfairly distributed. Additionally, at times the material in lecture felt rushed through as too much material was presented in one lecture. However, with that said I do think Professor Debs was quite successful in touching on a myriad of topics in education. ",
            "\u00a0Everything is great. Revise and resubmit. Office hour access. TAs were great. Even the Facebook group discussions were cool! ",
            "\u00a0This course examines many varied topics, which is a strength as this presents he many facets of education. However these topics are not examined very in depth duing to the introductory nature of this course. Also it is primarily US focused. ",
            "\u00a0The pace of the course is both a strength and a weakness. I liked how many issues we touched on, but also every lesson left me wanting more because breadth sacrifices depth. Another strength is the classroom evaluation, where you get to do ethnographic field notes in a new haven school. One weakness is the amount of reading. Professor Debs tells students not to heavily dwell on every paragraph and annotate everything, but it's hard to gauge how skimming will play out when the midterm and final quiz asked for identifications. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how we were able to discuss questions we had in section and get to know one another in those groups. It was illuminating to see the different backgrounds that students were coming from. ",
            "\u00a0One strength was just how much material was covered throughout the semester. I went from knowing very little about the education system in America to knowing what I feel is a pretty substantial amount about many topics related to schooling such as school choice, international educational systems, the various different national education reform policies over U.S. history, etc. I learned so much about a really important topic and definitely want to take more education courses in the future. One weakness is I feel like lecture was often rushed. Professor Debs had so much interesting information to talk about and so many slides, but would often end up skipping over some of them or going over some really briefly, so I struggled to pick out important pieces of information. I know there is a lot to cover, but maybe if lectures were made longer and/or focused on more key information rather than glossing over many topics, I would have gained more. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: covers an impressive amount of content in a very short time, amazing TAs, engaging professor, consistently interesting readingswe even had the chance to observe a classroom, which i found amazing!\r\nweakness: sometimes the sheer amount of reading for this course each week forced me to skim readings i would have loved to read more deeply. however, the class was so ambitious in its coverage that im not sure this problem has an easy solution (like many problems in the education system, as we learned!) ",
            "\u00a0I thought that this course was structured well in terms of the material we covered, though it seemed heavily skewed towards recognizing problems rather than addressing these with solutions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nThe classroom observation was surprisingly informative and educational. The exercise was a great way to take a moment to see how what we were learning in class actually plays out in the real world. The scheduling and write-up weren't as painful as I had anticipated either.\r\n\r\nThe wide range of topics that we covered. This is a strength and a weakness in a way. I felt a lot of the times that we just didn't devote enough time to really interesting, worthwhile topics. Each day of lecture covered a topic that we could've spent a semester exploring. This is an intro class, however, and in that sense the breadth was helpful.\r\n\r\nClear expectations. Every assignment had a rubric detailing exactly what Professor Debs wanted.\r\n\r\nSection. Having a section did help the material stick and I really enjoyed the discussions.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nThis felt like a high school class, not a college lecture. I felt this most strongly after turning in a 5 page paper on the purpose of education. I wrote my first essay trying to seriously consider what I believed to be the purpose of education. I ended up using my rewrite option to get a better grade, realizing from my feedback that the point of the assignment was to check understanding of the readings and nothing more. This and other assignments in this class seemed like boxes to check, not opportunities to critically consider the material.\r\n\r\nThe peer review on the final paper. I really, really disliked how the peer review for the final paper was organized. Professor Debs assigned 2 15 pg papers to read right in the middle of reading week when I hadn't even had time to finish my own paper. I appreciated the comments, but they were not worth the 3 hours that I spent reading and providing suggestions for my other two assigned papers. I think it would be better if this was something that we could opt into instead of have assigned. \r\n\r\nThe readings. This isn't so much a weakness as an area for improvement. I think there could be a more balanced reading list assigned that covered a wider range of perspectives on education. At the very least, this might drive livelier debate and disagreement in section. ",
            "\u00a0This course was so poorly designed, which was very disappointing especially as it was an education course. The assignments (particularly the observation paper) asked students to evaluate and generalize something based on one experience, which may be a sociology aspect but felt unfair. While that may be unavoidable, other elements of the course certainly were avoidable. The grading was VERY arbitrary, with a point (or part of a point) being taken off for each grammatical error or typo. This is remarkably unfair and unhelpful. Even in very polished papers, a typo is likely to occur and evaluating those typos does not judge how well a student is understanding the material or even how well they are writing. The other grading was very arbitrary as well, with comments that were talking about the level of interest the paper held, or the depth of the paper, and sometimes not even mentioning a reason for a seemingly arbitrary score. Beyond that, the lectures were not well-executed. This was a lecture course trying to be a seminar, and as such we ran out of class time nearly every day, and ended up having more discussions than actually learning material. They were boring most of the time (except for Retley's, which was SO good!), and often had a very strong bias. The strengths of the class was the subject matter, which was interesting, and the classroom visit which was very cool! ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was strongest for the readings and the sections.\r\n\r\nMany of the readings were very engaging. I especially enjoyed that articles with strong perspectives and opinions were included alongside more narrow academic articles, which provided more opportunity for engaging critically with readings and creating discussion. I generally thought that the amount of reading was reasonable, though substantial. I felt that section was useful mostly for talking about readings - I didn't think that the data exercise or the final quiz was a good use of that time, as it displaced a more valuable aspect of the course.\r\n\r\nI didn't find the lectures all that helpful. One contributor to that was the frequent small group discussions - these discussions never seemed to take on much of a direction beyond reviewing what was in reading; perhaps it was just a function of where I was sitting, but the discussions tended to fizzle pretty quickly. Generally, I find discussion most productive in somewhat larger groups with clear and ambitious focuses and longer periods of uninterrupted time (and, generally, it seems that some work is necessary to establish a culture in class where this will work). While I value being able to engage in class, I think that the structure did not invest in discussions heavily enough to make them worthwhile, so they mostly detracted from lectures.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat unsure of the purpose of schooling assignment. It was useful to critically reflect on my own beliefs (and experiences) in relation to those of some philosophers of education, but the prompt - asking for a purpose for education in society - felt broad to a degree where any answer I could give would be disingenuous, especially if supported only by my own perspective and a few readings. I suspect there's some more narrow way to formulate the assignment that would be more suitable to a paper at the start of the term.\r\n\r\nI thought the school observation was a cool assignment. It provided a glimpse into a perspective that I really didn't previously have. I thought it went particularly well with the reading we did specifically on New Haven - and I suspect that more readings specific to New Haven or even particular to schools in the area would have made the experience even better. ",
            "\u00a0There are really interesting readings and I enjoyed the Facebook reading discussion/response format. I actually really enjoyed writing my final paper! However, there's too many readings and writing (~30 pages total) for it to not warrant a writing credit. Also, because it is a survey course, we couldn't go too in depth into any one particular topic, which was unfortunate because there are so many interesting aspects about the US education system! We ended up rushing through a lot of the more interesting topics that came at the end. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Pretty thorough overview of issues in education and an interesting course. Professor Debs is great and the TFs all had experience in the field which made them even more helpful and interesting resources.\r\nWeaknesses: I would have liked to talk more about policy and current events pertaining to the issues as well as the more historical and philosophical texts we read, though there was a pretty good mix of recent articles and other readings. On that note, this course has a good amount of reading ",
            "\u00a0I think the lectures in this course sometimes got cut short and a lot of interesting information had to be left out. Debs is a good lecturer and I like the 50 minute format but maybe 3  50-minute lectures would be better. ",
            "\u00a0The material was not particularly compelling since there was limited opportunity to discuss the readings and learn from my peers. It felt like we would read, have it summarized in lecture, and then not get to cover most of it in section. ",
            "\u00a0It does not talk a lot about pedagogy, teaching and learning, only about inequality in education. It is very focused on American education for an introductory course.\r\nIt is very good if you're interested in inequality in education, and professor Debs really listens to feedback and tries to improve. She is a great lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0Longer lectures would be helpful! I felt like several of our lectures ended abruptly and were SO interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the participatory style of the lectures but also sometimes felt as if \"turning and discussing with a neighbor\" took up so much time during lecture that we would barely cover the topic at hand. While I enjoyed the readings tremendously, I often felt lectures were rushed, disorganized, or hard to follow. I also think more examples of international education would be very beneficial to the course. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! It is very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think all student should enroll in this course. It was so eye opening and an experience all students should go through. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think learning about education is essential to one's education. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The material is super relevant and interesting, and it isn't a huge time commitment to keep up with readings. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you are interested in education. The workload is pretty intense though. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This is one of the best classes I've taken at Yale! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course only if you are already passionate about American education and want to use this course as a gateway to the Ed Studies program or other education classes. The content will interest you if you already are invested in it, but the structure of the course may drive away people who are trying to figure out if they want to study education or not. ",
            "\u00a0This is a good course to get a general understanding of current disparities in the US Educational System ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if you're an American student or at all interested in education or social justice/equity. Education is a fundamental component of society and our lives, and the issues of schools are extremely significant or telling of greater issues Americans face. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the field of education and wants to be exposed to a lot of different aspects of education to see what they might like to explore further.  However, if you already know that you have a more particular focus within the field of education, I would recommend seeking out courses that are more narrowed in scope to your interests - you'll probably get a lot more out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! This class will teach you so much and Mira is incredible!!!!!! It's also not super challenging ",
            "\u00a0I would most definitely recommend this course to any students who are interested in getting a better view of the educational landscape in which they/others were educated. ",
            "\u00a0For students who are genuinely interested in the education system, I would recommend this course. Unsurprisingly for a class about education, the class is very well-taught, and I know so much more about the education system than I did before. I did not apply to the education studies certificate and do not plan to pursue a career in teaching, but I am glad I took the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but tentatively. It's true that this course is a pretty comprehensive overview of education in America, but the reality is that comprehensive inhibits deep exploration, at least in just one semester. The course is just an introduction to education studies. Don't expect too much more. Take this class for the discussion section opportunities, if anything, because the topics we learn about are genuinely interesting. ",
            "\u00a0This class is the reason I'm not pursuing Ed Studies. Please remember that you do not need to be in the EDST program to pursue a career in education. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to a student interested in education and/or social justice. It isn't a preprofessional course, but it provides a good background to those interested in researching, reforming, or just learning about the US education system. If you are interested in learning about the debates around race, charter schools, or Teach for America, this course will help you take a more informed stance. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but only if you're interested in either policy, education in general, history, or psychology. It's not really a great course for STEM majors, I think, because the level of inherent stimulation isn't that high. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone else who is interested, even slightly, in education. I think I learned a lot of valuable information about the US education system as a whole, the field of education, and how to write good papers. There were a lot of readings, but they were all interesting and the class discussions on Facebook were also very illuminating. ",
            "\u00a0The course is interesting, but keep in mind that it requires a lot of writing yet does not count as a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great intro to the broad field of education and if you decide it isn't for you by the end, you still walk away with a broadened perspective and having done really interesting readings and having had great discussions. Even if you aren't planning on education after college, you learn a lot about something that affects every single American today ",
            "\u00a0Recommend for those who would like philosophical discussions about equity topics. If you want to learn something about education itself, pedagogy, or deep understanding of relative laws, this is not the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think anyone interested in education or even simply social mobility/inequality should take this class as a survey course. ",
            "\u00a0With a few changes (like a more structured lecture), this is a class that all Yalies should take. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to all students interested in education. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I'd recommend this class if you're even vaguely interested in education. Especially take it if you've taught students before, or if you're considering entering the education field after graduation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, despite its flaws, it's an interesting introduction to education studies. ",
            "\u00a0Its a nice class if you dont lnow about education studies at all. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this course is incredible and would recommend it to every student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!! If you want a class that is rooted in the real and the everydaythat is, the twelve years of schooling most of us go through before Yalethen take this course! Its so relevant to everything. All the material is provocative. And all diverse viewpoints are valued. There is so much rich debate ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Highly recommend, especially if you think you know a lot about education because this course will show you how much you dont know. As long as you stay on top of the readings and understand the general aim of each author the course is more than manageable! ",
            "\u00a0I would because the quality of our education system will be so crucial to our ability to keep progressing as a nation. Understanding the roots of its struggles is key to improving it. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is an important course for those who want to take more education studies classes or who are pursuing teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely everyone at Yale should take this course. People are Yale because they either benefited from the incredibly unequal education system in this country or because they achieved academic success in spite of incredible odds and disadvantages. Yet very few reflect on the education system and the structures that led them to value education (at least their own education) so much and that allowed them to come to Yale in the first place. I would especially recommend this course to people who had privileged educational backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I couldnt stop talking about this class all semester. Often, even when I wasnt consciously thinking of the course, I realized what I was saying related to some issue wed discussed. This class made me incredibly passionate about education. Take if you are at all interested in this topic! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course to anyone wanting to understand issues that have faced American education historically and today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're interested in education. I didn't love Professor Debs or the style of the lecture, but I did learn a bit. This course opens the door to a lot of really interesting courses on education and it's not that bad. If you're interested in taking more classes in education, take this one. ",
            "\u00a0No, unless you are very interested in the subject matter and don't mind some frustrating elements of the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course! It's an interesting survey course but you won't get too much depth out of it. Helps you figure out if you want to be an Ed Studies scholar or not. Lectures are sped through and sometimes disconnected from readings. It's not that hard of a course, but definitely helps to stay engaged and learn from your peers, who come from all sorts of educational backgrounds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a really interesting course. Just note that this course is focused on U.S. education, and although there are a few lectures on international education, if that's more of what you're looking for than there are additional classes. Even if you're not going to do the Education Studies program (this is the prerequisite to apply for that), I would still recommend it if you're interested at all in understanding how our young generations are educated and how the system can work to uplift or oppress different groups. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, if you are at all interested in education this is a great overview. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course in order to sample the education studies program, which interested me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in inequality in education or in Ed Studies. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Debs is outstanding, especially. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to those who are interested in the topic because I felt there were many important issues covered, but for how fascinating the material is, I think the course could be taught much better and has room to improve. "
