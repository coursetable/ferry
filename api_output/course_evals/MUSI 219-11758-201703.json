            "\u00a0The assignments for this class were very effective in helping students train their musical abilities, and keyboard lab in general was a great exercise, but it seemed that much of the class time was not spent very productively, almost as if it was not necessary.  There was definitely more that could have been covered that would have improved the course rather than covering things already covered in Music 210 and Music 211. ",
            "\u00a0The homework assigned was very helpful in practicing the techniques discussed in class, however, I felt I needed more practice. I also felt afraid to ask questions when I didn't understand things, as most other people in the class se mand r to comprehend thins right away. "
