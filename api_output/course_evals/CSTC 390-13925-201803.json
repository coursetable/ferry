            "\u00a0It was an intro food science class that showed the science within food. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught us important things about the food industry, both from a business and science perspective.  We used design of experiment, which was very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a little about the food industry and how to write lab reports and how to product-test foods. ",
            "\u00a0Through this class I learned about the food industry and food culture, especially in the united states. This course took a pseudo-scientific (because it is a college seminar) approach to learning the methods of developing new foods and food techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class. SO good. I learned a ton about the chemistry behind ordinary and extraordinary cooking methods. This class is an absolute must take. I am non-science major and take this class made every week so fun! "

            "\u00a0There needs to be some way for every student to contribute equally to the group lab reports. I think for every group, people just did the same section each week, so they only ended up learning how to do 1 section. This worked out fine, except some people got easier sections and some people got sections that took way longer. I ended up doing the discussion section for every lab report, which took me so many hours and so much writing, while other people just got to write materials and methods, which was unfair. There was also pressure to just keep doing the same section that you started off doing since we were most familiar with that section.\r\n\r\nI also think a group lab report is not a good setup. It makes your grades depend on other people, which is stressful when some people are probably credit D'ing the course. Because it's a group lab report also, no one feels obligated to work on overall formatting or making sure all the other sections mesh with each other. Because of that, I was stuck doing that each week too. \r\n\r\nI enjoyed the groupwork in class but I think it made it stressful that the groupwork reflected on your own grade. ",
            "\u00a0We just didn't learn a lot. I was excited to learn about and create foods, but the class ended up being akin to a fifth grade science class except the grading was much more brutal. We'd sit in \"lab\" for two hours eating pretzels then be expected to produce a publishable scientific paper out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: very engaging, interesting material\r\nWeakness: a LOT of work ",
            "\u00a0The course had interesting lectures, but most of the time was spent in 'labs' testing one of two products, which got repetitive fairly quickly. I also didn't feel like I learnt that much, so a more varied syllabus would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great premise for a course, but the execution could be improved. I liked the balance of lab and lectures, though I think the course would be more effective if we used specific ingredients/additives (xanthan gum, emulsifiers, oils, etc) rather than specific recipes (ranch dressing, frosting) as the centerpiece of the curriculum. This would better expose us to how food is crafted, rather than just playing around with different recipes.  The final project, spherification, was the best project because of this: it focused on a specific method/technique rather than just a specific dish. \r\n\r\nThe midterm exam could be improved as well. It required very little intellectual challenge, and instead was simply pulling facts from the lecture slides. A better test would ask us more open ended questions about improving food/food systems, or require more rigorous facts and analysis of the food industry. \r\n\r\nThe greatest failures of the course were the nature of the assignments and the heavy reliance on group projects. Many student were taking the course Credit/D, really skewing the effort between group members and resulting in some group tensions and in VERY arbitrary grading of these assignments. For example, the second group I was assigned contained a majority of credit/D students, so those who were actually taking the course for a grade were severely and arbitrarily disadvantaged. I strongly feel that this course cannot ever be successful with so many group projects, because students will inevitable take the course credit/D. These assignments were also unsuccessful because they did not expand enough on the work/content from class and thus didn't further our learning. They felt like check-in lab reports simply assigned for the sake of giving us homework and a grade. \r\n\r\nI think that the 1 page responses and the final project were much more effective assignments because they required more thinking (though they were still unnecessarily long). Ultimately, I think that if we were instead given scientific papers or other readings as homework, to be discussed in class, this would much better complement our lab work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n\r\nProf. Kauffman. Celiac disease friendly. EVERYTHING. Great class and really teaches you a lot about not only science but the business side of the a product pitch as well. I learned how to write a chemistry lab report!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n\r\nSometimes directions were a little bit not specific. I felt like we could have gone over what was expected a little bit more in class for assignments to ensure that we all knew what to do to get the highest possible grade. I felt a little unprepared for assignments. Maybe having everyone pull up the rubric and going over the points would be helpful, briefly of course. ",
            "\u00a0The labs were interesting and it was fun to engage with food in this way. However, they became very repetitive after a few weeks. I would have preferred to have had more lectures to learn material and more advanced concepts and less time doing the same lab repeatedly. ",
            "\u00a0One of the main weaknesses of the course was the repetitiveness of the labs. The Frosting and Ranch labs were essentially the same experimental tests done on different substances which resulted in weeks of doing essentially the same tasks (testing viscosity, flavor, pH etc.) without learning anything new. The class could be improved by shortening the number of weeks spent on each type of food and changing up the type of qualitative and quantitative tests that done with each one. Ex: For frosting, labs could be on making and then creating marketing and advertising for the product. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's a fun class and atmosphere, and the time passes by quickly when you're having fun. Would definitely recommend! ",
            "\u00a0In a way, I did enjoy taking this class for the unusual/novelty of itbut that being said, I can't recommend it to my peers/classmates overall. Unless the number of experiments and the diversity of the experiments is improved/increased (as of now, there are basically just three labs that are each repeated three times), the intellectual challenge (and I mean that in a good way, like the way that makes taking the class meaningful) will continue to be extremely lacking. Furthermore, the grading harshness seemed arbitrary/purposefully timed, rather than actually reflecting the performance of the class. The class/topic has great potential, but there needs to be a huge overhaul/improvement of the current curriculum first. ",
            "\u00a0I would avoid this unless the material of the class challenges. I honestly don't feel like I learned anything from this course. Easy credit/d if you wanted to though. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very interesting course, but be prepared to work a lot.  Weekly lab reports and a 10 page single spaced final paper took up a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course as a fun credit/D, but it makes for an unpleasant course for a letter grade due to the nonstop group-based work. Dr. K is super nice but a real stickler when it comes to other things like deadlines and hyper-specific prompts/rubrics. Take this class if you like messing around with food and ingredients, but don't expect to think critically about the faults and workings of our food system. \r\n\r\nFor me, a student taking this course for credit and with the hope of digging critically into our food system, the course was a painful waste of time. ",
            "\u00a0Oh for SURE. This class is amazing. I would take it again. I am not kidding this class is the bomb. The labs are so fun and Dr. K is an absolute weapon. Loved this class and the whole entire layout. If you are a foodie, take THIS CLASS. "
