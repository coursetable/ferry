            "\u00a0The atmosphere of this class was one that I would love to replicate for Yale courses across the board. It was a space where I felt comfortable sharing my thoughts about the literature we read, and the small class size motivated me to stay on top of course readings and analyze things on a deeper level so I could contribute. Some of the readings, however, did not always seem to be related to nostalgia in ways that were apparent. However, the class did prompt me to relate nostalgia to many different concepts and see it in the greater context of the world. "
