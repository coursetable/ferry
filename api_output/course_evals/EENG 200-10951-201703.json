It's always annoying to have lab, but I found them necessary in helping to make sure you understand the material (and there are only 5 during the semester). I often didn't feel comfortable with the material until I did the labs. You also build on your lab writing skills in the process, which is important for the engineering field. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths are that there is a lot of help when needed, Professor Reed and the TAs were always available to answer questions. I think the weakness of this course is that too much is packed in too quickly, and it is hard to develop more than a simple understanding of the different circuit elements from just the lectures. The labs definitely help solidify things. ",
            "\u00a0Lab's were poorly organized/ran into many problems, both with important typos and malfunctioning equipment. Classes consistently ran over time due to trying to fit too much information into each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The class is taught very well. We go through many examples of the day's topic which really helps to understand it. The class sometimes ran a few minutes late however. ",
            "\u00a0The psets in this class are very manageable - they only take 2 or 3 hours a week.  You get to apply what you learn in class directly to the psets, so you can see what you do and don't know.  The thing I dislike the most about this course is the lab component.  The labs themselves are cool, but the lab reports can take ages, and  personally felt like I didn't get anything out of writing full lab reports.  If this could be changed, EENG 20 would be an amazing course. ",
            "\u00a0I think a section or peer tutor of some kind would have been extremely useful since lectures tended to go by so quickly it was difficult to understand in the moment what you did and didn't understand well conceptually. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated that it was a 50 minute class; however, Professor Reed often had trouble finishing in that amount of time, so I think it would be better to go back to it's being a 1 hour 15 minute class. I had class 35 minutes later up science hill, and I often would have to miss lunch because he let us out late, so I would rather it be advertised as longer that way you can plan your schedule accordingly.\r\n\r\nI liked that there were only 5 labs and they weren't all full lab write-ups. The labs also really helped explain the material, as I often would be confused until forced to write about a concept and explain it. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, this course was very good. Professor Reed is a great lecturer, the topics covered are very useful, and the TA's were helpful. I think this class should be divided into lecture and lab or count for 1.5 credits because the work load is very large. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is poorly written and hard to follow. Lectures were more helpful ",
            "\u00a0Allow people to leave on time for lunch but otherwise awesome! ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting, great professor, and helpful TAs. Professor is always available to meet for help.\r\n\r\nClass size is pretty large for an engineering course. The labs were difficult and sometimes beyond what was taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a lot of material in depth. The problem sets are a good length and reinforce the material learned in class. The labs are also a great learning experience, though the lab reports seem to be too formal and feel like writing them takes away from what was supposed to be learned from the lab. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture speed was a bit fast. I feel like this course could be 1 hr 15 minutes of lecture instead of 50, and 4 labs instead of 5. I did appreciate the wide range of office hour and open lab options. ",
            "\u00a0Lab grading criteria were vague. ",
            "\u00a0Labs are useful, but often confusing and don't take into account lousy equipmebt ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well structures, good lecture notes; Professor Reed is super passionate about teaching this course and his enthusiasm definitely helped. He knows what he's talking about and can explain things with different perspectives.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: professor Reed talks too fast and could let certain section a*holes bog him down for stupid questions. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes lectures were not comprehensive enough to fully understand the material, but the TFs were very helpful and were able to make the class much easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0Reed goes through the material very quickly. You do learn, but you need to put in a lot of effort into understanding the material on your own time. ",
            "\u00a0Great class overall, only weakness was the lack of direction on what to study for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the way Professor Reed taught the course material. The weaknesses are the labs and writeups, which were graded inconsistently. ",
            "\u00a0The class starts out a little boring, but gets much more interesting as it progresses. The lab is a lot of work and not too interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Even though the professor moves through material more quickly than I would like, I feel like that is necessary due to the course naturally covering a lot of the important basics. ",
            "\u00a0I found it difficult to learn from the lecture. I think that the professor was wonderful, but the pacing was nearly impossible to keep up with. The labs also seemed to be unnecessarily time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: The presentations were relatively clear and well organized. There were not many errors in theory or calculation in examples.\r\n\r\nWeakness: Too much theory work and too little examples. When there were examples, they never expanded to more complex situations or if they did, they weren't explained thoroughly enough. ",
            "\u00a0For an introductory course, I found it to be mostly a repeat of what i had learned in physics rather than introducing me to any new concepts.\r\nGrading of labs was dependent on some seemingly arbitrary stuff especially considering how little instruction/insight/guidance we were given in both lecture and the lab. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, it was a difficult but engaging course with accessible help. One improvement would be to offer a sample lab write-up before the first lab report is due. ",
            "\u00a0The textbook is clear and understandable. The weekly problem sets were not overly time-consuming but included enough problems for one to become familiar with the week's material. Although the labs are included in the one class credit, they facilitated understanding the material, especially the units on op-amps and transistors, and since there were only 5, it was not really deserving of an entire lab credit anyway. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Mark Reed is a genius, and very willing to answer questions and fully explain things IF YOU ASK. Midterm and Final are only worth 40% in total (20% each), and so lab/pset grades really help. Psets really aren't that bad once you get the hang of them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: because Mark Reed is so smart, sometimes he doesn't realize that the class doesn't really understand what's going on, but IF YOU ASK HE WILL EXPLAIN! Unfortunately, lecture was only 50 minutes twice a week, which was not enough time in my opinion. I'd rather a longer class that consistently lets out early than one that's rushed. Other weakness is of course the labs, which are RIDICULOUS. Seriously, they're just overkill in terms of workload and expectations, especially if you don't know MatLab going in and they don't teach you! The TA's are VERY hit or miss, some very sassy some really great (@Josh) ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of the course was that we covered a lot of material, but it still felt like you learned a lot. I think the biggest weakness of the course was that the lecture portion of the course was only 50 minutes a week/ 2x a week. I think if the lectures were 75 minutes / 2x a week, we would have been able to get through the material at a more comfortable pace, allowing for a better understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very solid course. The final lab was a bit difficult and there was dissonance between the lab TAs and the professor over the details of the lab which caused confusion among the students. Professor Reed also taught fairly quickly and started the next class'  slideshow during the same lecture. I believe the course could be improved if Professor Reed just spent more time on the current class's slideshow before moving on to the next one. Perhaps we just need to ask more questions/not be afraid to as well though. "

The tests are somewhat reasonable, the homework is always doable (though often with TAs help), and the Labs are a lot of work but very fun. ",

The labs really help you understand the material, which is great because I often didn't fully understand it when doing the homework. You build skills you wouldn't otherwise, so take it if you need to. It is relatively hard, but it's easy once you do the labs and understand the material. ",

However, if you supplement class lectures with lots of office hours, textbook practice problems, etc., you'll eventually catch up. I think the material is really interesting, but tough to conceptualize. ",

            "\u00a0Great introductory course to analog circuit analysis. You do some digital circuit analysis towards the end of the course, i.e. 0's and 1's and all that, but most of the course is just dealing with voltages, currents, resistances, capacitances and the like throughout a circuit. So like, necessary tools if you want to go into Electrical Engineering.\r\n\r\nThere are weekly problem sets as well as labs every other week. Half the labs are full-blown lab reports while the other half are just answering questions. I suggest choosing/finding a reliable lab partner, because you'll probably have a partner!\r\n\r\nThere's also one midterm and one final, and you get to bring in a cheat sheet so I recommend maybe starting that earlier than the day before.\r\n\r\nProfessor Reed is a great lecturer, although he'll move quickly (even move on to the next class's material in the same lecture) if nobody asks any questions, and he loves to answer questions so don't be afraid to ask. \r\n\r\nAlso, the slides that he teaches from are on Canvas so you can actually take a look at them beforehand which has proved to be pretty useful.\r\n\r\nFinally, go to office hours! The lab TAs as well as the problem set TA are very helpful and kind.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's a fun course dealing with circuitry- obviously it's no walk in the park, but you can do it! ",
