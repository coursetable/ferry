            "\u00a0Clara was wonderful in every possible sense of the term and I have no suggestions to help her improve. ",
            "\u00a0Clara is brilliant and her section was more valuable than Prof. Kolbet's lectures. I learned everything from her sections, not class itself. ",
            "\u00a0Clara's love for medieval history and theology are clear! Her passion really comes through in her teaching. I especially loved the special class she planned for us at the Beneike Library. Her sense of humor and anecdotes throughout section made the material come alive. She is humble and often asked experts on other subjects to chime in (music, other history time periods). \r\n\r\nShe might work on getting a better discussion going - perhaps dividing into partners or small groups at times? ",
            "\u00a0Clara was enthusiastic and well-prepared. She was passionate and patient with us. \r\n\r\nAt times she could be more leading / facilitative with the important content points for a particular reading (if a student was particularly passionate, that could have swayed the section for the day). \r\n\r\nAlso, I don't think Clara got good briefing on final exam day about the two rooms - S100 was (I believe if this was similar to other courses) scheduled for students who are granted extended time either due to language or learning difference needs. The Great Room was our main location for the exam time. She offered for anyone to go to the alternative room (which would have been unproctored, which would have opened the door for possible cheating). So, it seems as if these details were not explained clearly to Clara (by Registrar in Advance of exam day or by the Professor). Fortunately, I think everyone just stayed and there was not the situation of an unproctored exam. ",
            "\u00a0Clara showed a real range of knowledge, yet was humble enough to admit when she did not have an answer. Although new at it, she had a strong instructional presence in the section classes. She always came to section prepared, weighed in effectively during discussions, and respected our opinions and questions.  She was responsive throughout the course when I needed to discuss something with her outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0A true darling. SO nice. So easygoing, THANK GOD. Not great at leading discussion and being engaging. But just so amazingly sweet. Love her. She's so smart and knowledgable. ",
            "\u00a0She helped facilitate an environment of open dialogue and encouraged varying viewpoints. She was flexible and patient. ",
            "\u00a0Clara worked hard to help facilitate our learning. Her slideshows were useful, and during her sections was the only time we received actual context for what we had been reading. She clearly cared about trying to help us learn the material. I also appreciated the comments she gave me on my paper. I loved the day she took us to the Beinecke. By the end of the semester, she had really warmed up to us and was very funny! She will be a great teacher. ",
            "\u00a0Clara was well prepared and well equipped for this work. She is an educator. She put in great effort to make sure the section conversations rolled and she was well versed in the information to answer student questions. ",
            "\u00a0Clara was clearly invested in our learning and our experience of this course. She was well prepared for section and facilitated discussion well. However, she was very timid. She would be the world's best teaching fellow if only she were more confident. ",
            "\u00a0Clara skillfully led the section meetings. She always came prepared to provide background to the authors and discuss the reading assigned. She obviously enjoyed the material of the course. Clara has the best interest of her students at heart and, I believe, will be a great instructor/professor. The feedback she provided on papers was helpful for my future improvement in academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Clara was interested in our section's interests and encouraged us to participate and direct conversation. When we had questions about the history of the period, Clara was often the one who explained them. Clara was open to reading drafts of essays before they were due, which was very kind and helpful!\r\n\r\nClara could have been more organized during section. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion section with Clara was consistently the most helpful part of class. She came prepared, and gave us historical background to the thinkers that we simply received nothing of from the professor. If not for Clara's powerpoints, I feel like I would know nothing of the connections between all the dots of the individual people we learned about, and instead they would just be a bunch of names attached to writings floating in a timeless void that would be forever shelved in the recesses of my mind under the label \"Medieval Period, Do Not Touch!\"\r\n\r\nClara could be more confident in her presentations (although I recognize that is a gendered thing, so it's not a criticism but rather encouragement). Other than that I found her very friendly and helpful all around. ",
            "\u00a0I watched Clara's confidence grow over the course of the semester. She was a patient teacher who helped make connections in what we were reading and contextualize the history. ",
            "\u00a0Did a great job of being accessible and ready to answer students' questions. \r\nHave confidence! You are in control of the class - I know students can be rude or unruly, but odds are they will listen if you put your foot down or steer them in a more reasonable direction. ",
            "\u00a0Overall she was excellent. Nothing to add more. ",
            "\u00a0She was fabulous!  Worked hard on her section presentations, and was also very engaged with the subject.  She helped me tremendously with the first draft of my first paper, and was always willing to answer questions.  The trip she led to the Beinecke library was one of the highlights of my semester. ",
            "\u00a0Clara was a great Teaching Fellow. Her grasp of the material was spot on. In section, Clara would clearly explain concepts that were confusing in class and provide images (I am a visual learner, so this was really helpful). Clara encouraged us to provide questions ahead of time and tailored the discussion for my section's particular interests. Furthermore, Clara was easy to talk to outside of class. "
