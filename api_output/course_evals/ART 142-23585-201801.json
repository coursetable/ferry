            "\u00a0Not very much. ",
            "\u00a0In intro to doc filmmaking we focused heavily on how to construct narratives. Im crits we came to understand what is effective when trying to tell a clear, engaging story. We learned how to record audio for films, and basic tenants behind good cinematography. ",
            "\u00a0I developed many skills regarding filmmaking and the process of making your own documentary. Sandra gave us insights and tips to help us learn. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to craft a narrative, how to interview subjects, how to tell a compelling and nuanced story, but - most importantly - how to ensure that my biases do not overpower the film. In other words, I learned how to leave the audience with the impression of my subject that I wanted, while still showing the other side and letting the audience make up their own mind and grapple with all of the information. I also learned a number of technical skills - such as how to use a camera, how to frame a shot, how to edit on premiere etc. ",
            "\u00a0We learned a lot about the basics of moving images and video as a form of expression. Then we did a lot of critique in class for the remainder of the semester to use our own projects to learn about what we can do better. ",
            "\u00a0I knew nothing about making films before this course, and now I can film, record audio, and edit. I also learned about how to create a narrative visually. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths of this class is that you have the opportunity to make a documentary. The weaknesses are that you have no guidance whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0The course focused very little on the technical aspects of filmmaking, and students were pushed into the deep end of the pool when filming for final projects . I wish there was more instruction in the areas of filming, audio recording, and editing. I think that he time allotted for the course would allow for it, because we moved quite slowly. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course at times was not engaging and a little boring, which was likely enhanced by it being four hours long. It is strong because it provides you with knowledge that you cant get from any other Yale course. It teaches you the basics of how to produce a film. ",
            "\u00a0I think the strengths were the fact that each week we were required to film something and show it to the class. The critiques during class were always very helpful and I think I improved a great deal week to week. I also think enabling us to devote the entire time after spring break to working on our final projects was great, because it enabled me to produce work I was really proud of. One way I think this course could be improved would be to have a bit more training on the technology. I found I spent hours a week just trying to figure out which equipment to check out, how to use it once I had checked it out, and how to use premiere. That being said, I was able to figure it out and perhaps self teaching is effective in and of itself. ",
            "\u00a0I think it could be a 2 hour course twice a week so we could get more out of it. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that you get to watch and talk about your classmates' projects every week, and that helps you to see other ways of approaching the same instructions. \r\nThe weakness is that we didn't talk a lot about technical aspects of filming, and many of us found it stressing to try to figure those out on our own. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked to have watched examples of good documentaries and talked about the specific techniques employed. Also, the reading responses felt like busy work at times. Perhaps the time would have been better spent getting hands on experience with equipment. That said, I really liked this course on whole. "

        [
            "\u00a0No, not if it continues to be taught in this manner. There was very little structure, opportunities to engage with documentary as an art and form of storytelling. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you enjoy film and want to learn how to make a documentary, you should take this class! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student, if not to receive instruction from Lucknow, so that they have the opportunity to go out into the world and create something meaningful. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in film or learning how to make documentaries. It is not a very light workload though, if thats what they are looking for. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to any student (as long as they have the time). It is engaging, exciting, and you get to produce a cool final product. Also Professor Luckow is amazing and gives honest and helpful feedback each week. However, it is truly an insane amount of work, so don't take it unless you know you have the time. ",
