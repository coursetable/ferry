            "\u00a0Gives a historical overview of how privacy has been conceived and understood. Most of us this semester came in thinking it would be about technology privacy -- and it definitely touches in that. But be prepared to explore what privacy means sociologically, historically, politically as well. ",
            "\u00a0Broad understanding of the current debate around privacy. Also a good start to academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to structure essays and give good arguments. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I learned valuable skills about critical thinking. I learned how to read academic articles, interpret others arguments, and construct my own arguments. I also learned a lot about writing in general, including advanced grammar, stylistic choices, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0My writing and critical thinking skills developed immensely from this course as well as my ability to create strong arguments and assemble evidence that supported my thinking and persuaded the audience more. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a stronger sense of writing with purposeful structure and primary/secondary source analysis. ",
            "\u00a0I developed new perspectives in analyzing academic works and writing my own ",
            "\u00a0By the end of the course, I learned how to write more logically and with better organization. I had my first experience writing a college level research paper, and it was time-consuming. I also had my first experiences breaking into college level writing in general. I learned that structure really was not more important than content and logical narrative, but I still feel like some types of structure were marked off for.\r\nI learned how to think about and discuss mundane things from a more interesting perspective; the privacy perspective. Even from within privacy, there are many more perspectives to discuss from (such as economic, emotional, psychological.)\r\nI learned how to come up with interesting and relevant questions on the fly by relating to things I'd already known about.\r\nI improved my ability to logically dissect other people's arguments.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Improved academic writing abilities, improved understanding of the elements that make an argument strong and weak. Increased ability to analyze and critique the arguments of others. I appreciated the analysis of works in pop culture (such as Black Mirror episodes). Weaknesses: Becomes boring after a while (very narrow topic), discussion not always very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Really good readings, discussion, and instruction - wished we had spent a little more time on contemporary matters of privacy instead of focusing mostly on old stuff ",
            "\u00a0This could be interpreted as a strength or a weakness, but the course is very front loaded. The first half of the semester will feel like a mad dash of writing papers. An overwhelming positive is that the readings are often more engaging, like watching Black Mirror. ",
            "\u00a0This class was about a very interesting subject and the projects were cool to do. The round table discussions sometimes had trouble getting participation and gaining momentum. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is the professor. Palmer was very engaging and helpful throughout the class and made the class much more enjoyable and valuable. An improvement would be to possibly debate and form arguments more in class to help when forming the main arguments for papers. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the topic enabled the class to be inherently engaging.  Also, the class flowed very well throughout the year, as Palmer assigned appropriate readings that all tied into each other. I also really appreciated the feedback for each assignment.  Palmer went into great detail about each aspect of the papers, allowing me to really see the strengths and weaknesses so I could create a strong final draft. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the exposure to a wide variety of theorists and texts. I wish we spent a little more time on essay structure and the process of constructing an argument. ",
            "\u00a0I didn't feel like I knew what I was doing for the first 2 papers. I didn't understand what was required, but I thought it was okay because I had a good understanding of the material and felt I could write competently on it. Not so. My first paper was really quite atrocious, because I didn't focus enough on a single theme and tried to write about all the things I thought were relevant. They may have been relevant, but they didn't help make my argument stronger. It would have been extremely helpful to see more examples of good writing in the format that was required, because much of what we were given to read were long academic drawls. Then, when I tried to learn from those academic drawls, my several page paper became an academic drawl, mediocrely condensed without adequate explanation. \r\nI received a rubric for the second and third papers, which helped immensely. However, I felt that the papers were different in format from the first paper, so I didn't have adequate preparation to figure out what my professor wanted. Honestly, I would've preferred more frequent writing assignments in the form of the final writing assignment (the judging panel one) because I felt like that would have allowed me to actually get practice before axing my paper grades. By the time the third paper came around, I thought I had everything figured out, but by then it was too late to significantly change my grade.\r\nTo be honest, I enjoyed everything besides writing the papers. I read a lot of interesting perspectives that I wouldn't have thought of otherwise, and discussed it with other intellectually curious folks. I feel like that's a big part of what I came to Yale to do. In the end, I felt like I learned a lot, but not a lot about writing. \r\nAll we ever covered was writing in a narrow scope (academia) which I did not cover in high school. I believe I can talk competently about privacy theory and law because of all of our in-class discussions, and I feel like I have become a more interesting person for it, but I do not believe that this English 114 class served its purpose as a writing class. I feel like this was a writing class in which we rushed learning to write in order to write about the topics that were the real purpose of the class. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who needs a writing credit, wants to become a better writer, and/or has a serious interest in privacy, theory, and the law. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely - I am a big fan of Palmer and he provided me with outstanding instruction that helped me improve my writing. I would absolutely take a course he teaches again. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely a valuable experience to have as a first year. Teaches you how to make an academic argument, which you literally might not know how to do (even if you think you do) from high school. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great subject matter with plenty of areas for open discussion and people all over differ in their opinions of the subject. Great framework for academic writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I would recommend this course to another student because the articles that we read were interesting and the topic is a contemporary issue. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. It is an interesting topic, well structured, and a great professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, a great class to develop as a writer and to discuss interesting and relevant topics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for two reasons.  The topic itself is a very interesting idea to discuss in a seminar setting.  Also, the class has a very positive impact on one's writing as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because you come out of it a much better reader and writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. However, I would recommend it if you are interested in the subject material, not if you come from a poor writing background. I did the things that my professor recommended (going to a writing tutor, going to the writing center, going to office hours) but was still not up to par. The writing tutor and writing center would say that things were fine and good, but still not up to the standards of the professor. For this reason, I wanted to have more writing practice than the 3 major essays of the class. If you want to learn to write well, go somewhere else because that is not the focus of this class. "
