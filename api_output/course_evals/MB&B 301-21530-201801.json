            "\u00a0- Answered questions about biology that I never asked before but really needed to know the answers to\r\n- Learned about topics (like phage experiments and fidelity in ribosomal translation) that I had barely even heard of before this course\r\n- Forced me to think critically like a scientist, almost to painful (but helpful!) levels\r\n- Learned about molecular biology in amazing depth, especially about RNA\r\n- The last three lectures were really interesting and answered even more biology questions I never asked before but really needed to know the answers to ",
            "\u00a0Learned about prokaryotic & eukaryotic transcription and transcription & translation, catalytic properties of RNA, and various other biochemistry-related topics. Also learned how to interpret experimental data and draw conclusions from the data. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great MBB course for teaching students how to think like scientists. The course teaches the material through interpretation of real data and real experiments, and I learned a lot about the logic of bipchemistry through the course. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the molecular and chemical processsed behind eukaryotic and prokaryotic replication, translation, and transcription. ",
            "\u00a0learned how to memorize lots of material with general success ",
            "\u00a0This course was a very rigorous overview of biochemistry, focusing upon topics involving nucleic acids and the management of information in biological systems. It involved a lot of experimental thinking, and the psets and in-class quizes helped to develop my ability to think critically about data from experiments. After taking this course, I feel that I have a very strong foundation in biochemistry and that I can build upon this in other courses and through independent research/inquiry. ",
            "\u00a0Factual knowledge about nucleic acids, the genome, etc. How biochemists design experiments and evaluate results ",
            "\u00a0I learned SO MUCH from this course. The material itself was very detailed (loosely focused around the \"Central Dogma\" for prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as well as other topics such as phage replication). On top of that, I think I finally really began to learn how to \"think like a scientist\" - i.e. how to set up an experiment, how to interpret data and come up with conclusions. I also appreciated taking this course with biophysics and seeing how the two connected. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a lot of hard work, but payed off. We learned everything about DNA transcription and replication from two amazing and knowledgable professors. The class goes over so much but really teaches you the history of the experiments and how people came up with some amazing ideas. The class was really tough for me but I feel like I climbed a mountain. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about how to analyze biochemical experiment data and how to derive meaningful conclusion for that data. \r\nI learned about transcription and translation in bacteria and eukaryotes at a chemical level. Also a lot about protein and RNA structure and function. ",
            "\u00a0MB&B 300 Biochem I talked about the basics and then explored proteins, carbohydrates, and metabolism.  This class finishes where that started with a really in-depth look at DNA, RNA, and genes. ",
            "\u00a0Upper level Biochemistry at the RNA and DNA levels ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me insight into molecular biology, particularly at the level of DNA and RNA. I was able to critically interpret scientific findings given specific assays in order to determine information about a given biological system. "

            "\u00a0What can I say? Prof. Steitz is, of course, a goddess of all things biochemistry, and Prof. Schlieker is a warm and friendly walking encyclopedia in his own right. The course is hard and work-intensive, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't take it. ",
            "\u00a0The material we learn in class is super interesting and fascinating, and the professors are very distinguished in their respective fields and know what they are teaching. However, the class seems to emphasize grades and competition more than anything, and it severely detracts from the course. It discourages students from wanting to learn the material, and rather pushes students to compete with one another. Additionally, a majority of the test material is heavily dependent on one's lab experience, and it is really a disadvantage to students who have not had the opportunity to work in a lab for several years. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- everyone is incredibly motivated in this class. Professors are incredibly knowledgeable, psets really help you get a deeper understanding of biochemistry.\r\nWeaknesses- a little too much information, sometimes difficult to see the flow but it is there. ",
            "\u00a0The material was well-organized and challenging, but sometimes the lectures don't introduce concepts in the most understandable order (background first, applied concepts second. It can be improved by  emphasizing basic concepts in the beginning of lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Pushes your scientific thinking\r\n- Provides amazing depth without losing students (at least, not too much)\r\n- Very well structured\r\n- Emphasizes experimentation as foundational in science\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The amount of content in the slides was overwhelming at the beginning of the semester, and kind of underwhelming in the second half of the semester; try to work on balancing things out so that the amount of content is always challenging but never too much\r\n- Problem sets were often difficult to understand, not in terms of content, but rather in terms of what the question asks in the first place ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Hands down the best biology/biochemistry course I've taken so far. This course really teaches you the skills you need to become a good researcher. The lecturers are amazing and present the material in a super interesting, engaging way.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The grading of the problem sets and the exams can be very frustrating at times. Unless you have the answer they're looking for in the answer key, your answer will be marked wrong even if it is a good, reasonable answer. Also, the 20-20-20-20-20 curve in the class really makes the grading much more stressful than it needs to be. ",
            "\u00a0tests tested trivial material e.g. molecular masses. Should really focus on fundamental concepts ",
            "\u00a0The course felt very dense and the last few weeks of lecture felt like extension topics. It would have been nice to cut the material from those two weeks out to give more room for everything else. ",
            "\u00a0Professors are extremely knowledgeable and dedicated, one of the hardest but most rewarding classes at Yale ",
            "\u00a0This course is difficult but content can be rewarding. That being said however, I wish that the course did more to encourage collaboration. Because of the curve and the way classes and sections were run, I dont feel like I got to know my peers all that well. ",
            "\u00a0There isnt much I would change in the course overall  the only thing is that Prof. Steitzs lectures and Prof. Schliekers lectures were sometimes at slightly different levels of difficulty. In general the class was great and challenging in the best ways ",
            "\u00a0Asks too much of students. Strongly weighted towards test, with psets taking up so much time and counting for very little. Strengths are that you do learn an unimaginable amount with great lecturers ",
            "\u00a0This was a very challenging course, but overall I think it was very good as well. I have no immediate weaknesses to mention. The strength of this course definitely lies in the abilities of the instructors and the small class size. I felt like I really had access to the knowledge of two experts on the materials we were discussing. Their lectures were well structured and thorough and they were able to answer any questions we had. I also think that a strength of this course is the student group that takes it. The course seems to be quite self-selecting, so everyone is interested and attentive. ",
            "\u00a0Great course, I learned so much not just about biochem but how to think like a scientist. The grading was very nit picky on both the parts and exams - they have specific terms they want etc. Steitz and schlieker are awesome. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: interesting content, good lecturers (both Schlieker and Steitz are good). I liked how the lecturers alternated (other biology courses usually have one teaching one half, and the other teaching the other half, which makes the course feel very disconnected), and they played off each other. Weaknesses: course structure was at times hard to follow - I wish they outlined the structure of the course so I didn't have to figure it out along the way (side note: lecture 10 catalytic RNA and lecture 16 ribosome as ribozyme should be taught together - it wasn't clear that the two were closely related). TA grading was inconsistent. I often worked on psets in groups, and we would agree on an answer, but we would all get different scores on psets. TAs themselves varied in helpfulness. Midterms 2 and the final exam were so challenging and pretty disheartening. I understand there needs to be a curve, but wow, I did not feel prepared for them even with studying, review sessions, peer tutoring, etc. ",
            "\u00a0The class expects a lot of you, which some may think is a weakness. The tests involve a lot of you figuring out things based on gels and graphs, but actually pushes you to be a good scientists. A lot of things that make it hard are just not being able to figure out exactly how to do an experiment or how the results contribute to a certain conclusion. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing instructors! Really cool material! Really sad curve! ",
            "\u00a0I think the course would be greatly improved with a Piazza page where students could post questions to their classmates, TAs, and professors.\r\nMB&B300a had one, and it's particularly helpful for students who need clarification on detailed processes, structures, and concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Usually pretty good, though Lecture 7 sticks out as poorly organized. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are in the two instructors, who both did a very good job. The weakness of the class is that it is such an overwhelming amount of information that it can often be stressful if not confusing at times during the course. "

            "\u00a0Of course. You can't NOT take a course taught by Joan Steitz. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Most difficult class Ive taken at Yale but also the class I learned the most in. You should not stop yourself from taking this class for GPA reasons- you will learn so much, and there are many opportunities for grade redemption. I have not done lab work at all in my life but honestly after this course you could probably throw me into a lab at Yale and say do a gel electrophoresis, western blot, in Situ hybridization etc etc and I could not only do the proper procedure, but also analyze it correctly without any guidance. Honestly, a lot of science classes at Yale can be superficial with everyone\r\nanxious to leave class by the end (or 15 mins in). This class is not at all like that. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in the course material and ready to spend ample time on the material before exams. No if you're very focused on a good grade. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Like all MB&B classes seem to be, it was excellently taught and left me feeling like I had learned a lot of valuable information. It can be a lot of work, but if the subject matter interests you, the course is a great way to dive deep into molecular biology. ",
            "\u00a0100% yes. Anyone interested in doing biology research should take this course. Make sure to take the time each week to keep up with the huge amount of material covered in lecture though, since it is very easy to fall behind in this class. The material is also extremely cumulative, which makes it hard but also very rewarding. If you can take the time to keep up with the lectures, then you will have a truly amazing experience taking this class w/ Professor Schlieker and Professor Steitz. They are an amazing duo who always deliver fascinating lectures that makes the class fly by (even though it is over an hour long). Best class I have taken at Yale so far. Could not recommend it anymore. ",
            "\u00a0A great MBB course but one that requires way more time than most Yale courses. ",
            "\u00a0This class is practically a rite of passage for MB&B majors, and its very challenging. You learn a huge amount of information and that requires a lot of effort, but the tests are fair and the problem sets help solidify what you learn in class. Overall, Id say the class really confirmed for me how interesting biochemistry is and taught me a lot about how biochemists think and come up with experiments. Im really glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0if you're taking this course, it's because you have to. go to class, start studying weeks ahead of time. it's the fire through which MB&B majors are forged, and it can both be a great bonding experience and a terrible experience if you don't prepare well enough. You've got this! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I feel like after taking this course, I finally have the right to call myself an MB&B major. Now, nobody would say that this is an easy course. Ive heard people call it the hardest course theyve taken at Yale. That being said, you learn an incredible amount of very interesting information. This course teaches you biochemistry the way biochemistry should be known. It really expands you knowledge and perspective into living systems, and I feel that I will remember it as an important milestone in my development as a scientist. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ofc as an mbb major Im biased, but I thought the material was very cool and I think theyre trying to make it more manageable than it has been. ",
            "\u00a0It's hard and I suffered. Profs Schlieker and Steitz are good lecturers with good notes. Course structure is a bit hazy. Psets are ambiguously worded/can be really difficult. Midterms/final are hard. But the content is interesting and I made some good friends in the course, so I enjoyed it. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this to a student who is passionate about mixing chemistry with biology and learning things at a very granular level. I loved orgo and chemistry, and I liked bio. The combination of this made the class fascinating and really made you understand WHY certain things happen, not just memorizing that they do. ",
            "\u00a0Bioichem II was probably one of my favorite classes this year! The lectures were always very engaging and well-thought out - it was clear Professor Schlieker and Steiz had put a lot of thought into how the material could be best presented. They also did a very good job of keeping the class engaged by asking a lot of questions during the lecture and having the quiz every lecture. The content is very very cool - you really get to learn how a lot of the main processes in biology function at a chemical level. More importantly, you learn how to analyze and interpret data, especially gels which are surprising useful for all kinds of analysis. \r\n\r\nHomework was fairly challenging though still doable and also fairly useful - it was also nice that homework was not weighted as much. However, test are also challenging but the grading is brutal because of the curve, only 20% A's in a class of 30ish (which I'm not sure was enforced), you can probably count and point at which people will probably get those grades. Review session and weekly sections were not as helpful because they were mostly question and answer - probably more helpful would have been a mix of Q&A and review of key topics. A lot of studying outside of class was necessary because the sheer amount of material covered is A LOT - though textbook reading (I used Lehinger) was also mostly helpful but didn't overlap super super well with the course material (still useful though). ",
            "\u00a0Only take if you are an MB&B major, or credit/D as a pre-med ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, especially since it is a required class. The class is well-taught, and the information seemed to be presented in a logical manner, although there were a few lectures that despite review were confusing. The problem sets were fair, and the exams, while challenging, did not live up to the reputations of the year prior, and were for the most part fair and well constructed. "
