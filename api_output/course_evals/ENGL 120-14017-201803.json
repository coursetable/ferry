            "\u00a0I learned much about the writing process. I developed great skills in writing essays. I also learned how to analyze non-fiction under a new and improved lens. ",
            "\u00a0This class explored the creative non-fiction genre of essay-writing. I read many great examples of essays and attempted to emulate my favorite aspects of these essays in five of my very own essays. I learned how to give detailed feedback to my peers during the workshopping process and also improved my own revisioning process. ",
            "\u00a0I became a better essayist, and my conception of an essay expanded throughout the semester. I became a better writer in general, but I use the term essayist because English 120 is really a class about essays. We wrote 5 essays (personal, profile, place essay, op-ed, writing about writing) throughout the semester and spent the night before every class reading 2-4 essays on various topics by professional writers from the Norton Reader/choosing one of them to respond to in a couple hundred words. I learned how to blend narrative with self-reflection, and I definitely enjoyed reading and discussing most of the essays we were assigned for homework. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how to think more critically, analyze text, and become a more fluent reader and writer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the revision process for my own essays and what to look for when revising my own work. I also learned a lot about writing personal essays. I also learned how to evaluate and imitate other writers' styles and techniques. ",
            "\u00a0Learned different stylistic techniques, what others like as readers ",
            "\u00a0Essay writing, text analysis, close-reading "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course was great in teaching new approaches to writing essays. It teaches you how to write effectively, eloquently, and powerfully. The class discussions were extremely helpful when learning how to write. They were also wonderfully thought provoking. It does get slightly repetitive as the semester goes on but continues to spike interest. ",
            "\u00a0This course does a great job at giving students a comprehensive overview of the essay genre. I was able to explore the works of many different authors and time periods and gained a newfound appreciation for many authors. I also appreciated the workshopping process. While it was intimidating to share my work before the entire class, I learned the most about my writing process and habits when I got my essay workshopped.\r\n\r\nSetting a more regular set of dates for when essay drafts are returned to students and revisions are due could have made the process of submitting revisions easier to navigate. I also wish that I received more pointed feedback on some of my essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Riley is a great thinker and teacher, and she puts a lot of time into reading and reviewing each essay you write in the class; essay topics are open-ended and allow you lots of creative discretion, which can also be a struggle sometimes; essays we read were mostly interesting, though I don't know how much they helped me with my own writing. Weaknesses: You only submit five pieces of writing in the class. Given the length of each and the energy they required to produce, I thought that was a fair, challenging number, but I think to really become a better writer, you need more practice and lots of repetition. I wish we more frequently wrote smaller pieces (even just one page before a class period) where we could have worked on more specific skills or wrote about more specific topics for practice. I would suggest decreasing the number of reading assignments from the Norton Reader and adding these smaller, ungraded (or only for completion) pieces of writing to the five longer essays. The professional essays were fun to read, as I mentioned, but I don't think they actually improved my writing. Only actual practice did that. I also thought I could have used some more guidance on how to revise effectively and efficiently. As a student/writer who tends to put a lot of work into the first draft, editing as I go along and only putting sentences and thoughts to paper when they feel polished, revising was tough as I often didn't want to change certain paragraphs or sentences I already liked but felt I needed to change something because I was partially being graded on how my essay changed from the first draft to the revision. There's only so much energy you can put into one essay, and I often would end up second-guessing myself and spending an unnecessary amount of time stressing about what to change or remove. ",
            "\u00a0Love the peer evaluations/workshop and helpful critics from the instructor ",
            "\u00a0This was by far my favorite class, and I believe that it was a great course. I really liked the text book, and the essay topics. ",
            "\u00a0Discussion was always great, great professor ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings and discussions, as well as getting to learn how to write essays that are very different from the style we normally learn in school (ie., more creative and personal) "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend it. This class facilitates learning on a very personal level. It allows you to be creative in your writing and express yourself more than any class I've ever taken. The nonfiction aspect of this course opens up a whole world of creativity that I was unaware of. It allows you to state your beliefs and opinions in an effective and powerful way on paper which will be useful for the rest of my Yale education and beyond. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ENGL 120 was an excellent writing course that combined elements of both creative and analytical writing. Being able to submit a non-graded draft before turning in a revision took the pressure off of draft-writing and helped me to truly focus on the revision process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I enjoyed English 120, especially with Professor Riley. I loved our discussions of the professional essays we read, and I thought I grew as a writer by the end. Writing creative nonfiction can take a toll on your creative energy and can also suck up a lot of time, and that definitely happened for me this semester, but I appreciate the fact that English 120 forced me to think. Writing these essays require focus and familiarity with your own self, which was difficult but rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think it is fundamentally important for all students to refine and explore their writing skills. It is an interesting opportunity to express yourself creatively in a place that sometimes feel stifling in that regard ",
            "\u00a0Yes for sure! Professor Riley is absolutely great! The essays we read are very interesting and help you become a better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course to become a better writer! ",
            "\u00a0Yes Professor Riley is extremely supportive and gives helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely would recommend this course. Even for those who have taken intensive writing courses before, this class and Prof Riley will compel you to think and write about diverse topics in a myriad of different ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have recommended this course to many of my friends. Like I said before it was great course material and teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with Professor Riley. ",
            "\u00a0For sure! A great introduction to English courses at Yale, although if students want to improve their traditional essay writing skills they might want to take a different class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This course made me a much better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you like nonfiction writing at all this is a good course to get your fill. "
