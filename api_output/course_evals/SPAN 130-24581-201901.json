            "\u00a0I learned more about the basics of the Spanish language. Additionally, I approved my writing a lot in this course and had fun at the same time. ",
            "\u00a0Grammar-wise, we started at por vs para and made it to conditionals. The short stories we read and videos we watched helped improve our ability to understand conversation. ",
            "\u00a0My ability to read and understand spoken Spanish was dramatically improved by this course, and I also continued to develop my ability to speak and write in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0My Spanish reading, writing, and speaking improved immensely in this course. It was a challenge well worth it. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths of this course included for me: a fun professor, and very structured and organized learning.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of this course included: topics that did not feel that relevant to my life and meeting every day of the week without exception. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the course packet and online assignments. Deadlines and assignments were straightforward. The weaknesses of this course is that 50 minutes is not enough time to go over homework assignments, learn a new lesson, and practice what we've learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: forces you to learn since class every day is in Spanish, you have to practice what you are learning. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weaknesses are that the course focuses a lot on only grammar. I think it is just as important to speak in casual settings with your classmates, not just practice that one grammar rule of the day. I would also rather spend more time learning about the culture of the many spanish speaking countries. ",
            "\u00a0Strength is that the pace of the class was perfectnot too fast and not too slow. Also, the resources provided to us for exams really helped me prepare well for it. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. Spanish 130 is a great course. Whether it's your first language class at yale or a continuation from 120, the curriculum ensures everyone gets to the same level. ",
            "\u00a0Its a good refresher on most of the topics of basic Spanish so that you really learn them, but it is obviously tough showing up 5 days a week. ",
