The definition of a vector space and a transformation are developed in abstract ways. The most important takeaway from the class is probably the representation of linear transformations as matrices. Towards the end I got very comfortable working with matrices, determinants, etc. At the end you develop the theory of inner products.

            "\u00a0The course needs to go at a faster pace since I didn't get to finish the whole syllabus ",
            "\u00a0The peer tutor hours were very strong.\r\n\r\nMore appropriate exam questions would help. ",
            "\u00a0The primary strength of this course is that the problem sets were at an appropriate level of difficulty that forced students to critically examine and apply the content presented in the lecture and textbook. That being said, most of the instruction in this course was incoherent. I constantly left lecture so confused that I did not know what questions to ask; this was true of both lecturers, the TA, and the peer tutors. The only resource that I could learn from was the textbook. I think that the teaching staff ought to take time to think about how to present the content in a way that is clearer and more enriching than the textbook. It feels like a waste of a Yale course credit to take a class where none of the time spent with the instructional staff felt worthwhile. Students at Yale deserve better than learning from a textbook; we can do that without committing to an entire semester of attending lectures, completing lengthy problem set assignments, and stressing over exams. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course moves too slowly at the beginning and then rushes at the end.  For example, we covered 2 chapters before the midterm and then 4 chapters in the second half of the term.  The later chapters cover some really cool concepts and I think we could have spent more time on them. ",
            "\u00a0The classes are fast paced and very proof oriented. It would be nicer to slow down and get a better understanding of the concepts first. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that it will force you to learn how to write proofs well. ",
            "\u00a0The ULAs for the course, Teava and Joy, were amazingly helpful for understanding the key concepts of the course. However, the lecture could improve with explanation of concepts before moving on and bringing concepts together instead of separating them completely -- as there are a lot of parallels that could have been made to make the course easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0I found lecture hard to follow, I think that a lot of the proofs done in class were too complicated for me to understand, and an understanding of them was not essential to the class in the end, so I don't know why difficult, long proofs are prioritized over the fundamentals which will actually help you. The subject material is interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is that there is much time devoted to developing proof techniques especially through the discussion sections. Theorems and important concepts are explained in detail so that the students get it, and psets usually are good at helping to practice the important ideas. A weakness it that we never really do much computational work like a non-proof based class would do, and by leaving a lot of pretty simple ideas so abstract it makes it harder to understand. ",
            "\u00a0A great textbook which helped me follow the material. Psets were set at an appropriate length and level. However, the class was usually very boring and it was very hard to stay awake, even for someone who usually has no problems staying awake in long lectures. Explanations were not clear and context wasn't set right at times. It was hard to develop any intuition without reading the textbook. Psets often not graded on time and sometimes not returned. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: Get a better teacher. Arie was absolutely terrible, and I've heard Anibal is only slightly better. Such a disorganized lecturer, and the way he answers questions is really off-putting and confusing.  Strengths: chance to develop your ability to learn proof-based based math on your own by reading the textbook! ",
            "\u00a0The course is really difficult just because of the material it covers, and sadly the professor did a poor job of explaining the material which made it nearly impossible. ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS OF THE COURSE: They chose a pretty good textbook and not much else. WEAKNESSES: everything else. I learned every part of the course from the textbook and from the peer tutors. The professor was inaudible, wrote illegibly, had no idea how to answer questions, and often made mistakes while writing on the board. His office hours were a joke and class time was useless. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to like this class so badly, and I think that I could have, but I didnt. I found the lectures arduous and poorly explained. I really liked Professor Levit but I thought he struggled to explain concepts clearly in class. He often just skipped through parts of proofs, assuming that it was clear, but this was my first advanced math class and even though I read the textbook and did all of the p-sets, I still felt very lost. Most importantly, this was my first proof-based math class, and I desperately needed guidance about how to write proofs. I think proof-writing and logic should have been a bigger focus of the class or the discussion section (rather than the random and useless, although interesting, hour and a half long discussion sections on set theory etc.). That would have made the class so much more rewarding and easier to understand. ",
            "\u00a0If you like math, it's pretty interesting to learn about the theoretical notion of vectors and linear transformations. A good taste of what upper level university math is like: abstract, theoretical, mostly proofs, little computation. It's an eye-opening experience if you invest yourself into the subject matter. Lectures were kind of dry, Arie is a very knowledgeable teacher but I thought he was difficult to follow at times. The book is very solid though and the weekly sections were instructive for going over lecture material in more depth. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well structured, but I felt that the end of the year was very rushed, and that we did not have the chance to spend as much time as we should've on the last units. These were unfortunately the most relevant units to subjects outside of class, and as such I felt underprepared for what the class left me with moving ahead. I had issues as well with the way in which we were then evaluated on these subjects which we did not have as much time to discuss on the final exam. I appreciated the evening sessions which helped me to solidify concepts, but found that without this session if I failed to understand a concept in class, there was very little opportunity for me to reinforce ideas before we moved on.

This course is a great foundation is proof based mathematics and the theory of linear algebra, which is crucial for many later courses in mathematics, computer science, and statistics.

Teaching proof-based linear algebra is difficult, and less experienced lecturers are not able to make the course a fulfilling and engaging experience. ",

This class is challenging, and will require you to think. However, if proof-based math is your speed or you want to take higher-level proofs-based math classes, this is a solid introduction. ",

            "\u00a0Yes. This was probably the best way to learn/be introduced to linear algebra. As tough as proofs were at the beginning, it made for a much better and more effective learning tool as the class went on and I felt I really understood why things were try rather than simply memorizing formulas like in a calculus class. ",
            "\u00a0Sure, as an introduction to linear algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Not with Arie. He really made for a terrible teacher. I know of a couple people who's exams he straight up misplaced. Their grades got shafted because of it too, apparently. Would still take it over 222, though. Linear Algebra is a beautiful subject, and learning it through straight computation honestly does it a disservice. At least the p-sets somewhat facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0No, this class was really interesting, and I liked the material in theory. But it was taught so poorly that the class was unbearable, and I dreaded it every time I had to go. ",
            "\u00a0I would NEVER recommend this course to anyone ever. I thought of being a math major and this course has thoroughly turned me away. I knew going in that the work would be hard, but I had NO idea that I would have such little support. A professor who can't teach and doesn't care about his students on top of notoriously hard material? please stay away ",

But you'll definitely have to motivate yourself to do the weekly psets and stay on top of the material. ",
