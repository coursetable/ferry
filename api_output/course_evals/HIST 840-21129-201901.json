            "\u00a0I gained a broader insight into the historiographical debates on colonialism in Africa and the varied methodologies scholars use to approach key questions. ",
            "\u00a0This course addresses many of the fundamental arguments and interpretations of the African colonial period. We learned about the various forms of, \"motives\" behind, and mechanisms by which colonialism was practiced throughout various parts of the continent and by different powers. This syllabus for this course includes works from various disciplines, from anthropologists to political scientists. ",

            "\u00a0It might be helpful to re-arrange some of the texts so that we have broader overviews at the beginning, or to read bits and pieces of Cooper's text alongside other readings to get more context. ",
            "\u00a0This course brought together students from various disciplines and with various levels of experience with the subject matter into lively and productive discussion. The focus on writing and posing questions made for many exciting seminars. ",

            "\u00a0Dr. Harms is brilliant and to be taught by him was truly an honor. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the readings for this course. I thought Prof Harms did excellent with his monograph selections. The readings were well organized in the form of a build-up from one week to the other. At the end of the course, Prof Harms asked students to make recommendations to improve the course for subsequent years. This to me is very useful and shows how he is committed to designing courses that reflect the needs of students. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was its breadth; reading the history of British and French colonialism from a variety of angles offered students a range of perspectives and accounts. One weakness, however, might be in the geographic distribution of readings; the majority focused on western and southern Africa. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning more about European colonialism in Africa. The course is structured in a way that covers several major historical works within the field, as well as providing a broad overview of the discourse of colonialism. ",
