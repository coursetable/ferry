It seems like a relevant course for economics students, but could also be taken by people with other academic backgrounds if they are proficient with the level of math. The course was divided fairly straight forward and the professor more or less stuck to the syllabus, which was nice. \r\n\r\nA part of the course that stands out for me is the part where we focused on extensive form games and Baysian games with imperfect information. This. I think, is something I will take with me in my further economics  studies. ",

We saw a lot of different examples during the course, both videos and different written examples on the board. This is to me a very crucial component to be able to understand and learn.\r\n- A very nice professor, who was very approachable. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- The classroom provided for us was way too small. About 1/3 of the students had do desk to sit at which was very unfortunate, especially during the exams. I don't know where or with whom this responsibility lies, but hopefully next year they will match the number of students with the right classroom.\r\n- There was not very good feedback from out problem sets. The problem sets were marked with a grade and that was it. It would have been nice at least to be able to see the solutions, so you had a chance to improve.\r\n- The exam very much focused on the last to lectures had before the exam. It would have been nice to make it ore representative of the course by including more of what we had learned in the first couple of weeks. ",
