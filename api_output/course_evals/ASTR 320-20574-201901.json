            "\u00a0Over the course of the semester, I learned absolutely nothing in this class. This is not for my lack of trying; I read the professor's lecture notes and took notes on them every day before coming to class, I worked hard on problem sets, and I tried to remain engaged and attentive in class. However, this material is so abstract and difficult to absorb on its own that adding a professor who isn't that great at lecturing or even making sure students understand material was a recipe for disaster. The only knowledge I gained was in my own studying for the exams, and is not credited to the professor. That being said, this class covered fluid dynamics, gravitation, and radiative processes. ",
            "\u00a0You do learn about fluid mechanics and radiative processes, but most of my learning was done through self study for exams rather than in class or through problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I learned fluid dynamics in the class, and some of the gravity / 2 body encounter material was repetitive of Astro 310. This class is not a physical processes in astronomy course, its really just a fluid dynamics class that touches on some gravity topics for 1 or 2 lectures ",
            "\u00a0The biggest thing that I learned from this class was how to cram for a test. I have never before had to shove so much information at once into my brain without comprehension. This class was supposed to cover fluid dynamics and assorted other miscellaneous astronomy things but the first half of the course was comprised entirely of overly complicated derivations done in in realllllly light chalk in small handwriting in a dim room on a distant chalk board.  I mostly just tuned out and then crammed the lecture notes into my head the night before the test. This class did a really bad job of emphasizing comprehension or facilitating digestion of the material. The problem sets weren't that obviously related to the lecture material and really did not help at all in understanding the course material (or memorizing the equations which it turned out was necessary both for the midterm and the oral final). ",
            "\u00a0I can now recite an entire textbook of fluid dynamics and assorted other physical processes in astronomy. Whenever I hear a triggering keyword, my brain jumps to the beginning of that chapter of the lecture notes and runs through everything about the topic. But I don't know what any of it actually means or how to apply it. I didn't learn anything in class - lectures were dry and so math heavy that I often lost sight of what we were talking about. There were often mistakes in the lectures that no one caught because we were all lost, so I ended up not being able to really trust anything we learned in lecture and relied only on the lecture notes textbook while studying. My time would have been better spent not going to class at all and just reading the notes. There was far too much material covered, and so studying was a frantic rush to memorize far more than we could actually comprehend. I understood basically none of what we were doing until reading week. PSETs didn't correspond to what we were learning in class, and so I had to rely on prior knowledge and lots of keyword searching and googling to figure out problems. They were graded inconsistently, so it was hard to judge how well I was doing and how much I actually understood concepts. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This class is basically only weaknesses. Lectures are confusing, dry, and abstract. The professor actively turned students away when they asked for help and refused to have a TA or set office hours. The material is immensely difficult on its own. The only strength is that the professor's lecture notes were a textbook to study from, and were comprehensive. ",
            "\u00a0The one strength of this course is that Professor van den Bosch has written a 200 page textbook specifically for this course. Unfortunately this book is riddled with sentence openers such as It then obviously follows.. or As one can clearly see.. when referring to complex material and conclusions which are in fact not obvious to most students.  \r\n\r\nThis course is in desperate need of a teaching fellow. Professor van den Bosch has no regular office hours, his grading is largely subjective, and he was often reluctant to substantively answer students questions about homework. If this is how Professor van den Bosch intends to continue teaching 320 then there needs to be a TF assigned who can speak to grading discrepancies and is available to answer student questions. ",
            "\u00a0This class is difficult to navigate in many ways. The only strength I can think of is the new material I learned, but everything else is incredibly frustrating and discouraging.\r\n\r\nThe problem sets are designed to push students and to test the limits of what they know, on top of being graded very harshly for what seems like arbitrary reasons. The more text explaining what you did argument for giving someone a 60% on a problem set that is nearly objectively/factually correct in terms of the questions asked is ridiculous.\r\n\r\nAt the very end of the course the professor mentioned that the intent of the problems sets was so that no one/very few in the class actually do well and he always expects low scores. He explained that because people dont go into detail for every single fact/theorem theyre using that indicates a lesser understanding. This wouldve been helpful to know week 1 or 2 when we were all trying to understand why we were getting almost failing grades on problem sets that were technically correct. The grading is also incredibly arbitrary  you can get anywhere from 1 to 4 points off for putting an X symbol as a multiplication and he interprets it as a cross product.\r\n\r\nThe course should also have a TA. The professor was not helpful when it came to explaining or giving guidance on problem set questions or class material. He often told us to read another textbook to find an explanation in lieu of having him explain it.\r\n\r\nThe course should cover WAY less material. By the time the final came around it seemed like a memorization game as opposed to a course in which you could show your understanding of topics. Because of the oral final, there is no way I couldve walked into his office without knowing every single thing we learned in the class, which made it difficult to quickly absorb all 167 pages of his lecture notes and just regurgitate in an hour. ",
            "\u00a0This course was almost entirely weaknesses. An anecdote that sums up why this was is that Professor van den Bosch peppers his lectures (and lecture notes) quite often with the phrases \"obviously\" and \"it clearly follows that\" when in fact almost nothing about fluid dynamics is obvious or clear to students who have never learned the subject before!! The homeworks in this class were challenging, but not in the good way. They did not help at all in digesting the (very dense and complicated) course material and were graded absurdly subjectively with no clearly outlined criteria. Professor van den Bosch has no regularly scheduled office hours and is not very approachable or eager to offer help when it is requested. He flies through the lectures, frequently pausing to ask the students what the \"obvious\" next step is when all of us are 5 minutes behind trying to catch up! When no immediate answer is given, Professor van den Bosch looks disappointedly at the class and continues with the next line which \"clearly follows\" from the last. The expectations for the tests are also quite opaque. On the midterm, Professor van den Bosch explicitly told us to skip an entire chapter of the lecture notes, only to include questions on that chapter on the test! The two biggest overall flaws about this class are (1) that it covers too much material and (2) there are not sufficient resources for seeking help. The first issue could be fixed by cutting out much of the second half material which is covered in Astro 310 (gravity, impulse, etc.) and spending more time on the fluid portion. The second issue could be fixed by providing a TA for this class and having Professor van den Bosch read some articles on conscientious teaching. Specifically, he could schedule office hours which would make him more approachable, be less discouraging in his emails, and be more aware of the impact that his language has on impressionable students. ",
            "\u00a0The largest problem with this class is that it's extremely difficult to get help when you need it (which is often, as the material is difficult!). This can be easily helped by having a TA. Class went over so much material so quickly that I got confused very often, and it would be super helpful to be able to sit down with someone who I wasn't afraid to ask a ton of questions. A TA would be a more casual way to ask questions and get help on PSETs, and to get the amount of help that we needed. Professor van den Bosch is obviously very busy, doesn't have set office hours, and was sometimes willing to help but sometimes refused to meet with us. Especially when we had questions about the PSETs, he occasionally flat out told us that he wouldn't help us any more and wanted us to figure things out by ourselves. I understand not wanting to walk us through the entire PSET, but the questions were often confusingly worded, and didn't correspond exactly to what we were learning. I was usually extremely confused when I first attempted to answer questions, but when I had the opportunity to ask those questions I would understand more of what was going on. When forced to fend for myself, although I sometimes managed to get the right answers, I often didn't actually understand what was going on with the problem, which was frustrating and stunted my learning. PSETs were graded pretty arbitrarily, with points taken off one person's pset but not someone else's for similar things. Points were sometimes taken off for not explaining every single thing we were doing, so that by the end of the semester I was explaining even the simplest addition to avoid points being taken off, which took a ton of time that I could have been using to try to understand the material. Separately, Professor van den Bosch commonly used phrases such as \"it should be obvious\" and \"clearly this follows\" when things were far from simple. This made me feel like I should be able to make jumps in math and logic that I couldn't make, which made me feel stupid. It also prohibited me from asking questions, because if the material is \"really rather easy\" than I shouldn't have questions about it, and I might be seen as dumb by the class or Professor van den Bosch if I do. This classroom environment has been repeatedly shown to have a negative impact on minority groups and women, who already often feel as though they don't belong in spaces such as STEM classes and fields like astrophysics. If it weren't for my amazing classmates, who I knew were also struggling, I would have felt isolated and that maybe I'm not cut out for this kind of work. Providing structures for help (like a TA!) and removing some of this type of language from the lecture notes would make class a more conducive environment to ask questions, which would help everyone understand more of the material. Lastly, I think this class covers far too much material. Some of what we did was also covered in ASTR 310 and PHYS 401/402, so reworking the curriculum with these classes in mind and removing repetitive material would free up some class time. Perhaps some of the more difficult math (microscopic view) could also be removed, as I'm pretty sure no one truly understood that. To really make the class more manageable so that there's time to do example problems in class and really delve into and understand topics, I would suggest renaming this class Fluid Dynamics and only covering the fluids section (which was about 2/3 of the class). The other assorted physical properties in astronomy were largely repetitive with other required astro classes, and seemed random after spending so much time on one connected topic. Reducing material would be a huge improvement in allowing time to actually understand, digest, and use material instead of simply memorizing it for tests. "

            "\u00a0This is the worst class I have ever taken taught by arguably the worst professor I've ever interacted with. Please, avoid it at all costs. I'm going to break this down into three different sections: the course material itself, the structure of the class, and the professor (Prof van den Bosch). \r\n\r\nThe topics covered in this class were fluid dynamics, gravitation, and radiative processes. I knew some things about radiative processes and a fair bit about gravitation before this class. However, this course mainly focuses on fluid dynamics. The sheer amount of material is ridiculous, and I feel like I never understood anything when it was being explained, but not for lack of trying; I read the lecture notes every day before attending class and still couldn't figure out what was going on. On exams, I simply had to regurgitate discrete facts and reason my way through how they were connected as any form of understanding. To pass this class, you NEED to have strong memorization skills because that's how you'll learn most of the material; not through critical thinking, but rote memorization.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this class was terrible. Each class was a lecture, which is standard enough. What wasn't standard was that the professor refused to have office hours and there was no TA. If you didn't understand material, you basically had no hope of learning it because there were no structures in place to help. The class had 6 problem sets, a midterm, and a final. Class mainly covered complicated mathematical derivations or abstract concepts, whereas problem sets asked you to apply formulas you hadn't learned using methods you hadn't been taught to solve problems you didn't even know could exist. There was virtually no overlap between homework and class. If you want to do well on psets, just search the posted lecture notes for the problem you're doing because you will be given no tools or instruction on how to complete assignments. The midterm was written and the final was a 1 hour long oral exam. You will be completely unprepared for these exams, so memorize equations, what terms in them mean, how they're derived, and how they apply to concepts. Try to take this class with friends or other people in your major, even if it means waiting to take it for a year or taking it a year early; basically nothing will prepare you, so get it done with people you know will support and help you, because the Professor sure won't.\r\n\r\nProfessor van den Bosch was truly terrible. Not only was he not good at teaching, he was problematic in many other ways. To start with his teaching, he races through lectures and constantly assumes that students know more than they actually do. Whenever we asked questions, he seemed to get testy or angry at us for not understanding, which is extremely alienating when you're trying to learn. Students would email him asking for help on concepts or problem sets, and he would turn them away and be rude in his emails to them. It seems that he was trying to isolate students, and that simply isn't an effective way to teach. However, this was just the tip of the iceberg. Our class happened to be predominantly women, and he would occasionally make comments about women that made people uncomfortable. He threatened our class with excom when he realized that we'd been studying together because he wouldn't give us any help. He constantly used phrases like \"obviously\" or \"clearly\" and just made students feel dumb when they didn't understand extremely complex material on their own. \r\n\r\nIn short, I would NEVER recommend this class. You won't really need to worry about your grade, though; I learned I got a B before doing this evaluation, which I'm thrilled about. The material is too long and difficult, there are no support structures in place, and the professor is awful. The fact that most students made it through is a testament to their brilliance, hard work, perseverance, and camaraderie despite the obstacles put in their way. ",
            "\u00a0No I would not. Like ever. The course covers way too much material for most students to substantively understand and retain any of the content. From the beginning it feels as if you are being set up to fail with problem sets that extend past content covered in class and incredibly challenging exams. Additionally the grading procedure for your problem sets and the oral final exam is so openly subjective that it feels like there is no way to feel confident about your work in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Unless youre an astrophysics major, dont take this class. You could probably get a better understanding of fluid dynamics in a different class. Please take this class with friends/people you can work with. It can feel at times isolating and discouraging to try and learn material and understand problem set questions, and when you feel like you finally have it you get low scores on every assignment understand this is not a reflection of if you know the material!! Its more likely a reflection of if youve re-proved Newtons 1st law in your problem set. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. Unless there is a different professor, or there is a TA, or the class is just formatted completely differently. This class was only survivable because of the support provided by other classmates. If you are planning to take this class by yourself, beware that it is really difficult to get help. Professor van den Bosch is not approachable or encouraging and only explained his grading techniques at the very end of the class. This class is really difficult but not in the good way where you learn lots of stuff. It's difficult and frustrating and you end up memorizing the lecture notes because there is not one to help you understand the concepts. This class is honestly really really disappointing. Not only in its content, but also in the way it makes you feel. I worry for young students taking this class. If I hadn't had the support of my peers, I probably would've thought that I was just struggling because I was stupid and I wouldn't have known how to seek help. If you take this class alone, it might make you feel really defeated and alone. If you have to take this class, you should definitely demand scheduled office hours and a TA. ",
            "\u00a0Please don't take this unless you have to. I didn't learn anything that I couldn't have learned by reading the lecture notes (which are available online). This class was a constant source of stress, as I was never sure if my level of understanding would correspond to my grades. Professor van den Bosch grades very harshly, which is fine, but it would be great if he could have told us at the beginning that he expected low average scores and that a 60% on a PSET doesn't mean that you don't understand anything. Asking for help was always stressful, as I was afraid of being judged or thought to be dumb. There weren't too many PSETs, but they were difficult and didn't correspond to class material, so I felt like they were a waste of my time. Then I had to memorize the entirety of the lecture notes for tests, which was time consuming and didn't correspond to actual understanding. "
