            "\u00a0Needs to be organized better and more consistent across the different sections. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was good -- the lectures and psets were helpful & the grading was fair. I wish the midterm and final review sessions were more helpful, but otherwise it's a good class. ",
            "\u00a0VERY teacher dependent. I had an amazing instructor but shopped the other sections and they were terrible. ",
            "\u00a0the class was pretty well paced - 1 pset a week. some of the topics were explained very clearly but for some, I benefitted so much from watching Gilbert Strang's lectures from MIT OpenCourseWare/reading the textbook. this year was the first year the professor taught the course so it was just ok. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - learned linear algebra pretty well. Weaknesses - psets were confusing/frequently covered topics we hadn't learned, grading on exams was unnecessarily harsh, teachers did not provide adequate resources for exam preparation. ",
            "\u00a0Make sure you buy the textbook because sometimes lectures can be unclear/difficult ",
            "\u00a0I felt it moved very fast and topics were not explained in relation to each other ",
            "\u00a0The course was ok, but could benefit from further standardization of the lectures across the sections. Some topics were covered briefly or not at all in some sections and then appeared on problem sets and tests. ",
            "\u00a0The professors varied a lot among the sections, and the different professors at times taught different things. Our final exams were also different based on section which was rather annoying. I enjoyed the size of this class however, it was not too big so you could feel comfortable asking questions in class. I also think the textbook was very good. I do wish that my professor had posted some sort of notes online. Also, posting answer keys to the psets would have been extremely helpful when it came to studying for the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Linear algebra is a good course. It became very theoretical at times, and sometimes I would have preferred an additional, concrete example. ",
            "\u00a0The course would benefit from instructors holding more office hours since the two hours a week each instructor holds isn't nearly enough. Also, the instructors should work more on coordinating their lessons to make sure we receive the same number of homework problems and lessons for each week.\r\nExams were returned to us very late after our taking them. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well-organized and encouraged student participation in the form of asking questions, which I liked. I do not think there is much room for improvement teaching-wise. I would have liked to learn about Fourier transformations, which was not part of the 222 curriculum. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes it was difficult to complete the psets with just what we learned in lecture, so it was usually necessary to go to office hours to get help to complete the psets. But the midterms and final were overall fair and were representative of what we learned in class, and the TA's do their best to help us! They were very patient and kind and always did their best to help us and figure out the questions together. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course is that it follows along (somewhat, until the end) of Strang's lectures at MIT (who wrote the textbook). However, one weakness is that the professors do not teach well enough so that I am able to confidently take the test: I was very ill-prepared for the first exam. I went to review sessions, but they only confused me more. Strang's lectures were the guiding light. Moreover, although it is necessary for this course to be standardized across all sections, I wish that if one class did not go over a certain subject, then it would not appear on the test. However, single value decomposition showed up on the test, although it was not gone over in my section. The professor emailed us notes so that we would understand it, but I think it is grossly unfair for that to happen. Also, weakness: problem sets are due weeks of exams, including final: THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN! "

            "\u00a0I obviously haven't taken 225, but 222 was a perfectly good class that taught me everything I needed to know. I don't think you can go wrong by taking this class over 225. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you can find a good professor. Linear algebra is pretty fun and it's really important for a lot of other fields. ",
            "\u00a0yes if it is necessary for the major or if knowledge of linear algebra would be helpful for life. For example, I'm a Computer Science major and this class is not a requirement of the major, but I know that linear algebra is used a lot in CS/data science (topics came up in my NLP class this year). It wasn't necessarily my favorite class of the year, but I do think I learned important info. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student who was very interested in math. For someone who is just taking math for fun, this is a challenging class that requires a lot of focus and work to stay on top of. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. If Math 120 was the last math class you took before taking this course, your faith in Yale math may be restored to a minimal extent. The content is interesting, and is not too challenging to understand. What I disliked though was how we had to fully rely on Gilbert Strang's MIT videos to understand most of the course's contents as the instructors rushed over the materials in class. It surely does feel like a lot of content in a short amount of time since the last few weeks were filled with shallowly-taught topics. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student who would like to learn about linear algebra but is not yet ready to be exposed to the rigor of a proof-based course. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if you are taking it for your major. ",
            "\u00a0I would never recommend this course to another student, unless it was required of their major. I took this course because quantum chemistry sounds like it would use linear algebra: I had to credit-d-fail the course halfway through because I was unsure if I would even pass this class. This class is definitely not well-facilitated to teach you anything: just watch Strang's lectures. "
