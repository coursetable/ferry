            "\u00a0I learned about how interdisciplinary Rome is! This course taught me to view everything Roman through the same framework of applying historical narratives to anachronistic contexts (I mean that critically, not praisingly). Seriously, I was taught that every development in Rome from Monarchy to Republic to Empire to papal city states, to Fascist rule was a perfect byproduct of the classic texts and mythos of ancient Rome rather than a series of calculated and isolated decisions. This class held so true to the iconicity of Rome that it often didn't consider whether any of Rome's developments were actually antithetical to Rome and its values, rather than fulfilling it's preordained trajectory from antiquity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to read buildings and art for Roman influence, as well as some of the greatest themes in Roman thought and stories. I learned how Rome has influenced so many aspects of Western culture and political thought today. I learned how to bring the world around me and art in the YUAG and YCBA into my studies. Learned how to read (and enjoy!) epic poetry. ",
            "\u00a0We learned how to analyze various literary, political, and historical texts and place them in the larger context of Roman history. We also learned how to look at and assess aspects of various works of art and architecture. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of knowledge about Roman history, literature, architecture, art, poetry, and movies from antiquity to the 20th century! Very broad swath of knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing - by far one of the best classes I've taken at Yale mainly because the professor is so engaging. This class taught about the risings and fallings of Ancient Rome, concluding with its conversion from Polytheistic Rome to Christian Rome. I developed the ability to think about monuments, paintings, or physical objects as tools for education. It definitely helped me learn how to think creatively. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the origins, history, and legacy of Rome, how writers and politicians reworked this narrative to suite their ideological needs, and how Roman culture still influences Western society today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Ancient Rome and how Roman history relates to the modern world. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of the impact that Ancient Rome has had on civilizations throughout time. I developed annotating skills and strengthened my ability to analyze texts and compare them to others relating to the course. "

            "\u00a0This course had very few strengths, one of them being the fact that a course about such a great city can only sink so low, no matter how poorly it's designed.\r\n\r\nOne of my least favorite courses I've taken at Yale, The City of Rome, which purports to be a seminar, is, for all intents and purposes, a lecture. There were immense amounts of readings that we hardly ever covered entirely, the analysis we were offered was superficial at best, and hardly ever made reference to any intellectual or scholarly tradition. Furthermore, we kept circling back to the same few themes (memory, law, public vs private spheres, building, etc.) that felt super monolithic since those themes were the only lenses through which we were taught to consider the entirety of Roman history. Ideas and texts that were supposed to be thought provoking, heretical, reactionary, and incendiary were reduced to those same superficial common denominator themes memory, public vs private spheres, etc. And so, what were supposed to be interesting ideas that should have caused us to reconsider historical narratives later in Rome's history were presented to us as logical, and rigid continuations of literally the same exact themes we read about in the texts of Rome's earliest thinkers.\r\n\r\nBecause of all this, The City of Rome felt intellectually suffocating. I would not recommend this class to anyone.\r\n\r\nIf this review seems angry or frustrated it's because this course was ultimately disheartening. I love Rome with all my heart, as a city and as a concept. I thought this course was going to be an awesome way to learn more about it, but I ended up being disappointed with the whole thing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Jewiss is a very engaging speaker. I felt like I learned a ton for every single minute of class. I liked that we had lots of smaller, \"out-of-the-box\" assignments such as coming up with visuals that synthesized what we'd learned in readings, written responses to viewing art and buildings outside of class, and coming up with our own omens (Romans love omens! a major takeaway). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there is so much to talk about in this class that we were always behind where we should have been on the syllabus, making due dates for readings and assignments somewhat difficult to figure out ahead of time. It was usually fine, though. ",
            "\u00a0This course had many strengths, but what I liked most about it was how reasonably all the assignments were spaced out. Even though we were covering a lot of material, the readings and writing assignments always felt manageable. The one weakness of the course is that because it attempted to cover such a broad range of time (all of Roman history), we were always behind on the syllabus and sometimes could not discuss works we had read. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor, fun seminars, fascinating material, excellent readings\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: covering Rome from its founding to today is very ambitious, so we skip a lot and make a lot of generalizations. We also were perpetually about 2-3 weeks behind on syllabus starting from January, but Prof Jewiss was always flexible and understanding with deadlines and work was never overwhelming. Just don't take this class if you like rigid syllabi. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the professor would have given us a better idea of why we weren't performing well on assignments and been consistent with her reasoning. ",
            "\u00a0We try to cover more course material than we can reasonably cover. This could at times be frustrating and confusing for students. That being said, I did learn a tremendous amount about Rome and Western culture as a whole, and do feel like this class was essential to my academic experience. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very engaging and the class discussions were always interesting. Professor Jewiss is a great professor who challenges students to think about the world in new ways. The assignments were challenging and creative but very fun! ",
            "\u00a0The course syllabus was sometimes difficult to follow and it would be unclear what readings or assignments were due for which class. "

I would not recommend this class to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in learning about the stories that drove Rome and how they continue to influence us today! This course connected to my other classes in the coolest, most surprising ways which was lovely. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any student regardless of their major. Even though it is a seminar course, in my opinion it manages to combine the best aspects of lecture and seminar classes: there is a small class size and lots of opportunities for participation, but the professor also goes in-depth on historical context, which is very helpful for understanding the readings. The assignments in this course were unlike anything I'd had to do for another class at Yale - they were very creative and thought-provoking, but never overly stressful. The subject matter is fascinating, and Professor Jewiss is probably one of the best people in the world to be teaching it. This course is a great option for English/Humanities/non-STEM majors, but also for people who just need a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely yes - Prof Jewiss is great, seminars are fun, readings are interesting, great mix of literature/history/art. Course caused me to decide to major in classical civilization (as well as history). ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! The professor is so engaging - you will definitely get something out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, good course if you want to learn a lot about Rome. ",
            "\u00a0Everyone should take this course!!! Its so interesting! ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. I enjoyed the readings and the subjects we discussed in class. I would make sure the other student would be aware of the workload. "
