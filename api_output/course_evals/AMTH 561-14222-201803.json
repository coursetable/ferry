            "\u00a0In this course, I was able to better understand how eigenvectors and eigenvalues work, applied to many different kinds of situation (for many graphs). I learned how to better do mathematical proofs and discovered a whole new field of spectral graph theory. This course also helped building bridges with other fields, with some applications to optimization and random walk and probabilities, and abstract algebra. I enjoyed learning about the pretty math of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Basically, went from 0 to very reasonable proficiency in understanding what a graph Laplacian is, what eigenvectors and eigenvalues mean, understand the basics of diffusion. Gained a lot of practice with several proof writing approaches and several good skills in applied mathematics.\r\nMajor insights into spectral theorem. ",

            "\u00a0I really refined my knowledge of advanced linear algebra, but generally got a very nice overview of spectral graph theory. I got a sense for the sorts of bounds one can prove and the methods for doing so, as well as the algorithmic questions and recent advances. It was definitely good practice for various proof techniques (again, particularly drawing on linear algebra), which are more broadly applicable. ",

The most interesting parts of the course for me were when we analyzed conductances, resistances and random walks, since these can be extended to real-world applications. A large part of the course also focuses on expander graphs, and while the math is pretty it can be unintuitive at times. This course can also help you get a decent working knowledge of linear algebra, which Yales actual lin alg courses (222 & 225) will unfortunately not do. ",

            "\u00a0I found that the homework were extremely challenging and I wish there were other resources for the courses, than the (amazing) lectures notes from Professor Spielman. But since he's one of the creators of that field, it makes sense that only his notes were available for the class. I enjoyed working with my classmates on this class, I also learned a lot from them. Chris Harshaw was also an excellent TA for the course, giving us perspectives and insights on understanding the homework questions.\r\nAlso, I usually spent between 25 and 30 hours on each of the homework and was never able to fully solve them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the lectures and homework are really good.\r\n\r\nI felt the Professor's discussions on \"what are important\" and \"history of this field\" where very valuable.\r\nCourse is very well organized. \r\nThe lecture notes are very good.\r\n\r\nWeakness: I think I would have appreciated slightly more homework related to the spectral theorem, but this is a bit of pre-req so I'm not sure if it's appropriate. I would have appreciated more time on generating bounds by comparing to the complete graph, I felt that this section woudl actually have benefited from a \"worse proof\" (one that takes longer) if we could get more insight from the professor as we talked about the problem.\r\n\r\nThis is a REALLY good course, it's hard to come up with a weakness. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are: interesting material, excellent lectures, challenging/fun problems.\r\nOnly real weakness I can think of is that since we covered a lot of material without any review, it's hard to remember what we covered. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful course!!!!! Could not be improved! ",
            "\u00a0Dan is a wonderful lecturer. He tends to give the intuition behind what we will spend the class doing at the beginning and then outlines the proof as he goes. However, sometimes the pieces aren't fully connected for me and I tend to get lost partway through class (around the 45 minute mark normally). This may be more my weakness than anything, however some additional connective tissue to motivate lemmas could be useful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is extremely well-taught and organized, and the homeworks are hard - but just the right level that they're possible to solve, and satisfying when you do. Professor Spielman is an excellent lecturer, who clearly put a lot of time and thought into picking topics and how exactly to describe them. He does so in a way that's intuitive and tries to show how researchers developed their ideas. It is difficult to think of any criticisms, except that perhaps the topics weren't always very coherent - in some cases, earlier parts of the course tied together with later courses, and Professor Spielman was very good about previewing/highlighting these, but other topics felt pretty unrelated from all the others and were more like (disconnected) components. There wasn't necessarily a clear trajectory of building towards the topics at the end of the course, but that may just be the nature of the field: in the end, we did still get to talk about a lot of different, interesting topics. ",

Dan goes a little too fast in class, so it's hard to know what's going on if you zone out for a even a minute. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Spielman was a great lecturer, but I wish that one of the problem sets involved implementing the concepts we learned in a simple way -- it would've been nice to see the applications of spectral graph theory to other fields. ",
            "\u00a0The rigor of this course was great, as was the general choice and sequence of topics covered. Sometimes problems on the problemsets were set up such that one little formula/ neat trick from the lecture notes was all it took to solve it, which could be a little underwhelming. But overall Dan did a good job of making clear why the problems are worth solving. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a very good course...but I do notice Dan loses half of students' attention when he tries to explain something very difficult, but I don't see a way other than students work harder to solve this problem. ",

Spielman follows his notes almost to the letter, which means he usually skips the exact same details that are skipped in the notes. Therefore you need to come very prepared for class in order to follow everything and be able to ask good questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is extremely strong. Dan's notes are invaluable, and I'm not sure that I could have done the class without them. I don't have much criticism. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prof. Spielman. He was just incredible. \r\nWeaknesses:  I would have appreciated a bit more emphasis on the applications (e.g. in machine learning), but given the amount of material we covered, it makes sense that it was not included. ",
            "\u00a0Dan Spielman is an amazing teacher. He speaks slowly and clearly, and his lectures and notes synthesize recent research in a way that is just simple enough to be accessible to students without glossing over important details. The only criticism I have is that I didn't really understand the big picture of what exactly the topics we learned about are used for, though I think that can be clarified with more experience in this field. ",

The homework are also pretty challenging. I would recommend it to grad students or advanced undergrads, because this is a much greater intellectual challenge and much greater workload than the other classes I have taken at Yale. ",

Professor Spielman is an excellent lecturer, who puts a TON of thought into the topics he presents and how he presents them. The material is interesting and interdisciplinary, and the proof techniques you hone seem pretty broadly applicable. The problem sets are often difficult and will require time, effort, and creativity, but are SO worthwhile to do - it's a thrill to get the solution, and they really reinforce understanding of the lecture material.
