            "\u00a0I became more familiarized with chords and scales (in major and minor keys) and trained my ears to better recognize intervals, chord qualities, etc. "

        [
            "\u00a0The course was good at moving from topic to topic and getting students to really practice musicianship skills. The main weakness of the course was that it didn't \"teach\" so much as it \"quizzed.\" Every day in class, we would basically do ear-training quizzes either for practice or for a grade. I don't feel like I really learned any new techniques in class or got enough training to actually be able to do the things that were asked on the midterm/final. Really the only way to get better at a skill was to work on it on your own, and even then it was kind of up to luck/personal skill/former musicianship training. By the end, people were still struggling with the same things that they had had trouble on throughout the semester (e.g. identifying diminished and augmented chords, dictation, etc.). "

            "\u00a0If you already have some background in ear training, yes. It may be difficult if all the material is brand new to you. ",
            "\u00a0People take this class for a variety of reasons, and, if you are already a musician who wants to refine your skills or needs the credit/pre-req for another class that you are doing, I would say go for it. If your only background is 110, there is a huge gap between the two classes, and I'm not sure that any amount of practice of material from 110 could really prepare you for this. A lot of it is just training your ear to hear rhythms, harmonic intervals, chords, etc., and you don't really \"learn\" those things in this class so much as you drill them. A lot of the class is just quizzes and drills, and you have to come up with your own techniques to learn and memorize sounds outside of class (though this may depend on your instructor). Personally speaking, I didn't have much prior experience with ear training and there were some skills that I just couldn't develop no matter how much I practiced at them. All in all, though, I did get better at a few things (like identifying and playing chords and solfege). The instructors are usually aware and understanding of your starting level and personal development, so I managed to \"survive\" the course without much prior training, but I would say take it at your own risk. Also, if you're not already aware, this class comes with a half-hour keyboard lab every week, but it is still counted as only half a credit (at least at the time of my writing this). "
