            "\u00a0I learned a lot of valuable background in artificial intelligence and cognitive science more broadly. It was useful to think about what intelligence is and how to conceptualize it, both in humans, nonhuman animals, and machines. I learned more of the computational side of psychology, including working with other students on how to build a computational model, as well as some interesting insights into how computer scientists are addressing problems in psychology using things like machine learning.

            "\u00a0I think the breadth of this course was really strong. We covered a lot of important and foundational works and topics, and I think conceptually it was structured really well. I feel like it sometimes spent too long on meandering discussions, and that class time could have been better spent going over the interesting papers and frameworks we discussed, rather than talking about what students thought about them. I also think that it could have been better served by getting some more hands on guidance on projects, like building simple computational models and so on, having assignments outside of reading responses, and so on.
