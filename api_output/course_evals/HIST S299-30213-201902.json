            "\u00a0I learned about the comprehensive history of Southeastern Europe from prehistory to the present. We covered a lot of different groups and certain ideologies through different time periods. Since Professor Banac is extremely knowledgeable and had first hand experience with the situations unfolding in this area, we could much better understand what was occurring before, during, and after the Yugoslav Wars. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much better general understanding of the Balkan region as it was previously an area I knew very little about. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the rich yet difficult history about the Balkans. All the way from the ancient Roman Empire times up to modern day time, this course has covered a wide range of cultural events that have shaped what we know as the Balkans today. ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into how the Balkans and beyond has been shaped by empires (including the Ottomans and the Hapsburg monarchy), and some customs in the region ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the culture and history of the Balkans! I also learned how to write a cohesive research paper. ",

            "\u00a0Vast knowledge about the balkans and skills that you only can get from studying abroad ",
            "\u00a0I previously didn't know much about southeastern Europe, but after this course I feel knowledgable and happy to have learned so much about the area. I was able to think critically and develop new thought processes about southeastern Europe and its relationship to the world. "

            "\u00a0I felt that this course's strengths were in its excursions and professors - I think the professors were excellent at presenting material in a way that is understandable, and I thought that the excursion provided the class with valuable cultural experiences. I felt that one weakness was that the class readings sometimes echoed exactly the content taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the professors. Both professors are incredibly knowledgable and Dean B especially takes amazing care of the group and really just wants everyone to be low stress and enjoy themselves. ",
            "\u00a0I can really only list strengths: this course was absolutely amazing and probably one of the most enriching experiences of my life. Professor Banac and Dean B were extremely knowledgeable and could answer any question we could think to ask in class. Students got firsthand experience living in and learning about culture and the history we learned about was all around us. The workload was perfect in that we still learned a great deal while having enough time to experience all the city had to offer. ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing and one of the many strengths was the excursions as they allowed you to better understand the information you were learning about as you experienced many things first hand. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it is taught by two tenured professors that not only have a great amount of knowledge on the region but also are able to share some personal experiences. Additionally, the excursions allowed us students to further delve into the topics that we had learned in our lectures and allowed us to experience things firsthand. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of the course is the immersive experiences that can only be had in the balkans. That said, I wish that the course itself was a bit more interactive, though I do understand that lecturing has a very specific format. ",
            "\u00a0The excursions and overall environment was fantastic. It was the best class. I cant think of any weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0Yes yes yes!! This summer session class is hands down the best one. It is extremely low workload, just a weekly response to anything pertaining to class or the excursion or anything you want to research that relates to the topics covered that week. Class is an hour and a half each day and then you have tons of free time for the beach, gym, hanging out, walking around the old city. Every weekend is a group excursion that are super fun and usually just involve a lot of great food and fun times. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course was the single best decision of my Yale career. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, do it! ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely! This class was amazing as you could tell Professor Banac really enjoyed everything he was teaching and was very knowledgable about the history of the region. The excursion were also super fun as you got to explore some other countries around Croatia and truly experience the culture of the region while also getting to some other amazing people from Yale! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to other students who are interested in learning about history and culture of a different region from their own. I personally, before starting the program, did not know much about the Balkan region and its history, let alone have ever delved deeply into European history. That being said, this course was extremely comprehensible and a great opportunity to really learn about a region firsthand in the country itself.  It was truly an eye-opening experience and I found everything so fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, not only was the course engaging and informative, but the interactive excursions allowed the students to understand the material on a deeper level. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if you want to spend your summer in one of the most beautiful places in the world and get to know how ethnic nationalism impacts the day to day interactions of people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! I have never learned so much in such a stress-free environment. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, Absolutely. Fantastic experience if you are considering this please do it. ",
