            "\u00a0Independent research is really great. I learned a lot about process of research as well as practical skills like coding and understanding complicated physics fast. ",
            "\u00a0Writing in Latex! No joke, the progress report for this class made me finally get my shit together and learn how to write a proper APS style article. Also time management ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about what it's like to actually perform research in physics. This was really useful - taking physics 471 was utterly unlike taking a regular physics class - and I think it definitely helped me to get a better idea of whether I would enjoy research in physics. I also learned a fair bit about quantum computing, about collaborating with other researchers, and about reading scientific papers. "

            "\u00a0I really appreciate that we can take research for credit. I think more instruction on how to give a good presentation and write a good final paper would be helpful. These are both important skills, and I feel like we were left to our own devices. (Maybe have drafts/optional practice sessions). ",
            "\u00a0The course could and should be better organized. There were many times over the semester when I was left to my own devices; while this occasionally worked well, more often it made me frustrated. I think that there should be more guidelines about how the research project is performed; in particular, it would be useful if all students were required to either have weekly meetings with their supervisors or send them weekly progress reports.

            "\u00a0The level of intellectual challenge and workload of Independent Projects in Physics will obviously depend on the specifics of the project on which you work, but it is certainly a case in which the amount of time and energy you put into your research correlates directly with what you learn. I would highly recommended Physics 471. ",
            "\u00a0Required for the major. Find an advisor the Summer for the academic year, or the fall semester if spring. ",
            "\u00a0Independent research for credit is a fun way to start gaining research experience! Find a good mentor early and you will have a great time. ",
            "\u00a0Taking physics 471 is a great way of learning whether you enjoy performing research in physics. Your experience will, of course, vary depending on your mentor. I think that students who begin research over the summer and continue it during the term generally have a significantly better experience; if you don't do this, then you'll spend the first half of the semester reading papers and getting up to speed before you actually begin doing any research. Also, almost all of the initiative for setting up meetings with the mentor and doing research is left to the student, so only take this course if you're organized and self-motivated. "
