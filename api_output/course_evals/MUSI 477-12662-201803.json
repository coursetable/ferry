            "\u00a0This class was an incredible and wild ride. The readings and conversations were beyond engaging and it made me think about music in an entirely different way. I may not have an answer to the question of music, but I've certainly thought about it. ",
            "\u00a0I read a lot of different authors and their views on music and other related subjects. I also learned to think critically about music and its place in society. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredibly valuable in posing a lot of questions about the ways we talk and theorize about music, exploring new theoretical possibilities in musicology and music theory. I gained a lot of experience reading, interpreting, and analyzing historical and contemporary texts on music, culture, and society. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: subject matter, intellectual challenge, and class itself. I looked forward to class every week.\r\nWeaknesses: Somewhat vague essay prompts, periodic confusion about course trajectory ",
            "\u00a0I thought the readings were very informative and well-chosen. It would have been great to read even more older texts - from the 18th and 19th centuries - as personally, I found these much more interesting than the modern essays. \r\nAt the end of the course, I was a bit disappointed because we didn't learn what music actually is, but only what different writers thought it is, not giving preference to a single view, but I probably shouldn't complain, because I realize that this was never the aim of the course in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0The greatest strength of this course were Gary Tomlinson and Michael Denning who brought a wealth of knowledge, experience, and enthusiasm to each class. Some of the readings were incredibly difficult, but our Professors were patient in discussion and demonstrated often different interpretations which were both helpful and interesting.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses of the course included the open-ended nature of the class. The material from week to week was often quite different and it was not always clear how we were meant to connect everything we were reading about. This also contributed to the inaccessibility of the course, which is a shame because I feel that having a few more people in the class would have been better for discussion. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course, but you absolutely get out what you put in. Readings are necessary to have a chance of following class discussion, and while you may not get an answer to the question of music, you will absolutely think about music in ways you never have before. I hope this class is offered again and that more people will take it because it's a truly unique experience to have both Professor Denning's and Professor Tomlinson's opinions bouncing off of each other. ",
            "\u00a0This course is about exploring new ways of thinking and writing about music beyond music theory and history. The readings are challenging but the ideas are valuable and having a course co-taught by Michael Denning and Gary Tomlinson is incredible. "
