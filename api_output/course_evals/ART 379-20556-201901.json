            "\u00a0The real strength of the course is the weekly critiques. Producing work every week forces you to put in the time and effort to begin to create a cohesive body of work you can be proud of. One aspect I would have appreciated more of was more time critiquing and talking about professional artists' work, if for no other reason than just to be exposed to more photographers. "

            "\u00a0This class is so good. It's one of the few photography classes where you actual technical knowledge as part of the curriculum. Ben is such a good teacher but more importantly he is approachable and funny and actually cares about his students and their education. If he's teaching it, 100% take it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Ben is an incredible teacher and it's clear that he really cares. I developed a ton of new skills and was excited to go to class every single week. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student with the caveat that you truly only get as much out as you put in. If you aren't willing to work hard in order to be ready for the critiques every week, then you will likely not find the class very rewarding. On the other hand, if you are, you are certain to leave at the very least with the beginnings of a project that really excites and interests you. ",
