            "\u00a0I learnt a lot about how to draw straight lines and realistic ellipses. This class started off really hard and really boring, as many basics are, but by the end - when we had a whole lot more freedom - it was fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class! ",
            "\u00a0I definitely developed my drawing abilities this semester, as well as my general artistic eye. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to reduce objects into simpler shapes, making the drawing process more methodical. I learned how to observe and apply traditional skills to draw accurately. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a much stronger understanding of how to draw 3D objects on a 2D surface. In class, we covered topics such as line, shading, value, composition, and perspective, which built on the foundations that I already had from high school. The weekly assignments also provided excellent practice of the concepts taught in class.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable takeaway from this class for me was that it significantly improved my ability to not be daunted by very intense drawing tasks. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the biggest skill I got was in trusting my direct observation and translating that into the drawing, and also working from direct observation into more abstract things opened up my comfort with trying to put emotion into the art without starting from nowhere, ",
            "\u00a0I learned about one point and two point perspective, and improved my charcoal skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to be self aware about my surroundings. I became more detailed of my observations of nature and life. I learned different ways of drawing by using variety of tools. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0This course did well as far as bringing together people of different talents levels and making sure all were challenged adequately. It could be improved by giving students a little more room for creativity. ",
            "\u00a0Just an amazing class! ",
            "\u00a0I like the way the work is spread out, with typically one assignment per week. I wish we started using a variety of materials a bit earlier on, because it's kind of overwhelming to shift from just one to everything so quickly. I also wish we had a bit longer to work on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness of this course was that we did not actually spend a lot of time in class drawing, so it was difficult to actually know what I was doing wrong until the crit. By then it was too late. Often times, we would get out of class much earlier than scheduled. I do think that that time could have been used to provide more guidance in our drawing. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of weaknesses, I felt that it would have been helpful to be able to redo assignments for improvement. \r\n\r\nHowever, a major strength of the class was its structure each homework assignment built off of what was taught in class, which made the application of those concepts simple to follow. Additionally, the variety of skill level in the class made the environment and feedback received much more constructive. \r\n\r\nThe assignments were also interesting and creative (though also time consuming). Overall, the way this class was taught was enjoyable to me and I saw a lot of improvement in my drawing throughout. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course goes from medium work to a lot of work very quickly and maybe a smoother transition would've been nice, but at the same time it was cool to see how quickly we all were able to make really cool things. I appreciated the freedom within the assignments to be creative, especially toward the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could have spent more time drawing the figure! ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class. "

        [
            "\u00a0yes  - it was as if I wasn't taking a course. It has a great schedule and the work, though hard, was interesting and fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes most definitely! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This was an amazing course. It was challenging, but it complemented the rest of my workload well since the type of work is so different. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is willing to learn a lot and perfect their skills on their own time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to other students, but only if they would be willing to spend a lot of time and energy on the homework assignments. Although the in-class instruction is highly valuable, a lot of learning also happens outside of class, which is something students wanting to take this class should consider. \r\n\r\nIf a student wanted to challenge themselves and build very robust skills in drawing, I think that they would benefit from taking this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a lot of time in your schedule I would definitely recommend it, finishing projects and just seeing how much I improved throughout the semester made me very happy I took the course, even if it was overwhelming at times. ",
            "\u00a0Not really ",
            "\u00a0No  I think that for anyone who has taken art class before, it is redundant and not much of a learning experience that challenged me or helped me grow in any way. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would highly recommend this course. Professor was amazing, learned so much, and was challenged in new ways throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is a great course and also very therapeutic. "
