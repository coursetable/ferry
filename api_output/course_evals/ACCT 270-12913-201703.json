            "\u00a0I had absolutely no knowledge of accounting or finance. I am happy that I understood how time is an important factor to define value. I understand how to analyze the performance of a company through its financial reports, how income and cash flows are different. And also I know now how diversification impacts the risk and return of a portfolio. Thank you, professor! ",

            "\u00a0As the name of the course suggests, you are exposed to the fundamentals of accounting. Course is clearly equipped towards complete novices (as it should be) and Professor Antle was so respectful of that and of the sometimes-steep learning curve of the material. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: definitely the professor! He is great! He explains very well and cares about our understanding. ",
            "\u00a0The class could be better taught. The professor expects that we know how to use excel so it can be hard. The class could be taught slower to better understand the material. Hard to learn the way the class is taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: made me wake up for an 8:45 class, increasing my personal resilience.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: poorly organized. The professor set a slow pace by repeating half of the previous class nearly every class. Ideally, you'd hope for homework that reinforces the concepts you learned in the previous class. Antle assigns homework that forces you to teach yourself the contents of the NEXT class. This is hard, because many accounting concepts cannot be deduced logically. You have to learn the conventions. Often, Antle will go over a homework and say \"there's no way you could have known that\". Then why did you make us do it?? What was the pedagogical goal here? ",
            "\u00a0I wish it wasn't so early so I could've gone to class more often. ",
            "\u00a0Very clear powerpoints, but the class is very early in the morning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized course material; professor very willing to help; good textbook\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n\r\nI'm not sure why class attendance is mandatory given that you have to complete homework on a topic before the class in which it is taught. If you are doing a good job on the homework -- which you should because they are not hard if you read the textbook -- you should not have to go to class. Most class time, honestly, was a waste of time. I learned a lot, but I mostly taught myself. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses at all. Rick really wanted you to succeed, and assigned the perfect amount of weekly assignments/problem sets to make sure people were getting enough practice. It is clearly material that you will fall out of touch with if you don't practice it enough. ",
            "\u00a0Starting from scratch, and taking us through the nitty gritty. We don't just know what the three financial statements are, and how they interact with each other -- we also know how to make them from scratch using nothing more than transaction information. ",
            "\u00a0The accounting portion was great, but we spent too much time at the beginning analyzing on present value discounting. I wish we spent more time on more advanced accounting concepts such as marketable securities and accounting of accounts receivable. I wish we had more practice analyzing actual financial statements of companies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are subject matter and weakenss is the length of the class. it should only be 50 minutes ",
            "\u00a0This course is very good at teaching the basics of accounting and finance. I felt that the course went too slowly and didn't teach as much as it could have. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone who wants to learn the basics of accounting and finance. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great class to learn accounting because accounting is an important concept to know how to do especially if you are pursuing a career in finance or consulting. ",
            "\u00a0Objectively speaking, this class has a couple of negatives. It takes place at the school of management at 8:45 in the morning. You have to complete a homework assignment every class. Sounds reasonable, right? Except that your homework on Monday directly uses the material you will learn on WEDNESDAY, and it's due right before he mentions the relevant concepts for the first time. You have no way of completing the assignment, and no way of knowing what you're supposed to know. You spend four hours on the homework and feel that you must be mentally challenged. This approach did not help me learn. Why not teach first and let us practice afterwards? You wouldn't make someone bang on the piano before teaching them how to play!\r\n\r\nHe makes a lot of concessions for people who just want this course on their transcript. For instance, if you complete the homework and the take-home final, you can skip the in-class final and get a B+. That's great, but I hoped to learn as much as I could instead of scraping by with a B+. He seems to make the course artificially difficult by forcing us to account for never-before-mentioned concepts and transactions. \r\n\r\nAlso, do not buy the book! I spent about $20 renting a book that we never had to open. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to learn accounting, you will. It's tough, but accounting is a puzzle so that's expected. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to know some basic accounting. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to learn the basics of accounting and I did. It is not a life-changing class, but if you read the textbook and keep up with the homework you'll learn how to read and write financial statements. I'm glad I took the course and I hope it will serve me well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the information provided in this class is useful, especially for students who want to go into finance or business. ",

            "\u00a0Take it for Professor Antle! 2 problem sets, weekly Canvas assignments (that you WILL receive thorough feedback on to improve your work), a take-home final and an optional sit-down final. The basics of accounting are something everyone should know, and you'll walk away understanding the 3 main financial statements (and some cool applications). ",
            "\u00a0If you want to understand t-accounts and want to be able to build financial statements then this is a good course for you ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, no matter what your level of familiarity with finance (or interest in finance). ",
