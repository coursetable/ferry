            "\u00a0I learned how to write about myself but also how to read more critically. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class a junior engineering major, and can honestly say this was the first class (in both high school and college) where I actually felt like my writing was improving. I also thought that reading contemporary, relatable texts (lots of articles from newspapers and magazines) meant that we gained better insights into interpreting modern writing. ",
            "\u00a0I vastly improved as a writer and reader of essays. My abilities both to clearly advance a logical public point and articulate ideas using creative writing also improved. ",
            "\u00a0How to write engaging essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a comprehensive overview to creative nonfiction writing. Felt the most important tool I came away with was the an ability to identify good writing techniques and model them in my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly developed my ability to read critically and write with a clear public point in mind ",
            "\u00a0- Learned new insights about the value of each sentence in an essay\r\n- Developed skills in analyzing techniques in Creative Non Fiction\r\n- Expanded my passion for creative writing ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to effectively present a thesis, how to discuss essays, and how to analyze different types of texts. Moreover, I learned new writing techniques and styles. ",
            "\u00a0From taking this course I was able to learn basic skills in forming detailed and coherent college essays based on personal experience and or opinions. We also dissected many different forms of short articles or stories that help us creatively when writing our own personal essays. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my non-fiction writing and learned helpful skills to use in my future pieces. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many of the tools and techniques used to write personal essays through reading and writing, and how to use the revision process and peer/teacher feedback to improve my written work "

            "\u00a0Really a wonderful class. Great readings, and fun, broad essay topics. In my section, deadlines were fair (read: spaced far apart and very flexible); daily homework consisted of reading a few articles and writing a short response. No complains. A must-take. ",
            "\u00a0Favorite class by far this semester! I think that the class started off great but got even better after the mid-semester review. Thank you Maggie for taking our considerations into account! ",
            "\u00a0Maggie led excellent discussions of the material, selected excellent essays, and provided outstanding feedback on rough drafts. My only suggestion for this course is to expand the amount of writing done throughout the semester. Five essays may be enough, but smaller assignments and exercises that allow us to practice techniques would be very helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: we read great essays for class and received clear feedback on our essays and on how to improve them. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the small seminar-style of the class was effective in facilitating engaging and interesting discussions. Additionally, I thought \"workshopping\"--where everyone reviews a rough draft from their peer--was extremely helpful in crafting strong essays. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nDiscussions\r\nPersonal exploration ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely interesting and informative. I learned how to apply the writing techniques that we learned in class to my own essays. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great because of the constant debate and discussions in class over the essays we read. i wish we would have dedicated more time to editing our own works, but that is just more of a personal preference. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the readings and in-class discussions, but I would have liked to talk more about mechanics and technique in class. I would also have liked to have more reading (either suggested or mandatory) to draw from. I think the class could have benefited from more structure to discussions as well. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take 120! It's not a ton of work, and you get a chance to really improve your writing. You read lots of short nonfiction (think New Yorker, Atlantic, etc) and get to write your own. While other intro English classes really emphasize a more academic style of writing and analysis, 120, I would argue, focuses on more real-world writing skills that can be applied to any major. If we had a freshman writing requirement, this should be it. You should treat it as such, and absolutely take it.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't be turned off by the course title. This is not \"The Modern Essay\" in the academic sense. Nearly every reading was a piece of journalism, satire, personal essay, etc... and always were a ton of fun. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course, and if you can, take it with Maggie! She's phenomenal and made the class so fun and relevant that it never seemed like a chore (or a bore). ",
            "\u00a0If you are looking to improve your writing skills, ENG 120 is an excellent opportunity to do so. The material is fun, engaging, and helpful to your growth as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0YES! ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to other students. Felt like it was a perfect blend of practicality and intellectual challenge. ",
            "\u00a0I would! You become very close to your classmates and professors. You learn how to write about yourself and your experiences in a powerful way ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course because I learned so much about writing and close reading. English has never really been my strength, so this course helped me improve my essays. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great class that will make you a better writer without confing you to one specific subject area. You read and write essays on a variety of topics and emerge a much better writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this is a great class to take if you enjoy personal writing/are looking to get your feet wet in writing at Yale "
