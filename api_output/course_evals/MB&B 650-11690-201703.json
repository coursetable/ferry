            "\u00a0In my first rotation I gained the ability to use optical tweezers and how to interpret the data obtained from this technique. In my second rotation I learned how to use NMR techniques for protein studies. I learned how a lab functions in both cases and how the interactions between the people in a lab work at a professional level. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a great deal of hands-on experience and have a better understanding of the direction that my graduate career will take. ",
            "\u00a0I developed foundational skills in several areas of biology, including working with nucleic acids, cloning, running gels, etc. I did not have these skills before rotations because my background was not in biology. I also learned the logic and limitations behind each of these techniques. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. The Xiong lab is a great lab to rotate it. All the lab members are very nice and inviting, and the research in interesting. I learned a lot from my rotation in this lab. "
