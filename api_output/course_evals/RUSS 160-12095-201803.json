            "\u00a0You improve Russian writing and oral skills by learning advanced grammar focusing on specific verbs and constructions. Some main these were time expressions, verbs of expectation, verbs of happening/occurrence, and aspect. ",
            "\u00a0I very much improved my speaking, listening, and reading skills in this course. I also came away from the course with a greater understanding of contemporary Russian culture and a better ability to conduct myself in modern Russian society. All in all, I attained a greater grasp on Russian language and culture. "

            "\u00a0The course has a LOT of written homework. That said, Irina gives you thorough feedback that helps you recognize areas that need improvement. This aspect of the course is wonderful and Irina is a fantastic instructor who really cares about the improvement of your Russian skills. The part of the course that could need improvement is classroom dynamics. Granted this depends on who is in your class and how motivated they are. Although we had a nice small size of 6 students (more than this would seem like too much), sometimes classroom discussion lagged and not everyone was motivated enough, which depends mostly on who is in your class. ",
            "\u00a0I really like how this course has a strong emphasis on both grammatical/lexical and cultural topics. There is a lot of freedom for students to ask questions and work through problems or issues they find particularly vexing. Another great strength of this course is the variety of assignments, from grammar worksheets to reading excerpts from contemporary fiction to watching films -- I felt like I was able to improve in all facets of the language. My only suggestion would be slightly shorter homework/grammar worksheets; I felt that the worksheets sometimes got tedious and repetitive. "

            "\u00a0No doubt about it if you want to improve your Russian. Irina is delightful, smart, kind, and an excellent instructor of the Russian language, who will help guide through the byzantine structure of the Russian language with relative ease. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is an excellent course for anyone keen on improving their Russian language skills. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good way to build Russian grammar and vocabulary. The only thing I would change is the fact that sometimes we receive homework assignments a bit late, i.e. the day before they are due. Personally, it makes it harder for me to synthesize the material and memorize all the vocabulary necessary to succeed in the course. "
