This semester, we focused on electromagnetism, so I learned multiple ways of working with electrical and magnetic fields. My class also learned the fundamental properties of electricity (i.e. voltage, current direction in relation to an electric field, charge carriers, etc.). Also similar to Physics 180 was that higher-level mathematics involving differential equations, large systems of linear equations, and higher-level calculus periodically came up, though it was never crucial that students actually perform those higher-level mathematical operations.

            "\u00a0Strengths: Fantastic teacher, interesting course material.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Homework is considerably harder than any of the exam material, which doesn't totally make sense to me. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  Knowledgeable lecturer, wide availability for assistance, study halls, peer tutors, etc.  Manageable pace for lectures, and detailed problems worked out in class.  Partial credit for midterm corrections a HUGE plus, and homework is due only 1x/week, and is graded generously.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  Emphasis on theoretical problems in both the homework and lecture, and applications could be taught much more effectively through one of the intro electrical engineering classes.  Understanding of inductance could be more condensed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lots of office hours and peer tutor hours\r\nWeaknesses: The pace of the course is fast, which makes it difficult to completely follow all of the complex topics being presented. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well-structured and well-paced, and there are plenty of resources for getting help when you're stuck. Prof. Steinacker is the best professor I've ever had and really was the best thing about this course. I am not a physics student by any means, so this was the best I could have hoped for (though even Prof. Steinacker couldn't make me love physics). ",
            "\u00a0the strengths is the instructor who is willing to help during office hours and answer questions after class. The weakness lies in the way the class is structured with the psets being so difficult they require cooperation in order to finish. The lectures too were dry and long making it hard to stay focused for the whole class ",
            "\u00a0Shorter psets would be nice, they were unnecessarily long. ",
            "\u00a0The PSETs are too difficult for the material we are learning. It is hard to conceptualize the major ideas of the course when we aren't learned the basics. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by having a range of types of problems on the pset, so have easier questions in the beginning and work up to the hard questions so students can learn how to do the problems in small amounts instead of having all hard problems on the pset. Also, in class should be much more examples of problems and less time spent teaching the concepts so intensely. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the psets and the online notes. I went to class every day, but I generally struggle to pay attention in class and it was really nice to have narrative notes to go through that helped me process what I didn't understand in class. The weaknesses are that this course is a TON of work, and that the test questions are sometimes tricky. I felt that no matter how much I studied and how thoroughly I understood every pset/review problem we'd been given, I still sometimes just could not understand the problems and for this reason at times it felt like it was testing innate capacity instead of learning ability. Still, it got better towards the end and the tests became less tricky and more complex applications of things we'd learned. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is Steinacker, she cares so much and really wants people to fall in love with physics. The problem though is that the classes are absolutely massive so it is hard for people to actually get engaged. Also her notes aren't the best organized in the world, but neither are mine... The biggest weakness is that people will just go to study halls and get the answers to the homework without actually understanding how to actually solve the problems. ",
            "\u00a0The class is excellent. Although very challenging, there are many resources available for students to aid the learning process. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class, but the psets were so long that I at times was less engaged with the material as they took too long to do. I feel I could have gained the same amount of knowledge with less homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the instructor, the grades. Once again, professor Steinacker has outdone herself. She continues to be one of the best professors I have ever had. She is so clear and detailed in her lectures and notes it's almost impossible not to learn anything. She also has gone out of her way to provide examples, notes, review sessions, etc. The grading is the same as 180 (aka VERY FAIR; 35% HW, 10% class participation, 15% each 2 midterms, 25% final) with the same exam corrections and curve!! \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: workload. Be prepared to die. The psets are even longer and more challenging than 180 (I know, trust me they get longer and harder even if it feels like that's not possible) and the amount of time you need to devote this class to not fail is significant. ",
            "\u00a0The content of this course can be interesting, but the workload is extremely high. Professor Steinacker is incredible, and the number of office hours and study halls every week is extremely helpful for completing the work. That being said, the concepts can be complex and require reflection, and the work takes up a lot of time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great professor who really cares about her students! The lectures are always clear, and office hours are a huge help.\r\nWeaknesses: After the first exam, she started making all the homework problems required, which I thought was somewhat unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0the professor is quite bad at lecturing, though she is a nice person. Honestly, not sure if anything could make this course better. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible (and incredibly stressful!) introduction to physics. The material is harder than in 181, and less relevant for students who aren't interested in engineering. Professor Steinacker does her best to make the class relevant for everyone, but its definitely a physics course that focuses on classical physics which isn't that interesting and is math heavy. Class is well taught and though the homework assignments are very time consuming, they do help you learn. I would say a weakness of the class is that the homework are a little unreasonable. This last semester, our homework would be 10 questions long but only 5 would be graded (and we weren't told which 5). This was a little ridiculous to me, and not only stressed students out immensely, but really lowered out quality of work. ",
            "\u00a0The course is structured so that you can get a lot of help outside of lecture to do the psets. However, I think lecture could be improved to be more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well facilitated to encourage student growth and learning. However, students are at a disadvantage if they do not have friends in the class. The professor is one of the best professors at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The class is very good because it pushes you to do really difficult problems but the grades were fair with test corrections and help at office hours. The class doesn't really have too many weaknesses, it is really well structured by Steinacker and you learn so much. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: great structure, good introduction to physics. \r\n\r\nWeakness: a lot of topics to cover, leaving little time to go over each. ",
            "\u00a0I feel the structure of this class could be much more effective. A flipped classroom, where we are provided with lecture notes and then spend class time discussing and asking questions, would probably be better, as I got little out of lecture and was often completely lost. This could also be remedied by making this class a three-times-a-week course where the classes are only 50 minutes, so we can learn in more manageable packets. The time required to be spent at office hours is also kind of absurd - 8-10 hours a week outside of class time. This was an incredibly taxing course, and could be more more manageable and interesting (as the material is sometimes exciting) if it were presented in a way that allow student to be ahead of the material, rather than always falling behind. It also seems geared toward students with strong physics/math backgrounds, which creates a group of people who are achieving great success and alienates those without the experience, leaving them to do endless work for a mediocre grade because the course, its exams, and its teaching structure isn't designed for them. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is the pace of the material and the clarity with which it is taught.\r\n\r\nThe major weakness of this course is the amount of work. The length and difficulty of problem sets can be overwhelming, and detracts from time needed to study for other courses.\r\n\r\nI also was very frustrated at the amount of time it took for homework to be graded (>1 month in one case), and I often thought the grading was erratic and non-standard. Sometimes I would get 1 point off for getting a wrong answer, sometimes I would get 4 points off for having the wrong units. The feedback provided by the TAs through comments on canvas were also not very descriptive or helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is great. Her lectures are clear and organized. The notes on Canvas are also a great resource. She also really tries to make sure no one falls to for behind. \r\n\r\nThe only two suggestions I have ate to have more sample problems/practice tests available AND to make the TAs do more. They were not that helpful and their grading was often unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Great instructor who is willing to dedicate 10+ hours every week just in office hours, and great group of peer tutors. I think the homeworks tend to be ones that you cannot do unless you go to office hours. There is a need to check every answer on the homework at an office hour or peer tutoring session in order to get full credit for homework assignments - which also helps learn how to solve them in the process. However, some problems go beyond the concepts discussed in class, and are difficult to solve without going to office hours. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths are that the course is organized logically, and the pacing of topics is reasonable. The problem sets are created very thoughtfully with a lot of attention to detail, so that committing to the work involved in each homework assignment really does pay off in understanding the material you are responsible for. Professor Steinacker does her best to supplement the sometimes-tedium of lecture with interesting demonstrations, videos, or connections to the outside world, and make the material more relevant/accessible to people less familiar with electricity and magnetism. It could be improved by more frequent examples in lecture, because while a lot of class time is spent on derivations, the applications of those concepts are not clear in lecture, so they are less easily absorbed at the time of lecture. Additionally, the first midterm exam covered proportionally so much less material than the second midterm that it seemed like a non-intuitive way of measuring students' abilities consistently. Another point that might be improved is availability of TFs, as they often were not present or eager to help in study hall. The grading of homework assignments often took a bit too long to be helpful, and sometimes the feedback was sparse so I was left guessing what caused me to lose points. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Online notes.\r\nWeaknesses: She can not teach at all.  Makes PSETs way too hard for no reason and doesn't cover hardly any of the material necessary to do them. They are a complete waste of time and do not facilitate learning. Her lectures are not intuitive and she doesn't know how to explain things to the students. ",
            "\u00a0I believe that my suggestions from Physics 180 still stand, so I will paste them in here.\r\n\r\nThis course can teach students (those who have the time to REALLY dig into it) quite a\r\nLOT. And as time consuming as the problem-sets are, I believe that they teach valuable\r\napproaches to general problem solving. I would assert that the problem sets are also good for\r\ndeveloping skills around teamwork, as it doesn't seem to be often that they're solved, totally\r\ncorrectly, by a single individual who's working alone. However, it also seems to me that\r\nstudents can neglect to learn how to actually study physics (building understandings of\r\nconcepts, learning how to derive & apply formulas, etc.) & simply focus on turning in P-sets.\r\nCopying them IS totally possible, and, sadly, does happen. Of course, copying P-sets is also\r\nreflected in exam performance. My only definite complaint would be that more accurate\r\npractice tests and finals should be available, as the practice final that was provided was far\r\nmore difficult than the actual final. Also, I know that this would be difficult to provide for a\r\nlecture of this size, but a larger emphasis on solving physics problems in general (i.e. more\r\nfeedback on the format & reasoning students provide to back up their answers) would be nice.\r\nTeaching HOW to do physics, and not just providing knowledge of kinematics, dynamics, etc.,\r\nis, I believe, important. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is one of the strengths of this course, and also the amount of help that is available. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are difficult, Dr. Steinecker is a smart woman, but I wish she would take into consideration the amount of time it takes to complete the psets. Not everyone can make time to go to her office hours, and without going to office hours, finishing the psets seems impossible. ",
            "\u00a0This was a great course, but some of the lectures and homework assignments were too dense and hard to keep up with. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course! It was extremely well taught and the material was interesting. It was definitely a challenging course and the large lecture sizes made it slightly more difficult to stay focused and on top of the material. However, weekly psets and daily office hours really helped me station top of the material, learn it well, and succeed in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot think of any weakness of this course off the top of my head.  What you put in is what you get out, which is exactly how a class should be. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great professor who really cares about the course!\r\nWeaknesses: The homework load became a little excessive, especially after the first exam. ",
            "\u00a0I think the homework should be shorter or all the problems should be graded because a lot of the times they were repeated and similar. ",
            "\u00a0The psets and time expectation were honestly grueling and unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, a super strong course. The only area for improvement I can think of is making the lectures a little simpler. That is, focus on some of the easier stuff and then get into the more complex material. I thought almost everything else was great. As a final (minor recommendation), a couple of the PSets were too long, but most of them were a solid, feasible length. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly problem sets can be a grind, and I felt as though if students went to office hours they were given the answers. I was not able to go to office hours or study hall because of my schedule and always felt behind from these students. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Steinacker does pretty much everything perfectly. The material is just difficult for many people who are required to take it, and who may also be bogged down by other challenging required courses. I just wish all pset problems were graded like last year, since they dont become as good learning tools and rather mainly means of getting graded weekly when only five are looked at by graders. ",
            "\u00a0amazing amazing class! Professor Steinacker makes this class the best version possible ",
            "\u00a0PSETS are too hard. ",
            "\u00a0Honestley this was a beautiful class with an amazing professor and I wish I were more eloquent to express how great she was. The TAs were just bad at both grading and explaining. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course all stem from Professor Steinacker. The material isn't necessarily anything thrilling, unless you really love physics. Still, she managed to make it interesting and engaging. Her notes were detailed, her psets difficult but helpful, and her exams were fair. The office hours were also extremely helpful and allowed me to make the most of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a challenging course, with a very high workload. But, the course is worth it because as long as you put the time in, it is very rewarding. The Psets can take 10 hours a week, so maybe shorter psets would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the clear organization of the course material, the professor (Prof. Steinacker is amazing), and the consistent office hours and study hall. A weakness of this course is that some topics are not covered in very much depth, but this is an introductory physics course so the level of detail is to be expected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent professor, challenging but useful problem sets, fair exams, abundant resources for help\r\nImprovements: problems sets were quite long and as a result many students end up rushing through without the time to fully understand and work out each problem carefully ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that the curriculum is well-organized. The main weakness is the homework. The homework is excessively long, and much more difficult than any examples presented in the lectures, to the point that it is at times impossible to do the work on our own without copying solutions from a study hall. If the homework was shorter/easier (or at least all solvable from concepts from the lectures), students would be able to do it on their own and not resort to copying every week. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a very difficult course, and it is very time consuming. While I think it is great that students are rewarded for putting a lot of time into the PSETs by awarding them a high percentage of the final grade, I think the PSETs themselves are too long. I believe students would be more inclined to truly understand the problems themselves if they were given 6 or 7 problems a week as opposed to 9 or 10. As well, the tests were a bit difficult compared to the learned concepts. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course is that it has amazing resources for students who need it. Professor Adriane is probably the professor who invests the most time in her students, with (almost) unlimited office hours. The class also has study hall most days of the week which are SUPER helpful for doing the psets. Students get the chance to correct their midterms for the possibility of gaining up to 50% of their lost marks. Do not get me wrong, the content of this class is VERY challenging and you definitely need to put time to do the psets and study really well for the midterms. But Professor Adriane makes sure to provide every resource that we might need to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0This course requires vast improvement. I can safely say that, because of this course specifically, I will no longer be taking Physics classes at Yale. While Adriane was a somewhat entertaining lecturer, she provided very little practical assistance in solving the difficult problems she gave on PSETs. Classes were devoted to deriving equations, but hardly any time was given to actually applying those equations to physical situations (which is obviously the entire point of physics). The PSETs subsequently were incredibly difficult and stressful, because Adriane had given us zero skills with which to solve these problems. The PSETs were hardly ever all graded before we were tested on the concepts in those PSETs, which meant there was no way to know what we didn't know prior to a test.\r\n\r\nAll around, this class was a massive disappointment. I highly recommend that the Physics department takes a close and careful look at this class, or risk losing countless more students like me who are actively being turned off of Physics at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very intense and requires a lot from students, but the professor and TAs put just the same amount of effort in. Sometimes, the lectures are a little disorganized, but the general theme is always clear and applicable to the PSets. ",

            "\u00a0The main strength of this course was its excellent organization. Professor Steinacker organized all of the information in a way that made sense and allowed concepts to clearly build off of one another throughout the semester. The main weakness was the length of Professor Steinacker's problem sets -- although they were very helpful, sometimes the length of the problem set was detrimental to my understanding of the material because I had to rush through the questions in order to finish on time. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers so much information, which is inevitable but makes it hard to keep up. Additionally, the first test covered only a few topics despite us having covered a lot in class, which made the second test overwhelming with the amount we needed to know. However, all of the help sessions were very useful (office hours, reviews, study hall, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Very fair grading, and very generous with the grade corrections we can do! The professor is a HUGE strength. She is so thorough and knowledgeable of the material and I am so honored to have had Steinacker this year. \r\n\r\n\r\nWeakness: I felt that a lot of students came into this class having taken AP Physics C and because of that I felt at a disadvantage. The problem sets took me an incredible amount of time. It is hard to ask questions in lecture given the large size, but there is definitely time to ask during office hours. ",
            "\u00a0This course highly favors engineering students and those who have taken physics in the past. Lecture was often very hard to stay concentrated and involved in due to the speed of the lecture and difficulty of problems that are simply rushed through. The exams were also very difficult and similar to pset problems, which were for the most impossible to do without help from the professor or TFs. ",

She is the most generous and brilliant professor who will teach you anything and be in office hours for essentially forever to help you. The only way this course could be improved would be with a tad more leniency toward the number of psets/maybe making them a tad more forgiving to students who aren't in physical sciences. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured and the availability of all course materials made it very conducive to learning. In addition, the frequency and length of office hours and study halls made the problem sets manageable for any student in the course. Overall, the course was very strong and presented many opportunities for students to ask for help. "

As far as the content, I thought 181 was more interesting but its also definitely much harder. It harder mathematically, conceptually, and work wise. The psets are even longer and harder this semester (you have to do all 10 problems some weeks...) and there were multiple instances I wrote 20+ pages for a single pset. I took this as a 5th credit with 4 other hard credits and while I'm still alive to write this review, it certainly was incredibly challenging. Consider only taking this as a 4th credit as max. ",
