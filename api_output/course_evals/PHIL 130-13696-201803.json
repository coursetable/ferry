            "\u00a0I gathered new understandings on the meaning of education and the ideas many thinkers have had about it. However, we didn't go about this learning classic arguments for systems of education, but rather read many readings that spoke of oppression, ideal view of society, etc that invoked education. ",
            "\u00a0This class covers a pretty solid overview of possible reasons for education and the pros and cons of different educational systems and ideals. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey course of how education has been philosophized differently throughout time and the implications of political theory and philosophy on education, from ancient Greece all the way to black feminist writers of the late 20th century. You will walk away from this class not just understanding different philosophies of education, but of government and of life. A very enriching course. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed this class and the material that we covered. I came away with many new insights into the role of education in the formation of a government and society, as well as new perspectives that I never would have expected. ",
            "\u00a0Philosophy of Education has changed my perspective on education and my life goals in various ways. Each of the works studied throughout the course has made me reconsider the ethics and purpose behind the way I have been educated in the past. This has influenced me to become more critical of not just what Im learning in my courses but also the ways that course material are presented. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about how different education systems are linked to political philosophies and in order to figure out the best education, one must figure out the end that is desired. It was an incredibly interesting course topic! ",
            "\u00a0I gained insight into how educational philosophy and democracy are related ",
            "\u00a0I learned to balance a lot of readings through this class. There was a lot of material to get through for this class, and it was overwhelming at first. Later on, though, I got the hang of it! ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about education systems, how they shape people and society, democratic values, democratic education, epistemic injustice, and many more topics. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the course will only improve as it gets taught more (this was its first semester). Also led to critical thinking, and invoked political though often. Professor Stanley, at times, quite interesting and hearing him ramble off about the fascism of American history or Trump (which he does often) does actually build your understanding of some of the fascist history of the country. The class was flexible, and the other people in the class made it more enjoyable\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\nI felt that Professor Stanley picked favorites in the class, especially students who has taken his pervious classes. This was quite annoying considering he seems to openly value their opinions and arguments more than others. \r\n\r\nThe class had a very high reading load but a lose syllabus so I began counting on his emails to know what to read--issue being that he sent these out the night before class. 3 essays and 2 exams for this class would have been excessive but he canceled an essay and the midterm due to getting behind in the class--we needed more time to discuss readings. Expect the syllabus to be more of a guide instead of listing hard due dates ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus of this course was brilliantly put together, including both seminal/canon writers & thinkers as well as prominent figures belonging to historically marginalized groups (who have been largely excluded from being legitimated in fields like philosophy and political theory in other courses at Yale). Prof. Stanley is a passionate speaker and an exceedingly knowledgeable professor, who genuinely wants to engage students and their ideas in the classroom and collectively reach meaning of readings each week. Well constructed, well taught  a fantastic course. Prof. Stanley often gets a bad rap for his \"disorganization,\" but in this course it actually fit together really well with the flexible syllabus and served to strengthen that mutual construction of course material between the students and the professor. ",
            "\u00a0Great discussion every day in class. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of this course was its emphasis on older philosophical material such as Plato and Rousseau. I thought it could have been improved by having more articles or materials connecting the philosophy we were reading to current debates about education. ",
            "\u00a0The readings gave us a diverse perspective on different philosophies of education. ",
            "\u00a0I liked this course but I wish it were smaller and met once a week for a longer period of time. It was held in a seminar room but was a little too big to be a seminar and met as often as a long lecture. I think class discussions would've been more robust and the level of discussion higher if the course were a seminar. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are also the weaknesses in some way. The course is somewhat disorganized, as the syllabus changes frequently enough that it could become a nuisance, but at the same time, this gave us, the students, the agency to choose what to study as a class, which I appreciated very much. ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing because we even discussed how to improve the course, and Professor Stanley changed the syllabus according to what materials we, as students, were interested in. I dont think there is much that can be improved! ",
            "\u00a0This class is really engaging and interesting, and the emphasis on discussion is definitely a strength. One weakness is that it's a little disorganized and it's sometimes not clear what to read for the following class, but that did not take away from my overall enjoyment of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course adapted to what the students wanted to learn about, not just what the professor decided. It would have been nice to spend more time on some of the long readings to understand them in depth. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of my top three classes I've ever taken at Yale. It was incredible, and had only one philosophy major in it. I learned so much every class, and the readings were a lot but interesting enough that I wanted to do them - and, when I didn't understand them, all had helpful resources about them online. The one complaint I would lodge is that there was a bit of a divide in the class between those who had taken a) a philosophy class before or b) any class with Professor Stanley before. Sometimes people drew on knowledge of the philosophers we talked about that wasn't in the readings and no one fully explained it to others in the class, or just made references to other people in the class as being the top of the class, and it wasn't a big thing but it made participation more daunting and difficult than I think it needed to be. That being said, class was always fun because it was full of banter and intelligent comments and real-world applications and with ten more complaints it would still be in my top 3 classes. I filled a huge notebook with information and literally pulled it out multiple times in conversations with friends because I wanted to reference something someone had said in class, and I am keeping it forever. I would recommend this course irregardless of what grade you could get, because you'll walk away with a ton of knowledge and new perspectives on education and the US and if you get a bad grade too hey that's what makes you truly free... #philosophyofeducation ",
            "\u00a0There were many strengths of this course - we covered a lot about not only education in Western philosophy, but also how education tied into other areas of life (a.k.a. all of them). The only shortcoming was that maybe we moved a little fast in some areas. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Jason Stanley\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the readings and discussions in this course. A little more clarity as for expectations on the first paper could have been helpful, but overall no complaints. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Highly depends. This class is more like a political philosophy class that tries to connect to education. If you are interested in political theory, abstract ideas about what education should mean, are okay with having an ever-changing syllabus then consider taking this class. I hated this class for about 3-4 weeks before it finally grew on me. It was a charm to it, even if the beginning of the class is tough to endure. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in the history and motives behind certain educational philosophies.  It's very interesting to look at educational philosophy and see the ways in which it has interacted with the sociopolitical movements in the United States.  The only thing is Professor Stanley is a bit scatterbrained so if you're not into having a professor who sometimes goes on tangents about DuBois, shares a lot of anecdotes about his 7 year old son, and says \"oy vey\" a lot, you should not take this course!  But he is a wonderful professor and is very engaging and I would recommend at least shopping the course to get to meet Professor Stanley and see what a thoughtful professor he is. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend. Prof. Stanley is a joy and makes talking about the course material engaging and fun, but still intellectually stimulating and rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is very interested in political philosophy and how that applies to education, but not to someone who wants to look at tangible issues in today's education system (or who is looking for concrete solutions). ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This was my favorite class this semester because of the way that it influenced my personal philosophies. The material and class discussions challenged me to rethink the ways my academic interests contribute to society, and this will change my tragectory in college and life completely. Also, the diversity in philosophers that we studied (Rousseau, Plato, Patricia Hill Collins, DuBois, Paolo Friere) was refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY! A must take class at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class. I learned a lot and I enjoyed the teaching style and the readings. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend. I took it as my first ever philosophy course and Professor Stanley says it's not like the other philosophy courses in the major. He is a great professor and I learned a ton. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Philosophy of education is a wonderful class to take to learn more about a very important topic in any given society. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course covers many philosophical topics which I think are interesting and vital to think about. Also, discussions were really interesting and fun. "
