            "\u00a0I learned about how people think about AI. ",

            "\u00a0I learned about the arguments and counterarguments about artificial intelligence. I learned how to write concisely. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about Philosophy of Mind and how to write in an aggressively efficient manner. ",
            "\u00a0I am much more intellectually developed with a focus on AI, technological progress, and the mind. This class stretched my mind and made me look at AI and the mind from many different directions. My writing skills are also much more improved and is much more concise. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about the origins of artificial intelligence and whether or not it is possible to build a mind out of software ",

            "\u00a0This course is an in-depth response to the question \"is it possible to build a conscious mind out of software\", and it is a broad enough question to take a whole semester to (attempt to) answer it. I also gained the ability to write concisely, due to Professor Gelernter's teaching and grading style. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about philosophy of mind, the discussion behind artificia intelligence, and a lot of key philosophers in the movements. "

            "\u00a0Gelernter is passionate about these ideas, and if you want to learn more about his idea of machine intelligence, take it. It is a bit biased however. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Gelernter is articulate and a pleasure to learn from. \r\nWeakness: Didn't cover all the material we were supposed to cover and didn't always feel engaged in a conversation. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely interesting, and its readings and discussions are extremely stimulating. The essay feedback is extremely helpful. The essays are also short, which is very nice, but their brevity also make each word count, teaching me an important lesson in writing concisely. The class discussions were interesting but more or less lacked student participation. Professor Gelernter is very interesting, but the discussions were not really discussions, which seemed to disappoint both the professor and the students. We didn't break the ice early in the semester and never ended up breaking it. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the readings were pretty interesting, the 150 word assignments were good, and I improved my writing\r\nWeaknesses were the class could sometimes get a little boring despite the very interesting content ",
            "\u00a0More structured syllabus/plan ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course was that the material was organized very well--the readings were all incredibly interesting selections, and revealed a different insight into machine intelligence. The course could be improved by having more assignments, and better being able to gauge how well a student was doing in the class at a certain time. ",

            "\u00a0It's little work, but it's also not super rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class if you need a writing credit or don't know anything about artificial intelligence. Professor Gelernter is a very intelligent professor that knows what he is talking about and is a leading figure in the computer science world. The grading system is challenging, but certainly not as difficult as some of the reviews make it out to be, you just need to be concise and clear and you can get a decent grade. Gelernter gets a bad rap from some students, but I think he is a refreshingly honest person that isn't afraid to defend his ideas. However, it was a bit annoying when he would assume \"a priori\" that students knew about an intellectual or cultural figure and then be disappointed when nobody did. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this class if you need a writing credit and want some interesting insight into why we will never achieve artificial intelligence. Professor Gelernter is an engaging lecturer and is good at articulating his ideas. The assignments are far from a burden on your schedule. If you're not a flowery writer, then it will be easier to do well in the class. Gelernter's feedback feels kind of arbitrary, and I was disappointed with my grades a few times, but he wasn't too harsh. Just take notes on the common errors worksheet he hands back and take it into account when writing the next paper. Read and re-read your papers to take out unnecessary words. ",
            "\u00a0Gelernter is unlike other professors and it will take time to understand the way he works and what he expects. The writing assignments are short, though they demand care. I genuinely felt like my writing improved and found the subject matter to be very complex and interesting, though not difficult to comprehend. Grading can be unpredictable, though. ",
            "\u00a0Very interesting and not a lot of work.  Just have to pay good attention. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class. The class has very little work and is extremely rewarding. The work it does have counts and taught me valuable lessons about my writing. The true treasure of this class is being taught an extremely interesting topic with stimulating readings and an over-qualified professor. This class is a hidden gem. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it because I improved my writing and it is a good writing credit for someone who does not like writing long essays ",
            "\u00a0For all of the CS majors who are looking for an easy writing credit, take this class.  The actual workload is very smallwe wrote 600 total words before the final paper.  However, the assignments are graded so harshly, so be careful if you're looking to do zero work and get by with an A.  You actually need to spend a few hours writing these 150 word paragraphs because they are graded on a word by word basis.  Go over them extensively, and you should do okay in this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, challenge perceptions of consciousness ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in machine intelligence, and would be interested in taking a whole semester to delve into the philosophical implications of machine intelligence, then the course is for you. ",
