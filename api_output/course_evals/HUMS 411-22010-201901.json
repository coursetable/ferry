            "\u00a0I developed a breadth of knowledge of different religions and philosophical thoughts. I learned to engage critically and respectfully with ways of thinking that were different from my own. ",
            "\u00a0Where do I even begin? I think this class is set up for success because it's designed to get students thinking about life's biggest questions: what does it mean for life to feel good? To be led well? To go well? What is a life worth living? The course has really delivered on its promise to challenge the way we approach these questions. I spent a lot of time having discussions with my peers about these questions, and in the process, I learned how truly important it is to ask these questions and how high the stakes are for asking them. How we approach these questions orients our lives and it affects so many of the choices that we make, from what we eat to what career we decide to pursue or how we choose to spend our time and how we treat other people. I renewed my appreciation for humanity; it felt like such a privilege to get to hear people's visions of a life worth living and know that there's an entire life that has brought them to that vision, and there is the rest of their life that will change or grow that vision. \r\n\r\nI brought a lot of the course questions to my own life as well. It really brought a lot more awareness and appreciation for the journey that I've been on, both as a person and as Yale student. I've always been pretty open to being wrong, and more often than not, I'm very happy to yield my time on the floor out of fear that I am indeed just always wrong. This course helped me articulate the things that are really important to me, which helped me become comfortable fighting for what I believe in with conviction and respect to others. ",
            "\u00a0Working knowledge of many different value systems (both secular and religious). Coming out of this class I am much more capable of articulating my own vision of what has value in life as well as engage in similiar discussions with others. ",
            "\u00a0-learned a lot about major traditions and philosophies (both in terms of the basics of the tradition, as well as applications of the tradition to modern life) ",
            "\u00a0This class was amazing. It helped me learn more about myself and the things I believe in and helped me understand my classmates better too. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the basics of some of the major world religions and life philosophies. I also practiced the skills of charitable listening and engaging in respectful, truth-seeking dialogue with my classmates. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about different traditions and religions that I didn't know anything about before the class. ",
            "\u00a0I re-evaluated a lot of my values and the coherence of them throughout this course. By reading different traditions we also learned to examine ourselves ",
            "\u00a0How to think about life differently. This course made me actually learn how to begin answering the big questions. When I look back at Yale, this class will be what I think of first in terms of my academic experience. Its made me start to journal, start to create new practices that guide my life, how to redefine my decisions, actions, relationships and many other things around what I value most, and even shed light of what things I value!! I truly believe that you become a better, more purposeful person by taking this class, and that your life will be made more meaningful just by diving deep into Life Worth Living. "

            "\u00a0The strengths were speakers that came in on every third day of the week. So cool to see people practice and share their life stories! The Retreat was also wonderful. A weakness was the AMOUNT of reading we had that we could not even discuss in class. It made printing and engaging intentionally very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of this course is that there aren't enough sections to accommodate the insane number of people trying to take this class. This is a hot take: I really think this course should be required for all seniors. On a more serious note, I do feel strongly about opening up more sections of this class. It is truly a gift to get to experience this, and I would love for more students to experience that.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, truly one of the best classes I've ever taken. It's an incredible educational and personal experience. The reading selections are amazing. The teaching team is incredible. The people they select to be in the sections are lovely. I really cannot say enough good things about this course. ",
            "\u00a0The reverse lecture format and the retreat were both very effective. I also very much appreciated how much though went  into the selection of each of the readings. My biggest qualm is that any has to receive a grade for this class at all. Everyone at Yale should be able to take this class, but its kind of ridiculous to assign a letter grade to anyones work. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think the class is a great way to learn about various traditions/philosophies, because I think the seminars are a guided introduction to traditions that might feel too large/overwhelming to learn about otherwise. Obviously we only skim the surface of the topics, but I think the syllabus also does its best to offer a little bit more than mere \"basics of Buddhism, etc.\" The class is structured where the first seminar (generally) is a discussion of primary texts (i.e. the John Stuart Mill for utilitarianism), while the second seminar is a discussion of an application of the tradition (i.e. effective altruism). \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: \r\n-Grading felt very arbitrary and poorly designed. The three papers seem straightforward (what is a life worth living, according to Yale, your peers, and you). However, as I discovered too late, these papers are rigidly graded to an arbitrary rubric that is not conducive to good writing. For each paper, we were given a list of guiding questions. However, I was graded as if I had to answer every guiding question, and was docked if I didn't answer each guiding question. In my mind, that makes no sense, because guiding questions are meant to guide discussion, not be the blueprint of every paper. Furthermore, given the word limit for the papers, answering each guiding question means giving shallow answers to each question, which encourages papers that cover a lot of different topics with very little depth. This is my own opinion, but I think a paper that answers a single guiding question in great depth is a much more insightful paper than a paper that gives a sentence of thought to each guiding question. \r\n-On top of two 75 minute seminars, there are weekly 50 minute lectures. I don't really mind the extra time commitment, but perhaps the LWL team can consider moving the Thursday afternoon time slot to a time with less classes, since Thursday afternoon interfered with other classes I was hoping to take. Moreover, sometimes the weekly lectures didn't feel that meaningful, because speakers are just vaguely asked what their vision of a life worth living is, which doesn't really invite a lot of specific exploration into the cultures that they are representing. Again, like the papers, generality is privileged over specificity, which I think makes the lectures less insightful than they could be. \r\n-The readings were enormous, which I'm not sure is necessary. Every week was hundreds of pages of readings that we were asked to print out, since there was a strict no technology policy. I wish the syllabus had made an allowance for tablets (which many people in my class ended up using) because printing a lot of pages of readings is expensive and I know that at least for myself, doing readings on a tablet is actually better for my learning style. As always with constructing a syllabus, I know there is a difficult balance to strike between giving enough readings to facilitate comprehension/discussion and not giving too many to be overwhelming. However, I found myself skimming the primary texts most weeks and found the secondary texts to be much more insightful. I know there is value to reading primary texts, but it is difficult to read fifty pages of excerpted passages from the Koran. The readings from the Christianity week were probably the easiest to read because they were divided very digestibly, like, \"here is a life led well according to Christianity\" and then a listing of three verses from the Bible. I imagine it would be a lot of work, but it could help people read more carefully if the primary texts for other traditions were subdivided similarly. \r\n-I wish we could have changed certain weeks. I know there are too many traditions to cover in one class, but I do wish we learned about more non-Abrahamic religions than just Buddhism. There are also a lot of cultures around the world that have their own social and philosophical traditions that could be worth learning about. ",
            "\u00a0I honestly loved every part of this course. It was great. It handled cultures in a respectful manner, I only wished we could learn about more! ",
            "\u00a0The retreat was an ESSENTIAL part of my experience of this class! So intense but resulted in such a level of group bonding with my class that truly made the class an experience of a higher level. Love the discussions. Sometimes wished I knew more about the basics of a faith before trying to discuss it, especially on our first day of section, because with faiths I wasn't familiar with, it was very difficult to have an educated discussion when I felt I didn't even know the basics. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions each week were amazing and the students that make up the class make things very interesting. For me, the class was very eye opening and perspective changing. ",
            "\u00a0We only have one week for each tradition which sometimes feels like a bit too short, but I think the goal is to learn the skills to examine different vision rather than fully understand the visions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are endless. Incredible instruction, great classmates, fantastic reading material. Perhaps the only weakness is that we didn't have people in the class who could personal represent many of the traditions we read about. "

            "\u00a0Yes! I great way to open your perspective to different ways of being and thinking. ",
            "\u00a0Yes yes yes yes yes! Do not leave Yale without taking this class!\r\n\r\nI've loved my experience at Yale, as imperfect as it was, and taking this class the spring of my senior year was really just the cherry on top. I remember thinking that this is what a liberal arts education is all about and I am so lucky to be at this place, where ruminating about the meaning of my life is a worthy intellectual exercise. This class really helped me reflect on how much I've grown as a person during my time here, and it reminded me that there's always room to grow. I don't think this class changed my mind or the course of my life (though it definitely has the potential to do that for other people), but it's been so rewarding getting to hear about other people's lives and thoughts and getting to share my own. The community built in this class is truly so precious, and I love that we can all disagree so respectfully and still come out with an appreciation for everyone's humanity. (Honestly, I think more of that is needed in this world, so I felt very lucky to have gotten to experience that.)\r\n\r\nI have never been more excited about a 9 AM Monday class during the entirety of my Yale career. This class kept me awake multiple nights because the class demands a lot of introspection and reflection and a willingness to grapple with the fact that we might never discover the true meaning of our lives. At the same time, this class also reminded me of a lot of things that I often forget in the inertia of things that incessantly demand my time and attention: We have the power to choose how to orient our lives, whether it's seeking personal fulfillment, dedicating our lives to serving others, or whatever else. Everyone is just trying to find what makes their life worth living, and it's worth remembering that we should be kind to each other, if only because we're all just a little bit lost in our own ways. And we should consider ourselves lucky that we get to make these choices at all. I hope that taking this class is one of the choices you make. This experience will stay with me for a very long time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I can recommend this class to virtually anyone. Its not an earth shattering experience. But it will give you the opportunity to engage with questions and materials, which we rarely have the opportunity to discuss in structured settings here at Yale. \r\n\r\nWorth it for both for people who spend all day thinking about these questions and also those who dont think about them at all. I personally was someone who fell into the first category. I appreciated the opportunity to throw various ideas out into the open on a regular basis, which I would normally only think about on my own or with one or two close friends. ",
            "\u00a0I think this class was hyped up a lot, but it was in actuality not a very good fit for me, which I didn't realize until a lot later. At the very least, I wish I had taken the class credit/d because of the arbitrary grading. \r\n\r\nI think a lot of people like LWL and give the course glowing recommendations, because they spend most of their time at Yale taking classes that they don't like or they are STEM students that don't have readings that make them think about the world at large (not trying to be reductionist here, but this is the sort of conclusion I've drawn from talking to other students in the class). I imagine for a lot of people this class feels like a \"breath of fresh air\" in their otherwise unrelenting schedules, but for me, I already take a lot of enjoyable classes that ask me to think about things that are bigger than myself. As such, this class didn't feel that life-altering. \r\n\r\nI do think the readings and questions posed are interesting, and I found myself quite affected by a lot of the \"second-day\" discussions of secondary texts (especially from Christianity and utilitarianism, which were about radical love from MLK's view and effective altruism, respectively). I also enjoyed learning more about other traditions and philosophies. \r\n\r\nI think anyone considering taking this class should be cognizant that the class sometimes gets overblown recommendations and possibly lower their expectations. Also regardless, credit/d-ing the class should be the move. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. I think everyone at Yale should take this course at some point during their Yale career. It was my favorite course this semester. It helps you understand yourself better; it changes the way you interact with the world and with this institution. APPLY FOR THIS COURSE AND IF YOU GET IN, TAKE IT! ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!!!!!!!! I took it during senior spring with one of my best friends and it was a highlight of this semester. Go on the retreat - it's essential! ",
            "\u00a0Yes totally ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Best class I have taken (and not just in terms of pure enjoyment, but in terms of my own personal development and discovery regarding how I want to live my life). You get vulnerable with other classmates, you may cry with them, but you also laugh and really understand where people come from in a class setting (which is an experience that is incredibly valuable in its own right). Please take this class for your own sake "
