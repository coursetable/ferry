The class gives ample guidance for technical aspects and artistry but not much for how to collaborate and seek out support which is vital to documentary filmmaking. I believe the course should try to encourage collaboration with students learning other aspects of filmmaking, finding ways the project needs of one course could meet the class requirements of another.
