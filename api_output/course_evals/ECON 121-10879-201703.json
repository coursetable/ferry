I'd say though that the main goal of this class is to teach the intuition behind microeconomics by using mathematical models. All the Psets were written in three parts--theory, application, assessment--leading up to a real-world application question, which really helped tie in concepts we learned in lecture with our own experiences.

We also learned how to account for factors like uncertainty into these models. From individual models, we moved on to partial and general equilibrium theory, which involves deciding how to allocate goods among multiple individuals in the market, which uses the same principles of utility maximization. We incorporated firms and production economies into this model and discussed concepts like Pareto efficiency and the welfare theorems. We learned about market failure through imperfect competition (monopoly, oligopoly) and asymmetric information (signalling, adverse selection, moral hazard). ",

But also this class taught me simply how to budget my time better - there is a lot of work in this class, and a lot of difficult, intellectually challenging work. And while in the moment I certainly thought studying and the problem sets were too much or too difficult, now I feel like it was just challenging enough and I'm proud to have finished. I also was forced to learn how to seek help, as the p-sets were often just too long and difficult to finish on my own - I relied on my classmates and office hours with peer tutors and TA's, and just seeing how much help is available for me in my classes was an insight in and of itself.

Student's grew more and more disinterested in the course as the semester passed, and by the end of it many were on the laptops or phones checking their email or browsing social media.\r\n\r\nThe response to student concerns about grading is terrible. If the student has any concerns about grading he is treated in a hostile manner, almost like some kind of fraud, who's trying to get points he doesn't deserve rather than a student with genuine concerns about grading who seeks explanations.\r\n\r\nWhen explanations are given they're given on the basis of uniformity of grading rather than right or wrong, and there is a complete failure to recognise that there can be more than one answer to a question, especially a qualitative one.

Professor Samuelson is a great lecturer, but there's only so much one can do to stay awake for such a dry class early in the morning. Problem sets are atrociously long. For example: the problem set for Fall Break was only three questions, but took hours to painstakingly show the necessary algebra for one of the problems. In the future, this class should create homework that tests the students' understanding of the material, not the students' ability to reduce complex fractions and manipulate exponents. ",
            "\u00a0Samuelson makes this course very, very predictable.  This is a nice feature for the 9 AM T/Th schedule.  Class notes are all available online and review sessions before exams are fairly comprehensive.  Professor Samuelson is a reliable lecture; however, reliability does not translate well into enjoyability in this case.  Lecturesin Davies, of all placeshad a particular ability to put even the most diligent student to sleep.\r\n\r\nProblem sets are extraordinarily time-consuming when they shouldn't be.  The wording of problem sets and exams is cryptic, likely given Prof. Samuelson's eternity of experience in academia.  The calculus is easy and the exams are fair, thought grading is fairly odd and you won't get any feedback on why your written answers didn't pass muster. ",
            "\u00a0The professor is awesome and the TA's are pretty great too. The only problem is that if you miss lecture, it's really hard to get a full grasp on the topic thought since the lecture slides posted skip a lot of important topics/methods that come up during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Samuelson is great at explaining difficult concepts and takes the time to answer questions in class. However, some of the problems and concepts featured on the problems sets are not covered in class and can be difficult. Moreover, Teaching Fellows play a limited role in the course and do not hold review sessions before exams, which, in addition to the review sessions Professor Samuelson hosts, might be helpful. The exams are usually fair, though the format (usually three questions) can make it difficult to succeed if you struggle with one of them. ",
            "\u00a0The course could greatly benefit from taking the time to go through worked examples in lecture and in section. As it currently stands, the lecture is structured to introduce the theory behind many concepts and optional sections are used as a Q&A leaving it largely unstructured. The real learning comes from doing the PSETs which is usually on your own or in student groups. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures did not carry over to the tests completely. The tests are essentially psets and so it's hard to prepare for the exams and final. ",
            "\u00a0To be honest, the lectures were a little dry and focused too much on theory. This meant that when it actually came around to doing problems, it felt like a completely different exercise. On that note, a lot of the questions on problem sets and tests simply seemed to be poorly worded or formulated. \r\nThe strengths of the course is that in most cases it did a good job of linking together some of the key concepts and allowed me to feel like I developed some form of tuition. ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught super fast. A lot of the course was also purely theory based, and it was difficult to understand due to a lack of actual numbers and examples. For example, much of the lectures were based in abstract equations, and a couple of applications of how this theory would be used would have been beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The class is amazing, the only things I would change is add the graphs to the slides and not have it at 9am. ",
            "\u00a0The material just isn't that interesting. It feels like a regurgitation of Intro Micro except with more complicated math. ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of the class for me, was that it was very math heavy. A lot of times, I would be doing calculations, but I wouldn't fully understand how those calculations had applications in the real world, or what their significance was in economic terms. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: rigorous, interesting, Samuelson\r\nWeaknesses: can be time consuming, his slides could be improved (i.e. none of the graphs drawn in class are on the slides which can be frustrating esp if you don't take good notes) ",
            "\u00a0The issue with this course is that it is not at all practical. Most of it is just math, and the economic models are derived from assumptions that render the models relatively useless. In addition, the psets are extensive and filled with problems that involve vast amounts of algebra, which doesn't add to anything except the time needed to complete them. At times, it feels as though the problem sets were designed to be confusing. The exam questions that ask you for an explanation are graded very arbitrarily, and the TA's don't explain their grading, which adds to the confusion. In addition, the powerpoints are almost impossible to follow along with without the lecture and there are not that many online resources (i.e. notes or videos of the lecture) that students can use to supplement their learning. ",
            "\u00a0The class is quite poorly taught. The lecture slides are not very helpful and going to the lectures helps but only marginally. Most of the learning is done on your own, so be prepared to research the concepts and practice the material yourself. The class environment is also quite toxic; many students are unwilling to help because they worry about the precious curve. Some of the TA's are good and helpful, but others also only rehash what was said in class even though it may be hard to understand. The class can be improved in all of those respects. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this course is its lectures and its lecturer.  Each lecture was extremely clear and devoted to a specific subject, in many times building off of skills we had previously learned or topics we had already explored.  Meanwhile, Samuelson was an incredible presenter, one who often supplemented his fantastic slides with work on the board and ample time for questions.  The lone weakness of this course lies in its problem sets, which are sometimes excessively long. ",
            "\u00a0well organized, good lectures, however, the 9am trek to davies is brutal and i missed class quite a bit. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Samuelson, from what I hear, is a divisive teacher. I happen to like his style of teaching. He obviously cares about the topics at hand and cares about students' inquiries when someone is confused, taking time every class to answer questions. Concepts are well taught but some interesting tidbits may fly by fast. 9 AM lectures don't help my attention either! But overall I thought the professor taught the class well. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved with more relevant applications of theory. ",
            "\u00a0This  course is known for being very difficult. The TAs and peer tutors were extremely helpful but every office hours i showed up for quite packed and it was difficult to get personalized help. I think the course could benefit from having more resources available for their students. Piazza in Intro Macro was quite helpful last semester for having questions answered online, or having more peer tutors/TAs would also be great. ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness is just that the material is confusing and complex and nuanced, and we don't have nearly enough time to cover all of it. I know at certain colleges Intermediate Microeconomics is taught in two semesters, which would be tremendously helpful--even though I did okay in the class at the end, I still cannot concretely tell you what maybe 1/3 of the lectures were really about, because we went so fast that I kind of skipped understanding concepts to make sure I just knew how to do specific types of problems. \r\nWith that being said, Larry Samuelson is an animated professor who clearly loves Economics, so that's definitely a plus. However, he also has a manner of speaking that makes the easiest concepts like \"MC=MR on a monopoly graph\" sound 10 times more complicated (at least in my opinion). Discussion section and office hours saved my life because I just could not understand some of the phrases that came out of Larry's mouth. ",
            "\u00a0This class was really informative, and material was really interesting. The weakness came from the grading. Literally, there was no feedback for the grading. You gain or lose points with no explanation whatsoever. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were useful and important to attend because the lecture slides themselves - while a good review source - did not shed light on all the points discussed in lecture (particularly graphical explanations for concepts). \r\n\r\nI gained very limited use from sections and they felt particularly dry and I felt that none of the participants warmed up to the section over the semester. I did appreciate attempts from our TA to make the process more effective.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the midterms were good and the final was well organised although a few more review sessions would have been appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures sometimes dragged on, but the lecture slides were very helpful. The P-Sets were very challenging and I wish sometimes the lectures went over more explicitly how to solve these types of problems. I also wish we had more time for the exams. \r\n\r\nI also thought there was an inconsistency in the difficulty of the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0I think the problem sets could potentially include more exam-type questions or a greater focus on the \"application\" section of the problem set.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have a better textbook that more closely aligns with the content of the course, or at least links/direction to resources that match the content of lectures. Lecture notes/slides could also be better organized to establish clear section headings. ",
            "\u00a0A stronger and more explicit discussion of how topics fit into the mold taught in Intro Micro would be helpful in future iterations of the course. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that there was no real need for textbook reading as all the information we were responsible for was in the slides and presented in class. However, the problem sets and exam questions go into much more detail than what is presented in class. In addition, in lecture the professor will often go over the math related problem solving, but the conceptual questions that appear on problem sets and exams are much more difficult to answer and are often have to be done on your own. ",
            "\u00a0Lots of material but well supported with by an excellent instructor and relevant case studies. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: this is really an excellent course. Yes, the material can get a little dry sometimes. However, Samuelson is a superb instructor and tried his best to make it interesting. He usually succeeded!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: this is a hard class. That's not exactly a weakness, but this is also an extremely difficult class that requires you to put a ton of work into it. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are long and tedious - sometimes not too helpful. The TAs are great and very helpful! As are the practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0My discussion section was very unstructured and as a result, unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0I believe the course could be improved by making it more applicable to the real world. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are interesting, and Professor Larry is a great teacher. The course helps understand the concepts taught in the intro course in more detail and uses some calculus (optimization) to explain the workings of the various models. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are the right amount of challenging, on the cusp of doable as long as you put in the work. The TAs can sometimes be difficult to access or unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets are the right level of rigor. TAs could be more accessible. ",
            "\u00a0PSETs are helpful to learn the material but they also take a long time with an excess or algebra that dont help with your understanding. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Samuelson's in-class lectures are absolutely amazing. That also seems to be the downside of the course too, however. So much emphasis is put on the in-class lecture material that if you ever find yourself missing class or taking subpar notes, you risk having little-to-no reference material for the problem sets. There's really no textbook (Nicholas & Snyder's book is \"recommended\", but the benefit you get from reading it is minimal). Also, the lecture slides Prof. Samuelson posts online lack a lot of the charts and verbal explanation he gives in class so they aren't too helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I think Professor Samuelson is a really great lecturer; he explained everything very clearly, and I feel like I learned a lot of useful tools for different economics problems. There was actually no textbook for the class, which was awesome because I didn't have to do additional reading for the class. Professor Samuelson felt that his lecture slides were sufficient.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Different discussion section TAs would teach/go over different topics. When I compared my notes from discussion section with my friend in the class, he had a better understanding of different topics than I did, so it was unclear what was most important from the lecture. These topics weren't because of different student questions; the TAs just decided to focus on different things. Also, the lecture is at 9am which sucks. I don't know if they will change the time anytime soon, but it was hard for me to stay awake in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very challenging, I wish there was more of an effort to have individual tutoring offered to students as opposed to large group sessions that students simply use to get help on their psets. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The professor is amazing! He's such a great lecturer and he teaches with a passion that clearly communicates how much he cares about the class and its students. The amount of homework and double midterm system I think also works to the advantage of students. \r\n\r\nWeakness: While the lecture slides are pretty good, they are a bit lacking in examples of application of the concepts taught. This makes it a bit hard to use them to complete homework. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- intensive, many resources available\r\nWeaknesses- moves very quickly ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well taught and well organized. Larry is an incredible lecturer, his psets are helpful and interesting, and his exams are fair. My one complaint is that the textbook he recommends is very difficult to follow. He doesn't require a textbook, but I personally prefer to use one. It would be better if he recommended a textbook that matches the material he teaches more closely. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture was great, as I thought Samuelson was a wonderful lecturer. However, sometimes the slides alone as a resource online are misleading or confusing. I think the lecture slides posted online could be a little clearer (maybe including graphs) for a resource to reviewing students. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Samuelson was a great lecturer. He explained theory and concepts very well, so that we could apply them to any type of problem. He also provided us with practice exams from the last 10 years to give us extra practice. We also applied these concepts to economic policies in real life.\r\n\r\nI wished we could have gone through more example problems as the ones provided in class were very general and were not always helpful enough to complete the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The course was strong in its emphasis on the math of economics and was effective in that purpose. I thought that the course could have been improved, especially in regards to lectures near the end of the course, in more carefully relating the math we were learning to the actual concepts in economics. This could have been done by more graphical representations or real-life examples. I also would have appreciated better feedback on graded assessments and exams, as it was difficult to pin down exactly why each question was scored how it was, especially because our TA kept saying that they were not allowed to discuss the exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the slides can be improved a lot. What you learn in class is NOT what is tested or on the psets. Go to section for that. This class also NEEDS to be moved off of the 9am time slot. I guarantee that students would learn so much more if was an hour or two hours later. It takes nothing short of a miracle to get us up to Davies at that god-forsaken hour. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very heavy on the math and sometimes that is to the detriment of gaining a better understanding of economics.The problem sets are actually sometimes quite useful in helping to explain the connection between the conceptual and the mathematical, but I dare say it would be a much easier course to follow, and probably feel more rewarding, if it was set up so that concepts were taught and explained first and followed up with mathmatical models (to give students some appreciation for why the models are important/significant/worthwhile) as opposed to the current set up which feels like you are being forced to learn math loosely tethered to economics and then not until you finish a problem set or take an exam do you realize what the point was. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture gives basic theoretical ideas and may brush over examples. This leaves you very unprepared for the PSETs and exams. Sections do little to help with this, as they repeat lecture content, and office hours and thus the last resort every uses to get by. ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the professor connected the topics more to current events. Though I understand intermediate microeconomics serves as a basis for more challenging and demanding economics courses, the material seemed a bit disconnected from current-day economic problems. ",
            "\u00a0Of all the professors Ive had, Prof. Samuelson was among the most engaged - he seems to care a lot about teaching and it makes the class much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nOne weakness, as I saw it, had to do with he problem sets. Often, the algebraic complexity made it hard to follow the economics points we were supposed to be learning. This was especially the case for the first half of the course, and was somewhat odd, considering how the exams were much more conceptual and much less algebraically difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the various opportunities to learn, not only in class but also in the very carefully made problem sets. Also, the material of the course is fairly straightforward and generally easy to understand intuitively, if difficult to apply precisely. The weaknesses of the class include the level of math expected of students - as I had no experience with multi-variable calculus or linear algebra going in, some of the questions and concepts were difficult for me to grasp. Also, the professor would sometimes gloss over challenging concepts in lecture and leave students to learn them on their own, which sometimes was a little bit too much to expect I think. Overall I think if the lecture moved a little bit slower and explained exactly how our natural intuition about a problem is modeled mathematically, the class would be much more enjoyable. Nonetheless I greatly enjoyed the class, and even though it could be very difficult at times, it could also be very rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0The class is well-organized, however, often the lectures didn't align closely with the problem sets and tests. The lectures could be more focused and clearer. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are helpful. The notation is sometimes confusing. ",
            "\u00a0The concepts in this course were challenging to grasp in lecturebut the problem sets really helped cement the knowledge (even though they were quite hard). \r\n\r\nThe notes were often difficult to follow, it would have been helpful if some of the information that Professor Samuelson wrote on the board were also shared in the slides. ",
            "\u00a0I feel personally that the lectures were a bit vague since there weren't any example problems, like those in the exams, during the lectures. That made it harder to understand the application of the concepts involved. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths- Passionate professor, lots of resources\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- TA sections were not well managed, and hence it became difficult for me to clarify doubts from the lecture or nuance my understanding ",
            "\u00a0Let me preface this by saying I thought the course was amazing. The one piece of feedback I have about the course material is that it seemed the material on market failure was presented with a lower degree of generality than everything else. Looking back, I think I remember the models we were presented as _examples_ of each market failure, but were I asked to identify the key factors behind all models of each kind (e.g. single crossing, perhaps?) I'm not sure I would be able to. This is kind of sad because the lectures made clear there were many different versions of such market failures, but it wasn't always clear how one would model them as we did our examples. ",
            "\u00a0Support from the course instructor and teaching assistants had its strengths and weaknesses. Professor Samuelson is a great lecturer and he takes time during lecture to answer questions and clarify confusing points in the material. During Review Sessions, he is just as helpful. He should be the go-to resource for most of your questions, as a weakness of the course comes from the apparent lack of communication between Professor Samuelson and his TAs. While the TAs were all great and helpful in their own way, there were many times where they were unclear of what Samuelson wanted them to teach/cover during Office Hours and in Discussion Section. The TAs would sometimes question why Samuelson was teaching a concept the way he was, and even go as far as saying that the concept is unimportant to intermediate microeconomics. \r\n\r\nA second weakness of the course is the timing of office hours. The course had lectures Tuesdays and Thursdays, with problem sets due the following Tuesday during lecture. While one could reasonably start the problem set after the Tuesday lecture, it seemed as if 90% of every Problem Set emphasized material taught on Thursdays. Now, of the 5-6 available resources (Professor Samuelson, the 4 TA's, and probably a Peer Tutor), only 1 individual had office hours between Saturday and Monday. The other 5 had them on Thursday or Friday morning. This all means that one had better comprehend each Thursday lecture and work diligently that evening to prepare questions for the Friday office hours, or else you'd be left clueless until Monday evening's TA office hours where about half of the class crowds around a single TA. ",
            "\u00a0The psets are designed to demonstrate concepts and further material feom the lectures, which means that time spent doing them results in learning the material in equal measure. ",
            "\u00a0The strength was the instructor.\r\n\r\nThere were two main weaknesses. First, some TAs were at times unprepared. Second, the course was seriously understaffed (in terms of the number of TAs). Many students often didn't get to ask all of their questions. ",
            "\u00a0Psets should be split up into parts and distributed through the week.\r\n\r\nLectures should be recorded! I found lecture passive - I let the material be calculated in front of me without much engagements.\r\n\r\nI wish I could have paused and rewinded so that I could follow along and be doing the math too instead of rushing to copy down and wondering how many steps Samuelson had skipped because he can do all this stuff in his head at this point.

Some people find this class fascinating, and others find it a complete waste of time and effort. For me, the class was an emotional rollercoaster between these two extremes. If you are an Econ major, you'll have to take the class, so just suck it up and do it and commit to it. If you're thinking about Econ, definitely take this class to test whether you actually want to major in Economics. And if you're looking for a fun or interesting extra class....

It doesnt really touch any concepts not covered in intro micro, so if youre not required to take it Id say just take into micro and be done.

It was astounding how good a massive, required lecture in economics could become. Here are some of the things that make it worth taking:\r\n\r\n- The lectures are incredible. Aside from being extremely clear, Professor Samuelson somehow manages to achieve a great amount of nuance in an introductory economics lecture. What I mean by this is there is a huge risk of learning a lot about economic theory without understanding its limitations (e.g. its assumptions)---and I imagine some of the problems with political discourse in this country have come from people making dogmas out of poorly understood economic concepts---but all throughout the course the professor lectures with such limits in mind, pointing them out where relevant. If you ask Professor Samuelson a question, he will give you a good and honest answer.\r\n\r\n- The problem sets teach you the material. The fact that the problem sets generally helped me internalize the material was honestly extremely nice. The problems are insightful but also not difficult or too long. Also, the masses of past exam papers on the course website made studying for midterms and finals quite relaxed.\r\n\r\n- The material feels coherent. At the end of the day I found myself doing very little memorization in preparation for the exam. Basically, if you get the concepts and can apply them when called upon, you will do fine. This is such a pleasant way to learn compared to classes in which half the work is spent on memorizing arbitrary facts that are promptly forgotten at the end of the semester.\r\n\r\n- Good content. This is obvious: if you're an economics major you need to know this stuff. In fact this is material worth knowing, I feel, for most people wanting to get a handle on how the economic world works.\r\n\r\nI've heard the version of this class offered in the Spring is easier. If you want to learn economics, take it with Professor Samuelson. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course for any students considering majoring in Economics, as you get a decent exposure to General Equilibrium and the use of basic models to examine behavior of agents in markets. ",

Outside social sciences, it's a must for philosophers (I'm a philosophy major).\r\n\r\nStudents of natural sciences can broaden their scope by this course. This course would give them the capability to apply their knowledge to uncharted territory in their own field and develop new models in physics, biology, geology etc. ",
