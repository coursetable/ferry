            "\u00a0I think my ability to speak off the top of my head in Spanish and construct sentences correctly grew a lot. I also was pushed to read harder books and watch more challenging films, so I learned what level I can understand which was helpful because it's made me more confident in talking to native speakers and considering study abroad. ",
            "\u00a0Throughout this course, I developed my Spanish speaking, writing, and listening skills. I learned more advanced grammar skills, truly putting me at an intermediate level of Spanish. I learned to read authentic Spanish literature, such as Un Relato de Naufrago, as well as discussed major world events in the Spanish speaking world. ",
            "\u00a0Speaking Spanish ",
            "\u00a0Definitely gained a greater grasp of grammar. This course was grammar intensive ",
            "\u00a0I somewhat improved in understanding Spanish, even after taking a break from it for a semester. I was able to understand Spanish conversationally, but I couldn't speak that well. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my Spanish by taking this course. Profesora Reymundi made sure we understood the material and went through countless activities, videos, and lessons to help us do so. I'm proud of the progress that was made over the course of the semester. ",

        [
            "\u00a0A strength is that all expectations are so clear. I love how scheduled everything is. I never have a question about what I need to do, what I'm expected to study, etc. That helps me to just focus on learning the content.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness I can think of is reading \"Relato de un Nufrago.\" In Spanish 2, there wasn't any homework assignment I didn't complete. For Spanish 3, reading this book was the only one. I honestly tried but it took a ridiculous amount of time (3 hours for 1 night. If I had done all that was assigned, I wouldn't have slept.) It just had too much boat jargon that I don't even know in English. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very organized. Every assignment, activity, and exam is mapped out from the first day of class and listed in the syllabus. There is no ambiguity in grading and the course is taught fairly. However, some classes were not very engaging and did not facilitate as much learning and development of speaking skills as i thought they could have, due to the 'lecture' feeling of class sometimes. \r\nHowever, a major strength was the professor, Profesora Reymundi, who is the sweetest woman, and is very knowledgeable about Spanish and how best to teach new grammar topics. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are that there are a lot of opportunities to learn read and practice grammar but not enough fun activities and time to speak. ",
            "\u00a0The class could benefit significantly from installing mandatory in-class activities and reducing the lexicon of the reading assignments. Many of the assigned pieces were well beyond my comprehension level and took an inordinate amount of time to complete. ",
            "\u00a0The weakness of this course was assigning reading that were too hard to understand or comprehend. They were way above my level of Spanish. It was ridiculous that the professor expected us to know what was going on just by reading. I had to type whole stories into google translate. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed how engaging the course was. Profesora always had music to listen to when we walked into the class to help us get an ear for the Spanish language. She would also usually have some short movie or visual shown in class to help achieve the same thing. She had interactive activities in which we would converse with our partners to help with our accent and speaking in general.  Overall, it was incredibly engaging, a factor that paid off in helping me learn Spanish ",
            "\u00a0I liked the course- loved the readings and movies which really got us to think. I wish there was some way to get students to have conversations in spanish, but I don't know how I'd do that. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would! I would recommend my professor specifically. ",

            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. It is tedious, and the class meets every day. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want to improve your Spanish, definitely take it. ",
            "\u00a0I would if they wanted to understand spanish grammar, but not if they wanted to improve their speaking ability "
