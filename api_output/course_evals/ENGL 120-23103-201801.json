            "\u00a0Write personal essays, read for craft - what you'd expect of a class like this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to make my writing a lot more concise in this class. Professor Hill really pushes you  to cut down your writing.  I also learned a lot about myself through my writing (my deepest thoughts, interests, etc).  Lastly, I learned you can write about basically anything as long as you can follow the prompt. It was refreshing to know and understand that. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about writing in this class! I learned about techniques, word choice, sentence structure, tone, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Close analysis of text and creative writing skills ",
            "\u00a0I developed a better understanding of the variety of forms of writing covered in this class. It allowed me to learn how to develop an idea from start to finish. I learned how to think creatively and put my ideas in a context that created a point of interest for the reader. ",
            "\u00a0I learned different styles of writing and how to write more effectively. We read different authors and examined their approaches to topics and how they were successful or unsuccessful ",

            "\u00a0I was pleasantly surprised by the diversity of authors we read. It was cool to write and edit an essay every week. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  small seminar allows for great conversation, everyone gets to know each other because the class is so small, the professor is very accessible because of the small class size, work shopping other peoples essays and getting your essay workshoped is very helpful for your writing.\r\nWeaknesses:  writing an essay every two weeks can be challenging with other course loads, receiving criticism is difficult, buying a course packet for the course is expensive and arguably unnecessary ",
            "\u00a0I felt that there could be more one on one tutoring to suit each students' different needs ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were that we were exposed to many stylistic techniques, but in a way, I feel like we glazed over them and that we could've delved deeper into them. (Maybe at the expense of learning less?) ",
            "\u00a0Writing ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: I thought the readings connected well to the writing and editing process. I really enjoyed the class conversations and discussion of the readings.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I thought more feedback would have been helpful for each essay. One helpful change would be if we could have a partner that would help us edit each draft! I also felt that I could have used help learning how to edit on a small level. I feel comfortable editing for organization/content, but having one class devoted to word choice, sentence structure etc. in order to convey idea would have been really helpful! ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were that we got to read very different styles of writing and practice them ourselves. I really liked the different writing assignments and found them challenging but rewarding. A weakness was that we did essentially the same thing every class, some variety wouldve been cool. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely! English 120 was, by far, one of my favorite classes at Yale. I took the course Credit D/Fail, and I really feel like that allowed me to enjoy the learning process much more because I wasn't being burdened by the idea of a grade. ",
            "\u00a0The quality of a course like 120 really depends on the instructor. ",
            "\u00a0I think  ENGL 120  is something that everyone at yall should take. I feel very lucky to have taken it as a freshman because now I will carry these skills with me through the rest of college.  It is a manageable English class and a great writing credit. I recommend that all students take it, regardless of where they are in their studies. We had all ages and grade levels in our class and it really helped the classs flow. We had people like myself, who havent had any English class experience in college, and English majors sitting side by side.  Take this class! You wont regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Take it if you're reading this! You might be uncomfortable at first (I sure was), but you can definitely handle it! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I think the readings for the class are very enjoyable, and it's fun to have the chance to be creative with the essays. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would; the environment was very relaxed and was a safe space to try new things with writing and improve. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they do not enjoy more formal writing. "
