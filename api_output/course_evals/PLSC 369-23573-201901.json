            "\u00a0Surface-level overview of technological developments and their impact on security. Nothing you couldn't learn by just reading a few news articles. ",
            "\u00a0The most concrete things I learned were: how the Internet, encryption, and bitcoin ACTUALLY work.  I also learned a lot about India from Prof Wilkinson's lectures.  In general, a lot of cool topics about the intersection of political science and technology ",

            "\u00a0I learned incredibly rudimentary material about international relations and data privacy. ",
            "\u00a0I came out of this class with a much better understanding of different countries, especially India and Chinas, approaches to security, surveillance, and privacy. While I cant say that any of this knowledge really changed the way I personally think about privacy, it was very refreshing and eye-opening to look beyond the U.S. and their technological advances. I probably learned the most during the lessons on voter fraud and cyber warfare. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the modern challenges that are arising from technology's usage. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives you a good overview of the problems modern technologies are causing in political systems. Professor Feigenbaum does a great job distilling technical foundations and covers important policy issues. Professor Wilkinson's lectures often rambled and were just an amalgamation of current events. ",

            "\u00a0Perhaps the most poorly written final exam (multiple choice) that I've ever encountered. (Questions were incredibly ambiguous.) Professors decided to \"make the class harder\" halfway through the semester by grading the essays (of which there are four total) more harshly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: really incredible lecturers and dedicated TFs, fascinating content\r\nWeaknesses: too many papers and the prompts were super vague every time ",
            "\u00a0The organization of the class was atrocious. It's clear both professors are passionate about the subjects, but sections had no guidelines and ended up being only tangentially related to the course material and readings were often not posted until after the lecture for which they were assigned. The homework assignments were asinine, and were either incredibly specific so as to prevent you from being able to actually come up with something interesting, or so vague as to be useless as prompts. The exams suffered from the same problem, as the multiple choice or true/false questions were either so intuitive that you didn't need to have been in the class to get them right or so specific that studying felt like a waste of time. The material of the class is its strong point, particularly in the first half. After the privacy/surveillance lectures things go south fast without a clear direction. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Section with John was fantastic. He was a great leader, and always gave us great insight.\r\n\r\nWeakness: The entire course except for section. ",
            "\u00a0I wish there was more overlap between the political science and computer science majors assignments. I was on the political science track, but I found myself wanting the option to do a computer science problem set instead of an essay, because while I got a lot of political knowledge out of this class, I didnt really learn in-depth about the technical side of things. ",
            "\u00a0I think it should be taught separately. I liked learning about the Comp Sci components of the class, but found it hard to understand. The tests also ended up being geared towards the political science lectures, so it made it feel as though we didnt really need to learn the CPSC topics if we were in the PLSC seminar. I also felt like they were throwing together topics in an unorganized fashion. At the end of the day, I felt like I was learning the same thing over and over again. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was pretty much perfectly structured and organized. One of my favorite courses I've taken at Yale so far. Please continue to offer this course! ",
            "\u00a0Give instruction on the homework instead of just a prompt and a page requirement. Also dont call it a reading response if its going to be graded as if it were an essay. ",
            "\u00a0The material in this course is great. Wilkinson especially is an incredible lecturer and teacher. The assignments are useful to reinforce the class. There are, however, a lot of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The course covers very interesting material. The lectures by Feigenbaum were typically great. Wilkinson should be replaced. His lectures were not insightful nor were they engaging. The essay prompts were AWFUL. They focused on one part of one class as opposed to the larger concepts we were covering. ",
            "\u00a0A huge weakness was that the professors were teaching things that they were not nearly experts on. This came up for both Prof. Feigenbaum and Prof. Wilkinson, and really detracted from the interesting lectures that were more related to the professors' areas of expertise. Otherwise it was an ok course, and brought up some intriguing ideas about technology. \r\n\r\nAlso, the grading system was incredibly unfair, due to the cross listed nature of the class. Students writing essays (graded subjectively by TAs, generally quite harshly) were graded using the same grade boundaries as students completing CS psets (which Prof. Feigenbaum openly said most people got high grades on).  If this class is ever taught again, I STRONGLY suggest making this clear to students, or better yet, using different grade boundaries so students doing the same type of assignment are graded against each other. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Brought together one professor from Computer Science and one from Political Science; The course got me to think critically about technology; My section was great; Lecture notes posted online; I improved my social science writing and got SO credit.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Much writing, but no WR credit. The different versions of the course had different assignments, which caused problems: I heard the coding assignments were easy, but the essays were very time-consuming, yet everyone was graded together. Furthermore, splitting the course in two defeats the purpose of bringing together Computer Science and Political Science. Few people came to section. Assigned readings were way too long and not always very relevant. Losing a single point on an assignment or exam resulted in losing a whole percentage point in the final grade. Much of the course felt wishy-washy. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's one of the more engaging PLSC lectures that's not one of the super famous ones (bioethics and law, constitutional law) ",

            "\u00a0TLDR: Please do yourself a favor and avoid this class at all costs.\r\n\r\nA more extensive description: This class is nothing less than a catastrophic disaster. If you want to learn nothing for an entire semester, this is the class for you! Be prepared for horribly boring lectures, for material that you can learn merely by having common sense, and for reading responses that evaluate your ability to make a coherent essay with some citations. And oddly enough, what you learn in this class deals with neither \"Power\", nor \"Security\", nor \"Surveillance\"; it deals with modern conflicts in South Asia. Those genuinely interested in the proposed title should know this before going in, else you will lose all motivation to pursue anything tangentially related to the intersection of technology and policy. If Steven Wilkinson is teaching this course, I would suggest that you run the other way and pretend that you never saw him. His lecture notes are like smelly, fly-infested garbage that ended up on a computer screen, though perhaps this metaphor is too generous. But when you show up to teach a class that you ostensibly know nothing about, it is not surprising that every word either stems from an outside academic, or lacks the force to deliver a novel, thought-provoking message. For what Yale is worth in academic capital, the students who took this class have deserved infinitely more, more engagement and more intellectual zest. My hope is that this comment will ensure that this class never gets taught again, a nail in the coffin that Power, Security, and Surveillance will inevitably occupy. But if my truest imagination deceives me, and this class is offered yet again, I hope equally that there will not be enough students to enroll, and that this class will descend into that proverbial graveyard for lack of student demand. It is time that the students of Yale college speak out against academic injustice, and respond to this injustice with the utmost sincerity. Finally, I want to thank you for taking the time to read this rant about Power, Security, and Surveillance. I hope that, at the very least, it has made you doubt your intentions for joining this class. But does this class even deserve to be called a \"class\"? Probably not, though I know no other way to explain what it purports to be. ",
            "\u00a0would recommend content if taught in smaller lecture ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a computer science major who knows very little about political science, but I wouldnt recommend it to anyone who wants in-depth technical analysis or cyber security policy analysis. In my opinion, the class is very surface level, and therefore, best for people new to the topics of cybersecurity, surveillance, etc. ",
            "\u00a0No. Worst class I have taken at Yale. You could learn the same concepts by taking any other international security course- and there would be more guidance, and the paper prompts would probably be clear and they werent in this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course! Super interesting with very well chosen and balanced content. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely not. This was the most disorganized class Ive ever taken. The homeworks were not planned out strategically. The last one was assigned a week before the due date (the day before the final) while the others gave about 2-3 weeks to complete. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The course discusses some issues pertinent to contemporary society and its interactions with technology that people should be aware of. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Great professors, great material. ",
            "\u00a0In its current structure with the same teachers I would not recommend the course. If Wilkinson is replaced and essay prompts are improved, then this would be a great course to take. ",
            "\u00a0No. It had potential, but ultimately fell flat ",
            "\u00a0This is a new course, so with improvement, yes. The idea of a combined Computer Science and Political Science course is good, but needs refinement. "
