Other times, I felt like I was given no background on what the lecture was going to be about. Better framing of the guest speakers' lectures would be useful. I appreciated the comprehensive overview of business and government around the world. ",

            "\u00a0I would suggest engaging more students through debates and establishing earlier deadlines for the written work so students can have feedback. The case studies in the final exam (take home version) were interesting, there should be more like these during the term. "
