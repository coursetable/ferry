            "\u00a0Learned how to plan and execute an art piece for an exhibition. ",

            "\u00a0My own practice and time management. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very rigorous, though in some ways it is what you make of it. Overall, I thought that we had a really strong class, and I got a lot of very productive feedback from my peers. I really felt that during the duration of the course my practice and process improved considerably; I was pushed to find new means of expression that I had not previously considered. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course was great because I got to evaluate the work of my peers and receive feedback on my own work. I really enjoyed working with my advisor, Troy. ",

            "\u00a0It would be great to have readings! Just so we get more critical modes of thinking about our work and are able to share a common dialogue. The group can also feel large at times, and it can be difficult to talk across mediums (it seems like computing+art students have different concerns than art students, and this could limit discussion). But otherwise useful. ",
            "\u00a0I think there could have been more work in the first semester to spread it out. Advisors and topics could have been sorted out earlier to get a head start on our work. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the format of presenting + feedback worked well with the overall theme of the senior project. However, I do wish that we could have had two presentations as opposed to onethen we could have developed our ideas more and gotten feedback on the changes from the first round of reviews. Though, I understand that given the shorter time frame of the course (in comparison to Senior Project I), this may not have been possible. Overall, I learned a lot from both looking at my peers' work and hearing their critiques of my own. ",
            "\u00a0I think that we should have a bit more work time. I dont know if we should necessecarily present on our work every week. It may have been beneficial to have studio time instead of having work time on some days. ",
