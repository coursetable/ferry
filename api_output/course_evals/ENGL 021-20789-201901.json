            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to identify different consciousnesses in novels, and just in general how to read fiction more critically. ",
            "\u00a0Analytical thinking, close reading, expanding themes ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage a fairly heavy reading load (a book a week, plus two articles) by breaking them down in smaller chunks. I learned how to read books with an eye towards the depiction of consciousness - both in a grammatical and thematic sense. What type of narration is it? How does that specific style of grammar/narration lend itself to the depiction of a conscious experience? ",
            "\u00a0I got a chance to dive into many fascinating novels and hone in on the concept of consciousness. The small seminar setup is very conducive to discussion, and I learned a lot from listening to my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I did not learn very much from taking this course, other than general writing skills from having to write three papers. ",
            "\u00a0In this course I read novels more fervently than I had in quite a long time. Each work was compelling and made me think, and Im grateful that I had the opportunity to discuss these works with a great group of students. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how authors represent consciousness in works of literature in a wide variety of styles. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths - really good reading list, kind of had a clear progression of what we learned\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes felt like there wasn't much purpose to class discussions ",
            "\u00a0Fun and good reading, though we spend too little time with each novel ",
            "\u00a0I think the strength of this class was in the syllabus; we read a lot of fantastic books that I likely would not have read on my own time. However, I found the seminars themselves quite lacking in several ways. First of all, I think Prof. Kramnick spent too much time at the beginning of class lecturing about the book. While having some context can be helpful, lectures could go on for 15 minutes to almost half an hour, which is considerable in a 75-minute class and considering the pace at which we read (a novel per week, meaning there is a lot of material to discuss). I felt like having this kind of start to class was really stifling for students and prevented us from having an organic conversation about the books. This was compounded by the fact that the prof calls on each person individually, then has the student share their thoughts directly to him, so that he can respond back (or sometimes interrupt them midsentence). We are college students and old enough to have a conversation without having to raise our hands ever time we would like to say something. I was really excited for this class, but ultimately very disappointed by the quality of the seminar discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the pace of the course: While the pace seemed daunting at first, it was a great way to get a big selection of fiction within one semester. Also, its nice to be in a freshman seminar, just for the experience of having one. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: A western-centric view of fiction. Only one non European author was read during my semester (Spring of 2018-2019 school year). I wish there were more perspectives represented in the materials chosen. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- The variety of the novels and the inclusion of two films at the end. Although I wasnt a big fan of the novel, Outline, when compared with the rest of the syllabus. The discussion post set-up was very helpful in allowing me to flush out my understanding of the novels. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses- Sometimes I felt as if the professor would spend too much time at the beginning of the class summing up what we talked about in the past that it would detract from the discussion itself. I also wish there were more structured in class activities rather than sole discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is its syllabus. The books that we read were all wonderful and highly-acclaimed, and a major reason that I remained somewhat engaged with the class. The weakness was the professor. Professor Kramnick seems to be more suited to leading a lecture class; I did not find his seminar teaching style conducive to my learning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the class has an interesting focus, the reading list is great, you get a sense for some of the major positions on consciousness through also reading philosophy and science excerpts.\r\nWeaknesses: class discussion doesnt always feel productive, there are too many people in the class. ",
            "\u00a0more varied selection of literature and more free-flowing class discussion ",
            "\u00a0The discussions surrounding the novels were very interesting and very complex. The discussions did a good job of exploring multiple angles towards consciousness and the many different implications of the depictions. The course was a little too quickly paced, however. We read a novel a week, which was too much to keep up with with the rest of my coursework and prevented us from going very deep into a few of the novels. "

            "\u00a0Yes - I think it's a fun course to take if you love to read fiction - you basically just get to talk about really good books in class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes- very interesting and niche class ",
            "\u00a0This course forces you to read a lot of great books that you probably wouldn't make time to read otherwise, so in that way this course is good. As far as the actual classes go, they are not that engaging and dominated by the professor and his thoughts. So overall it is pretty dissatisfying. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Prof. Kramnick is certainly an acquired taste (he loves to talk, and sometimes I felt that he spoke too much during our short seminars) but he really knows his stuff. So if you are willing to look past some of his more arrogant behaviors, then you will find a mentor who is really engaged with the materials. \r\n\r\nHowever, this class is a fair bit of work. You should expect 4-8 hours of readings a week, with a weekly response posted to canvas discussion board. 3 papers are super manageable (but sometimes Prof. Kramnick gives the prompts only a week before the papers are due, which makes it hard to really dedicate time to craft a thoughtful and critical argument). \r\n\r\nIn spite of Prof. Kramnick's eccentric personality (He puts a 4 inch book on his seat so that he can be \"tall\" at the head of the harkness table) and the rigorous reading schedule, this class is worthwhile because of the material itself. If you are at all interested in language, the impact of language on the conception of self/others, consciousness, the limitations of languages, the nuances of grammar in conveying mental states, then this class will offer something for you. ",
            "\u00a0I would if you are looking for a reading intensive course with fascinating novels. This isnt as writing intensive, but you have to be willing to commit to a novel a week which can be daunting. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course. There are better and more interesting first-year seminars. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if youre interested in something with a lot of reading. Its a great way to enhance your literary diet while also having the opportunity to discuss that with your peers. ",
            "\u00a0no, just on account of the way it is taught by the professor ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it. I would just caution the student to be sure they can handle that amount of reading. The course is really interesting and well taught, but it takes a lot of work to keep up in. "
