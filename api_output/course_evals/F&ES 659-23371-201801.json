I wish the course focused solely on New England, solely on natural regeneration methods and solely on the values that forest managers must manage for- and how best to do so! (water, wildlife, timber, recreation, carbon). Because the course was global in perspective and because the course attempted to cover so much- all of ecology (soils to meteorology!), natural regen, nurseries, values, agroforestry, etc, (here and everywhere) I came away with generalizations that felt a bit hollow.

I understand why the course is taught this way and I do think that it makes the course accessible to more people, but I expected advanced, high-level, focused information about silvicultural techniques, as opposed to broad, introductory topics.

Sometimes I would have liked more of the field time to be spent on just walking around and talking about what we see in the forest, versus on exercises. I recognize that the exercises are good for reinforcing the concepts, however. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Dr. Ashton really cares about his students.  Strong sense of silviculture community.  Some really enjoyable field trips.  Good textbook.\r\nWeaknesses: Vague scope/broad/basic.  Lecture could use more student discussion/engagement.  Some field trips seemed like we were driving a long way to accomplish something that could have been demonstrated right outside of Marsh.  Would love fewer lectures, more field time. ",
            "\u00a0Workload is definitely not to be underestimated, but there are several modes of teaching employed that infuses much-appreciated flexibility in learning. Field trips helped me to appreciate and consolidate the concepts learnt in class; to visualise them in real-world scenarios. ",

Which I have never said before but I thought they were fun, challenging, relevant to my interests, and pretty accurately tested the breadth of my knowledge on the topic. I also thought field trips were particularly informative and engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor teaches all of the information very well.  It could be improved by cutting out half of the material and really diving into the other half.  The field time was great, I know this is impossible but I'm going to say it anyway - more field time would be hugely beneficial. ",

            "\u00a0Its strengths are course structure and wholeness of contents. Students have many ways of learning the material being covered and that is very much useful and appreciated. There is much to be improved however in the timing among slides during lectures and on many of the slides themselves (see 11 below), which should be re-photographed and redrawn. Also, field exercises could be better organized so that they are fair to all students and that everyone actually does something in the end. It's somehow too relaxed and that is good and bad at the same time. Also, the field trips could be scheduled differently along the semester, as I felt they were too crammed up at the latter part and that was a bit counter-productive (I even missed one!). Also, silviculture breakfast seems counterproductive and lends itself to a clique-mentality. I would really review this unofficial component of the course. Not all traditions should be blindly followed. ",

",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the field trips, class community (silviculture breakfasts!), the civility of having free tee and coffee offered in a morning class, the great lecturing from Dr. Ashton. Weaknesses are that it's just a ton of content and time. ",

As for the class lectures, many of us were grateful for the online recorded versions because Mark talks in circles quite a bit. Fun, but not efficient or consistently clear. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent class! A great course for non-forestry students who want an digestible initiation into the field, since the course touches on several topics that are taught more in-depth at the school (e.g. Forest Health, Forest Operations, Stand Dynamics, etc.). Individual workload can be heavy in terms of weekly lectures, readings and field-trips, but there are very few assessments which makes it manageable overall. Professor and teaching assistants were always positive and super helpful with explaining initially-heavy concepts, and the lectures and field trips are fun! ",
