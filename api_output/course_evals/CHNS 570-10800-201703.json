            "\u00a0I learned how to identify and translate common grammar patterns in classical Chinese texts and translate basic ideas and passages from English into classical Chinese. My knowledge base of traditional Chinese characters and their classical meanings has grown significantly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of Chinese characters and grammar. Professor Hunter taught the course in a fun and engaging way that was very accommodating to the fact that I had taken no previous courses in Chinese language. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basic grammar and literary conventions of Classical Chinese ",
            "\u00a0I wish I had realized earlier the importance of memorizing the story characters, plots, and main ideas for help in remembering characters. I think I may was too focused on memorizing definitions in a vacuum. But I can't really know, because i learned so much that my view now may be skewed and I don't remember how at the beginning, even one phrase of four characters seemed like a lot to get through. \r\n\r\nthis is the third time I am writing this after losing my work in this system. apologies for sloppy answers.

            "\u00a0The course is a solid introduction to reading and translating classical Chinese texts. The Rouzer textbook, which we used, is about the best textbook currently available as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nI would have found it valuable to stop and reflect on lessons 1-5 as a class after we completed them, rather than combine lessons 1-5 and 6-10 together immediately before the midterm. ",
