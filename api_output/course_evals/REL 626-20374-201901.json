            "\u00a0Tendency to combat arguments with information that is not found in the readings. Overall very smart individual. ",
            "\u00a0Sara is honesty the best TF Ive ever had. She was exceedingly well prepared and her emails ahead of section kept us all well prepared too. She is encouraging, concerned for all, upbeat, and deeply knowledgeable about the material. I imagine she will make a splendid professor before long! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - compassionate and resourceful\r\nWeaknesses - none ",
            "\u00a0Organized and thorough. Gave us space to investigate our own questions. \r\nGreat theological analysis worksheet. Helped us study for the final. \r\nConsiderate and prepared. She was Aleshas way more prepared for the class than needed. Ready to answer an array of questions. \r\n\r\nThe section sizes should be maxed at 10. ",
            "\u00a0Sara really knew her stuff and taught us a lot! She was a tough grader on the first case study, but she definitely helped me improve and I learned so much during the course. She clarified a ton for me! "

            "\u00a0Justin comes prepared. His classroom management skills are excellent. He has material ready to lead a discussion. There is no dead air time. Further, he has answers to student questions and makes space for differing opinions. While he is still maturing in his pedagogy and theology, he is very knowledgeable and is able to argue the basic and advanced theological rhetoric. He is skilled at seeing how the pieces connect if one argument is skewed where does another move. He is respectful of each student and there various outside obligations and was helpful when I needed accommodations. He respected the dignity of each participant. Well done!! ",
            "\u00a0Justin was well prepared. Invited questions and knew the subject matter very well. ",
            "\u00a0I have to say that without Justin this class would have been much harder. He did \"fill in the gaps\" of knowledge left by the lectures and worked in the sections to provide more structure so we could understand better the course material. I am grateful to have had him as a TA and I am sure he is on for a bright future as a professor and a theologian. ",
            "\u00a0Very well versed in systems. ",
            "\u00a0Sara is a kind and thoughtful TF.  She is eager to help lead students and facilitate learning appropriate to each student.  I would add that I think she should add some more teaching elements to the sessions.  While facilitating is great, some subjects required straight-up teaching to help clarify lecture.  I appreciated her positive and welcoming tone. ",
            "\u00a0Great at facilitating class discussion. Very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot speak highly enough about Sara. I felt as though she organized, challenged and supported where appropriate our section in the best way possible. She was attentive to the details of our theological points and encouraged us to fine tune them our walk through the implications of a statement wed said more closely. She worked to foster a respectful, inclusive and supportive classroom environment in a meaningful and intentional waynot because she had to but because it was important to do so, which you could tell in the way she talked about it. She was easy to schedule meetings with outside of section and quick to respond to emails if I had a question. Sara is awesome and Im very thankful to have had her this semester!!! "
