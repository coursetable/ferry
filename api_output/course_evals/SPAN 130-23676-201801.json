            "\u00a0A richer Spanish vocabulary and better communication skills both orally and written. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Spanish grammar and vocabulary, from introductory material through intermediate topics. I learned more about Latin American culture and read interesting stories in Spanish. I also learned more than I was expecting to about conversing in Spanish, and how to speak more naturally. ",
            "\u00a0I learned Spanish! ",
            "\u00a0The course helped with the knowledge of Spanish grammar and reading comprehension. "

        [
            "\u00a0A strength is the small class structure, mine only had 10 people which was very helpful. A weakness is the distribution of work, it could be more evenly distributed over the weeks. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course!!! It is very interactive, which I think is important for a language course. It's also quite time consuming, although I think that's necessary for a course like this. My class was rather small (around 10 students), and I think the small size really added to the experience.\r\n\r\nThe many evaluations are helpful in staying on track, and I appreciate that the class is not curved. However, I wish that we didn't have such a heavy workload during the last couple weeks of class (having to both read the novel and watch the movie at home), since many other classes have finals or final projects during this time. This led to a lot of students either not doing the extra homework, or not getting as much out of it. Instead, I wish that the novel and movie were moved a couple weeks earlier and we spent the last two weeks learning more topics and doing review. \r\n\r\nIn general, L1-L4 courses require an enormous amount of time commitment and L5 courses are quite advanced. I wish that there were half credit Spanish courses that you could take (not to fulfill any language requirements) just to keep up with your language study and learn about imteresting topics, but were not meant to be as intensive as the main courses. I think this would make a great addition to Yale, because currently, many students only take as many Spanish courses as are required and then stop. They might be interesting in keeping up their Spanish, but the L1-5 courses take so much time that they can't fit them into their schedule.  I hope you consider this because I think it would be very helpful for many students. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that overall, the course was mostly busywork and I found very little of it meaningful. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend but a good Prof is necessary to do well and actually learn the language. I would recommend taking it with Sebastian Diaz if at all possible. ",
            "\u00a0I would, but probably not unless that student was required to take the course or they were very interested in spanish. That's because Yale students are always very busy and this course is a huge time commitment, so it's not worth it unless you have to take it or are very interested. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  Sebastian is amazing and the course is rigorous but well structured ",
            "\u00a0No I would not recommend this course, but it is a requirement. "
