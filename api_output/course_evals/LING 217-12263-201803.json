            "\u00a0A fine introduction to Linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0Insight into the field of linguistics and basic knowledge of syntax, language acquisition, and IPA. ",
            "\u00a0From knowing nothing about linguistics, I came to a conversational level of understanding of the four major components of linguistic analysis, and with that a general body of knowledge about how to approach questions in linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0Basic understanding of linguistics as a field ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course exposed me to many of the areas of linguistics and aspects of neurolinguistics, since we looked at language acquisition and such. I learned about linguistic research as well as how to diagram various linguistic structures. This course focused on the overlap between language and the mind, so that was the content of classwork. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think on another level!  At the beginning of the semester I was struggling a lot to grasp the concepts, and prof MMP told me basically to suck it up and try harder because it takes time and effort to break through to the other side.  It's true, and you get to learn so much about the structure and function of language.  I've learned how to openly fail, embrace it, and grow.  It is an incredibly rewarding class as well because you learn so much so quickly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about both linguistics and language acquisition! I know all the foundational ways to analyze language now (we did a few classes each on semantics, morphology, phonetics/phonology, and syntax). I also learned how to write my own linguistics research paper/what linguistics research looks like, as that was a heavy focus of the last third of the course. ",
            "\u00a0We had an introduction to basic linguistic concepts in the first half of the course and learned about its connection to the human mind in the second half of the course(language acquisition, sign language, sentence processing), from which we learned to look at human language from a cognitive perspective. Through reading papers and writing our own short paper, we learned how linguistic/psycholinguistic research questions are formulated and tested. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the more technical theoretical foundations of linguistics, such as morphology, semantics, syntax, and phonology, but we also explored further into psycholinguistic topics such as language acquisition and real-time language comprehension, with a unit on Sign Language as well, which I really enjoyed. In the later half of the semester, we read a lot of case studies and experiment reports. The final project of the class was to conduct your own study on any linguistic topic of your choosing, which was fun, and although challenging, it helped that we had read through so may professional studies, as well as learning about the studies of Professor Piango.

            "\u00a0This course has one of the highest workloads I have come across. There were 2 p-sets a week, 3 midterms, final paper, and a final. A lot of the content on the p sets was also challenging and not necessarily dependent on the things we had yet gone over in class - and while this did facilitate learning which was AWESOME because I learned a lot it was incredibly frustrating that we were graded on things prior to learning them. ",
            "\u00a0The content is a strength, the way in which is conveyed could be polished. ",
            "\u00a0The material is so engaging, and Professor Piango is a wonderful teacher! Id say that the course could be improved a lot though, mainly in terms of clarity, grading (which is unduely harsh), and time management; we almost never finished class on time and section always ran over. Making clear what we are expected to know and not penalizing us for missing homework questions covering topics we never learned would be a start. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the competence of both the professor and TA, I thought that they made themselves very accessible to students. Of the things that I would change, don't make the paper due during finals period/near any of the other tests within the class. I think it would be a better outcome if the two were more separated. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a decent amount of work, and it is usually pretty complex. This helps you learn the concepts in the end though, so it is rewarding. It could be improved if some requirements were a little clearer. Overall, it was a challenging but interesting course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  lecture is super important and insightful, learn so much, very open environment in which you are allowed to fail, studying for the quizzes and final isn't too horrible because it's a gradual, cumulative process, there are handouts and answer sheets to the psets and quizzes that are super helpful and can clear up a lot of confusion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:  psets can be frustrating at times (you do problems on things you haven't learned yet), prof MMP can talk in circles at times - you really need to focus in lecture ",
            "\u00a0Professor Piango teaches this class like a lecture-seminar, which I personally really enjoyed. She talked for most of class but always entertained our questions, so we were pretty engaged. Definitely have to be prepared for every class! Unfortunately, she would engage us too much sometimes, where our time was often eaten up by class discussion and we didn't get to discuss stuff we actually needed to know. When quizzes (read: midterms) came around, it was hard to tell what was just stuff we discussed in class vs. material we were going to be tested on. \r\n\r\nI think her teaching style is pretty particular, so you have to see if you mesh with it or not.. Prof. Piango and Andy were always so helpful in answering our questions inside and outside of class though!\r\n\r\nSome other cons: I also wasn't a huge fan of the mandatory section on Wed night - basically this was a 3x a week class. And we had both a final paper and final exam, except the final paper was 3000 words and worth only 5% of our grade... ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: 1. The course materials are interesting on its own and it debunks a lot of misconceptions about language that I had before taking the class. 2. The structure of the syllabus is well organized. We were given a linguistic \"crash course\" before diving into the connection between language and mind.\r\nWeaknesses: 1. The short paper only accounts for a small amount of the final grade but the workload is disproportional to it. The period for doing it was also a bit short. We drafted a short proposal a week before Thanksgiving but the feedback was given after the break and the time to collect data was a bit limited. 3. The pace of the course was a bit slow during the start of the semester, and I kind of got bored. I think we could've spent less time on lexical items and dive into language acquisition earlier because I felt like I was taking an English Grammar course for the first half of the semester and didn't get the point of doing it. If the connection to mind was made earlier I would feel more motivated. 4. The lecture note was a bit hard to follow for a non-psych/cog sci major.  Some of it did not make sense to me until the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We really learned so much in this class, and I feel like I became a better reader when it comes to the case studies that we analyzed for homework and during section. Prof Piango is also very organized with her handouts and I suggest taking notes directly on them. Our TA also made homework and quiz answersheets which really helped when reviewing for quizzes and the final. \r\nWeaknesses: We sometimes went off on tangents during class, which meant that sometimes we went a little over time.

            "\u00a0Take this if you have a genuine interest in linguistics or need it for a requirement. The course load is a pain but the professor is fun so lecture was engaging and you really do come away having learned a lot. It is just a lot to put yourself through work-wise for something you are not interested in learning a good deal about. Even so, what you learn is unlike anything from other courses - even intro linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I have to say the material of this course is not only fascinating, but also eye-opening. Linguistics doesn't usually get taught in high school and, as my first class in the field, Language and Mind served as a through introduction. Homework assignments can get a bit nerve-wracking, though. And the professor's lecturing style is not for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but Id probably credit/d/fail it if youre not already involved with linguistics or cog sci. Its really fascinating material, but, even for a 200-level course, is unnecessarily confusing and frustrating at times. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! This course was the highlight of my semester ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. If you have some linguistic or cognitive science experience, the course might go along smoother, but Prof. Pinango's teaching kind of redefines what you have previously learned, so take note of that. Even though there is a great workload and sometimes it feels like you don't understand the concepts, it is really instructed to help you learn and succeed in the end. One of my favorite and more engaging courses this semester. She keeps you on your toes, so pay attention! ",
            "\u00a0This class is great for any student who wants a broad, yet deep introduction to linguistics AND how it connects to the mind (i.e. Theory of Mind, context, etc.).  This is not a class I would take if you are not looking to put work or effort into it... it definitely requires a lot of time and brain power.  However, it is an incredibly rewarding class overall, and there is a ton of support to help you get through tough material.  There aren't that many intense readings, although there are Psets due every class (except on the 1-3 days in which one isn't assigned).  Office hours are very accessible.  The content itself is intriguing as well!  Highly recommend, if you are willing to put in the work. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student! Even though it was hard work, it's a class about material that I wouldn't think of studying otherwise. It has completely reshaped the way I view humanity and language and the importance of language in our world. The class is frustrating at times, but I feel like Prof. Piango and Andy (our TA) are both so knowledgeable and fun that it's worth it. It's definitely my favorite class of the semester. If you have taken linguistics before though, make sure that you realize this class is based a lot off of her own research and interpretation of linguistics. You definitely have to show up to class every day and do the work, but even still I think grading was pretty lax. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to people who are interested in linguistics. I think it gives a very good introduction and we also learn its connections to psychology, and it gave me a better idea of what doing linguistic research is like. ",
            "\u00a0Even though this class is a level 200 course, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a solid introduction to linguistics, but is also interested in more experimental linguistics. Professor Piango is very kind and smart and wants to share her knowledge of linguistics with her students. This class made me realize that majoring in linguistics may really be something I want to do, so if you want to explore your potential interest in linguistics, take this class. "
