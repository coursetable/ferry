            "\u00a0The most important skill that I learned from this course was how to structure an argument in an academic paper. ",
            "\u00a0How to write more academically. ",
            "\u00a0- critically anyazing difficult argumentative essays essays and pieces \r\n- considering the most effective writing strategies \r\n- assessing my own writing for strengths and weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write in a more concise manner, and to look more critically at pieces of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my skills of reading and analyzing texts. I also just developed my writing in general. ",
            "\u00a0I developed very important writing and reading skills. As an international student understanding the U.S. college writing system is vital to my future succes. Additionally, I have not done close reading before and this class also provided me with insight into close reading techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write a real college essay. I was a terrible writer in high school, but in this class they really broke it down step by step. It made writing look more like a formula, which is often easier for many people to follow. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my English skills in writing and reading. One of the most valuable skills is that I now have a better understanding of how to properly write a coherent essay. ",
            "\u00a0I have a better understanding of my own strengths/weaknesses in writing. I am much better at constructing well-reasoned arguments and placing them within the framework of a larger conversation. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about both writing and the topics that were covered in class (vegetarians, gourmands, and cannibals). Through writing the essays and the feedback Professor Im gave, I learned how to write more effectively, and through the various readings we were assigned, I learned a lot about food culture, cannibalism throughout history, and vegetarianism. ",
            "\u00a0Both my writing and thinking improved as a result of this course. Hearing Professor Im break apart arguments and question readings made me more conscientious about how I read things and approach writing. I began to enjoy the writing process by the end, something I never imagined myself doing. "

            "\u00a0The strength of English 114 lies in the fact that it not only teaches students to read and write academic papers but gives them the opportunity to receive lots of feedback on writing. I believe that the main weakness is that the course does not teach students how to write on the sentence level. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was an awesome course. One strength was the material. I though it was super interesting. There werent many weaknesses but having the writing tutor give his talk earlier in the year would have been helpful. ",
            "\u00a0- the organizations of the seminar classes was helpful and engaging it allowed for lively discussion and deeper understanding of the texts we were analyzing \r\n- feedback on essays was very in depth and illuminating, and office hours was also very helpful \r\n- I think for the final draft we could have collectively used a period or time of final proofreads, or stricter deadlines at the beginning \r\n- other than that the course was helpful and fun ",
            "\u00a0I loved how we were forced to submit fought drafts and then had the opportunity to meet with our Professor to improve our final draft. I loved my teacher - she was incredibly engaged and helpful. The registration process for this class was a nightmare; however, this is an issue with all English 114 classes. ",
            "\u00a0This course has a lot of strengths. Since I have no idea what to major in, it was great that this class taught writing skills independently from some other subject. The subject and texts of the course were very interesting. Finally, we had a very tight-knit class and active group chat. I cannot . think of any weaknesses in this course. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the faculty, the engaging texts and the topics that the class is subdivided into. In this way the class is engaging to all students that are taking it. ",
            "\u00a0It teaches you how to write for other English classes, but not for history or science classes. It would be nice if there were classes or parts of the curriculum where students could learn these writing techniques as well. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are probably the second and third module. The first one was a bit lackluster and the readings were at some points too abstract and not as engaging. ",
            "\u00a0The course was overall very engaging; however, some of the readings were very long and required much time to read, which resulted in less time to fully understand and analyze the texts. Also, the first essay was quite challenging because not much instruction was given regarding how to do close readings. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were that the structure (split between readings and writing essays) allowed for growth in both understanding and creating academic writing. The detailed feedback Professor Im gave on each essay (including the drafts) also helped me realize weaknesses in my own writing and how to correct them. ",
            "\u00a0The constant feedback from series of drafts and peer review were essential to improving my writing. The readings fascinated me and often helped me understand how to construct arguments and use certain writing features. Still, there were a few readings that I did not learn much from, but that could have been a failure in my own understanding and lack of concentration when reading. Office hours helped me immensely. The sheer strength of Professor Im as an instructor and a person was the largest benefit to this course. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, especially if they are in talking about food. Seo Hee is an amazing instructor, the readings are interesting, and my writing did improve dramatically over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course because it was a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0This course was definitely intellectually challenging and forces you to work hard. Nevertheless, the teaching of the course material and the feedback on essays is engaging and the classes are incredibly rewarding. Some of the conversations I had in these seminars were fascinating, and I always looked forward to going to this class. Id recommend this if you are willing to be challenged and are excited about having interesting discussions and nerding out about the beauty of writing. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this course. Taking an English 114 during my first semester at Yale has given me the skill set and confidence to pursue other English courses next semester. I strongly recommend this course, and Seo Hee Im is a fantastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. I improved my writings skills and enjoyed reading the texts. Class discussions were always engaging. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would. This course helped me improve my writing while achieving a greater appreciation for literature. Also, the teacher was always available and open to helping with any questions. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Even if the texts are at times not very engaging, the class discussions and feedback that is given on essays are valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think that this is a great course to take. The course helps to develop one's reading and writing skills while also focusing on an interesting series of topics (each section has a different set of topics, so pick based on one that is interesting to you). Receiving personalized feedback on your writing, as well as reading the various selections for the course, helps you develop an effective writing style. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course. The selection of readings, feedback, and discussion under Professor Im was unparalleled to any other English class I have ever taken. "
