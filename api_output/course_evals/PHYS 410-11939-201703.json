            "\u00a0Lagrangian mechanics and most aspects of advanced classical mechanics were taught and explained well. The class taught us how to solve certain types of problems. It also taught us another way of formulating classical mechanics; a tool that is invaluable for any physicist. ",
            "\u00a0This class takes an extended look at a number of topics and techniques in classical mechanics such as the Euler-Lagrange equation, Hamiltonian mechanics, the central force problem, non-inertial reference frames, the moment of inertia tensor, and harmonic oscillators. ",

            "\u00a0Prof. Harris is a great lecturer. Perhaps it's just because of the smooth timbre of his voice, but listening to him is calming, and everything in class just felt very well explained. Taking 410 expanded my knowledge of classical mechanics, and I feel like I'm beginning to understand the mathematical framework of physics. Once you take 410, you'll feel a much deeper appreciation for physics.\r\n\r\nThe only weakness of this course was the pset grading. Psets often had zero comments on them, each problem was simply graded out of five, and the grader was even snarky. ",
            "\u00a0The breadth of material covered was extensive and many important concepts were covered. ",
            "\u00a0This course was an immense intellectual pleasure for me. The one improvement I would suggest is for slightly more thorough feedback on the psets: sometimes I received back papers below a full score but with no comments to indicate what I did incorrectly! ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are fantastic because Jack Harris is incredible at drawing, illustrating and explaining these at times heady concepts. ",
            "\u00a0Problem sets were very fun, but took a while, lectures were good but seemed a bit overprepared. Material covered was fascinating. Problem set grading was unclear and had no comments ",
            "\u00a0Professor Harris' lectures are the highlight of this course. He expresses the concepts clearly, and you never feel lost or out-of-the-loop during class. The psets are fair, and the exams only cover whatever is on the psets, so you won't ever be surprised by anything on the midterm or final. One weakness of the class is that there's not that many questions on the psets, midterm, or final, so if you screw something up or forget something, then prepare for a decent chunk of your grade gone. ",
            "\u00a0I genuinely can not think of a weakness of this course. The material is interesting, Professor Harris was incredible, and the problem sets are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Good course, straightforward. At times a bit discontinuous, since it moves erratically around chapters of Taylor's book (it felt sometimes we jumped from one topic to another completely unrelated one). All the material is interesting, though. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were interesting and the order of material was well and clearly presented. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course covers all the necessary topics in order to move on to higher level subjects. At the moment, I don't believe that this course is missing anything. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was very strong.  It was one of my favorite courses.  I learned a lot, and thought the problem sets were challenging but doable and really helped me to understand the material. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent, well prepared lectures by Professor Harris. Mostly engaging problem sets. Weakness might have been the rather poor feedback we received from the TA, as well as perhaps the pacing between the course before the midterm and after. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well-taught and well-organized. I think one weakness of the course was that the grading seemed somewhat subjective on Problem Sets, and I think one way to improve the course would be to have some additional resource posted on canvas for students to access if they are absent during a lecture (perhaps scans of the notes or summary of relevant topics covered). ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were very clear & illuminated; the problem sets were certainly challenging but I never felt like I was drowning. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were good and got material across well and the psets and exams were fair, given the lectures. I really likes the system in my maths class where there were required reading and quizzes before each class to make sure you were keeping up with textbook reading, as it is hard to self motivated to do this. ",
            "\u00a0This class is really good; it would be better if the TA can be a little more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is overall quite good, and the lectures are especially good. The problem sets are nice and short, but they often involve tough problems that need some explanation. Usually this would be handled by the TA, but the TA would not look at the questions before his help sessions, so they were essentially useless. So, there definitely needs to be better communication between the professor and the TA. It would also be nice if the professor held office hours at set times. "

            "\u00a0If you're a physics student, absolutely, you will not regret this class. It's tough as heck, but you will feel glad for having taken it. ",
            "\u00a0I cannot recommend this course enough. Professor Harris is an incredible lecturer and you'll learn so much about Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics and central forces. The treatment of oscillators is more superficial but still very interesting! The workload is very manageable, though the TAs generally expect substantial rigor in the pset derivations. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely, fascinating material and great problems, helps you think about physics ",
            "\u00a0I took this class for the math B.S., while most of the other people in the class were physics majors. I was expecting more interesting material, although I'm not sure that's something that can really be fixed given the subject. I expect there are probably better classes at the school if you need those 400-level sciences like I do. Jack Harris is a very middle-of-the-road lecturer  clear but hardly inspiring. His lecturing is certainly not confusing and definitely didn't impede my understanding of the material, but his presentation is rather unenthusiastic and his responses to student questions were fairly lackluster. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course if you are interested in physics. Jack Harris is a fantastic professor. His lectures were coherent and well thought out, leading to interesting and rewarding classes. It's difficult to think of classical mechanics as particularly exciting subject matter, but professor Harris made it seem worthwhile and relevant to the more exciting physics topics, like quantum, GR, etc. Additionally, I've never seen a professor answer questions as well as professor Harris did; his responses were relevant, insightful, and, most of all, incredibly helpful to all the students in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to actually learn physics and hated the introductory courses. 410 finally uses the proper level of math needed to understand the deeper truths behind what you've learned your whole life in physics. It's really not that big of a jump from 200/201, as long as you have the math in your arsenal (linear algebra, multivariable calculus, differential equations). 410 is actually a fun class and I enjoyed going to lecture. ",
            "\u00a0If you are planning on doing the intensive physics major, this course is a perfect introduction to higher level mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0A good mechanics course. Jack Harris is a clear lecturer and writes interesting questions. Exams are straightforward. The course involves a long dive into Lagrangian mechanics, a bit on the Hamiltonian, and then topics on planetary motion, Newton's equations in accelerating frames, rotational motion, damped and driven oscillation. Two nice applications of linear algebra: the moment of inertia tensor for rotating bodies, and normal modes (what happens when a bunch of objects are tied together with a bunch of springs?). ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take classical mechanics (and you have to in order to get a physics degree) take this class instead of 401. The material is interesting but not groundbreaking. It lays a good foundation after taking an introductory physics class.  The textbook is great so if you feel you're comfortable with all material in Taylor Classical Mechanics you can skip this class and move on to harder things. ",
            "\u00a0Although it is a very hard course, the material is interesting and the psets stimulating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in studying physics. It is an important base layer to any higher level understanding of the subject. ",
            "\u00a0If you are thinking, \"Why should I take another mechanics course after all those years of mechanics?\" this course will make you realize you don't know anything about classical mechanics. Starting with the seemingly simple proof of a shortest path in a given space, Jack will guide you through the world of Lagrangian Mechanics and leave you at the brink of Quantum Mechanics. The last lecture will make you realize the relevance of Classical mechanics to the world of Quantum. Must take for the intensive majors, but I would recommend it to anyone interested in mechanics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to gain a deeper understanding of Physics. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course, especially after a less than great experience in 260/261, was a good experience. Prof Harris does a great job with lectures, especially with motivating why certain steps are important and how things fit into larger structures (though more of this would always be welcome!) The PSETs are reasonable but rather time consuming. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to Physics majors, as it does give you a deep understanding of classical mechanics. But I wouldn't recommend it to someone just looking for a science credit. ",
            "\u00a0A much more mathematically sophisticated treatment of physics than is offered in the 200/201 sequence. Exams were fair, though still challenging. Infinitely better than 400/401 track (from what I've heard). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a really comprehensive way to do mechanics ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in physics. ",
            "\u00a0If you're considering this course, it is probably worth it just for Professor Harris' lectures; they are very good and quite interesting. That being said, the rest of the course is just alright. It seems that Harris shows great interest in physics pedagogy and the structure/understanding of physics as a field; however, he shows much less interest in actually crafting problem sets and communicating with the TA in ways that would best facilitate learning physics in a classroom setting. \r\n\r\nThe problem sets are short, but they often involve some ambiguities and hard problems that one would usually get help with from the TA. However, the TA in this course refused to look at the problems before his sessions, and thus was quite unhelpful. He also was incredibly picky about grading. \r\n\r\nOverall though, the lectures are a great overview of the unifying ideas in physics and specifically classical mechanics, and thus is probably worth it.
