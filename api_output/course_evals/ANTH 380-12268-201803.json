            "\u00a0I learned about how cultural and linguistic evolution can be studied using the evolutionary processes of biological evolution. This included some qualitative and some quantitative methods, which were conducted in R. This class for sure should not be a writing credit, because half of the work is coding class time isn't focused on improving your writing. Also, this class isn't an introduction to R. You only use specific evolutionary packages, and instead of learning how to harness the language to do what you need, you just spend a lot of time copying and pasting example code from class without needing to know how it actually works. ",
            "\u00a0We focused a lot on computational techniques to analyze linguistic history and evolution. It was a significantly more technical focus than I expected going in, but the final paper gave us a good opportunity to put these skills to use. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how phylogenetic techniques can be applied to study language and culture evolution. Learned how languages and cultures can be coded. Learned a little bit of R and some other things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to code a tree in R. I also learned a little bit about language trees and the ways languages spread. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about how to understand phylogenetic relationships and a little bit about the methods involved in how people get data and code it to construct such relationships, but there was so much more potential to the class that was never realized because the content was beyond the background we were told we needed and the teaching and readings were impenetrable at times. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about using Darwinian models of evolution on cultural and language change, and also how culture is transmitted across peoples. That was the first 2-3 weeks or so, and it lost me from there. Everything else was highly technical, and related to modeling tree-like evolution through R, running analyses on the computer, etc. and other things that one with no computer science or statistics background might find really confusing. There was one week where we learned about the evolution of color terms which was interesting though. ",
            "\u00a0Linguistic analysis skills. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me learn about coding. I'm not a CS major, so I had not coded a lot before this course. The level of coding in this course was pretty much at the level I could handle while still pushing me. "

            "\u00a0This course is a good introduction into linguistic evolutionary methods, but I don't quite understand why cultural methods were also grouped into it. Professor Bowern is an amazing linguist, and I learned a lot about linguistics through this course, but the cultural methods seemed like an afterthought, and not at all related to her research. Additionally, I wish that I had learned more about R. I had hoped to get an introduction to the language, but instead we just had to scramble and figure out how to use specific packages that we needed. I think this course should reevaluated and changed to either be a quantitative course with coding and stats prerequisites, or a qualitative course teaching general concepts for a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0This course seemed to be in a transition semester as its popularity grows. Claire Bowern is fantastic, really knowledgable and friendly and helpful in-person -- I recommend her wholeheartedly. The class itself was a bit up and down, and seemed to suffer from a bit of an identity crisis. We started off in  more of a Yale Seminar format, holding discussions over readings, but pivoted around to a mixture of lectures and in-class activities. Everything became a little bit hard to follow, and the readings became extremely dry and technical. The material was a lot more interesting when we got to see it applied to the concepts we'd discussed -- in a vacuum, they're not that fun to learn about. This made the final presentations and the final paper a lot more engaging than what came before. I think this class has a lot of potential, and this is a bit of an unconventional topic so Prof. Bowern has few resources to draw upon, but it could stand to use more focus and structure. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bowern is incredibly smart, but the main cool concepts you take away from the course could be taught in a one or two hour workshop/seminar. The entire semester is a giant mess of a web of confusing and devastatingly poorly taught statistical and coding concepts, and rarely do you talk about ideas pertaining to culture and language or even evolution. This is a very technical course for someone needing the statistical and coding tools for creating language trees. You dont even learn real coding, just how to plug and chug and many frustrations come from not being able to resolve the bugs in the code. Again, I am very grateful for the large concepts and takeaways but a semester of excruciatingly painfully boring and confusing lectures are just not worth it. You could get the same take aways from a couple of thoughtfully planned workshops. When it comes down to it, even a statistical and technical linguistic phylogeny course relating to evolution of language and culture could be made fun or at least bearable if Professor Bowern were a better teacher, but in a sad turn of events, the thought and concern for student understanding and interest was at some point chucked out the window. This class could be made way more accessible to people through giving case examples and teaching cultural/linguistic evolution cases rather than trying to teach whatever was taught this past semester. The best part of the course was honestly hearing my peers final presentations. But yeah please think hard about taking this course. And then think about it again. And think about why you are at this university. And remember the thousands of wonderful courses offered here. Ive taken risks with random, difficult classes that I had no prior background in during my time at Yale before and Im really all for it, but this is just not a class you should do this in. Not even because youll get a bad grade (I think everyone did fine) but just because youll be frustrated and annoyed and will start to respect yourself a little less every time you come to class or do an assignment. ",
            "\u00a0The course fell behind really quickly, so the readings became irrelevant to class conversation. Also, there was a disconnect between what people learned and what was expected of us to know. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of technical background that we were told we didn't need, but in reality it was extremely difficult to understand a lot of this content. The readings were incredibly dense and hardly addressed in the lectures, which themselves were equally difficult to follow. The classes were also rather disorganized and it was difficult to follow even a general thread or theme of what was happening in the course. I did not feel like there was enough structure or support for those who did not have a statistics/linguistics background. Many students simply got lost and felt that the content went far over their heads, no matter how much they tried to engage with the material. The course should only be taken by those who have a good background in probability, statistics or linguistics. ",
            "\u00a0I think the idea behind this course is very ambitious, and it could be done in a much more engaging way. The first week of class we were told that we would all learn R together, and that no coding experience was required. However, we didnt really end up learning R because we were given code to just copy, paste, and replace certain things with our own data. There was a lack of connection between readings and what we did in class, so it was difficult to stay engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great professor who really loves the material and cares about her student's learning.\r\nWeaknesses: the required knowledge for the class is high--I didn't know this going into it and didn't take away much as a result. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course. There was a lot of work at times, but it was manageable, and I got a good introduction to linguistics, including how to use methods that I didn't know existed. ",
            "\u00a0I would say you get out of this course what you put into it. It's probably not worth it as a random writing or social science credit, but if you commit to actually learning the material and doing a good job on your final paper, you could really enjoy this course. I'd shop it and try to feel out how much of a plan Prof. Bowern has for the semester. With more organization and focus, this class could be great. ",
            "\u00a0Please please please spare yourself and dont take this course. That is my take. Ive literally never given a professor (n=~20) a negative review before and typically recognize my own shortcomings in my negative experience of a class, but I don't want to gaslight myself here. I would really recommend against this class. Some people may take it for a writing credit or good grade, but it's not worth the frustration you'll feel. If you're taking this out of interest in language and culture, take a great history lecture or another anthropology seminar or even English 120. If you're taking this as an already budding linguist or statistician, you may find it more helpful or necessary to your work. Still, I believe we're all capable of learning coding and stats when it's taught well which wasn't the case here unfortunately. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who wanted to learn about language families and the spread of languages, but only if they already understood a lot about linguistics and biological evolution and computer science. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting in so far as I liked the final project I worked on, but you will only get something out of it if you already understand a lot of the statistical methods used in these kinds of analyses. This is basically a class in METHODS; you will mainly cover statistical techniques/procedures and research approaches. Do not expect lectures where you learn lots of interesting material. It's more of a \"how to run an MCMC to construct a tree or reconstruct ancestral states.\" This is also NOT a seminar. The class is NOT discussion based. ",
            "\u00a0If you need a writing credit, and have some experience in computer science, statistics, etc. I would recommend it. There isnt that much writing other than the final report (10 pgs). I wouldnt recommend it if you are interested in linguistics or anthropology though, as it is very technical. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a very specific niche of people. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Bowern is one of my favorite professors at Yale. I would recommend any course that she teaches. "
