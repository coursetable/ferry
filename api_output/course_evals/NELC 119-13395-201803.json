            "\u00a0This course is an overview of the Near Eastern empires from the Assyrian Empire to the Sasanian Empire.  We also learned how to analyze primary sources critically and apply the theories of historical sociology to ancient societies.  We also got the opportunity to learn some basic Old and Middle Persian. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about Persia from antiquity all the way to the arab conquest. Mostly, the class focused on the political history, going through the different dynasties and discussing happenings. There was definitely a good mix of cultural and religious discussion as well. Also, fun extra credit assignments that teach you had to read old and middle persian. Its a random skill but the activities are definitely fun and easy "

            "\u00a0strengths: amazing professor, interesting lectures, manageable workload.\r\nweaknesses: a bit disorganized/hard to follow if you don't already have some knowledge of the time period, essay prompts could have been more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures. Great ta. Taught in a very coherent manner and the teacher really cares that the students understand. he is very laid back and open to any questions one might have. "

            "\u00a0Professor van Bladel is amazing.  He is one of the world's leading experts on this time period, and it shows.  The material is mostly interesting, but you should really take this course for Professor van Bladel.  There is a lot of reading, but the class is set up with the expectation that most people don't do all of the reading.  So you get out of it what you put into it.  Also, you will get much more out of this course if you already have some familiarity with Late Antiquity (at least from a Western perspective).  Otherwise, the somewhat spotty historical narrative can be hard to follow.  The optional language exercises (for extra credit) are very fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely. Even if you aren't interested in this stuff, its pretty easy to get an A in this class (a ton of extra credit). If you are at all curious about the middle east or persia or antiquity, this class offers a ton of information. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the subject matter was really interesting and it covers an area of the world that most history classes brush over. Readings are interesting and the extra credit assignments are great: I loved learning old Persian. "
