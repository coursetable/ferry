            "\u00a0This course has some good merits but many flaws. There are certainly interesting lectures. Unfortunately that isn't always the case. Some lecturers are not very good at clearly presenting their information. There are many redundancies between the lectures because there is no communication between the different professors and they repeat information. Additionally, the course sequence is lacking. The chemotherapy lecture was at least a month after the targeted therapies for cancer lecture. This doesn't make any sense. There should be a better structure to it. Additionally, the amount of information presented is too much. Some of the test questions ask for very hyperspecific minutia that are not important to the learning of the fundamentals of the subject. I agree that the specific information should be presented to the students, but it shouldn't be the basis of the grades. ",
            "\u00a0There was a lot of information provided in the course; however, due to the numerous instructors involved, it became difficult to succinctly connect all the material. So overall, though I do felt as though I received a lot from some professors, and little from others, I believe the information was too disjointed to yield a lasting impression. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- \r\nSome lecturers are incredibly engaging and present fascinating work\r\nThe first two lectures were AMAZING and I think need to be expanded as they really delve into the principles of pharmacology which are so important to anyone that wants to do work on the field \r\nYou get exposed to the research of labs at Yale you could potentially do a rotation in\r\nWeaknesses-\r\nSome lecturers were hard to follow and did not even stick to their slides. From the perspective of a student taking preparing for an exam, large presentations with no clear takeaways for the exam cause loss of time studying information the lecturer does not consider necessary- I recommend standardizing an objectives slide or having the TAs communicate with the lecturers and get the gist of the essential knowledge for the exam. \r\nThere was no clear organization between presentations \r\nI think I learned more about exciting new research than pharmacology principles ",
            "\u00a0This course felt unorganized. I do feel as though I learned a lot, and some of the lectures were fascinating, but it is difficult to understand what is expected of students when each lecture is taught by a new faculty member. Also, many faculty members did not give adequate feedback on exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think some professors need some regulations in what they teach us and what they test us on. Some presentations were enormous amounts of information for just a small fraction of it actually on the test. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the dynamic lectures, lots of really good Professors who all had great content. Weakness was the lack of class participation and outside group activities to facilitate a better learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0Having so many teachers is a bit overwhelming. Some professors were a lot better lecturers than others, and some of the professors were very mediocre lecturers. ",
            "\u00a0The course could stand to be more structured -- a little scatterbrained in terms of how lectures were structured and what the order of material taught was ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Lecture material is up to date with current research, for instance cancer immunotherapy.  Lectures cover a broad spectrum of topics. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some professors seemed unprepared while presenting lecture material; lectures were not structured and it was hard to follow the material. As a result, exam preparation required more effort because important concepts were not explained well sometimes.  Grading of exams also seemed unstructured and sometimes absolutely no explanations were given. This lack of feedback was frustrating because I did not know why exactly what I wrote was wrong or inaccurate.   In some instances, after showing my exam to TFs, they were not able to tell me where I made a mistake and my answers looked correct to them, which made me think that grading was not fair. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Leaders in the field presenting work with which they are personally engaged.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: No common thread/themes, disjointed due to constant switching of lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0I would add more molecular mechanisms and include more CNS drugs and renal drugs. ",
            "\u00a0The grades on  many exam questions did not have explanations as to why points were taken off. ",
            "\u00a0Some instructors seemed to lack enthusiasm. Feedback given for exams was sparse and not helpful. Expectations for what we should retain from lectures was unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The amount of information covered, the different professors for each topic, and the mix of students in the course\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There is no general format for the professors. They teach whatever they want with no structure, knowledge of what other lectures have discussed, or background about the class such as time for each lecture, class dynamic, or type of students. Some professor spent the whole lecture discussing details of drugs that have no application to many majors while others took the time doing a general overview of the subject they were assigned with background, general drug mechanisms, and stories (preferred). Many professors came in and gave a lecture that was only understood or applicable to a small amount of the students. Also many subjects or drugs were talked about in multiple lectures, making it hard to remember which professor wanted which information on the exam. I think each professor should be given background information about the class dynamics (grad school year and majors) and be given a brief structure to follow. Also the tests were very poorly set up. The rooms were always set up last minute and there was not enough room for us each to comfortably take the exam. The teachers should also be given an approximate time their question should take the student. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: It is nice having a different professor for each topic, because it ensures that the professor is interested in that particular topic and it keeps the class interesting because the professor wants to teach. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some professors have way too many slides and are often rushing toward the end and not covering the later material as well. For our exams, some professors cut off points but did not give comments or mark anything incorrect; consequently it was difficult to see where one had gone wrong. ",

However, the structure of the course and the lack of organization on the part of some of the professors made it much less engaging than it could be. Therefore, I would only recommend it to people who are extremely interested in pharmacology. ",

If every professor chosen would take the time to design a well thought out lecture with background, important, mechanisms and application of their specific subject, it would be incredible. The chance to take a class with this many subjects and possible connections with speakers is not one to pass up, but its poor design made me disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the course. It was interesting and covered a wide range of topics. ",
