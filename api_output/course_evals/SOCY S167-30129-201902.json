            "\u00a0I learned the basic construction of a social networks theory (both formalist and relationalist approaches) and adapted to use micro social structures to answer questions about macro social norms and trends. ",
            "\u00a0Ive developed the basic understanding of social network analysis. So far as I know, this is a relatively new subject within the theme of sociology. Hence, by reading the articles provided by Mustafa as the required readings, I am able to discover different areas within the social network analysis, which consists of theories, practical utilizations, categorical partitions, and even visualization software. Even though the course schedule is intense that all knowledge is taught in a relatively short period, Mustafa is able to think of us and how the thinking processes we have regarding the insights we have about the syllabus and readings. As a high school student, this also enables me to experience how a college-level seminar course is and immerse myself to the academic commitment ensured in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Social network analysis and a sociological world view. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge about how to understand societies in a more quantitative way. I also start to appreciate more formalism perspective to view the society. ",
            "\u00a0I practiced group discussion skills, reading skills, and learned many interesting concepts about social networks. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt many basic concepts in sociology and learnt to use Gephi to construct and analyze my own network. ",
            "\u00a0the use of software Gephi to analyze the social networks\r\nhow social networks affect some social issues such as health, people's preferences and choices, politics and culture.\r\nhomophily, the measure of centrality, echo chamber, etc. "

            "\u00a0Strength: the instructor provided readings across different fields to give us an introduction of how social networks are related to societal trends.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: as a significant portion of our students are in high school and are hence new to sociology, the instructor can do a better job of reducing the complexity of the readings to take care of all students. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: There are various aspects of social networks covered and they are very comprehensive, which consider both theoretical and practical understanding. The pedagogy Mustafa used is highly suitable for me to integrate the knowledge to a real-world case. There are reasonable amount of readings, which must be considered delicately by Mustafa and the readings carry different information to us. Every day we learn different knowledge about social networks, which shows us a vigorous process of learning and developing. \r\nWeakness: Mustafa has been respecting our opinions through the whole session, which is a double-sided effect. If some suggestions can be made, I would recommend him to form a more solid or must-achieved goals for every course. He does not have to always follow our willingness or in other words, he can put more expectations to the course processing. For example, if there are some bullet points under the theme of theorization of social networks, he can definitely reach these bullet points first instead of just focusing on the questions we had regarding the readings. Im not sure if this can be counted as a weakness of the course, but more likely, I would characterize it as a double-sided effect of Mustafas pedagogy. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths: The course is well-organised for learning, specially the choosing of the course materials. It allows students to learn about the social network analysis from a easy starting point and graudually make it an in-depth introduction.\r\nNo weaknesses for me hahaha. I enjoyed the course a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Some of the concepts it discussed are a bit too philosophical for me. It is hard to understand all these concepts fully and be able to apply them more creatively given the limited time for Sumer session. If there are more time and more specific examples, it will be easier to understand and use the concepts. ",
            "\u00a0strength: there are a lot of group discussions\r\nbut sometimes there is nobody speaking in the class. Some adjustments can be made to cheer students up, instead of letting the class be quiet. ",
            "\u00a0strength: this course gave me an exposure to social networks which is very useful in daily life. \r\nweakness: the workload of the reading is heavy and it is hard for students without a social network analysis foundation to understand some logic behind. "

            "\u00a0Yes. It provides a well-founded introduction to sociology. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student whos interested in sociology. This course can help the students with interest in sociology to have an idea about how sociologists life is. Some sociological terms will be integrated into the course to prepare them for future study. Also, as this is a seminar class, the limited capacity of this course allowed the students to have effective communications with Mustafa and can receive the most personalized help from Mustafa. Instructor is nice, course contents are inspiring, group cohesiveness is strong within the whole class, why not recommend then? ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Powerful and inspiring methodologies. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who wants to establish a more systematic view of what social network analysis looks like. It is a good class that helps explain and layout the concepts more systematically and it will definitely help students who want to focus on social network analysis and students who are pursuing other paths because it allows the students to use the knowledge they gained in class creatively in various areas even if they are not in the field of social network analysis. ",
            "\u00a0yes. The course touches upon many famous essays and concepts in sociology. ",
