            "\u00a0I learned a lot about all aspects of the tree of life, as well as some (very) introductory ways of collecting data in the E&EB fields. This was my first class under this department, so I loved being able to be exposed to introductory material across a wide spectrum of topics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the diversity of life on earth! ",
            "\u00a0I learned how the Tree of Life provides a model for conceptualizing evolution. Specifically, we start with the simplest organisms, bacteria, protists, and continue through invertebrates, fishes, birds, and mammals and higher and lower plants. We devote one week to each of these. I learned important things about the increasing complexity of life and gained a fuller appreciation for Earth's biodiversity. "

        [
            "\u00a0Professor Wells is definitely what makes this class so great. She is so, so passionate about the material, and is truly there to facilitate your learning. The tree (Yale Nature Walk) project was also really fun. You get a lot of hands-on activity with all the parts of the tree of life that you learn about (I think the classes in the greenhouses were my favorite). There's also a lab where you get to try so many exotic fruits! I think the only way it could be improved would be a little more structure on some of the assignments like the lab notebook. Otherwise, by far my favorite lab at Yale so far! ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught by a wonderful and caring team of TAs and Marta!!! Every week was really interesting and fun. Some cool field work and dissections. One thing I would say is that sometimes the work expected of us in a single 4 hour lab was way too much (ex: a lab with 12 stations and multiple questions at each station). Write-ups were okay, but are time consuming. Should be a writing credit course. ",
            "\u00a0Great showcase of diversity of life on earth. Quizzes were a good alternative to exams, though some of the lab reports were a little long. TAs were great and very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course was engaging, not stressful, and well organized. I would recommend this course with no changes. If you put your mind to it, you will learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0This course is amazing, Marta is the absolute best. I honestly have no weaknesses that I noticed because Marta does this course perfectly. "

        [
            "\u00a0Take this class! It's a great bio lab (for all you pre-meds out there) and is a great way to be able to fulfill this requirement, but also get outside of the MCDB department for a little. Professor Wells is amazing, and you will definitely not regret at least shopping the class. It's overall a pretty chill class. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, over all other labs. Marta Wells is an absolutely amazing professor who is incredibly passionate about the class and a joy to be around. The class itself is the opposite of the typical drag of a bio lab with engaging assignments that typically don't take all class period (dissections, exploring the botanical gardens, assessing animal anatomy) and unique activities (our collaboration with the Yale Nature Walk, an AMAZING fruit feast, stream exploration) that demonstrated the commitment of the educators to the topic and their students and made it one of the most memorable classes I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is an incredible way to spend time outside, meet Marta, who is awesome, and learn to take a breath and enjoy biology. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great lab for anyone interested in biology. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in life on Earth. The content is fun and understandable. The lab reports do take some time, but they help learning and are not challenging to complete properly. Take this course to learn interesting things that you didn't expect about plants and animals while checking out exhibits from the Peabody, eating exotic fruits, and collecting samples from a local stream! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I have already recommended it to many people. Marta's passion gets the entire class involved and interested, so I tell anyone who likes science that they should take it. "
