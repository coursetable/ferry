            "\u00a0I really like how lectures were recorded, it was really helpful in reviewing for the final. I also think that the quizzes were a good way to keep up with the material. A suggestion I would make is to provide more insight in regard to the final and what to study. I felt that there was so much covered in class, that something like an outline of topics to prepare for would have provided more direction.  I also think this class could benefit from a section, where we could review the information learned in lecture in a smaller setting. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quiz structure, while an attempt to fix the Midterm issue of previous years, was quite annoying. Instead of a regular problem set, this was an open note, online quiz, which would have been fine except that you need to block out a 3 hour period of time because once you start the quiz, there's no way to pause it. \r\nI didn't mind the weekly \"Pset,\" but the stressful time constraints of finding that weekly 3 hour chunk was quite difficult. \r\n\r\nThe final's structure and questions didn't reflect what Professor McCarthy recommended the class study in preparation for it. The questions were obscure, poorly worded, and placed a large emphasis on hyper-specific neural regions, which was not something we were told to focus on in our studying. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths in the clarity of lectures and quantity of information you can learn in just a semester. I took this for the Sc credit as a humanities major, and was impressed by how engaging the lectures were throughout the semester. Because there are just quizzes (aka 3 hours of work once a week), the course never felt like a burden, but  it definitely sustained my attention. Professor McCarthy is a pro at the material and you can tell that he keeps the class updated with new research. The amount of reference info in the notes and textbook were perfect. For weaknesses, this class could probably have an optional section available. Quiz comments were often unclear and unhelpful, so seeing an answer key or rubric would have been nice. Not having a practice exam available during reading period was annoying, since it was so unclear how the open-book quizzes would translate into exam questions. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: lots of resources/ information available\r\n\r\nweakness: quizzes, although nice during the semester, didn't create incentive to commit material to memory ",
            "\u00a0Class covered a lot of material on many different topics! A very good introductory course to the brain and how it works. Goes over a different topic each lecture, and spends two lectures on the more important topics, allowing for a more detailed understanding. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: the material is very interesting and engaging if you are interested in the human brain and Prof. Mccarthy is a good lecturer\r\nWeaknesses: The sheer volume of information you need to know for the cumulative final is an incredible amount. I think having midterms would be better than weekly open book quizzes. I also think this class would really benefit from having sections. Another weakness this semester was that the feedback on these weekly quizzes was not very useful. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the switch in format from the midterms+final to weekly quizzes+final. I think having the weekly quiz was really helpful in reinforcing/learning what we had just covered in lecture. The final was just really nitpick-y and required a ridiculous amount of attention to detail, way more than I think is necessarily to show a good grasp on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Teaching us the fundamentals of the brain\r\n\r\nWeakness: In terms of grading, the weekly quizzes did very little for my learning. I would prefer a midterm and a final, as the midterm would give an indication as to how the final would look. Because we did not have a midterm, the final looked extremely foreign to me and negatively impacted my grade. ",
            "\u00a0This course was super interesting and I appreciated all the support- taped lectures, online notes, weekly review sessions etc.  The material was engaging and fun to learn.  I thought a more complete rundown of each main brain part, its location and its function would have been helpful rather than just learning different things about the hippocampus in different units.  I thought the quizzes were a great way of reviewing the material and were less stressful than midterms.  However, they were still hard and I definitely did not get perfect scores. ",
            "\u00a0I hope Professor McCarthy will take this criticism into consideration as he designs the course for further iterations. The online quizzes had a good meaning--allowing for one to engage with the material in a low stress way that could be tested and assessed. A flaw was that the grading wasn't transparent and the answer keys unreleased because of some weird personal philosophy of the professor. Whatever, Fine.The final was beyond cruel. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciated Professor McCarthy's clarity and the degree to which he made the course's resources accessible. This course used technology well; I definitely think one of the course's strengths was how he made all of the lecture slides, notes (with links to other interesting/relevant articles) and the lecture videos themselves available online. I definitely referenced them a lot when doing the weekly quizzes and preparing for the exam, and I appreciated being able to review material at my own pace. Piazza also was a great asset for clearing up confusion and expressing curiosity; Professor McCarthy would review the literature on whatever topic a student expressed interest in, which was awesome.\r\n\r\nDefinitely one of the course's biggest strengths was its primary use of case studies, consistent with how a great deal of neuroscientific knowledge comes from lesion studies. You couldn't replicate this class by just reading the textbook, especially because the field is changing so quickly-- and Professor McCarthy gave us the tools to evaluate knowledge as contextual rather than absolute.\r\n\r\nI also liked the weekly quizzes, which made up 70% of our grade. They focus the class on consistent learning rather than one high-stakes performance assessment. And because they were open-note, if you committed to a few draining hours every week to be super thorough, you could feel confident in a decent end grade. Often during them I felt skeptical that I was really learning, as I basically reformulated the lecture notes, but when rereading the quiz questions cold to prepare for the final, I surprised myself with how much I had internalized and remembered.\r\n\r\nAs for weaknesses, there wasn't much of a culture of asking questions in class. Though a great learning experience, it was also definitely an anonymous one; I didn't have to actually interact with other students, the teaching fellows, or the professor to do well in the course, which some might think is a weakness. Perhaps the role of the teaching fellows could be made more clear. ",
            "\u00a0This class was relatively low-stress until reading week (when it became a huge commitment). Throughout the semester, open-notes quizzes gave a general idea of the way we would be evaluated. In addition, class engagement was entirely up to you, since Prof. McCarthy posts lecture slides, talking points, and videos. I also personally find Prof. McCarthy engaging and the material fascinating. The class's weakness was the final -- while there were review sessions, there was no indication of what might be on the test and rather the general instruction to \"know everything.\" Considering the volume of information covered, this was nearly impossible and induced a lot of stress and barred me from studying for some of my other exams until the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0In the short-term, the quizzes were a strength because one got to learn the material without the stress associated with preparing for a midterm. Long-term, however, the quizzes were a huge weakness. Although Professor McCarthy tried to alleviate anxiety by giving us quizzes, the quizzes were of no help when taking the final exam, as most of the questions asked on the final were nothing like quiz questions. The quizzes were also graded pretty harshly, so that, in itself, was discouraging in the hopes to perform well in the course. In addition, we were essentially left in the dark about the overall format and of the final, which was also discouraging and could have been circumvented if we were given midterms. Thus, although Professor McCarthy had good intentions in switching to quizzes, they, in my opinion, were not an effective change to the format of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great introductory course, difficult because of how broad the course was. IT covered a very wide range of topics in great detail. But taught well nonetheless ",
            "\u00a0Having the weekly quizzes was useful, but it also made the final exam content more of a mystery because I didn't know what would be emphasized or what the format or style of questions would be going into the final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was great. He knew his material, he was organized, he was dependable, and he cared about his students.\r\n\r\nThere was just too much stuff on each lecture. it was difficult to gauge what needed to be known for the Final exam based on the quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0So. Much. Material. And there was no way to tell how in-depth your knowledge was going to be tested on the final, which ended up being hell.\r\nMcCarthy is a great lecturer though and I always enjoyed attending.\r\nThe TFs were often way too picky and kind of condescending in their grading, however, which was discouraging. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized. Our textbook is helpful, and Prof McCarthy posted lecture videos, lecture slides, and thorough written notes. All the information is available to us! \r\nWeekly open-book quizzes kept me on top of the information, but ultimately, I didn't really memorize anything until the week before the final exam... which was extremely challenging! ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this class was that the lecture recordings, notes, and slides were all posted online. Since the class was at 1pm (right after lunch!!) I was always far too sleepy to pay attention in class. However, because the lecture recordings were posted online, I could watch them on my own time. One weakness of this class was that the online, take-home quizzes made it easy to not stay completely on top of things before the final, so the cumulative final was crazy stressful. I actually think I would have preferred two midterms, and a final (cumulative or not). ",
            "\u00a0i liked the weekly quizzes. I would have hated having 2 midterms and a final. However, there is just soooooo much information. Possibly in addition to these quizzes, have one midterm and then one final non cumulative. That way, students don't die when studying for this. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very interesting but i feel like there was a lot of information and the class could have been challenging if i did not have prior neuroscience information. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the weekly quizzes are a big strength of the course, because they allowed students to solidify their understanding of all the information presented that week before moving on to new material. I've talked to people who took the course in previous semesters, in which the only grades came from big exams, and it seems that the manner in which the course was taught this semester is much more effective. I think that one weakness is that having only one exam, the final exam, does put a lot of pressure on that one exam, and it would thus be useful to receive more information about the format of the exam leading up to it and to have a practice exam. The exam this semester seemed to have a massively greater focus on anatomy, both of knowing the exact anatomical locations of brain structures and on anatomical labeling, than was conveyed during the semester. While the quizzes occasionally had a labeling question, anatomy was generally not greatly emphasized. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely difficult. I think that it could be improved by incorporating more assignments during the semester in order to assess understanding in preparation for the course. Another alternative could be teaching less material over the course of the one semester so that digestion of all of the material is more feasible. ",
            "\u00a0Although this was the first semester the quizzes were used instead of exams, I feel like they would've been more effective if they were somehow closed-note or taken in class. ",
            "\u00a0We learn a lot of very interesting information during this course. The weekly quizes were time-consuming and did not prepare us adequately for the final exam. We had no real practice of anatomy or what was expected. ",
            "\u00a0There was so much material to learn! It was actually so insane how much there was... I thought the lectures were very interesting, but it was hard to keep up. I just thought that we were expected to know a lot of details that were difficult to understand. The quizzes were okay for me to help learn the material, but the TFs took off so many little points!! I also thought that it was very stressful to have one big final exam at the end, without having had any other exams. I didn't really know what to expect going into it, and I wasn't sure how to study since there is so much material. I would say that maybe having 3 non-cumulative exams would have made me feel less stressed, and would have helped me learn the material better instead of having open-notes quizzes, which didn't help me learn the material that well, and having one huge exam at the end, which I crammed for. Also, the professor talked so much about stress and the importance of sleep in the last few weeks, but I'm sure the majority of students in the class were very stressed (i was) and suffered from lack of sleep (i did) going into the final, which is not good!!! Scared to look at my grade in this class :( ",
            "\u00a0I think that some sort of work outside of the weekly quizzes would be helpful. I listened to the lectures and completed the quizzes, but found studying for the final extremely difficult: I had not made the connections between lectures throughout the semester. If we had monthly quizzes on certain functions or brain regions, I think I would have been able to learn the material better. ",
            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes on canvas were really helpful in reducing stress throughout the semester and they forced you to analyze what you had learned the previous week. The final exam was extremely challenging because there was SO much information you had to know and we didn't really have any idea of the type of questions we would be asked because there was no practice exam or midterms to practice on. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was great. However, as a grad student, it was hard to make time to attend any of review session. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The weekly quiz structure was extremely useful. I also thought that Prof. McCarthy did an excellent job as a lecturer and also in making all of the material available for students.\r\nWeaknesses: It was extremely hard. TA grading on quizzes varied which was frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: lots of interesting content\r\n\r\nweaknesses: So many minute details that the overall content being interesting becomes irrelevant. It becomes very disheartening to continue working, because it feels like there's no correlation between work and success. ",
            "\u00a0I think the weekly quizzes were a great idea and a good replacement for a midterm, but both the questions and grading for these quizzes seemed to get unfairly harder as the semester went on, and even the slightest loss of points meant a pretty significant drop in quiz average (70% of your grade). The final was also way too specific to which part of the brain does what instead of more broad understandings of topics covered in the class and was generally really challenging to study for (due to unclear expectations for it). ",
            "\u00a0I think it left it up to the student to force him or herself to pay attention and stay committed, and while some may like this I found that it really didn't work for me. ",
            "\u00a0The course was interesting but should not be advertised as an introductory course. Aside from the fact that there was way too much information shoved into one semester, the themes seemed to lack cohesion (other than the fact that they all had something to do with the brain). For these reasons, the videotapes were my saving grace; they allowed me to slowly go over the large amounts of content in each lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of material about a very complicated subject: the brain. The course brings in some of the latest research and findings in neuroscience and psychology. The course could perhaps be slightly more organized. The challenge of this course is to memorize a dense amount of information. ",
            "\u00a0Professor McCarthy's lectures are generally easy to follow, and the posting slides and notes was extremely helpful when studying both for the weekly quizzes and even more so for the final. The weekly quizzes are graded pretty strictly, so it's important to make sure every detail is spelled out explicitly when answering questions.\r\n\r\nSomething that this course is missing is a high-level overview of everything discussed, and the overall structure/direction of the course is a bit scattered. Different brain regions are referred to over and over again for different functions in different lectures, so by the end it's hard to keep track of what the various functions of each region are.

And the quizzes (each 10 points) count for 70% of our grade, so you end up losing a significant portion of your grade not because you don't understand the material but because the TFs are so nitpicky with unnecessary details in your answers.

I would say the greatest strength of this course is the many resources it provides! From the lecture videos, to Piazza, to the office hours, overall there are many ways to succeed in this class as long as you take advantage of the resources. ",

The downside, however, is that this course is often so overwhelming and the TA's, who this time around only graded the take home quizzes, were unhelpful and gave poor feedback. The weekly quizzes were fine and gave an opportunity to do well in the course, however you generally learn nothing from doing them as you are allowed to look at notes, the textbook, the lectures etc when you're  doing them. This became a serious issue when studying for the final exam, which was quite simply the most stressful experience I've ever had to deal with in an academic sense. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the weekly quizzes had the potential to be effective but in practice relied too heavily on Professor McCarthy's notes. The quizzes would have been too difficult based solely on lectures without the accompanying notes, but were slightly too easily with access to the notes.

Prof. McCarthy is a role model for all organized teachers. I highly appreciate his lecture slides, notes, recordings, and extra review sessions. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that could be improved is our exposure to closed-book assignments. The fact that the final was the first closed-book assignment we had all semester was very disconcerting. I think it would be better to have both the weekly open-book quizzes and a closed-book midterm in addition to the closed-book final. ",

Both I and many other students found that it was nearly impossible to suddenly memorize the whole course at the end of the semester, even if we had gone to every lecture, done every reading, understood everything along the way, and gotten good grades on the weekly quizzes. In other words, the class was entirely understanding-based until the last second, when suddenly 30% of our grade was memorization-based. ",

An additional weakness was that none of the grading was done by the instructor, and that the level of detail required by weekly quizzes often felt haphazard, with the TAs leaving short and sometimes rude comments without noting how the mistakes could've been bettered. ",

Even as humanities major, it felt relevant, important, and applicable to know something about the neurological basis for cognitive processes like decision-making, memory, and empathy.

            "\u00a0No. There are too many flaws. It NEEDS a redesign before it is ever considered recommendable by me.   I feel this course suffers because of the lack of accessibility which is funny given Professor McCarthy's claims that this is an approachable class for everyone (even the non STEM folks!) If I were to try and make an analogy for this course, it felt like you are told to run every day for a month-but only a mile, with many rests and water breaks every time you do it--manageable! Then, after the weeks of running just one mile a day, you are told to run a complete marathon nonstop with no breaks (though you should be well prepared because you've run \"every day\" this month! It shouldn't be a problem.) But you keel over in the second mile and then you're awake in the hospital wondering what happened and then you remember that The Human Brain final exam was one of the most unnecessarily stressful and difficult exams. I would encourage Professor McCarthy to understand that the material is DENSE. And the lack of clear communication of what is or isn't important to know is cumbersome. The brain is difficult, I get it. So much research is still ongoing and we don't know all there is. But this course often feels like you have to know every neurotransmitter, sucli and lobe in order to even get a D. It's a horrendously designed course. I'd encourage having a look at other courses like MBB300 that are able to be \"Dense\" without being inaccessible. The lecture slides were also way too long. Consider making a \"printer friendly\" copy without all of the riff raff. I swear to god the amount of changing gears slides I have printed out could make a 24x24 inch collage. This course is damaging to the human brain if anything. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This was such an interesting and engaging class-- to a degree I didn't expect possible from a large, anonymous lecture-- that truly is accessible to people from all majors. If you want to begin to learn about the awesome complexity of the human brain, understand contemporary methods of research neuroscience, evade the dullness of many introductory STEM courses, and have a greater, more subtle understanding of the human condition, then take this course!! Because of the open-note weekly quizzes 70%/ final exam 30% grading structure, if you put in a bit of work throughout the semester, you can guarantee yourself a respectable grade. So, while this isn't a gut class, it's definitely manageable, and I think everybody should consider taking it. ",

Much of this is the product of my own questionable work ethic, but I will say that since all the material was crammed in before the final, I'm not sure how much will stick.  \r\n\r\nI think a few more tweaks to the structure of the course could really improve it.

It is a science class about the human brain, so you will learn about a lot of pathways and anatomy and psych experiments (not humanities-esque theories about our evolution or molecular bio level cellular interactions). Theres a ton of material (i had about 100 pages of dense, single spaced notes by the end) and its fascinating! 3-hr weekly online quizzes were sometimes hard to find 3 consecutive hours for, but thats really the only work during the semester so its not bad at all, and forces you to review the material as you go. The final was definitely one of the scariest test experiences I've had at Yale (and this was my seventh semester) because there's so much material (cumulative) and the questions are highly specific, but I'd say it's still worth taking -- just maybe cr/d/fail if you're nervous.

You will be able to pull insights from this course in your everyday life (e.g. when drinking coke or pepsi; take the course and find out what I mean). Just do yourself a favor and please review the two lectures each week before taking the weekly quiz. You will be much, much less stressed and overwhelmed before final exam period. It is definitely possible to do well in this course if you just space out the workload rather than trying to memorize everything in the two days leading up to the exam. ",
