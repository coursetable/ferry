            "\u00a0I learned about the structure of fiction, poetry, and drama and how to create works in each category. I also learned a lot of techniques to make my writing more interesting, such as how to write good dialogue and how to trim scenes. ",

            "\u00a0This course was full of only strengths in my opinion. He always kept us engaged, treated us as adults, was extremely fair, was very real and transparent with us with where we stand in class. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the readings and the writing exercises, however I wish there had been more concrete feedback on individual writing styles and less emphasis on writing in the image of the professor \r\nI enjoyed the visiting writings and plenary lectures A LOT!\r\nI had little to no idea what my grade was throughout the semester, even when I asked the professor ",
            "\u00a0I think the way this course brings lecturers into the larger plenary lectures is good, though talking with them in smaller groups might be more helpful. Otherwise, I loved this course. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the workshopping sessions because it was helpful to hear my peers advice. I wouldve enjoyed more guidance in writing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I think we could have done even more workshops as a class. Also, the class felt a little imbalanced with A LOT of time spent on fiction and less time in the other units. ",
            "\u00a0I liked how this class was organized. I thought that the plenary lectures, class sessions, workshops, and homework assignments were all very useful and effective. I also like the small size of the class and the way it encourages communication. Finally, I just really appreciate how fun and relaxing this class is (while also being challenging).\r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, I think that the class could be a little better-paced/balanced. Our workshops seemed unbalanced, with a lot of people going right at the end in the unit with the longest works, and there were times when the class seemed to be going a little too fast or slow (no work or a lot of work at once). ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the workshop structure and the plenary lectures, but I thought that we should have utilized the mini-workshop structure more, as I think that would have been even more helpful. "

            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. This is my favorite course I have taken at Yale thus far. It challenges you but pushes you to become a better writer and make you think outside the box. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend, but understand that the class is mostly independent work and your experience will be heavily dependent on which professor you end up with -- make sure you like the individual before committing to take the class for the whole semester. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in creative writing. It's a great overview of the subject with lots of opportunities to write and receive helpful feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a very good introductory English course that allows students to explore their personal style of writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes a gut class if you love creative writing. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; it's very enjoyable and not too strenuous. It is perfect for an introductory creative writing class ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely recommend this class. It has a significant workload, but the work is all creative writing so it's fun and a good break from more info-based classes. The writing advice you receive is very concrete and useful, and you will definitely come out a better writer. Also, Professor Green is very funny and lively. He specializes in fiction and drama (whereas some of the other professors who teach this course specialize in poetry), so you might want to take this class with him if you're interested in those things. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially to students who have never taken a creative writing class before, as it serves well as a broad introduction. "
