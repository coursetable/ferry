            "\u00a0I learned about the historical progression of jazz in the United States from indigenous west African music brought over by slaves to modern hip hop, focusing primarily on the transitions and movements between New Orleans Dixie and Agitprop. I now have a greater understanding of the roles that gender and race played in shaping jazz styles, and how jazz in turn shaped gender and race perceptions at the time. ",
            "\u00a0I developed insight into the history of jazz in America, beginning with its origins in Africa and the slave trade going all the way until free form, etc. I also learned how to manage time and complete assignments over a short period of time, as the course was only 10 weeks. ",
            "\u00a0To learn to appreciate Jazz music and nuances in race more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the evolution of Jazz as it pertains to racial, political, and socio-economic changes throughout history. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I thought the written assignments were a great way to synthesize and process the historical information, however I felt that the class was more history than music. I think we could have focused more on music theory, what jazz contributes to western musical theory, and some jazz improv basics. I did not learn as much as I had hoped about the musicality and technical differences between each style. I think we could have analyzed individual pieces more, like we did at the beginning with blues form, but continued through out. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Duffy is obviously very passionate about this subject and put together a wonderful course. The readings were very interesting, particularly the ones about gender and sexuality in jazz. There were also readings that gave a great overview of the history of jazz that helped a lot with the essays. There was also a lot of material in lectures, which was great. Weaknesses: If I had to come up with something, I would say that the accelerated nature of the course makes it hard for in-depth class discussions. But given the circumstances, we actually did get to converse with each other and contribute a lot of our own insights. ",
            "\u00a0I thought it couldnt get any better "

            "\u00a0Yes! Especially if they are genuinely interested in learning more about jazz. I think it would be quite difficult if you don't have any musical background or if you're not actually interested in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Jazz is something that we are all exposed to, but very few people actually know the history of the music and the social context out of which it was created. Definitely a worthwhile course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is surprising how much this class has enriched my life. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Duffy is an amazing teacher and is very passionate about Jazz. For someone who has never even touched an instrument, I learned a lot; he made this course fun and incredibly interesting. "
