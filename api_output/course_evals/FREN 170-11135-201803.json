            "\u00a0I feel like I significantly improved my reading and writing abilities and my confidence in both. I think I got a solid literary foundation and am more capable of analyzing/taking a position on a work. ",
            "\u00a0Practice reading and writing formal French, intro to literary analysis in French ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about French culture and history through our study of French literature. It gave me a lot of practice with my reading and language analysis, and pushed me to expand my vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that now I have a firmer knowledge about French history (particularly in its modern colonialism), as well as a wider breadth of connaissance on different types of French literature (i.e. not just novels, just films, graphic novels, epic poems, etc.). ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the skill of how to read and analyse French texts, while accumulating contextual knowledge of the texts we studied. ",
            "\u00a0Great amount of reading comprehension, spoken french, presentation skills, and writing ",
            "\u00a0Deeper understanding of how French history relates to trends in French literature. Improved writing skills with weekly response papers and essays. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in reading and writing in literary French. This course also gave really interesting historical context to numerous important French texts and so gave a strong cultural understanding alongside the literature study. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I appreciated the way the syllabus followed the timeline of French history, so we started in the Middle Ages and finished in the last 50 years or so. For the most part, I enjoyed the individual works chosen to represent all those periods. I was also pleasantly surprised by how many films were not just offered as enrichment, but actually made part of the coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Good books, decent workload, engaging class. Would maybe have liked more modern books instead of some of the medieval ones ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed being in such a small class because it gave me the opportunity to engage a lot. I liked Madame Pinzka's organization of the course, too. For homework, she would almost every day assign us a couple questions to prepare for discussion, so when class came we each always had something to contribute. The hardest part of the course was definitely the sheer quantity of reading each week, but I did always really enjoy class time and our discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps everyone could answer just the same one or two questions so it could be more of a discussion as opposed to just everyone answering their individual designated question. ",
            "\u00a0A wide scope of texts were studied that enabled us to become broadly familiar with a history of French literature. The texts, for the most part, were also very interesting and engaging. This was a strength of the course. The assessments were also diverse, which made the course varied and more enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0I believe this course is very good. Some works are quite challenging. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: the course covered a wide range of french literature, both content-wise and time-wise, starting with an epic from the middle ages and ending with a graphic novel from the second world war. \r\nWeakness: because of the courses ambitious reach, we moved fairly quickly through each book and time period, often causing me to wish wed spent more time on a work Id particularly liked. With a survey course like this, however, thats to be expected. ",
            "\u00a0I think the small class size was a great strength of this class as it allowed us all to become comfortable with each other and to share our thoughts often during the class. I think it could be improved by hearing more specific thoughts from the instructor at the beginning of class to clarify any ambiguities in the text. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who feels like they aren't as well-read as they want to be and need to lay down a solid foundation for themselves in French literature. It's also a great opportunity to build some confidence in your writing skills through regular practice. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if it's with Madame Pinzka. While the reading workload can be heavy at times, especially if you don't read very quickly in French, the overall workload is just readings, weekly reading responses, two 5 page papers, and an oral presentation. The books are good and Madame Pinzka is so nice--she focuses more on your ideas about literature than your grammar, although she does offer corrections to your speaking without seeming condescending. I hadn't taken French for 2 years before this class and was fine. Take this over a grammar class any day. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to someone who is interested in French literature specifically. It's not a class to practice language in the same way that lower level classes do - we don't do any grammar or really have speaking evaluations. It's a lot of reading and written analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it covers an extremely interesting breadth of material. ",
            "\u00a0For students who are keen to improve their French reading skills and who are willing to put in the time to read the texts and do all the reading responses, I would definitely recommend the class. To get the most out of it, I feel you really have to immerse yourself in the content. For students unwilling to do this, I may recommend less content-heavy courses. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. Heads up: a lot of work! But its worth it at the end ",
            "\u00a0If you are a fairly proficient French speaker and writer who looks to improve both of these skills as well as gain an overarching understanding of French literature, I would recommend this course. However, if you already have a good deal of experience with French literature, I would recommend taking a more specialized course if you are able. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to another student, the teacher was excellent and the class size made it a really worthwhile seminar. "
