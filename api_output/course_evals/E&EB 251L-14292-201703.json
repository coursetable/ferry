I'll absolutely never look at arthropods the same way after this class, and I'm thankful for having such an intimate understanding of a whole phylum of organisms that I never would have gotten on my own.

            "\u00a0I found this course be very intensive towards the end of the semester. I wish I had known how much extra time outside of class the final project would require so that I could plan a little better. I would recommend maybe having a few hours each week throughout the semester to come in and work outside of lab time so it was not such a burden at the end. I fpund that I did not have time to study for the final because I had so much work to do on the project. However, I love how hands-on and interactive the class was! I think it really enhanced my learning. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me an opportunity to get incredibly involved with perhaps the most important organisms on the planet. The course forces you to collect, handle, and prepare specimens in an almost artistic way, making the class both scientifically and almost spiritually enriching. The course also allows you to get close with experts in the field as well as develop a good working relationship with your TFs, which added another positive element to the course. I do wish that the course were less backloaded, however. The last couple of weeks turned an otherwise amazing course into a really stressful experience. I also found the practical final unnecessary in addition to the collection project. I thought they used similar skills, only we were left with very little time to prepare for the final since it was due the same day as the collection. "

            "\u00a0If you are really into arthropods then yeah take it, but just be aware that there is a lot of work that goes into the lab, you will have to put in many extra hours, including during reading period. But the professor is super helpful and nice. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Make sure that you don't overload your schedule like I did, but with the right course selection, this lab will be a fun experience with fun people. "
