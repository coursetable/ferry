            "\u00a0Better understanding of Japanese literature. ",
            "\u00a0New Japanese, such as new kanji, vocab, and grammar.\r\nThis class also helped me maintain/master Japanese learned in previous semesters. ",
            "\u00a0Greater comprehension of the Japanese language. ",
            "\u00a0Academic control and understanding of Japanese along with ability to analyze texts to be able to engage with them in the language. ",
            "\u00a0For homework there was usually a reading an a couple worksheets that asked questions about the reading. We also had to write sentences using grammar patterns. I usually spent between 2-3 hours on homework for each class meeting. \r\n\r\nI think my reading got faster and obviously we covered new vocab that I learned. ",
            "\u00a0Reading, listening, speaking, and writing of Japanese language ",
            "\u00a0Definitely learned a lot more kanji and improved my reading comprehension skills. I also had a different sensei than last semester and noticed my listening skills greatly improved. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a continuation of the Japanese language curriculum, in which we focused on reading materials such as short stories and being able to write and talk about them in class in the form of assignments such as essays and class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0I gained more practice writing about abstract constructs and discussing abstract constructs in Japanese. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths: This class is amazing. The curriculum is so thoughtfully designed, and the teachers are so accessible and caring. Easily one of the best classes I've taken at Yale. \r\n\r\nWeakness: Our section was a little big, so it made it more difficult to get speaking practice/participate/be engaged. The homework gets to be a little much sometimes, but everything is so thoughtfully designed to just help you improve and continue to use your language skills, so I can't complain. The more time you put into this class, the more you will get out of it. I only wish I hadn't been so busy/lazy so I had put more time into improving my Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0It was good. Discussion in class could be somewhat disjointed, but it was always a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Need more professors :) ",
            "\u00a0It was hard to keep reviewing and using old grammar patterns. Also more specific terminology was being taught so there wasn't much overlap in the vocab between readings. But maybe this is expected, being a 3rd year Japanese class. ",
            "\u00a0All are good ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are definitely the readings. Once again, we read a wide variety of native material that provides a deeper understanding of many aspects of Japanese culture.\r\n\r\nThat said, I personally do not find the media assignments particularly helpful. They could potentially serve as good listening practice if they were done more often.\r\n\r\nWhat I did find extremely helpful was assignments where we had to write essays or the final project. Those allowed for students to learn vocabulary to things they already have a connection with, employ a variety of independent learning skills, and practice a variety of Japanese skills in both speaking to others and presenting one's things. I think the class would benefit from more of these kinds of assignments. Further, increased opportunities for responding to feedback would be great! For example, we wrote an essay, received feedback, and had to submit another draft. I think that better allows for students to internalize feedback. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured, and while rigorous, is not too much to handle. My only suggested area of improvement would be a more structured way to review material from earlier in the semester towards the end of it. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course blows through all of the things covered fairly quickly. While I was able to read texts which built my confidence, at times it felt like I was just memorizing kanji for a morning to forget them and memorize the next set of kanji for the next morning. The in class conversation was always engaging and the class presentations concerning news articles felt like a great way to learn and better understand Japanese. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are really interested in Japanese, otherwise it will be difficult to keep up with the work and quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0That depends on what is happening with the Japanese department, which is downsizing significantly. (Thanks Yale.) \r\nLearning another language can be such a rewarding experience, and this Japanese class just facilitated that so well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Most definitely! You improve different areas in Japanese than a lot of other classes and its taught very well. Youll be a little busy with it but no effort is to waste. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very engaging and fun class, as long as you do all the readings and homework. ",
            "\u00a0Who wants to improve there Japanese ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend to anyone interesting in maintaining their Japanese or moderately improving it. Of course you won't get the same gains as you might've had after a summer in Japan, but this class has helped me maintain my Japanese level and made me a more independent learner. I really hope I am able to continue taking classes with the wonderful Japanese senseis. They really do care a lot and it's been a pleasure taking advanced level courses with them. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is serious about learning Japanese, as it was incredibly fulfilling to see our language skills progress in all four forms (speaking, reading, writing, and listening). However, because the course requires a substantial time investment, I would not recommend it to someone who isn't going to be committed to the language and is just looking for a credit to take. ",
            "\u00a0Nishimura sensei is a great professor, whom I think anyone is lucky to learn from. The downside to this course in my opinion is that it is not very in class learning based. Rather, it is more of a learn at home and apply in class type of course which doesn't work well for my learning style. Thus, I would say make the decision on if this class is right for you with that in mind. "
