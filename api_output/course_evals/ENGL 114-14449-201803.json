            "\u00a0I was able to truly become a better writer following this course. The constant interaction between my other peers and the professor helped to improve my writing drastically throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0How to be a better writer, how to evaluate and better my own and other peoples work ",
            "\u00a0My writing definitely improved throughout the course, especially since I'm just a STEM major who is far from interested in prose writing. I also learned a lot about how claims can be written and presented, which I think will be invaluable. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the ability to think about modern philosophical texts and develop my own ideas related to the self and the self in artificial intelligence. I also able to improve my writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned many writing skills that will really help me going forward. I really enjoyed learning from Professor Eklund! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot throughout this course. First of all, I learned plenty of information about the self and what construct us as people. Most importantly, i learned how to properly put my thoughts onto paper and create and essay that is, I guess, Yale level. Became a much better writer. ",
            "\u00a0This course allowed me to evaluate what Im doing wrong in my writing and gave me many ways to fix the issues I had. ",
            "\u00a0My writing skills greatly improved, as well as my ability to properly structure an argument and an essay. I know understand how to identify a problem, make my claim, and provide evidence for the claim throughout the essay in an insightful and interesting way. "

            "\u00a0The readings are super interesting, easy to engage with, and exposed me to a variety of different writing styles. I would say that I wish there was more time spent on workshopping papers, especially the research paper, however this was addressed towards the end of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Engaging, small group setting was good for discussions ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite classes of the semester, so I don't have many qualms. The readings were fun and the essay prompts weren't that stressful. Overall, it was a very engaging course that offers a great transition from high-school level to college-level writing. Also, the teacher is just awesome. ",
            "\u00a0The course is discussion based and really helps communication skills and idea building.  The different types of papers allowed me to be exposed to different types of writing.  The range of the topics covered in the course ensure that the same topic is not exhausted, keeping the class interesting. On the downside, some of the readings could be changed to better fit the course. ",
            "\u00a0The discussions, peer workshops and ample, detailed feedback received on each of the four essays were all very helpful and definite strengths of the course. At times, however, we would stray off the syllabus dates and it was a bit difficult to figure out when different readings were actually due. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: \r\nTeaches you how to write \r\nTeacher was engaged and passionate\r\nReadings were interesting \r\nFlexible with deadlines\r\nCons:\r\nEssays would pile up and itd be difficult to keep up with all of them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: small class, interesting material, good discussion & discussion was encouraged, received good feedback on my writing from the professor, professor really wanted us to do well. Weaknesses: Peer feedback was hit or miss depending on who I was paired with, some assignments lacked clarity. Improving: Maybe showing the class what to look out for when giving feedback and how to give constructive feedback, clarifying the guidelines for the assignments and being more specific. "

            "\u00a0Definitely. It's also a great way to get writing credit for STEM majors and the information one learns from this class is actually quite interesting. Writing a research assignment also strengthened my confidence in doing such papers. ",

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The prospect of writing a college-level essay was absolutely daunting to me coming in as a first-year, and this course, and Professor Eklund, completely demystified the process for me! I feel like my writing has improved tremendously and I'm now able to write long, cohesive, interesting papers that properly convey what I'm trying to say. This is great for people that want to focus on improving their academic writing. "
