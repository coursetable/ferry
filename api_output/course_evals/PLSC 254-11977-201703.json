            "\u00a0I learned more about American politics. Most of the theories just confirmed anecdotes I already knew about American politics, but Henderson presented the material in an engaging way. I loved the case study assignment! The layout of the class made for a good breakdown of work, so I highly recommend the class. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class. I learned a lot about the American Political system and political theory ",
            "\u00a0Learned about role of parties in American politics as well as various views of political behavior. ",
            "\u00a0A further understanding of our government and political parties role in them. ",
            "\u00a0Political parties may seem like a relatively basic topic in the field of political science but this course gives students an incredibly interesting insight into the inner workings of political parties, as well as their effects on the political system as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the formation and evolution of political parties in the United States through theory and empirical accounts. ",
            "\u00a0Great class! ",
            "\u00a0A better understanding of how the 2-party system works in the US. ",
            "\u00a0Useful info about politics in the past and today ",
            "\u00a0Great introduction to political science in general; overall gained a greater understanding of the American political system ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to have a strong foundation of the history of political parties in the United States and the literature regarding this subject. ",
            "\u00a0Great spring board into politics ",
            "\u00a0A fairly comprehensive overview of the formation, action, and results of American political parties. ",

            "\u00a0I have gained a deeper appreciation for the American political system and can more easily identify reasons or trends for things that happen in reality. In other words, this course has given me an academic understanding/perspective grounded in history, psychology, and society for political phenomena experienced in this country on a daily basis. "

            "\u00a0I really loved the way he did his lecture slides. His lectures were engaging, and I like the current events segment at the beginning. Sometimes the readings were too dense/plentiful, but he did a good job of explaining them in class. I love the case study assignment! I think the midterm and final were excellent-- very straightforward with no surprises. I wish section had more of a purpose, but I think that just varies by TF. Please discard the interactive component-- I think it just made lecture awkward at times. ",
            "\u00a0John Henderson is the biggest strength. Think it is great as is. ",
            "\u00a0Good class, does a good job mixing theory, history, and applications to current events. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this is a fantastic course. Some lectures were more engaging than others, but I think overall it was an engaging political science course. The assignments were incredibly fair as well. The only improvement I could suggest would be to narrow down the readings on the syllabus. I attempted to do all of the reading for each class, but I found myself spending immense amounts of time on the readings, and then discussing the actual texts for only a few minutes during section or during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The course achieved its goal of \"tracing the evolution of American parties over time, and examining in depth some of the contemporary role of parties and partisanship in government and elections.\"\r\n\r\nI wish more benefits were conferred upon students who regularly did the readings. In fact, only the readings brought up in lecture should be on the \"required\" section of the syllabus to begin with.\r\n\r\nI think the course's framing of realignment theory could be re-done. (Why were we given such heavy criticisms of it, if we were expected to treat some of its central tenets as truths -- such as \"critical elections\"?) ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is the excessive reading often on the syllabus some weeks. The reading list should be better tailored to the topics discussed in lecture. Other than that, the lectures were engaging, the midterm and final format was great, and the papers were a nice complement to the more theoretical material that. ",
            "\u00a0Need better lecture topics. ",
            "\u00a0An interesting course overall - theories and readings can be a little dry, but Professor Henderson is very good about connecting material to politics today. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the accessibility of the material and the formatting of the exams. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - very applicable and interesting. Not really any weaknesses ",
            "\u00a0This a great lecture class. It is covers the subject thoroughly without being overwhelming. I really liked that Professor Henderson gave us a practice exam before the tests with all the possible questions. That helped me make sure I learned all the important material. I have no suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0This course was great.  I felt like I did not have to put a ton of work into it to get so much out.  Lecture was great, interesting, specific, organized, really informative.  In section we systematically went through the readings.  Slides were posted online so if I missed a lecture I had no issue keeping up with the material.  The case study paper was interesting, relevant, informative, and overall enjoyable to write.  The exams felt totally fair, I studied hard, for not too long, and did well (at least on the midterm).  Overall I feel like I learned more from this course than my other polisci courses this semester even though I had less work to do in it. ",
            "\u00a0I liked that the lectures tended to include news clippings and tv reports of relevant real-life examples, which helped crystallise certain concepts. It was also helpful to have had the sample test for both the midterm and the final; the exercise of going over the questions and having those thought processes checked was important for me personally. It would be great if we could have access to the slides prior to the lectures because most of the time everyone is frantically copying what's on the slides which detracts attention from what Professor Henderson is actually saying.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student. Do you learn a lot and is the material earth shattering? No, but it does confirm many everyday political ideas using political theories. The class is very straightforward (5-7 page case study on a congressional race, midterm with a verbatim study guide, final exam with verbatim study guide OR final paper extended case study). Henderson is a knowledgable guy who executes his lectures flawlessly, which is extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a solid course in American Political Theory. Reasonable workload, and Professor Henderson is great. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah. Good class for those interested in American politics. ",
            "\u00a0If they have a genuine interest in the subject, yes. If they have no interest in politics then this will be a very boring class. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone at Yale looking to delve into a specific part of the American political system. It is a well structured class that makes it easy to learn from, and helps students to build a more nuanced understanding of a part of our political system. ",
            "\u00a0Though it can be easy to some, I do not recommend Political Parties in the American System if you're actually trying to enjoy the class while doing well. John Henderson's \"required readings\" on his syllabus reflects a partial disrespect for his students' time, as some didn't even get a mention in lecture. Speaking of the syllabus, it was never revised, even though we fell almost two weeks behind at one point. The \"theoretical\" parts of the class sometimes get too technical, yet they're featured on parts of the midterm and final exam, if you take it. Also the \"choice\" between final exam and term paper isn't really real, because the due dates this semester were 10 days apart. ",
            "\u00a0Everything you could want out of a PLSC lecture--interesting and useful material, great professor, very fair grading, moderate workload. The class uses political parties as a tool to explore and explain several different aspects of American politics (from polarization, to elections, to congress), so there's something in it for everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Decent class with a very low workload. If you're interested in the topic and invest a lot of time into the readings it could be rewarding, but it is also easy to do well if you just attend lecture. By far the most engaging and rewarding part of the course was the case study. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Good professor and TA's. Interesting material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely! Great info, they want you to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0yes! ",
            "\u00a0This is a great introductory class to the evolution of political parties in the United States. It also covers many of the major political theories and literature in the field. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great 5th class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to understand the background of American political parties. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!  This course is interesting, engaging, easy to understand, so informative and relevant, and not a lot of work at all.  Whether you're a polisci major or just looking for a social science credit, this course provides a fascinating examination of the technical details of how our political system works that anyone would find interesting, and that honestly more people should understand as US residents or voting citizens. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great introductory course for anyone interested in political parties in the US, or US politics in general. "
