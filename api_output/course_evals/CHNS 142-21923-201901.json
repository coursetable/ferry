            "\u00a0I learned a lot more about grammar and vocabulary use. This semester was much more technical than the last, but I feel like I learned a lot more about the Chinese language and its complexities. I also appreciated the discussion portions of the class, which I felt helped me engage with the culture more. ",
            "\u00a0More precise verbal pronunciation, strengthened reading and writing skills; better understanding of Chinese culture (thought, behavior, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0This class had the same format as 132, just with more challenging material. I learned more advanced vocabulary and was able to discuss more complex subjects (relating to society, the world, etc). The repetitive structure can get a bit tiring, with daily quizzes, homework, essays, and tests, but I think this semester there was more variation since we would watch movies and have discussion days. ",
            "\u00a0More formal vocabulary than 132. Definitely a transition from learning to write/read words I already knew and have used before to genuinely new vocabulary I can now use to converse more formally. ",
            "\u00a0I really expanded my Chinese vocabulary and sentence constructions in this course. ",
            "\u00a0My Chinese speaking, writing, and reading skills improved significantly over the course of my experience with my instructor. ",
            "\u00a0Learning how to use Chinese and leave our comfort zone in a very welcoming environment ",
            "\u00a0Learned more chinese "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really liked the introduction of the discussion sections in the class. I think it made each passage we read in the textbook more tangible and allowed us to explore different topics, while developing our Chinese skills. Sometimes I did feel like we sped through some topics a bit quicker than I would've liked, but overall the pacing was pretty good. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: learned a lot very quickly, heritage-learner environment was extremely conducive to everyone's improvement\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing instructor (Liu Laoshi), and the way the class is structured really does force you to learn a large amount of material. \r\nWeakness: Sometimes repetitive (although this I don't think has a solution), also the location in the basement of Bass was not great ",
            "\u00a0I think the environment of speaking in Chinese everyday really helped expose me to more of the language and hone my ear for what sounded correct. I really liked how our instructor helped us construct sentences and talk about interesting issues in Chinese, because I feel like that was where we really improved. The daily mini-quizzes were a little stressful sometimes, but looking back, that was the only way to get us to study everyday and retain the amount of information and words we did, so I wouldn't change them. Thank you so much to the Chinese department for offering a heritage track for us to learn. ",
            "\u00a0The course is intensive, and work heavy at many times, but is honestly very rewarding. The course is interactive, and allow students to improve together in an environment where no one feels out of place or embarrassed to speak up. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class ",
            "\u00a0The class gets extremely repetitive. It starts out fine, but becomes extremely difficult to engage in, especially towards the end. "

        [
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student! It allows you to study Chinese beyond the basic conversational comments and grammar structures. The professor is great at introducing new grammar and vocabulary and does a great job encouraging you to practice what you've learned with your peers in class. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely. This is a class where you can really see your own improvement and Chinese is of course extremely useful to know. I also became very good friends with many of the people in my class; each class is its own little community, so you end up getting a lot more out of it than just improved Chinese skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! My chinese level improved a lot throughout the year. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Wholeheartedly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, you learn so much in this class. It is a lot of work, so if you have a lot of other intensive classes I would be careful, but I learned so much. When I called my parents, they even commented on my improvement. It was really nice to feel like you are making solid improvement in a class, because that kind of constant upward improvement and validation is rare to feel in most classes. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other heritage students. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! We got to talk about important and interesting subjects :) ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course because the teacher is great and it is clear what is expected from you as a student. "
