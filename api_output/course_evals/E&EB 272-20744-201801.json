            "\u00a0I knew birds were awesome before, but after this class, I know about so many cool functions of birds and specific birds who do crazy things. Definitely the kinds of things to drop on your friends and at cocktail parties. That said, I also know about the nitty-gritty biological things that were less scintillating to study, but given that this is an actual science class, it's pretty inevitable. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about what makes birds unique - their feathers, evolution, anatomy, behavior, and social structures. ",
            "\u00a0This class was awesome! I learned so much not just about birds, but dinosaurs, beauty, sexual selection, writing scientific review papers, and so much more. Loved it. Take it. ",

            "\u00a0I learned a lot about birds and was a bit surprised that this knowledge would translate very well to other organisms. I really enjoyed the section of the class where we talked about aesthetics. It was really satisfying to see aspects of humanities and STEM coming together. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about birds; Ornithology is not about memorizing hundreds of species, but it's about all birds themselves. The first half of the course talks a lot about the three big \"evolutions\" (the evolution of birds from dinosaurs, the evolution of feathers, and of flight); other lessons cover avian cognition, digestion, physiology, migration, sexual reproduction, and of course, the evolution of beauty. ",

Additionally, I learned a lot about how evolution is actually studied. Of course, I knew what evolution *was* but I'd never really interacted with it on an academic level before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned A LOT about birds. Evolution, life systems, breeding, navigation, biology, migration, singing, and more. I learned why birds are important and what they have to teach us about larger questions like the origin of beauty and nature's position on sexual autonomy. ",

            "\u00a0This course was an amazing course, truly eye-opening. My one critique is that there is not much opportunity for dialogue or questions; it's entirely and completely a lecture course. This can, I found, get a little grating. I wish there was more opportunity for discussion. ",
            "\u00a0This course is highly engaging - the professor clearly enjoys his field of study and loves teaching it. All of the material is supposedly from his slides, but his slides are rather bad - I would prefer to have a well-written study guide instead. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Prum is an awesome lecturer, and the class is just super interesting!\r\nWeaknesses: I wish it wasn't at 9:25 :( ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Prum is unbelievably knowledgable and a fantastic lecturer. He is very engaging.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: There was very little guidance for the term paper, which made writing it difficult, especially for non-biology majors. Professor Prum also blew through topics during lecture, making it difficult to really process and understand things. Additionally, the grading system for the lecture exams was harsh, and I did not receive much substantive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Prum was always a bit behind the syllabus, which was fine because I learned a lot but he had to cut out a lot of material which was unfortunate. ",
            "\u00a0the professor is amazing. very knowledgeable and passionate about his work and teaching. ",
            "\u00a0Great lecturer, very interesting material. Some more guidance on what to study for the exams would have been helpful; the TAs also occasionally took points off on exams and didn't say why, which was really annoying. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Prum is an excellent lecturer. The class covered a lot of material, but I never felt like we were skimming over things. I think it could be improved by making the lab class size larger and perhaps providing more external support for studying/paper writing via TAs. But overall a really solid course. I am not a science oriented person at all, and I found it easy to get up and go to class at 9:25 because it was so fascinating and fun! ",
            "\u00a0THIS CLASS IS NOT A GUT. Great + engaging lectures, but tests are really hard and somewhat unfair -- and the whole class is three exams and a paper. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures for this course are amazing! Professor Prum is truly an expert in his field, and it was incredible to learn about aesthetic evolution, sexual autonomy, and other topics that Prum has actually pioneered in ornithology. ",
            "\u00a0It will blow your mind. But he doesnt explain everything near the end - becomes kind of rushed. Could include some debate ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Extremely engaging lectures, the content is easy to understand, Professor Prum is really open to giving you feedback and advice on the final paper, oppotunities to go on birdwatching trips. ",

            "\u00a0This class covers so much about birds, and that's very important. I see birds in a new light, now that I know what's going on inside and outside of them. The class doesn't cover specific birds (if you want more of that, take the lab), but focusing on the general topics, which is very important and useful.\r\n\r\nI think a study guide of list of terms and topics before each midterm/exam would be helpful to review the content. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Prum, papa bird himself. He is an amazing lecturer with a great sense of humor. There were no readings for the class, but just by listening to Prum and taking good notes, I felt that I could get a solid grasp of the material. Prum also teaches us about his own insights into biology and more, which is fascinating in itself. Weaknesses: tests are fairly detail-heavy. You'll have to study a week in advance and go over all lectures + notes. But it's very doable, and there's always extra credit questions. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are amazing; the paper requirements were not clearly defined so they led to some frustration. ",
            "\u00a0There are many strengths to this course. Professor Prum's lectures are informative and highly engaging, the course material is fascinating, and the exams were very fair. I don't think anything needs to be improved. ",
            "\u00a0Would have appreciated structured review sessions prior to exams ",
            "\u00a0The course is a classic lecture and has the strengths and weaknesses that one might expect. Professor Prum is very engaging and I always found his lectures fascinating. I think the course does not require any changes. ",

            "\u00a0This course's material was highly interesting and engaging. The grade rested strongly on relatively few tests and one paper, though I do not see a clear way around this. ",
            "\u00a0The course requires a lot of commitment to memorizing content because the test can and will cover the broadest of themes to the most specific details. If you are able to commit that time to learning the content though, you're sure to get a lot out of the course. ",

It is heavy memorization but if you attend the lectures, Professor Prum is a great lecturer who is engaging and allows you to develop the same enthusiasm for the subject. I took this course as my EEB elective and it was a great decision. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to science majors and non-majors alike. It is a really eye-opening course, and radically changed my perception of birds and the natural world as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to realize in-depth why birds are super friccin cool. That said, all the reviews say this, but despite the lack of week-to-week work, you will play yourself if you don't take the midterms seriously and/or don't go to lecture. Studying with a friend helps a lot, since the information comes at you really quickly in class and you might not have had time to jot everything down, and he doesn't really give a chance to go over the information again. The term paper can also catch you off-guard if you don't have very much or confidence experience with science writing. ",
            "\u00a0This is one of the best courses I have taken here. It is well taught; the material and the professor are very engaging. This course is Not A Gut. The exams are easy to get partial credit on and hard to get full credit on. You will learn a lot and you will spend a lot of time and effort on this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The class definitely involves a fair bit of memorization for exams. It may seem like a gut, but it's actually pretty easy to do poorly, so watch out. It's very worth it though. Prum is an incredibly ornithologist -- when will you have an opportunity like this again?? ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who are interested in birds. I would not recommend it to non-majors or people looking for a user-friendly science course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! If you are interested in birds at all (or even if you're not), take this course! I left this class with a newfound appreciation for birds and learned so much about the biology of birds. ",
            "\u00a0Yes it gives you a new perspective on knowledge and the natural world ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I took this class having no previous knowledge or interest of birds and it ended up being one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken at Yale. Professor Prum is an excellent lecturer and definitely makes the morning walk up to ESC worth it. It seems like a lot of work with 3 exams and a paper, but the material is honestly not that hard (also very interdisciplinary if that's your thing: some physics, chemistry, even aesthetic philosophy to the very end), and the final is the same length as the midterm (with a lot more time to finish), and the grade distribution is very generous. Probably the hardest part is the final paper, but Prum gives a nice, flexible page range as well as a lot of advice on how to do it. This class is definitely one of Yale's gems and I'd recommend any student, STEM or not, to take it. ",

            "\u00a0This class has truly been one of my favorite that I've ever taken at Yale. When I was bluebooking and came upon this class, I read a course evaluation calling Richard Prum a \"bird god,\" and he truly is. His knowledge of the field and passion for the subject comes through in his teaching, making the class fun, insightful, and overall fascinating. Even if you never had much interest in birds before (I didn't), you'll really enjoy this class, as it opens up a new world of interesting information! ",

Professor Prum is highly engaging and knows EVERYTHING about birds. Birds are INCREDIBLE. They learn their songs in their dreams. And feathers are TOTALLY TUBULAR. You will learn so many incredible things about so many incredible birds. I think I might have to become an ornithologist now. ",
            "\u00a0This class fulfilled my second science distributional credit and it was a good choice for me since I enjoy E&EB. I would recommend this class to other non-science majors like myself who are looking for a healthy challenge instead of just a gut science credit. Professor Prum is very engaging and lecture was always interesting. ",

When I was a kid I was fascinated by birds and convinced my parents to take us bird-watching, and we got a bird feeder as well. This interest faded somewhat but was reignited and deepened by this class, which taught me more about birds than I ever expected to learn. It's a great lecture and the workload is very manageable. ",
