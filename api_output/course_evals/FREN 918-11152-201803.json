            "\u00a0The course provided an overview of the literary, aesthetic, and filmic production centering around the student uprisings of May 68 in Paris. The course also tied important theoretical contributions (Foucault, Barthes, Lefebvre, etc.) to their social and political contexts during this period. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of my own participation in a graduate seminar, I learned how to better intervene in discussions, and to state my point clearly and articulately. I also gained a level of confidence in sharing my point of view, or reading of a text. I think that this was largely due to the support I received from both professors in the class. With regards to the material, I think that I really benefitted from a cultural history perspective that aimed to place literary works within political and social movements. Oftentimes, when we take courses around a certain period, works are divided by literary movement. This was somewhat the case in this course, but the professors did a good job of explaining why/how the particular movement was taking place within a larger historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Good knowledge of the social and historical context of May 68, and its influence on literature and social sciences. Also, a large selection of works providing different approaches to this event and its background. Each course is an occasion to discuss a literary work related to an aspect of May 68. These discussions were a great occasion to share our point of view, and improve our ability of argumentation. Generally, this course gave me the opportunity to develop close readings connected to a socio-historical context. The presentations were also a good synthesis exercise. Finally, this course was a constant reflection on the process of building a corpus. ",
            "\u00a0I grew my knowledge of mai '68 in this class. It was also a welcome introduction to dealing with 20th-century texts and the perks--and challenges--that come with working on texts whose authors are still alive. It was a solid model for how to teach literature while integrating other disciplines, including film and political speeches. "

            "\u00a0The course departed from an interesting concept-- how to organize a corpus around May 68-- but discussions in class often felt disorganized or focused mostly on author's biographies and basic literary history without delving into the works at hand. The structure of the syllabus was somewhat confusing; beginning rather than ending the term with some of the more important theoretical works might have been helpful and provided a more solid foundation for approaching the texts that followed. The course also seemed to skirt some of its most central questions (namely race and class) and did not seem to engage with the revolutionary 'spirit' or radical nature of 68, rarely calling into question the status of the university as a center of knowledge-production or really signaling the course's relevance ('why teach May 68 today?'). We recieved evaluation for our progress in the course on the last day of class, which prevented us from incorporating feedback gradually after each assignment/presentation. ",
            "\u00a0I with that we had talked more about the idea of making corpus. On the last day, we went around and talked about the corpus/syllabus that we would define, but I wish it had been an assignment. That way, we could have developed our thoughts on the subject a little bit more. I think there should have also been some reference made to other corpusesfor example, Berkeley has an entire research guide on May '68. It perhaps would have been a good introduction to the course to talk about why these corpuses are insufficient. In the same vein, a bit more of a logistical/theoretical discussion of why specific works were chosen for the corpus as opposed to others would have been helpful in helping us think about how to frame our corpuses for future classes, or research projects. Apart from that, though, I thought that the course was really interesting. I really appreciated the diversity of the material presented in class (theory, literature, news, etc.) \r\n\r\nI loved that it was co-taught. The two perspectives approaching literature in different ways was very helpful. The professors were also both very supportive in students taking our own approaches to the topic, via themes that aligned with our research interests. I would have liked to get more concrete feedback earlier in the semesterfor example, on specific presentationsso that I could work more comprehensively to fine tune my skills and to correct my weaknesses throughout the semester. Overall, though, it was a very good experience. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n-Variety of approaches to theoretical or literary texts.\r\n-Relevant and enriching selection of works.\r\n-Great openness to discussions.  \r\nWeakness:\r\n-Difficulty in identifying teachers' expectations for oral presentations. This difficulty is related to the variety of approaches. I think it can be improved by explaining more clearly the nature of each exercise and the competencies involved in it. ",
            "\u00a0This class set out with an ambitious intention of contemplating and constructing a corpus for thinking about Mai '68 in France. It was an intriguing project. The readings were interesting and largely unknown to me. I am not sure whether we found an answer to the question set out at the start of the class, but the discussions we had in an attempt to arrive at an answer as to how to construct a Mai '68 corpus were illuminating. It would have been helpful to have received earlier the evaluations given to us at the end of the semester. "

            "\u00a0The course offers an introduction to an important and interesting literature and moment in French (and world) history, and for that reason is worth taking, but the class itself often felt confused in its focus. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! I think that this topic (Mai '68) and the themes that surround it continue to be incredibly relevant in our society, which makes it so interesting from a comparative standpoint. This is also such an interesting way to cover a lot of the literary movements of the post-war period, while grounding them in historical events. I thought that the concept for the class was brilliant, and I had a lot of fun in seminar. ",
            "\u00a0I strongly recommend this course. It is an intellectual and literary exploration of a major event in French culture, with global connections. The books, articles, and films on the program offer a wide knowledge of May 68 and its implications. The atmosphere of the course is excellent and encourages discussion and debate. While the diversity of approaches can be challenging, it certainly offers an opportunity to find your way among the different materials, works and theories taught in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for those who want to learn about mai '68 through its literature. "
