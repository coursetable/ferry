            "\u00a0I learned to connect modernity to antiquity! ",
            "\u00a0This open discussion space was a really special place for me to think about my own opinions and political theories. I appreciated it so much. ",
            "\u00a0I leaned how to evaluate historical and political texts, and analyze arguments in the context of other texts as well as the authors life as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0This course developed my writing, reading, and critical thinking skills. Having to write one paper a week really forces you to constantly reexamine your writing techniques, and reading 3 books a week both makes you focus on time management skills as well as your ability to identify broad themes in a text. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze historical and political books for their authorial bias, in their method, in the depth and articulation of their arguments, and in their larger impact on the world. My writing skills increased tenfold through this class, and my ability to cross-examine books broadened throughout the second semester DS H&PT. ",
            "\u00a0The sheer number of historical and political thinkers we read and the way in which we talked about their writing led to my ability to put these thinkers into conversation with one another on ideologies that continue to shape and be ever present in our world today made. This skill of learning from the past in approaching our present and future lives together made my taking this invaluable. "

            "\u00a0I liked the lay out of arguments on the chalkboard before, and the discussions. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course were the reading list, the seminar discussions, and our professor. The weaknesses are, of course, the workload and the inability to really dive into the text (weaknesses of DS as a whole). I'm not sure that the DS professors can really solve the problem of the shallowness of our readings, but cutting the readings down slightly so that we can focus more closely on the important passages might help. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: We read great books, many of them, and gain an insight on the \"western\" canon, whatever that means. We learn how to analyze books in terms of the sources they draw on, and the validity of their arguments. We debate in class and learn how to argue a certain point. At its best DS gives us a critical moral compass with which to look at the world. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: PoC and women are not focused on in this course. Yes, in the last two weeks we DO read DuBois and Arendt. But it's the last two weeks, and for many of the professors it feels like an afterthought. Also, the speed of DS makes it hard to take in every argument, and it took a little bit of time to fully grasp Nietzsche's racism, more time than DS allowed. That said, DS does its best with the mission it has, and though a lot of writers are rich, white males, they wrote good books. They should not be discounted entirely, and a lot can be taken from each of the books we read in DS. ",
            "\u00a0One of the greatest strengths of this class was the bringing of everyone's voices to the table during section. This was accomplished through online discussions posts that our professor or the starter for that day would read before class and then bring up during our discussion. This allowed for a more student-driven engagement with the text, but it is definitely a hard balance to perfect between allowing students to lead class discussion but also having the professor teach the material so that students learn even more. It would be this balance that I would focus on if I was to change anything about this course. "

            "\u00a0Of course! You will have to do a lot of work (it's DS, so you know that coming in), but you will finish with such a unique set of knowledge and a strong sense of the dominant political thought of the last few centuries. Discussions are great (we had many heated debates in my section), and Professor Klein is such a great mentor. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. If you have the opportunity to take DS, do it. Not only does it improve your reading, writing, analytical, and argumentative skills, but also you are a) surrounded by great peers, b) given access to amazing professors, c) reading extremely good books, and d) exposed to level of arguments that are hard to engage as a first-year. If you are prepared to work hard (most people in DS were not exposed to this pace in high school, but I'm saying that they were mentally ready to do soare you?) and you are willing to get your butt kicked, you will get so so so so so so so so much out of this. And the DS community is really tight-knit, both in your year and in the other years. "
