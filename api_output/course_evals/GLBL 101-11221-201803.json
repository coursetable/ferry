",

Part of the problem was  how many different areas we tried to touch on, instead of focusing anywhere for depth. I suppose I should have known from the course description and syllabus, but, as a first year, I couldn't tell that this was going to be the case. Having different lecturers for each class was hit or miss; I wish Professor Sky would have led more classes, since she has a lot of experience we could have learned from. ",

            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are definitely the guest lecturers as well as Professor Sky herself. They are able to make this course truly special and allow for greater understanding. A weakness would be the intense readings that many times felt unnecessary and also that some guest lecturers are clearly not as prepared/experienced as others and thus the quality of each lecture can vary drastically. I think cutting down on some of the readings and balancing out the quality of each lecturer is a good strategy to resolve these weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the sections and lectures, as they were both fresh and interesting. The only thing I would change is to have more student interaction during the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt the most from this course from doing the readings, which were varied and fairly unbiased. There were a few guest lecturers who were especially insightful and engaging - Aleh Tsvinsky and Omar Sharif come to mind - and I appreciated the effort to bring several difference voices into the class.\r\nI believe that a course that attempts to provide an \"introduction to global affairs\" is inherently prone to two pitfalls: either it focusses too singularly on one topic or region (and thus is not truly \"global\") or covers too much, very superficially. Unfortunately I think this course to some extent did both of these things.\r\nThe first half of the semester focussed entirely on the Middle East with a heavy focus on the US (and, to a lesser extent, the West in general) perspective of those affairs. This seemed to pander to a US audience, which I recognize must be the majority given Yale's location, but I felt that this narrowness undermined the attempt of the course to teach global issues. The second half of the semester covered a range of topics. These topics were heavily weighted towards those directly related to the US and especially US national security - for example, a lecture on \"Russia\" was actually a lecture on US-Russia relations and China was largely framed in the context of the US-China trade war. Unfortunately when handling topics that were not directly related to the US, a degree of ignorance on the part of the class was assumed, resulting in a highly superficial discussion that was largely just based on very generalized, basic facts - the lecture on Conflict and Justice in Africa was a prime example of this. \r\nI would argue that the assessment model further entrenched this narrow perspective and hindered students' active engagement and opportunity to learn from this class. The midterm papers were too short for students to be able to properly discuss and critically analyze their ideas, and the assessment criteria did not encourage students to extend themselves by doing further research and engaging with current affairs beyond the scope of class material. These elements would have allowed students to broaden their perspectives and also would have allowed them to engage with the matters most important to them: it is essential to recognize that students take this class from a wide range of fields and interests and it would be ideal to allow them to explore these in their assessments beyond what is able to be covered in class. The assessments were also very narrowly defined in their real-world application: the \"policy\" assessments were restricted to the US government and the UN, and thus prevented students from exploring other mechanisms to create change (such as technological innovation summits or community-based organizations and projects). Allowing more innovative solutions would have definitely broadened the scope for students to engage in a more realistic and less US-centric approach to global affairs.\r\nI also felt that the assessments were too leniently graded, resulting in a lack of constructive criticism. I did not feel that I really learned anything by doing the assessments; instead, I simply regurgitated information and opinions I had been fed in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Really fascinating speakers and reading materials. Discussion section was usually very engaging. Not high stress or pressure. \r\nWeaknesses: Some lectures didn't dive in very deep and felt like a very shallow analysis of a topic. ",
            "\u00a0The guest speakers were fantastic, but I wish I could have seen more of Professor Sky in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Having many people talk about many different things which dont particularly relate is kinda confusing ",
            "\u00a0This class is a really fun survey class that is quiet easy without much workload, but since it is so much of a survey class, sometimes the course lacks a central core. I learned a lot, but at the same time I feel like I didn't. I really wish professor Sky would have taught a bit more rather than relying on sometimes great (and sometimes mediocre) guest speakers. ",
            "\u00a0Incredibly light workload. Lecture attendance is pretty much optional. ",
            "\u00a0strengths - structure, guest lectures, assignments\r\nweakness - the final was very different from what the course emphasized ",
            "\u00a0The course spent way too much time on the Middle East at the expense of important topics like the Asia-Pacific region, Europe, Latin America etc. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the speakers 100%. Most were fascinating, but a few (especially the climate change speakers) were a little bland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a few more smaller assignments could improve the class, but really enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The course changed too much - final essay became presentation and essay. There was not enough information given about the workload before the shopping period ended. This change meant my reading period was a lot more intense than i had planned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were that we had a diverse range of topics to discuss, and that section was interesting and beneficial. This course could be improved if perhaps the first two essays were due at different points in the first half of the semester rather than together, and also if we had more lectures by Professor Sky herself. Most of the lecturers were great, but some were more engaging-- and I wish they could have come more than once. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths -- Sometimes we had interesting speakers. Weaknesses -- Many flaws. If you want an A or A- (through effort and hard work), I think you should avoid this class. In my opinion, there wasn't too much of a connection between knowledge/good work and the grade you receive. Many students said the same thing. ",

This meant that some lectures were pretty bad wile others were fascinating. I appreciated the casualness of the class, but it could have had a stronger stucture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is good because it allows you to get a feel for which professors and topics most appeal to you. But its weakness lies in never going very deep in any particular area. If there had been better framing to tie all the topics together, it would have felt less disjointed. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing lectures and lecturers, fascinating topics. Weaknesses: touched on so many topics in a shallow way that I'm not sure what I learned as a whole+ assignments could've been connected to the material better. Could use more rigorous structure and leadership from the professor, and perhaps less guest lecturers. Readings were too much and often never came up in class or section, would be better to have less readings per class that will be referenced in lecture and discussed thoroughly in section. ",

            "\u00a0Since this course has new lecturers basically every class, it is very up and down. Sometimes the lecturers would be great and engaging such as those on the chinse economy and nuclear proliferation. However, more often than not the lectures would be bland and somewhat pointless. I wish this course had more lectures from Emma Sky covering the history and present situation of places like the Middle East. I thought all of Emma Sky's lectures were great, but we only got around 3 of them the entire semester! ",

Emma Sky is also great. ",

I was disappointed to see that Emma Sky only taught a few lectures. Instead, older, boring professors came in to teach lessons during which most of the class did not listen.

            "\u00a0I would! I found it gave me a base of knowledge on global politics and sparked my interest in fields of study I otherwise would not have pursued. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I highly recommend! This course is wonderful, in that it creates well-informed Yale students about current global issues. I loved interacting with others from various places in the world and hearing perspectives that differ greatly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it has something for everyone, whether one wants to major in Global Affairs or simply wants to take an interesting class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to explore a lot of topics and hear cool people speak then you should take this class. However, don't go into it thinking that you'll really be able to learn about something because it is a bit spread thin. ",
            "\u00a0I would only recommend this course if the student has very little prior exposure to what's going on in the world for the past few decades. If they have kept up with politics at all, something more challenging would be more worth their time and energy. ",
            "\u00a0Yes and no. If you want a broad/surface level overview and hear diverse world fellows speak...then yes. This would be a good class. However, if you want a deeper understanding of the topics (although the middle east was covered very thoroughly), I would recommend taking a smaller seminar or a more specific lecture class. I think this class tries to cover too much. The workload is pretty low so it could be an interesting fourth or fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you truly care about global affairs! It also is great if you want a baseline for this information without a super heavy workload. ",
            "\u00a0If you really need a social science gut, take this but beware that there is both an oral and written component to the final. If you do not like withstanding section and a whole lot of superficiality, please do not take this course. ",

            "\u00a0Yes!!! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This introductory class really hooked me on global affairs and foreign relations.  If a student is interested in any sort of major involving foreign relations, this class is a must. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to only one specific kind of student: a student who felt they were completely ignorant of global affairs and international policy. I would not recommend this class to any student wishing to learn more about global affairs from a truly international perspective, any student wishing to learn more about solutions to global affairs beyond US and UN policy, or to any student who would like to engage with any specific interest. I would encourage any student considering taking this class to consider very carefully whether an introductory class in global affairs is likely to produce meaningful learning opportunities for them.

            "\u00a0If you want to pursue Global affairs, then this is a great class to get a taste of many professors that we might meet in the future. However, if you're trying to learn critical skills or become a somewhat expert in an area, this is definitely not the class. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Great instruction and extremely interesting regardless of one's interests. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, definitely. ",

            "\u00a0Absolutely. Great introductory course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you want to become more literate on global issues. Although it is a very first year-dominant course, I think anyone would benefit from hearing the lecturers and learning about current events and conflicts. Section is actually interesting, as we often had debates and also free discussions. The lectures weren't the most engaging lectures I've ever been to, but I would recommend actually going to them in order to get the most out of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, its interesting as a lecture series. ",

            "\u00a0This class was a bad experience for me. I would not advise you to take it. I perceived it to be disorganized, and a LOT of work, with three 5-page papers and a group presentation. To me, it seemed as though there was not much of a connection between knowledge/good work and the grade you received. There were a bunch of flaws I had never before encountered in any other class (three five-page papers with vague topics - and 2 of them are due the same day, a group presentation with unclear instructions and grading criteria)... ",
            "\u00a0A great intro class! ",

            "\u00a0Yes. It was my favorite class of the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend the class, but only if that person has space in their schedule for something less serious. Some of the lecturers and their stories are really interesting and it was a great privilege to hear them speak, but the class as whole felt like it didn't have much fo a direction. ",
            "\u00a0I think its a cool class to take first year, or as something to attend interesting lectures for. Beyond that its not a class meant for developing deep knowledge or understanding. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly, no. There are definitely countless other courses I wish I took. I thought this was going to be a good introduction into global affairs and global politics in general, but found the class to be of little value. I recommend simply taking a more concentrated class on something you're interested in and exploring the major of global affairs in a different way. ",
            "\u00a0yes. for an introduction into an area Yale is very strong in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great intro to global affairs and the middle east. ",

            "\u00a0This course will not improve your writing. The assignments are random and unclear. The lectures are meant to be interesting because they cover very interesting topics, but I found them super boring. Take this class if you want something incredibly easy but unfulfilling because you can get by without even going to lecture. ",
