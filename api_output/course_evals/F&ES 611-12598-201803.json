This was really great, because I have become cognizant of available state-of-the-art tools that can be very useful in solving not just environmental problems, but challenges in other disciplines. ",

I am very glad I took this course the first semester of my PhD, because (now that I have taken FES 611) I have a better understanding of what data science techniques are out there, I will be able to dive deeper into ones that are more specific to my own research as I continue with my education. ",

I also liked the wide range of speakers we had; I would actually say that I would've preferred more speakers or demos as opposed to student presentations. ",

A weakness is that it is hard to know which topics you are interested in exploring further in workshops because many of the workshops occur at the beginning of the semester before a large chunk of the material is covered. ",
