            "\u00a0More coherent final section.\r\nOption for different paper topics ",
            "\u00a0The course was fairly disorganized. It would be better if the class more strictly adhered to the syllabus regarding examinations. I think it would also be useful to create a syllabus that listed all the planned lecture topics on the day in which the lecture will be given, so students can come mentally prepared. It would be useful to make the modules more concrete and outlined before the lectures in said module are given (such as was done with the hematology module) because it oriented the lecture within the module. I would suggest to lecturers to focus less on their personal research. I would have lecturers submit their questions to the exam rather than having it written by a third party, unlike what was done with the hematology lecture. I would suggest, if possible, that lecturers are informed of the prior lecture content, in order to prevent repetitive information. I think it would be better for students to have more choice in the subject of their final paper--maybe not complete autonomy, but perhaps several options instead of just the one. Overall, I think that the topics addressed in the class were very diverse and interesting, I just think that the class could be further enhanced with a greater sense of organization. ",
            "\u00a0The organization seemed a little underdeveloped and there were parts of the course that I thought would occur and then didn't or vv. The content was very interesting, but wasn't always consolidated well and lecturerers didn't always seem to know what exactly they should be teaching us. It has a lot of potential though, and I did enjoy learning beyond my normal scope of topics. "
