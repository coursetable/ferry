            "\u00a0I learned a huge amount about the cultural and social elements of European history that would have been more or less neglected by any other professor. ",
            "\u00a0The course taught me how to see European History in a new, more social focus.  The books put a fun take on the human aspect of European history.  I also learned a lot about how societal changes and influences altered history. ",
            "\u00a0This course was essentially an in-depth AP Euro; pretty much your typical European history survey course. ",
            "\u00a0This class was extremely rewarding. It provided a fantastic overview of basic European History and through the perspective of Professor Merriman, there were many interesting and insightful lectures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about European thought and developed from Absolutism to WWII, analyzing and understanding the major themes in Europe at that time. ",
            "\u00a0Summary of modern European history. Outsize focus on France and the early 20th century. ",
            "\u00a0Since I never took AP Euro in high school, I'm glad I took this course just to learn some new material. Though the reading wasn't too heavy in this class as we only had two lectures a week, it still forced me to spread the reading throughout the week rather than waiting till the night before. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the importance of comparative historiographical methods in the study of history. Weekly writings sharpened critical thinking skills and lectures were nuanced and carried forward each week's important themes. This course constituted a detailed study of the history of modern Europe and the themes which underly European history and sociopolitical thought. The course paints a vivid picture of the cultural landscape of the European continent. The course teaches you how to construct historical arguments in a rigorous and meaningful way. ",
            "\u00a0In this course, I gained a general understanding of European history, from the 1600s to the end of World War II. In addition to learning about the historical events that took place in this time period, I learned about regional themes of nationalism, pugnacity among some of the European nations, and other themes of mass movements and revolutions that connected these events. ",
            "\u00a0Historical analysis and a general understanding of the events of the last few centuries from a European (and often Francophile) perspective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about many different aspects of European history over a broad sweep of time, which is impressive for one course. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about Russian/Soviet, Eastern European, and Central European History. I also learned a lot about historiography and the different types of historical interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0Broad base of European history ",
            "\u00a0An overview of modern European history. Covering political, economic, and social themes from the early modern period to WW2. Basically AP Euro, but in greater depth with amazing lectures, engaging sections, and supplementary films. ",
            "\u00a0This class taught a fair amount about the working class in Europe during this period as well as some of the nuances of European politics of the time. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: always engaging and despite being an \"overview\" history class, I learned lots of specifics about Euro history. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman is very good at giving an overview of a period in a short lecture. We sped through some elements of the history that I would have been interested to know more about, and I almost wish there had been another paper so I could have explored more topics. But he is an incredibly passionate professor, and he really brought the subject matter to life. ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in both its depth and expanse.  The book tied together the lectures well, and there was a unique focus on the human aspect of history.  There weren't many weaknesses, and sections really tied everything together well. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that you do learn a lot and lectures are very lively/interesting; the weakness is that there is sort of a lot of reading (it depends a lot on the week). Some weeks we had over 500 pages, other less than 40. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in this class were all very interesting. There was not a single dull lecture in my opinion. Professor Merriman is also an incredible lecturer and provides many interesting details and insights that not many other professors would. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course was good, but it incentivized the wrong behavior. Students who diligently read the textbook (in addition to the lectures) were actually at a disadvantage in terms of grading. The midterm did not test major themes in the course; rather, it tested specific vocabulary words that really were not all that relevant to what we had learned. Professor Merriman sent around emails with terms to know, and if one never read the textbook and instead just learned those few words, they would do better on the midterm. If they studied the textbook and tried to have a grasp of the material, there would be too much to learn and the midterm would be too difficult and cover too much material. ",
            "\u00a0The course was slightly unorganized and we never knew what was going to be emphasized in tests. Perhaps having a general list of important topics and events, of important ID's, etc, would be good to have.  And unfortunately, it was very easy to fall behind on the class readings.  But the biggest strength by far was Professor Merriman himself.  His anecdotes were very entertaining as well as very relevant to the course.  But mostly, it was how Professor Merriman was able to breath life into the history we were reading about that made the course so great. ",
            "\u00a0The course is focused enough to allow for detailed study: this is a strength. Rather than shallow summary, the course prefers deeper and particular analysis of evidence. In this way it recreates the work of real historians more accurately than many survey courses. The course also finds a strength in the exceptionally talented Prof. Merriman, whose lectures are characterized by wit, dry humor, and, at the end of it all, exceptional profundity. The discussion sections developed and delved deeper into the material and provided opportunities for creativity and expression. ",
            "\u00a0This course was a good survey course to European History, with a variety of different mediums used to engage students, from lectures to discussion sections to movie screenings to relevant novels. However, lectures seemed to be disorganized in structure, and I would have appreciated if there were other secondary sources used to complement the course, other than Merriman's European History text. ",
            "\u00a0The instructor was very animated and drew on his personal experience researching the subject matter. In addition, the instructor used interesting sources such as artwork during lecture. The instructor's textbook used was excellent, but it might have been interesting to study a few contrasting perspectives on the historical events discussed. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman and my TF Jonny Bunning were fantastic. Professor Merriman is an exceptional scholar of Modern European, French, and Polish history, and was extremely engaged with students. I cannot think of a way to improve this course. ",
            "\u00a0I like this course because I think the lectures and readings interact really well. Instead of repeating material, the readings give good background for lectures which were more specific and specialized. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastically taught but hard to improve or get a sense of improvement ",
            "\u00a0I think it would have been interesting to cover more arts and culture of the different European epochs and relate them to contemporary themes. A few of Merrriman's lectures contained relevant paintings which supplemented his notes nicely. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this class was very reliant on the textbook to teach the actual history while Merriman would focus lecture on various characters or moments he found important or interesting. At times that made the class seem like an arbitrary journey into Merriman's personal favorites. But I also understand that a lot of students found him very engaging and that he made history \"come to life\". "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0If you are considering what concentration to focus in as a History major, definitely take this class!  If you have any interest in European history, take this class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Merriman brings European History to life! He is so passionate, has fun teaching and loves his students. This class is a great over view, and while it does move fast, it is still very much worth taking and doing the reading to catch things you missed in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great survey of European History and I highly recommend it as good introductory history class. You will have fun taking it and learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as they are interested in the topic and ready to read a lot. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are interested at all in European history or if you are looking for an engaging class. The material is very useful and the readings are all very good. Not too much work, especially if you can keep up with the readings, which is not too hard to do if you're diligent. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a good course, but don't read the textbook thoroughly and don't expect to do all of the work, such as the assigned books and movies. It was too much for anyone to reasonably complete all the assignments, especially the second half of the course. ",
            "\u00a0If you're interested in European history and haven't taken it before (it's similar to AP Euro), then I'd recommend. 1 midterm, 6-8 page paper, and a final. Work is manageable, and Merriman rambles a little but is very knowledgeable and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course if not because you are interested in European History, then just for Professor Merriman.  He is such a character and truly epitomizes the personality of a Yale professor.  I would look forward to going to lecture simply to hear his very interesting (and entertaining) lectures.  But the best parts about Professor Merriman were his enthusiasm for the material and his ability to bring the historical events we were reading about to life.  At the very least, you should shop the class just to see Professor Merriman in action.  If you do end up taking the course, make sure to not fall behind on readings.  Professor Merriman only covers some of the important ideas in lecture, and you have to read about the rest of it.  Also the lectures are just not as beneficial if you go in not having done the readings.  All in all, a solid, laid back history course covering some very interesting European History. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course to another student interested in European history or (like me) a history major who needs a course outside of their region and doesn't want to dive too deep into topics they don't know much about. Lectures seemed fairly disorganized but fun if you go (they're also online), and Merriman's clearly an expert. Actually, the whole course was fairly disorganized, but to the teaching team's credit there is a ton of content to cover in European history from 1648 to 1945. Fairly heavy on France-related and nineteenth-and-twentieth-century-related history. Overall, it was fine. I think I got out of it what I put into it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you're genuinely interested in learning modern (mainly Western) European history, either as a history major or not. However, if you've taken AP Euro or don't want to take a humanities class that is too euro-centric, then try taking something else. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, certainly. Anyone will be able to find some part of the course which interests and engages them. This history is essentially important for our understanding of the world today. And Prof. Merriman is a great orator. ",
            "\u00a0If you're really interested in British and French history, take this class. Professor Merriman doesn't really focus on any of the other countries besides the events of Nazi Germany and the Russian Revolution (which are really too significant to ignore). The lectures are extremely hard to follow and the course generally lacks structure. ",
            "\u00a0This was a good survey course to European History, and I would recommend it to underclassmen looking to see whether or not the History major would be a good fit for them. However, I would hesitate before recommending this course to all upperclassmen, as it is a lot of introductory material, and the course covers a wide time period and a vast number of countries. It is a lot to sit through, and a little unsatisfactory not being able to delve deeper into some of the topics introduced in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. Very interesting lectures and the material is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course. I am not a history major and had little prior exposure to this material and gained exactly what I sought through this course. ",
            "\u00a0No matter what your history background, this course is perfect for you. For those very interested in the subject, the TFs and Professor Merriman are fantastic mentors. For those who know very little about European History, the course is organized to teach a large amount of content quickly, accurately, and thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I really liked this course. Merriman teaches European history through a social lens that I havent gotten in many other history courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially with a tough course load ",
            "\u00a0If Merriman is still teaching this course, it is a must take. His lectures are amazing, the best I've ever had. Definitely a Yale gem. Without him and Jonny(TA), this would have just been an upgraded AP Euro ",
            "\u00a0Definitely ",
            "\u00a0If you like Merriman take the class. If you don't, get out asap. Was clear that some people LOVED his teaching style, but I found it grated on me over the course of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes "
