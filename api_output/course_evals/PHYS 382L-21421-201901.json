            "\u00a0Experience in various lab types, learning to write formal reports, and receive and use feedback to make a better report. ",
            "\u00a0Lab book skills, writing a lab report, responding well to comments on lab reports, some experimental skills (not as much as you'd think, a lot of the experiments are already built, you just run them), running simulation, taking data with uncertainties, some programming ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible number of new skills from this course. Not did I gain more experience with a variety of analysis languages but I learned more about proper experimental method, how to record ongoing experiments, and how to derive conclusions from the evidence that I gathered. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing Lab class. You choose four labs to participate in and get assigned to two. Everyone is required to take the Ising Model lab. Each takes about one month to complete. I participated in:\r\nSuperconducting Tunnel Junctions and the Josephson Effect\r\nIsing Model\r\nPulsed NMR\r\n\r\nI would recommend each and every one of these labs. The Ising Model sometimes gets a bad rap, but honestly it's great and teaches you a lot about numerical simulation and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches you how to become a physics researcher, and it prepares you for the cycle of doing physics, writing papers, and defending your arguments. ",
            "\u00a0You learn the material specific to the labs that you choose to do. Many are quantum based, and this is the area I learned most about. The content is very specific to each lab though, so I suppose the biggest takeaway for me is having learned the process/expectations of a real physics lab. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write scientific papers in this class. I became far more comfortable using Matlab and Python and developed my research skills so much. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to collect and analyze data in the context of physics. I developed my MATLAB and Python skills and learned how to construct a lab report that relates these mathematical analyses to the physical phenomena. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Specifically the Ising Lab, there could be more guidance as to the code, what needs to be done, and how one might go about doing it. Many students might be doing this sort of coding for the first time and not be able to get good results, and thus lag far behind in this lab that everyone must take. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great instructors, experiments are super super cool, grading is transparent, getting comments back is really good, lots of interactions with TFs and teachers, well organized, learn about three topics in depth\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: experiment guides can have a few small typos, misleading phrasing. Some TFs/teachers more approachable than others. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course would be improved by switching lab partners for every lab. Other than this, the class was fantastic. I learned so much and gained a lot of confidence in my abilities in experiment and analysis. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Although this differed depending on which labs you chose, I thought that there was very little busy work, and the labs were intellectually demanding - as all good courses should be. Ton of resources: 4 professors, 7 TAs, expensive/cutting edge equipment ... it's honestly the closest you will get to experimental research in a lab class\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Though I was fine with this, it is 6 hours a week. While we didn't do much work outside of lab class, plan your papers well so that you don't just cram them into the last day.. ",
            "\u00a0I think the greatest strength of this course is the professionalism that the professors have for the students, which is a stark contrast to the beginner labs. There are enough experiments to choose from that nobody will feel that their interests are underrepresented. The one large weakness is that everybody must do the Ising lab, which could be fun but is bogged down by so much analysis that sometimes you lose track of the bigger picture. Although, the Ising lab does hone your statistics and programming skills, so I see it as more of a necessary evil than anything. ",
            "\u00a0I understand the benefit of the Ising model (it requires no equipment and many people can do it at once) but there is an extreme lack of support for this lab (which everyone was required to do). The code we were expected to use to generate data was flawed and unable to actually run for the duration needed to get good data. There was no assistance in fixing this issue. This was a major oversight and made this lab extremely frustrating. Additionally, the resources available for anyone using a Windows machine were quite lacking. ",
            "\u00a0This was an excellent course - one of the best Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0The class functions as a really great introduction to what real physics experiments look like. That said, I would recommend more structure around the writing of lab reports/notebooks, these are some of the crucial skills we learn (and at a much higher level than regular lab), but they aren't stressed through the instruction. ",
            "\u00a0Some strengths of the course are the ability of students to explore different types of labs (3 per semester) without rushing through them by taking on a new project every week. This means you really get to think deeply about one problem at a time. A major weakness, I felt, was that some labs did not have an introductory lecture or explanation. We were expected to read through 3 or 4 different and sometimes conflicting lab handouts that were not always totally relevant because the lab's setup had changed since they were written. It would be nice have an introductory theory lecture and an overview of the setup before each lab, or otherwise a single handout or reading that introduces the theory nicely. Sometimes I realized key aspects of what I was experimentally solving for halfway into working on the lab. Also, with some labs, it was difficult to get help because there was no TA available who was knowledgable about the setup, and the professor was busy with other labs. "

            "\u00a0Yes, it's required for the intensive major, the labs you perform are very interesting and you learn a lot about the subject matter. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, fantastic course. You do only three experiments, so you learn a lot about those three things. Great experience going in depth into a topic and doing research about it. Very similar to beginning of a real research project. Ising model was great at teaching some python and how to run simulations. We also did laser cooling, which was hard conceptually but amazing and informative, and quantum cryptography, which was kind of cool but not as exciting as the other two.\r\n\r\nOverall yes, I would recommend. Pick labs of the difficulty proportional to how much time you want to spend on the lab. All of the ones that we worked on you would get more out of it if you put it more time. ",
            "\u00a0Would really really recommend!!! This class was so much fun; you get to explore three different labs that you choose. The professors are super helpful and always available to explain and reexplain things. I worked on optical tweezers (this one is a lot of work, profs were not really prepped on this lab so we had to figure out most of it by ourselves), nuclear fusion (super fun!!! You get to use the particle accelerator. Isnt too hard and Prof. Lamoreaux is very helpful), and finally Ising Model (which everyone has to do. Really challenging, but very gratifying when you figure out how stuff works. Lots of computational work. The TAs are also very helpful during this lab, as is Prof. Navon). Overall, really a super interesting class even though it definitely requires a lot of work. But it is definitely worth it if you but in the work. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!!\r\nPlease take this if you are a Physics Major (intensive or otherwise) ",
            "\u00a0This was a lab course, and I normally HATE lab courses. But this one was actually ok. Not sure I would've taken it if it wasn't required, but overall it wasn't awful: I got pretty good at latex and I learned that I never want to do numerical simulations again. I was a little intimidated by the 6 hr class time per week, but it ended up being the case that I only did work outside of class 4 times over the course of the semester (when the 3 lab reports were due and when the final presentation was due). So the class ended up being pretty chill. Nowhere near as bad as 205. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to do physics research for a career, you have to take this lab. Otherwise, if you're just mildly interested in physics, I wouldn't put yourself through the ringer (although for a WR credit, it's actually not terrible). ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, you'll get through it. The workload is not that large, but depending on your preparation it may be very difficult. It's nice that it's a writing credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely without question. I learned more in this class than Ive learned in any other Ive taken here. The professors were very engaged and very invested in student learning. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend that anyone interested in going into physics (including non-intensive majors) take the course. It is a really great introduction into experimental methods, even if grueling at times. One piece of advice, even though Lamoreaux is amazing, don't do the fusion lab, I don't think its that interesting personally and can go wrong (even though it didn't in our case) and cause major setbacks. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. It is a very interactive work environment. You develop a better understanding of the phenomena you are working with by dedicating more than just a single week to each lab, you develop your coding and analysis skills, and you will learn a lot. Nevertheless, the work environment is collaborative and low-pressure which, for me, is the best environment to learn in. "
