            "\u00a0I became much more comfortable in my ability to understand and keep up with the language both in reading and listening, and I feel that I gained an understanding of some very interesting topics in Chinese culture through the lessons we studied.\r\nAlthough my vocabulary increased dramatically in the sense that I can now understand and recognize many more words, it is still very hard for me to come up with them when I am trying to speak. I became very efficient at memorizing vocabulary and got much better at reading and writing, however, I wish I could have improved my speaking some more. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to formally read and write in Chinese and to use more formal grammar structures. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a few grammatical structures, but mainly, you learn a lot of new vocab that can be used in interesting conversation. The topics covered range from the American dream to an AIDS epidemic, so the conversations are very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0This course helped me learn a vast amount of useful technical vocabulary and more advanced grammatical structures that vastly improved my writing abilities in Chinese. I feel like this course allowed me to expand my reading skills and aural-oral proficiency because the course was structured to expose us to a large range of vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0speaking, reading, writing Chinese ",
            "\u00a0I learned several things. Not only did I learn new vocabulary, but also interesting topics in Chinese culture & history, and more importantly how to look for help. It was really important for me as a first year to go to office hours and ask for help when I was struggling. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nThe weekly tutorial for one-on-one practice is a really helpful, as it is one of the only times you really get to practice your speaking. \r\nThe material covered in the lessons allows us to study more interesting things than just basic vocabulary, while learning the language.\r\nThe overall structure of the class is a big strength, as it forces you to practice reading, learn vocabulary, write essays, and practice speaking through the weekly voice notes to the class wechats. Presentations were also very interesting and helpful as opportunities to learn something new.\r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\nA weakness of the course was, in my opinion, that there was not enough emphasis on speaking and conversational Chinese. The tutorials and wechat discussions were the only times when we could practice speaking, and I feel that it was not enough, so I don't know how much more comfortable I am speaking Chinese now than I was before. On the other hand, the class allowed me to be much more comfortable understanding the language and reading. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the class is well organized and conducive to learning Chinese, but it's definitely more geared toward reading and writing than it is towards speaking. I really enjoyed going to class every day with Wang Laoshi, I thought she made material fun and engaging while still being serious about what we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: the daily quizzes really force you to stay on top of your studying and prevent you from falling behind. Weakness: this is the first time the course was taught three days a week as opposed to everyday, so it felt very rushed and I didn't have enough time to fully process everything we were learning. ",
            "\u00a0This course succeeded in teaching students useful vocabulary and grammar, both formal and colloquial, to allow us to speak more confidently about all of  the topics we learned about in class. One weakness was that in the transition this year with the course switching to being instructed only three times a week, we frequently did not have enough time to finish the instructor's presentations or have much time for in-class discussion as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0Too much work ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great textbook written by the course's teachers that incorporates lots of new, useful vocabulary; listening exercises on Canvas every unit are very helpful for your listening ability; not required to memorize how to write every new character by hand for daily quizzes, which makes less and less sense in a world where people now type Chinese on computers and smart phones; using WeChat for some homework assignments; predictable assignments and flow to each chapter. Weaknesses: Not enough time for practicing speaking, especially unstructured speaking; not enough class time -- this semester was the first semester the course was taught without meeting every day, and I personally think administrators should allow the department to switch the course back to a 1.5 credit class that meets every day.\r\n\r\nChinese tends to be a lot of work, but once you develop a system and get into a routine, improvement follows and your grade reflects that. Our WeChat responses every unit needed to be 3 minutes, and I ended up writing out most answers before reading them aloud -- potentially lowering the time requirement and asking students to jot a few thoughts down on the fly before diving into an unprepared response to the question would benefit students' ability to formulate language on the fly. Each WeChat assignment kind of felt like writing a short essay on the question before reading it aloud, and I still feel like I need to push myself to use new, more advanced vocabulary and grammar structured when I converse casually as opposed to just falling back on the simpler, less precise words and structures you learn in L1-L3. ",
            "\u00a0This is difficult to solve, but because first years who get tested in come from all different backgrounds. While at the end I did think that this was the right fit, I found it extremely difficult to adjust along with everything that is also new as a first year at Yale. "

            "\u00a0Yes, if you want to improve your Chinese and are ready to put in the effort this course is great! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to anyone who wants to speak more formal Chinese and learn about crucial grammar structures. I also think that for the payoff it's not a terribly difficult class; you have to do the work but the work isn't nearly as overwhelming as L1 and L2. I found myself enjoying going to class every single day, and I laughed a lot because Wang Laoshi knew how to incorporate jokes and new grammar and vocab incredibly well. It was a lot of fun. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course if you have any desire at all to continue learning Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student trying to improve their proficiency in Chinese. By the end of the semester I felt much more confident in my ability not only to speak, but also to read and write in Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The teachers are amazing, you'll improve so fast! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It's hard to see my tangible improvement on a daily basis, but if you enjoy learning Chinese and want to get better, you can't go wrong with CHNS 150 and especially Wang Laoshi. ",
            "\u00a0Yes because the topics learned were super interesting and the class was engaging. "
