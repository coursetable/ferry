            "\u00a0The class was different from other courses I've seen on China in that it was a great blend of Chinese history (limited, mostly to provide context) and current events (the majority of the course). This class was a great survey of many topics critical to understanding China more holistically -- we discussed Chinese culture (film, writing, etc.), politics (engagement with Africa, Central Asia, and the world more generally), and current developments (AI, cyberwarfare, economic development, etc.) ",
            "\u00a0The ability to understand China from multiple different viewpoints. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about modern China! very interesting course overall. ",
            "\u00a0China in the World was one of the best classes I have taken at Yale. I think Prof. Tsu was truly phenomenal. The fascinating thing about this class is that it didn't look at just the history of China's rise, but really took a stab at predicting the effects of a world with China as the ultimate player. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about current topics about China and how they are shaping the world order. Great thing about the class was that it thought me how to critically think and evaluate different writing and opinions on China. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about China's position as an emerging superpower in the world, the social, cultural, economic, and technological implications of its rise as a global leader and as an alternate to the West in the coming decade. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about various contemporary topics in Chinese politics and culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze historical texts and how to think analytically about China ",
            "\u00a0I honestly don't know. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: An interesting survey of topics (though perhaps more broad than deep).\r\nWeaknesses: The growth of the class from a seminar to a lecture created a lot of administrative/organizational issues, and this showed. It was frustrating having the syllabus change almost every other week (especially with assignments). Additionally, assignments were only ever released ~4 days before the due date (making it difficult to plan work ahead, and construct more thoughtful responses). TAs definitely faced a lot more work because of this change, but were basically non-communicative. ",
            "\u00a0I don't think this course should be taught as a lecture, because professor Tsu teaches in seminar format but there is no way to engage and no section to express your own veiw point. ",
            "\u00a0Not much to improve, except that I hope even more students can take it in the future. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing class giving a great outline of topics on China. The best was also learning how to be a critical thinker about these topics. ",
            "\u00a0The readings were really informative and Professor Tsu's lectures were engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I think the information in this class was very interesting, but I wish that we hadn't jumped around so much. The topics seemed a bit disconnected. ",
            "\u00a0You learn a lot but I wish it was more of a seminar style or if it had discussion sections. ",
            "\u00a0The prompts for the bi-weekly papers are very vague and unclear. Also, a 65 person seminar? Really? I understand why it had to be that way but it was not at all conducive to productive discussion. ",
            "\u00a0I really loved the topics of this course focusing on contemporary China but also learning about other fields in art and science fiction. I think discussion in class could have been a lot more engaging; I dont know if size was the issue (there were about 60 students but it was meant to be a seminar), but most discussions just felt like everyone stating their own opinions towards a very general question posed by Professor Tsu, rather than engaging with each others points. Perhaps if formatted as a lecture with weekly discussion sections, we could learn about contemporary China with more depth rather than just breadth. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Not really, unless the format of it is worked out. If it's offered as a seminar, take it--Professor Tsu is amazing. If it's still a lecture you wont get much out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The professor was very engaging and insightful. Learned a lot about China's possibilities in the future ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course 100%! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Professor Tsu is so knowledgeable about China and has extremely powerful insights and also amazing at teaching students how to be careful, critical, and observant when thinking about China and the news and writings about China that could often be biased. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend, especially if the student is interested in expanding their knowledge of China's history and how the implications of that history for its current rise. ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend it to someone who doesn't have a very strong background in contemporary Chinese topics, for I think it's a great introduction. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was pretty easy and I feel like it taught me a bunch, but I couldn't tell you what specifically. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this for anyone wanting to learn more about China or Chinese politics, but for someone who is already fairly familiar with China, you may not get as much out of the class. I especially loved the reading on Chinese typography and font design, but would like to see more integration on all the different topics we learned. It didnt feel like there was much continuity between units, and lectures lacked structure. "
