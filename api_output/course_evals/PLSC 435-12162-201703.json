            "\u00a0I learned a lot about certain interpretations of Islam and about the general history of a large portion of the Islamic world, including areas outside the Middle East, like Pakistan and India. The class included many primary texts in the readings, which was very helpful for better understanding certain thinkers and their ideologies. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the development of Islamic radicalism. Much of my previous knowledge was inaccurate or woefully incomplete. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot more about the progression of Islamic ideas in the modern era and their influence on political processes and identities. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a pretty comprehensive understanding of the origins of fundamentalist Islam in the late 18th century, and how that evolved into the jihad movements of the 20th and 21st centuries. The course is organized by country, covering Egypt, Iran, Palestine, Tunisia, Syria, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan, with additional sections on ISIS, al-Qaeda, and Islamic feminism. Personally, I learned a tremendous amount in this course in a way that helps me understand what is driving the fundamentalist Islamic movements that are so important in the world today. I'm a STEM major and probably won't have the opportunity to take a religious studies class again (side note: this class felt much more like history/political science than religious studies to me), yet I feel that I gained a tremendous amount out of the course and it was well worth taking. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a very broad overview of Islamic movements throughout the Middle East. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a ton about the modern political history of every (politically) major branch of Islam (Sunni, Shia, Alawite) as well as the current politics of most Islamic countries. I knew much of the not-current events covered in the course, and much of the history of was covered only briefly, so I'm not sure how much true history one could from this course. It's a modern history course, though, so that's fine.\r\n\r\nI also learned quite a bit about the ideologies of various terror groups and how they can justify the atrocities they commit, which made me re-evaluate how I view groups like the Islamic State.

            "\u00a0This is an incredible course. It's brilliantly put together, and really shows you the pathway through which influential ideas about Islam and Jihad emerged. Really cool to see how specific historical circumstances (eg. French invasion of Egypt, Soviet occupation of Palestine, Gulf crisis, 1967 Arab Israeli war...) are inflection points in the history of this discourse. It's so fascinating to see how these ideas about both classical jihad and the alternative conception about the importance of an Islamic State and the \"faraway enemy\" that prevents its realization converge. \r\n\r\nIn terms of recommendations: hearing Wazhma's perspectives during the Afghanistan unit was very special. Especially considering that this course (in part) focuses on the social and intellectual impact of historical events, it's important to hear perspectives like her's. I think it would be great to use sections to expand this kind of learning, and invite nationals of the countries we study to share their experiences living with the impact of the ideas we're studying. \r\n\r\nThe midterm was weird. The essays were very specific, and didn't ask about what I thought were the most important themes of the course thus far (Muslim Brotherhood conception of Islam and Qutb's intellectual breakthroughs). I think this is why the average was so low. The questions on the final were much more reasonable, and allowed students to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the themes of the course. A lot of the IDs on it were too easy, however. I don't think it's productive to ask people to write three sentences about ISIS - anyone can come up with a sufficient answer, people who have studied a lot don't know what aspects of the movement to talk about! I loved the structure of each week's essay options. The questions were well planned. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Clear notes from the professor \r\n\r\nWeakness: The course covered so much content in so many countries that I don't think I really understand enough about each one. ",
            "\u00a0Great survey, perhaps organization could be chronoligical rather than country by country but not sure if that would work. At times there was too much at once ",
            "\u00a0The material for this course is fascinating, and increasingly important, however the lectures could have been more engaging, and the midterm and final covered too much material. ",
            "\u00a0Readings were interesting; lectures were helpful, and section was useful. The terms sheets were a bit overwhelming, but if you imagine them as study guides, then they were very helpful. One complaint is that some of the IDs on the tests were more of \"gotcha\" questions than questions actually seeking to test our knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0Great combination of lecture and section! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Griffel and my TA, Wazhma. Professor Griffel is deeply knowledgeable about the course material and has taught this class for many years. I find his lectures genuinely interesting to listen to and very informative. In section, Wazhma was able to provide the interesting perspective of growing up in Afghanistan and also having taken the class when she was an undergrad at Yale. She's also really nice and wanted us to engage with the material. Additionally, expectations for the midterm and final were very clear, with a study sheet explaining what we needed to know about given the broad array of material we covered. The study sheets were long, but if you knew everything they covered, you were guaranteed a very good score on the exams.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: memorization for the exams. Some memorization is fine, but I felt the amount of dates and names we needed to memorize for the final in particular, but also the midterm, was somewhat excessive. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Definitely a great overview course, and Prof. Griffel is an endless stream of knowledge and insight. Lecture slides were generally great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I felt like the \"country a week\" structure was a bit confusing to study intellectual history. Relatively modern movements like the Taliban and ISIS were in the middle of the semester, while say, Maududi was at the end. I think there should have been a clearer picture of who influenced who and overall timeline.\r\n\r\nTests were graded pretty strangely as well. Memorizing exact dates really doesn't seem like that helpful of an exercise. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nMost of the readings were quite informative and fun to read. Lectures were fast-paced but very content-rich. Exams were a good balance of IDs and essays and actually required students to know information.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nSome readings (the book about the Muslim Brotherhood, everything in the book by Lapidus) were pretty dry. ",
            "\u00a0There is a lot of information to absorb and Professor Griffel does a great job imparting and organizing that information in a manageable way. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a lot of fun, the readings were interesting and not too grueling, and Prof. Griffel is an engaging lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0100%. This is an incredible course. It's brilliantly put together, and really shows you the pathway through which influential ideas about Islam and Jihad emerged. Really cool to see how specific historical circumstances (eg. French invasion of Egypt, Soviet occupation of Palestine, Gulf crisis, 1967 Arab Israeli war...) are inflection points in the history of this discourse. If you have some background in Arabic the ID terms for the essays aren't hard to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was an interesting lecture. Make sure you go to class lol and learn the IDs for the midterm. Some of the vocabs are in Arabic and could be hard to remember for the exams. The course has a pretty light workload but keep up because there is so much content. \r\n\r\nMakes me view the Middle East in a different way and when I read the news, I now know who's who, which is a pretty cool feeling like I'm sophisticated now. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this class! I highly recommend it to anyone who really wants to understand the Middle East conflict and get a perspective on Islam that is completely different from what western education traditionally provides. I feel like I am so much more acquainted with any discussion of foreign policy now that I have a solid understanding of the politics of each individual country. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Interesting and not too much work. ",
            "\u00a0As a political science major and considering the rising prominence of the Middle East in politics I would definitely recommend this class to a fellow student. We covered important history of topics that are largely misunderstood and portrayed with biases in the media, allowing us to truly understand them and form our own opinions. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course that covers a lot of ground and has great sources. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. Professor Griffel is a fantastic lecturer and really engaging. The subject material is very interesting and we do a good job in covering a wide variety of thinkers with their original work. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great and interesting course on one of the ways Islam has responded to the challenge of Western \"modernity.\" History majors, Global Affairs majors, and Religious Studies majors would all be interested in this course. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend; it is a LOT of reading but it's all interesting and the lectures are very engaging. I learned so much from this course and would highly recommend it to anyone even vaguely interested in fundamental Islam and the history of Islam in the Middle East and North Africa. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. You learn the kinds of things that realistically you'll never learn after Yale, but are really so important to understanding a religion with billions of followers. I'm a STEM major but still found the course to be very accessible, and lecture to be interesting. The workload is required section every week (ostensibly on the readings but people don't do them because too much reading is assigned), a five-page paper on a weekly topic (every Thursday, the professor posts a topic and you have a week to write the paper, so you just choose to write on any one of the topics during the semester), a midterm, and a final. The midterm and final consist of ID's (you're given a study sheet in advance) and essays (which also relate to the material on the study sheet). If you miss more than one section, you have to write a final 10-page paper instead of the anytime-in-the-semester 5-page one. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, although with the caveat that you will need to do some catchup at the beginning if you have no previous experience with Islamic studies. ",
            "\u00a0This course is great if you want in-depth answers to questions like, \"why do people care what's going on in Saudi Arabia?\" \"Why would anyone ever join ISIS?\" \"what's the difference between Sunnis and Shiites?\". Don't take this if you're looking for a course on Islamic history, but definitely take this course if you want to know about the ideology of the current events of the Middle East (also if you want to read ISIS's magazine!). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in the subject, and want to learn about the development of Islamic fundamentalism across the Middle East. "
