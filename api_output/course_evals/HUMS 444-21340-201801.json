            "\u00a0So much about Rome and just about life. Professor Jewiss is the loveliest, most interesting professor. She's a fantastic discussion leader and knows and cares so much for Rome in its entirety. She isn't afraid to take on hard issues and ask us to engage deeply with our minds and hearts, rather than a narrow academic approach. This class is beyond worth it! ",
            "\u00a0Wow! Amazing to cover so much history in one class. A little disappointed we didnt really get to talk about fascism but when it would have come at the expense of a Dante discussion, its hard to be too disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0This course moves through centuries of history from the founding of ancient Rome to almost present day. I learned more than I ever thought I would about history, theology, politics, and classical literature. Plus the skills of drawing connections, close reading, and analyzing visuals to better understand text. ",
            "\u00a0This course takes a fantastic approach to interdisciplinary learning, that forces students to consider how all aspects of a civilization contribute to its identity. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to look at museums, art, films, literature, etc in a completely new way. Definitely will contribute to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a great deal of interdisciplinary knowledge about the Roman empire and the evolution of the city of Rome through the Middle Ages and into the modern era. I also honed the skill of textual analysis, and started to develop a stronger sense of how non-textual elements (art, a building, even a natural event) can be read and analyzed. In short, I gained broad skills in the humanities and specific insights about Rome. ",
            "\u00a0Understanding of Rome, both the forces that shaped it during its founding and how those forces continued to influence its trajectory and interacted with other major forces throughout history. Also, I gained a better understanding of how to analyze and understand a variety of classical texts using an interdisciplinary approach. ",
            "\u00a0I learned of the history of the Roman monarchy period, Republic, Empire, as well as its fall and the rise of Christianity and some of the history that followed after up till the point of Mussolini. I developed a strong understanding of different ways of looking at recording history and how literature and myth, though not always factually true, affect cultural identity and shape society. I read in depth some of the works of historians, poets, and other thinkers who lived across a time period spanning millennia. Above all else, I learned about city of Rome's importance to the world as a political, religious, and cultural center and how its history and impact has affected societies throughout time and continues to leave its mark today.

            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS. It's a reasonable amount of work that introduces students to an infinite world of meaning. Professor Jewiss knows how to draw together every discipline into a coherent whole, and it makes the course fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Jewiss is so knowledgeable and intelligent, that it made the class excellent. The interdisciplinary approach - looking at images, primary sources, etc - was an enagaging way to learn that Yale should embrace more of. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very strong! The workload was a lot of reading but overall manageable. The only issue was that we had too much material to cover and not enough time. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an incredible interdisciplinary study to the history and identity of the city of Rome. All of the unique readings were incredibly interesting, and led me to make connections that I otherwise would not have. Additionally, the inclusion of art and architecture was something that I found unique to other humanities courses that I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0This class is engaging and energetic you learn so much about the trajectory of the history, culture, and urban landscape of the city of Rome. Professor Jewiss is so fun, and you will not be bored in class. It is mixture of a lecture and a seminar, which works well.\r\n\r\nThe main weakness lies in the organization of the course there are lots of assignments that are not always explained with enough clarity once, we all had to redo an assignment because we didn't do it to the correct standards. Had there been more clarity in the original explanation of the assignment, that probably would not have happened. Three more minutes of discussion about what the expectations are for the assignment would go a long way. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: wonderful reading list, assignments, etc. prof was amazing\r\nweaknesses: could've kept up with the syllabus a bit better ",
            "\u00a0This course is strong in that it covers such a broad terrain in terms of time, space, and content, but still manages to track cohesive themes throughout the history and literature of Rome. It is also very compellingly taught by Professor Jewiss, who is engaging, passionate, and eminently knowledgeable. \r\n\r\nOne weakness was that for some assignments, the specific expectations weren't entirely clear. For most things, this allowed for creativity and exploration. But for a few assignments, the particular type of response expected could have been emphasized more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great course, very useful readings, good pace in class - we fell behind but only because of how deeply we delved into the texts. Assignments were also super helpful in understanding the readings and fun to do. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0YES! TAKE THIS COURSE. It will make you a better person - better versed in history, better equipped to think about the present, and better prepared for the challenges of the future. ",
            "\u00a0Take it. Especially if you want to spend a summer in Rome. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student interested in Rome and its history, culture, and ideas. The course also comes with a spot to study abroad in Rome over the summer and continue your studies from class! I'm so excited to take advantage of this opportunity. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student. The unique opportunity to immerse yourself in all aspects of the study of one city/region, with Professor Jewiss as your guide, is something that you should not miss out on during your time at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I definitely recommend this class Professor Jewiss is so engaging, and you will learn in a unique and interesting way. Taking an interdisciplinary look at the city of Rome leads to a fascinating intersection of theology, history, art, literature, and architecture. I really loved the ways these things were in conversation with each other, and the way Professor Jewiss intertwines them. \r\n\r\nThings to know: there is a lot of reading, and not all of it is discussed in class. Be warned that the grading for the class is entirely unknown there are lots of assignments with no weight attached to them, which can be frustrating but is simultaneously sort of liberating. Some of these assignments are creative, so make sure to know that for example drawing a shield, or writing as if you were one of the writers on the syllabus. Also, it is a real mix between a seminar and a lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0YES, definitely. Really changed the way I look at various forms of art, politics, etc. Such a wonder course. Virginia Jewiss truly loves what she teaches and that makes you want to do well for her. ",
            "\u00a0If you have any background or interests in the Classics, take this course! It will expand your outlook on the city of Rome and on the humanities in general. As someone who had taken Latin for years but never directly studied Roman society or how later historical periods viewed ancient Rome, this course was an enlightening experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its very well taught and Professor Jewiss is a fantastic professor. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  The reading list for the course is phenomenal and the interdisciplinary nature of the various assignments is refreshing and encourages broad-based learning.  Professor Jewiss always provides intriguing interpretations and insights.  Class discussions each week were rewarding for both contributors and listeners. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, FANTASTIC COURSE. Truly an enlightening and wonderful journey thorough 3 millennia's worth of literature, history, and culture. Professor Jewiss is AMAZING - extremely knowledgable and passionate about what she taught. The readings were hefty but doable, and definitely necessary to follow and contribute to class discussions, and the assignments were a lot of fun to complete. Definitely the most rewarding seminar I have taken at Yale, 10/10 would recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. Its focus on Rome will lead you to learn so much about not only the history of the Roman Republic and Empire, but on how societies come to evolve and change. If you never get to take the Roman Republic or the Roman Empire classes, this class will do a good job of teaching you a great deal about those parts of history. Dr. Jewiss is also a great lecturer and the assignments, though challenging, are not overwhelming. You get to read some very cool literature (think Dante and Virgil)  in the class too and analyze it. Overall, a very enjoyable class. "
