            "\u00a0I developed stronger conversational speaking skills and expanded my vocabulary in the language. I was able to converse with much more fluency as the course progressed. I also learned a good deal about Latin American history. ",

            "\u00a0This course could be improved by taking away perhaps one prueba and one composition. The almost weekly assessments (on top of an everyday class) is exhausting. ",
            "\u00a0One particularly strong aspect of this course is the in-depth class discussions about lectures and readings. One weakness of this course is the quick turnaround between exams/in-class essays/presentations. This class could be improved by more spread out assignments. ",
            "\u00a0The exams were not necessarily fair. They oftentimes focused on material that we never really covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the workload expectations are little bit too high for this course. Having a major assignment every week in addition to regular homework assignments was too much considering how many other courses students take. \r\n\r\nHowever, I did think the curriculum taught useful vocabulary and language skills and improved my fluency in the language. ",
            "\u00a0This specific section could have involved activities that went beyond having vague, shallow discussions about the reading and going over the previous night's homework. Sometimes it seemed like Professor Carreras didn't know what to do with the time. My Spanish would have improved more if we had more specific exercises for learning/using the grammar and vocab lessons. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and movies that were included in the course were interesting, and the grammar was mainly review. Sometimes the syllabus was unclear. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- really lax environment, so students are not stressed out, and this does not hinder their learning. Prof is always open to covering and reviewing whatever the students want.\r\nWeaknesses- lack of class structure can be more harmful than beneficial sometimes. Some of the SPAN 140 work is really a waste of time and does not develop any skills whatsoever. For example, sometimes their is irrelevant homework when we have a test, quiz, essay (etc.) due in class the next day. At least make the homework relevant to the content of the assessment... ",
            "\u00a0We did not speak nearly enough in this course. We rarely did partner work and when we did it was often to fill in the blank or some other activity that involved more reading out loud that speaking. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: many opportunities for talking \r\nWeaknesses: could have been more open-ended to encourage people talking about things they're interested in "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is looking to round out their spanish skills. If you can, take this course with Mercedes Carreras, she made learning fun and was extremely resourceful and flexible with make-up assignments for excused absences. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are interested in improving your Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend Intermediate Spanish to students who would like a more solid grasp of verb tenses and increase their vocabulary. I would not recommend it to students who have no interest in pursuing the language until completion because of how much time it takes up. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Prof. Carreras is a great instructor who cares about helping students learn. Best Spanish professor I've had at Yale ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course with a more rigorous instructor. But I think the overarching design of the course needs to be changed so that students have a reason to actually learn and use the lessons. ",

            "\u00a0Yes! Much less intense than other Spanish classes I have taken, so it was much less intimidating. "
