            "\u00a0It developed both my writing and acting, and helped me learn what it is to be creative. ",
            "\u00a0- What exactly a one person play is and their significance not only in the world of theater but all fields.\r\n- How to trust my own creative process and allow it to be nurtured in many ways.\r\n- How to become more grounded within myself before attempting to display a work of art for others to see.\r\n- How to take constructive criticism.\r\n- To become comfortable being uncomfortable. Discomfort only lasts as long as you will allow it to. ",
            "\u00a0This course, more than anything else, taught me how to approach artistry. As somebody who has never really been involved in performance art, I had a very skewed perspective of what performance art actually entailed, and this class gave me a lot of the knowledge and resources to understand artistry from an artists perspective. Professor Brooks had us keep a journal every day, which really developed my ability to reflect and work with my own thoughts and emotions as art. In-class acting exercises showed me different techniques of approaching performance and portraying different characters as a single actor, methods of switching between them and accurately capturing a person in their essence without losing your audience. ",
            "\u00a0Public speaking; improvisational skills; writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0This class dove into different strategies performers use when it's just them onstage in front of an audience. Techniques learned included the strategy of direct address, hyperextended characters, and quick character transitions (in a multi-character play). The class wasn't explicitly focused on theory or practice, but the readings and weekly performance exercises helped us develop both an academic and practical approach to the process. ",
            "\u00a0This course exposed me to a realm of theatre that I had never experienced before. Going into the semester, I had never seen a one-person play, so I didn't know what to expect from the course. I found myself wrapped up in a very unique art form which allows for freedom through restriction. Over the semester, we watched a multitude of one-person performances and studied the elements that led to the creation of each one. We did in-class exercises to develop our writing voices and worked towards creating our own show. This class was an excellent exercise in artistic development. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write and present one person performances using a variety of techniques based on the work of other artists. In doing so, I learned how to better observe people for research and I learned how to tell stories that are unique to me as a person. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt how to overcome barriers to writing and to motivate myself to write and criticize my own work to make it as authentic as possible. Learnt certain exercises to help me with my writing and different techniques performance artists use in their work. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about different kinds of one-person plays as well as methods of creativity in order to facilitate the writing process. "

            "\u00a0Although we were given very valuable guidance on performance and the process of creativity that manifests itself primarily in the first draft of a play, I felt more guidance in the process of actually writing would have been very useful. Techniques to employ and differences in styles. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Hal's personal background in the arts and how he can provide many different outlooks for one's questions\r\n- Trips to New York to see John Leguizamo's one person show, \"Latin History for Morons\"\r\n- Notable visitors such as Jeffery and Susan Mays\r\n- Growing and developing such personal stories with other freshmen around you\r\n- Being forced to journal, and finding that it is a magnificent way to understand your thoughts and actions with more clarity \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- There is less focus on the composition, and there should be a few more activities in class to help with the writing of the midterm and final\r\n- Better scrutiny for the readings is needed\r\n- Sometimes there is too many readings and/or viewings assigned to fully grasp everything in the material ",
            "\u00a0The materials, resources, and exercises that we worked with in this class were some of the best parts of it. The morning pages in particular, while sometimes tedious, were a really valuable way of reflecting and working on my art every day. Working with my incredibly talented peers was also a huge gift in this class, as it seemed to breed a sense of kinship and cooperation between us that I have not found in other courses.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue I had with the class was with feedback. Especially during the writing and editing process, I was often unsure of what Professor Brooks was looking for or what suggestions he might have. Office hours were mostly just a conversation, with him asking how our progress was and hearing different ideas for our plays. While this was helpful as a sounding board, I often did not get significant feedback on the writing during the process, which was sometimes frustrating. Feedback that we received after the midterm and the final was very insightful and helpful, but I think it would be helpful to have an opportunity for more structured feedback during the writing process. ",
            "\u00a0I found that there was very little focus on actually \"composing\" the one-person play. I got little to no constructive criticism on my play the time that I did have the opportunity to share with everyone. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposure to a wide variety of writing and performing techniques.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: sometimes it felt as though we were unable to dive too deeply into some of these techniques due to time constraints. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Hal is a great guy, and the readings are enticing and thought-provoking, if sometimes infuriating. The class is structured well and consistently, with the beginning of class focusing on analysis of previous readings, and the second half focusing on practical applications of strategies learned through the readings. The midterm is a good starting point for the final, and helps students develop their piece in preparation for the final. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Due to the fact that class only met once a week, it was hard to get any real momentum going, so each week felt a bit like starting anew. I didn't enjoy the morning pages assignment (every day, students have to write three pages in a journal -- a feasible but surprisingly time-consuming task) because I found that it took time away from doing my other work without providing me with any real creative breakthroughs. Additionally, I didn't feel that the grading in this class was scaled appropriately to the comments given. Because performance is so subjective, I understand that some grading disparities are to be expected, but I often heard students complain that the class was graded unfairly and that Hal didn't give enough real criticism to help improve for future performances. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this course was great for deepening my understanding of theatrical performance. I have a background in theatre, but I feel that the course might've been a bit intense for anyone without a basic knowledge of stage performance. Overall, I felt that the course was very well-structured, but I wish that there had been more attention given to the creative process of coming up with an idea instead of just focusing on developing that idea into a show. The course definitely walked through what to do with an idea to develop it, but I found it difficult to get the idea to begin with. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the course was very good at giving students the platform to practice performing OPP's as every class had sections for students to present, however there was very little prep for the writing component. I also feel that some of the exercises became repetitive and some readings were less relevant to the course than others ",
            "\u00a0This course definitely motivates you to write and it is satisfying to emerge with an end product and certain exercises and readings did suggest a few techniques or exercises you might use in developing your play. However, there was really very little guidance when it came to the process of writing. The organization of the course felt very random and sporadic and it would help to have a more systematic approach to dramatic writing. There was also very little focus on the performance aspect despite the course title suggesting that there would be some aspect of performance instruction. The discussions around the course material and the papers were all very vague and not very helpful. Exactly what skills were learnt or what was expected from the students was very unclear throughout which made the assessments quite frustrating as there was little transparency in exactly what was being assessed and how it was being assessed. Frankly, this course could be entirely self taught with the same results. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - the material was engaging and the class discussions were always lively. The work I produced from this class is some of the class is some of the best dramatic work Ive ever done \r\nWeaknesses - the once a week seminar does not allow for much feedback on work, especially in the way of acting for the midterm and final "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes. I think it is a challenging one, and the challenge can be quite frustration at times but the result is very worth it. Having the final exam be a concrete play is very fulfilling. You really see the work you create. It also pushes you creatively in a way that is very powerful and I think valuable for anyone who wants to develop that part of them-self. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! By taking this course, you become more aware of your capabilities as both a writer and a performer. You do not need any experience at all in either playwriting or acting. We all have a muse that inspires us to create, and Hal helps everyone see that. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. As somebody who had never done any theatre before this class, for me this was an eye-opening and thrilling course to take. Hal Brooks is a thoughtful and engaging professor. The materials (readings, films, scripts, etc.) are fantastic and often bring a new perspective on the meaning of art and how we express ourselves. This course is certainly an emotional and intellectual challenge, but it is absolutely worth it. ",
            "\u00a0It is a really interesting course. Be prepared to watch a lot of performances and read many short plays or books. Sometimes the work will feel unrelated to the goal of the class. But it will open your eyes to a different genre of performance, which is really cool. ",
            "\u00a0Any student looking to improve their writing and/or performing skills should take this class. My only gripe is the morning pages (3 pages of personal journalling per day), as I found it too easy to fall behind on those, but I know many people for whom they were useful, and I think having to complete them was valuable to me in building discipline. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to students who want an introduction to a theater studies class that won't be too rigorous in terms of workload. Unfortunately, I also didn't feel that the class was too intellectually engaging, either, and the grading can be very difficult. That said, Hal is a great guy, and it can be great to get direction from him every week, as he is a really good director. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course for anyone with an interest in theatre, whether from an acting or a writing perspective. Although the course focused more on the writing side of things, we did a few exercises that helped me develop my performance abilities. The material covered in this course (developing ideas, exploring themes, creating a cohesive body of work) is applicable to virtually any other field of study, regardless of whether it's STEM or humanities. More than any other course I took this semester, I felt that this course demonstrated what a Yale education can be. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a fellow student, although I think it is suited to a particular type of person. I unfortunately found out through the course of the semester that one person plays are not particularly engaging for me as a creator, but Hal still teaches you very valuable skills for being a better artist: how to work professionally, how to work with an audience, how to observe people to inform your work, etc. Hal is also a great director so you should volunteer as much as possible to receive his practical feedback, and I do wish he did that more during the classes. ",
            "\u00a0If the main goal of the student is to make themselves sit down and write, this course will help you do this. However, this course does not provide you with a clear set of useful skills to approach dramatic writing or performance and I cannot say that I would recommend it, based on the expectations the course set out.
