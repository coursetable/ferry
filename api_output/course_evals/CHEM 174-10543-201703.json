            "\u00a0I developed a vast amount of knowledge taking this course. Coming in, many other students had already taken some form of organic chemistry in high school, either through IB classes or local colleges, but I had no prior organic chemistry experience. At first, this class was far too difficult for me and extraordinarily confusing, as everyone else seemed to already know what was going on. As the semester progressed, however, I was forced to develop skills quickly to catch up, and I feel like I learned more because of this. This class reinforced my love of chemistry and might even lead to me switching from MBB to chemistry as a major. ",

            "\u00a0Theories of organic chemistry (MO, bonding, stability, acidity/basicity, stereochemistry, reactivity, conjugation and aromaticity); more factual knowledge like reagents and mechanisms and nomenclature; and growing intuition for synthesis problems and justifying mechanisms. ",

            "\u00a0In taking this course, I felt that I was able to get a good grasp of the basics of organic chemistry. The beginning of the course started off fairly slowly and I could understand all of the content being taught without even reading the textbook. However, as the course progressed, the difficulty definitely increased as I learned material that I had never been exposed to before. ",
            "\u00a0By taking CHEM174, I learned why reactions happened, and didn't simply memorize them. I developed a new appreciation for chemistry as a subject, as well as a stronger confidence when dealing with it in an academic setting. In addition, I learned how to read and outline academic material, very quickly. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about organic chemistry through this course; I didn't think that I would be able to learn so much from one course in the span of one semester! I also learned effective study habits through the flipped classroom format of this course; I knew early on that I needed to stay on top of the reading and the material in order to learn effectively during class, and maintaining this habit definitely helped with the material and with studying for exams throughout the course. This course definitely helped me improve my study habits, and I plan on taking these habits with me throughout my Yale academic career. ",
            "\u00a0I did not know anything about organic chemistry before this course. However, this course made it easy to transition into organic chemistry. I've developed a solid foundation in organic chemistry and feel prepared for 2nd semester. I've learned many reactions and mechanisms and also learned to justify them with MO theory. Additionally, I've learned how to use retrosynthetic analysis to solve difficult synthesis problems. I've also learned how organic chemistry applies to medicine and many other real-world applications. ",

That said, there are a few difficult topics that will require extra review, but there are discussion sections, office hours, and study halls so often that there is always help available.  In the class, understanding of concepts is stressed such more than memorization, which is different from a common organic chemistry class, but far more helpful. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a good intuition for chemistry. Since each problem in Organic Chemistry can be made unique, I feel that I developed a working sense for reactivity, mechanism, and product-formation. The synthesis questions near the end of the course were the ultimate test of chemistry knowledge gleaned from the semester, and they were challenging because one had to assemble a chain of reactions to obtain a certain complex product. Mastery of these questions definitely indicate the high-level of Chemistry that was taught. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of organic chemistry mechanisms (ex: hydrobromination, ozonolysis, oxymercuration/reduction) and topics such as MO (molecular orbital) theory, stereochemistry, regiochemistry, enantiomers vs. diastereomers, reduction vs. oxidation, retrosynthesis, etc. ",

I learned about trends in electronegativity, reactivity, acidity, basicity, and stability in various organic molecules.

This  includes (but is not limited to) molecular orbital theory, arrow pushing mechanisms, resonance structures, determining acidity and basicity, cyclohexane conformations, alkene reactions, alkyne reactions, aromaticity, and retrosynthetic analysis. Overall, this course was packed with information, and I learned a lot each day. ",

            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course was that, although it was a large, semi-lecture based class, we sat in small groups of eight. Having a small group to study with and work through in-class problems with was invaluable and made it far easier to learn the material. The biggest class weakness is the pre-class homework. I found doing the pre-class problems to be very difficult and not very helpful to my understanding of the material the following day. I feel that if the homework focused on what was already taught that day, it would better reinforce the topics rather than confusing them. ",
            "\u00a0I'm not a fan of the flipped class system and the Sapling problems were often annoying, but Tim did lecture on the more difficult topics which was helpful. Also the group-setting of the class was helpful. ",

            "\u00a0The flipped classroom was not as good as a lecture would have been, but the class was good nonetheless. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: active learning (lots of practice problems in homework and in class), collaborative, freedom to ask questions in class.\r\nWeaknesses: a lot of memorization of reagents and mechanisms; actual explanation of theory in class lectures limited because of time spent on practice problems. Sometimes irrelevant material on homework. ",
            "\u00a0This course teaches a lot and does it well. The flipped course can be hard to get used to but was enjoyed by the end of the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Certainly facilitate class bonding\r\nWeakness: Flipped classroom was relatively ineffective for my personal learning ",
            "\u00a0One weakness of the course is that the students must be able to learn a lot through reading the textbook. Due to the flipped schedule, the students' first exposure to new material is through the textbook and with more difficult concepts, this can be tough. I remember that at one point I didn't really understand the assigned readings and it was only after we went over it in class a few days later that I finally understood the material. I believe this prevents students from getting everything they could out of the textbook as they are unable to pick up more intricate knowledge if they struggle with understanding the general concept as a whole. I believe that if we went over concepts in class before being assigned the reading, it could be more beneficial to the students.\r\n\r\nOne strength of the course is that the flip style allows us to practice the types of questions asked on the exam many times before they are on the exam. This helps us build confidence in solving these types of problems. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\n- flipped classroom style\r\n- engaged TA's and peer tutors\r\n- incredible professor\r\nWeaknesses\r\n- last midterm on final day of classes\r\n- lack of in-class preparation for ACS portion of final exam ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course was the availability of help and the amazing amount of support the peer tutors and TFs offered. A weakness of this course was that it was flipped, which required a lot of work outside of class to understand lecture and to do well. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped-classroom style is an incredibly effective learning model--if you have the time to invest in the readings. A strength of this model was that I felt like I was able to get so much out of the class when I kept up with the readings outside of class and was able to take in-depth notes. I was able to come to class prepared with a conceptual understanding of the day's topics, and this allowed me to ask informed questions and solidify my understanding with practice problems. That said, the readings take a LOT of time, and if a student is taking an intensive course load outside of organic chemistry then it can be difficult to keep up. This was the case with me; there was a stretch of a week and a half where I wasn't able to keep up with readings, and most of the concepts in class went over my head as a result.\r\n\r\nI don't have any experience with an organic chemistry course that is not flipped, but I expect that there are trade offs with either model. Flipped classroom seems to result in a better understanding of topics, but only because it seems like you're doing more work outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0The class was well-organized, and there were always resources available to help students clarify concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This is a well-taught course, but it is very difficult. I think the exams were too difficultthe extent of the curve was extreme and it would have been a more effective judgement of students abilities if the exams were more on par with the parts and the problems done in class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely loved the format of this course. I think that the flipped classroom design really helped me in terms of making me read the textbook and learn the material before class, so that I could better understand all of the problems that we would do throughout class. I also loved the fact that we were split up into teams of eight, because it gave me the opportunity to get to know a lot of my classmates and it provided an amazing peer resource; my team and I always asked each other questions, studied for exams together, and supported each other so that we all would learn and understand the material well. Overall, I learned so much throughout this course and I always left class feeling like I learned something new. I will say that there were times when this course was very fast paced and not very conducive to answering every student's questions. However, I do think that this course was very effective in its design and in its teaching of all of the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is with Tim, the professor. Tim and his flipped classroom style made organic chemistry incredibly fun and interesting. I was initially hesitant about the flipped classroom, but Tim makes it work!! He incorporates lecture with team problems that keep you engaged with the material He is also very organized and his lectures reflect that. But most of all, Tim is incredibly devoted to teaching and getting to know all of his students. As you're doing team problems, Tim will come over, get to know you and discuss the problem with your team. He consistently asks for feedback and genuinely tries to accommodate the requests of every student. When the class asked for extra practice, he immediately created and uploaded extra problems to Canvas. Tim will also take the time out of his day to host review sessions before exams, which were very helpful, and hold office hours on multiple days each week. Orgo is hard and requires a lot of work, but Tim made it really enjoyable. 10/10 would take it again with Tim Newhouse. ",
            "\u00a0The flipped classroom style was extremely effective, as it was veyr rewarding to do problems in class with my classmates. Working through the problems together was extremely helpful. Sapling Learning was not as great though, as it explored content not covered in class yet, and was much broader than what was tested on exams. Sapling should be used to review concepts we went over in class, and hopefully questions could only test concepts we need to know or have covered. ",
            "\u00a0goes pretty fast, sometimes he doesn't have time to explain/answer questions in class, so you have to ask in section or office hours ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the class are the availability of help from the professor, TFs, and TAs.  The weakness is that the class required a lot of time each week, as there is homework due every class as well as a p-set due just about every week.  Personally, I thought it was helpful to constantly be doing organic chem, but it will be a time heavy course.  Another comment on the course is that it is a reversed classroom.  Each person responds to the format differently, but it will seem odd for anyone who has not had a class like this in the past.  Most people will get accustom to it after a few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0The material was very interesting, and the professor and TAs were great. The set-up of the course in the TEAL classroom made space for invaluable discussion and collaboration. The professor would present group problems, and the (half) flip-classroom design ensured that the material was learned. One would have to do (or not do) readings before every class and answer pre-class questions, meaning we came into class with already a little bit of experience with the day's lecture. Then, the professor would teach and present more difficult examples as well as provide rationalizations (mostly with MO Theory) for reactivity/products. No weaknesses noted. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs are super helpful. They host study hall at night 3 times a week, and students can go there to ask questions, work on homework, or study.The lectures are very useful; this class is a flipped class so in lecture, the professor would go over practice problems, which helped us better understand the material that would be tested on the exams. The professor is very friendly and helpful. There are office hours every week and you are free to ask questions in class. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The major weakness is that many students have already taken organic chemistry in high school. They know some of the material already. It is very unfair to people who have never taken organic chemistry before because we have to study a lot harder than they do just to get the same grade. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was very good. I think the sapling pre-class could have been more relevant to the course material. More time could be spent explaining concepts rather than reading the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Good teaching environment, but did not enjoy the flip-class style. ",
            "\u00a0good organization of material and group learning was a huge benefit ",
            "\u00a0Overall, I enjoyed the course a lot and felt it to be challenging on a level that was engaging but manageable. The only thing I disliked was that sometimes the reading and homework were a little disjointed with lectures, so it did not always feel like the work we did outside the classroom was reinforced in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exposure to independent learning, easy to form study groups, good curve, lots of resources for help\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Bad textbook (don't waste your money getting the latest edition), very fast pace (easy to fall behind), flipped classroom (assigned \"pre-class\" homework had irrelevant/unhelpful problems and was a waste of time), lot of work with little reward (if you don't like the subject) ",
            "\u00a0Working in teams was great for meeting new people and forming study groups ",
            "\u00a0More practice materials earlier on in the course would be helpful. I liked having pre-classes to help review the material for the next day's lecture. I also enjoyed having three midterms and the ability to drop one. ",
            "\u00a0I initially was sceptical about the flip classroom format but I grew to like it. The class was fun and engaging with my peers made it one of my favorites. It was very fair in terms of tests and grading and table placement. I liked the demonstrations a lot and the application portions of lectures. Everyone was very receptive to feedback. Having the teaching scholars around was really useful and Tim was a great professor - wish we got to spend more time with him! The only criticisms I have are that the preclass/psets are repetitive sometimes which makes them monotonous to do, and that sometimes lecture gets ahead of the reading which confuses me because I like to do reading first so a heads up would be nice for those times. There were lots of resources for students, and the course was great! ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the TEAL setup of the classroom, but the class discussions were very fast-paced and it felt pretty easy to get lost. My high school chemistry courses provided a lot of practice problems, and sometimes I wished that the TAs would also provide a wider variety of practice problems for the students to review key concepts before exams. ",
            "\u00a0The class is advertised as special, forward-thinking, and \"above\" other classes because it's taught as a flipped class. For organic chemistry, this is a terrible idea. I would have learned a lot more from a lecture. Especially because the book did not cover everything the professor wanted us to the learn, and the homeworks did not reliably show us what to expect on the exams.\r\n\r\nOverall, no matter how much I tried to catch up on my own, I was always still behind. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of this course are how well organized it is with good course material and very good instructors. It has included all necessary materials needed for learning higher organic and intuitive ways to tackle problems. ",
            "\u00a0I felt the flipped course method put me at a disadvantage. Coming from a weaker chem background than other students, the questions given and being answered during class were often above the level of my own-- my questions weren't always answered, as it was assumed that everyone knew. ",
            "\u00a0This course could be improved by focusing less on memorization. Especially on the final \"midterm\" and the final exam, we were told to memorize all of the mechanisms that we have learned and essentially had to reproduce one or two on each exam. It was a frustrating deviation from retrosynthesis problems that tested our chemistry knowledge and ability to apply all of the reactions that we had learned in a multistep process. I liked the table group setting (as opposed to a standard lecture), which gave us a chance to work with other students on practice problems in class. I also found online homework and problem sets on Sapling to be convenient, although I wish that the Sapling content better matched what we discussed in class and the assigned textbook reading. ",
            "\u00a0None ",
            "\u00a0This course was taught in a format that truly set students up for success. The flip classroom style and the use of the TEAL classroom allowed for active learning and encouraged problem solving with other students. One weakness of this course was that the homework assignments on Sapling were sometimes not really related to the course material. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course was the flipped classroom format. I thoroughly enjoyed this format and how it fostered greater learning and better relationships with my classmates. A weakness of the class was lots of unnecessarily reading that made focusing on the actual material difficult. However, I would not recommend any changes to the way this class is taught. ",
            "\u00a0The course overall was very engaging with the flip style. However, as a product of this style at times it felt as if some topics were not fully explained. Therefore, if the answers to the problems were more explored slowly it would aid in understanding several of the complex topics. Additionally a strength of the course was the availability of help and the time to ask questions. ",
            "\u00a0The structure of the lecture and discussion sections was great.  However, I hate using sapling learning.  I just got used to guessing the answer until I got it right, even on problem sets.  I would prefer not to have to use sapling. "

It provides a nice leap ahead for pre-meds or those studying Chemistry, ChemE, MB&B, etc. I think it is harder than sophomore-level, but you are treated as the top science students. Also, the grading is more forgiving, and it's always cool to be in a classroom with amazing people like USNCO National Finalists to help you out. ",
            "\u00a0I only recommend it if you are pre-med or if you are considering a major that has this class as a pre-requisite (ex: chemistry, MBB, etc). This class is very hard. However, it's useful for pre-meds to take this class because it will let you take advanced classes earlier than other people or more advanced classes in general. Also, if you are considering chemistry or one of the bio majors, this class will give you an idea of a more advanced realm of chemistry, that goes further than what you studied in high school. It will help you decide if you really like chemistry or not. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's very interested, although it is a lot of memorization. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone who is ready for a more challenging course and is able to dedicate a good amount of time outside the classroom to keep up with the fast pace of the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you need orgo for your major, then yes. If you decide to take this course, do not take it with a full load or with other difficult courses. This course is a lot of work, especially if you have never taken orgo before. You need to be able to commit a significant amount of time to studying/learning the material. Also, you have to be committed to memorizing (yes, it is possible to gain a deep understanding, but the exams are such a time crunch that you will be forced to memorize a tremendous amount of info just to finish). ",
            "\u00a0If you've taken AP Chemistry in high school recently and have an interest in Organic Chemistry, I would recommend the course. If not, the course will probably be too difficult in the later on in the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You'll have so much fun. ",
            "\u00a0Yes; the course was probably (though I can't say I've taken organic chemistry before) better organized than most general organic chemistry courses, and the professor and TAs were really good at making themselves available to answer questions and address concerns. ",
            "\u00a0Actually, I would advise any incoming freshmen NOT to take Freshman Organic Chemistry. I do not understand why it is taught separately from the normal Organic Chemistry course, which seems to be put together more reasonably, and the students seem to learn more.\r\n\r\nI heartily do not plan on taking the second semester of this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes as any chem major or premed track or anyone interested should take this course for knowing organic chemistry well and have a good foundation for other courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The support system of this course makes it manageable and very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0It is a difficult but rewarding course and a great introduction to organic chemistry. Do not be scared off by people saying it will \"destroy\" you or \"ruin your life\" or anything like that. It is doable as long as you pay attention in class, go to discussion section, and work with others on the pre class assignments and problem sets. If you are interested in chemistry and ready to learn (a lot) you will do fine. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course because it allows students to get used to the rigour of the environment in a facilitators way. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. There is a lot of material to cover, but it is organized in a way that makes it possible to succeed. ",
            "\u00a0This course is definitely the best way to learn organic chemistry. The material may be difficult, but this course generally sets students up for success. If you are interested in or have to take organic chem, CHEM 174 is the way to do it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. The group of students in freshman orgo is amazing and the format of the class is a major improvement on a basic lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was one of my favorites this semester. The class was interesting and engaging as a product of the material and the teaching style. I found the online homework very helpful in understanding the  information and it provided instant feedback. Further, the course really does provide a great basic background in organic chemistry. Also the environment of just first years makes the class more cohesive for learning. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have the chance to take first-year organic chemistry, it is absolutely the right decision.  (Mainly because this makes it so you can avoid the hell that I heard gen chem lab is.). "
