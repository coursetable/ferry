            "\u00a0Physics 200 is not a good course. The lectures are boring and nearly useless, focusing solely on deriving equations rather than applying and understanding them. I was shocked at how poorly taught Physics 200 was in comparison to my high school physics courses. We almost never discussed concepts or did practice problems; all we did was trace out the derivations already written up in the book. I went to lecture every day, but I suspect that I could have learned just as much without ever setting foot in lecture. If this course is to improve, lecture needs to be drastically reorganized. Also, the grading of psets and tests was often lazy and opaque, and the two midterms both took almost a month to be handed back. Equation sheets were often late and/or riddled with typos. ",

I think some of the derivations even in the Shankar part were a little unclear - it would be nice if Sarah could throw in multivariable calc-based tidbits, just connecting the concepts a little (for example conservative forces and integrating over a pathway) or maybe a little differential equations. Kids who understand will be really happy because it will connect everything we're learning. Sarah is such an enthusiastic teacher and I love learning from her. Her physics news segments are very interesting. Hoping we will go over thermo during second semester. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The teacher was a fun person and made it interesting to listen to the lecture.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The topics were not covered well at all, and it felt like the only way I learned in the course was by reading the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0Great intro physics course, gives you the basics and the mathematical background required is not that bad. ",

I thought the study halls were very helpful for working through the problem sets, which were challenging but gave important insight into the material covered in lecture.  I would improve the grading of the exams: 1. it took too long to get them back and 2. I don't think there were useful comments to help me understand what I did wrong, so I needed to talk to the professor or TA's afterwards. ",

The way we go through the material can be a bit too fast at times, but enough resources are out there (Shankar's lecture videos or his textbook) to reinforce learning as long as you put enough time into understanding the material. ",

It was also where I did most of my learning. I am not sure if that is a strength or a weakness, but I definitely found like lecture never really gave me the insights I needed to tackle the problems, and study halls where were I made the biggest strides.

I think the study halls could have been better organized, often it was hard to find the TA's since it was so crowded, and it was a stressful environment in which to try to strengthen understanding of the material. Also, twice I went to office hours and couldn't find the TA. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Demers is a fantastic person who is obviously passionate about her field. The only problem lies in the fact that she's not studying mechanics. Thus she was not engaged with the course material and that made the structure of her lectures haphazard and hard to follow. ",

            "\u00a0The main strengths of this course were that the content was taught at a happy medium level. It was not too slow for most of the class that is already well versed in mechanics, but it was also not too fast or new to confuse students who needed a refresher. It is perfect for a student that needs to take introductory physics for a major requirement but would be bored retaking the AP class (which seems to be what 180 is). Professor Demers was very interested in teaching and explaining the more novel concepts in the class, such as relativity, which is where the class really shined.\r\n\r\nThe are no solid weaknesses in the class, but it seemed like the combined TF sessions/office hours were a little difficult to navigate when it was crowded. Aside from this, the class was effective in its goals. ",

It is also a good amount of work, with a great amount of office hours and lectures per week.\r\nI wish that this course, especially given that it is a large lecture course, had a small section that people were able to go to in order to review the material taught during the lecture. Also, the feedback for our problem sets was very varied, and often did not match up with the answer key. ",

            "\u00a0Sarah is a great lecturer. She's very aware of how the class is responding to the material and her excitement over the material keeps things interesting. The physics study halls really need improving as far as location times and organization. Because of that office hours and reviews are a must if you're struggling with the material. The TAs were fine, some better than others, but they aren't very familiar with the particular methods that Shankar uses in the textbook. ",

            "\u00a0I thought the problem sets were overall very helpful and it was a very reasonable workload.  I think that the lectures could be improved a little bit by doing a lot more example problems instead of concept explanation (good but sometimes hard to follow). I also think the physics study halls all together with other physics courses wasn't as helpful.  If there were more TA's and maybe a separate space for group study that would be helpful. ",

            "\u00a0The course covered relevant material, but as the semester continued, the professor's explanations seemed to deteriorate. I was quite pleased with her teaching in the first half of the semester, but I became more and more confused as the semester progressed. Additionally, the TA's availability also seemed to diminish as we neared the time for exams, which was both frustrating and unhelpful. ",

Sometimes, the psets were way too hard and did not accurately reflect what we had learned so even if you did the pset, you felt as if you hadn't learned as much or didn't know as much as you really do. Thankfully the problem help sessions were extremely helpful. I think for next time some of the lecture should be dedicated to solving example problems/ giving us tools to solve some problems on the psets. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Demers is a great prof.\r\nWeaknesses: the lectures basically follow the book exactly which in some ways is nice but also left me feeling like certain elements were very repetitive if you were reading along. ",
            "\u00a0The course was a good overview of physics. However, I didnt like how we mostly did proofs in class. I think it would have been more beneficial to do more practice problems. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were good, Sarah explained things well and used examples. Sometimes she didnt use enough examples, but was very open and upfront about student feedback which helped correct that. Psets were great and manageable and thorough, but sometimes help hours were  disorganized. TAs werent there once. ",
            "\u00a0My strengths were understanding of the material and ability to complete problem sets independently. My main weakness was attention to detail and I made lots of errors because of this. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were sometimes confusing, got a little behind schedule. Problem sets were well done and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Very engaging and clear lectures. Shankar's textbook was also great and a pleasure to read. Unfortunately, towards the end, we got off-sync with the syllabus, resulting in us not covering as much material as originally planned. ",
            "\u00a0Covers a good range of material and all the relevant topics to form a basis for more physics and engineering related courses. PSETs were well made and manageable. Study halls were useful and well timed throughout the week. \r\nBiggest issue with the course was the accompanying textbook - Fundamentals of Physics by R. Shankar. The book is entertaining and easy to read - but that's not the point of a physics textbook. It reads like a story or narrative, and is not helpful for looking up information and concepts, or as a reference. It was novel in the beginning but by the end it was irritating to go through pages of drivel to get to a single derivation, and even then there were digressions. ",
            "\u00a0I felt I was a bit behind at the beginning of the year (more advanced math/physics classes not offered at my high school) and the class was a bit fast. However, I felt that instead of that being a reason why I wasn't doing so hot in the course, it became an excuse for me and that severely affected my performance and happiness in the class. "

It's also really interesting to learn about special relativity, which is arguably the coolest part of intro physics. ",

I learned stuff that I didn't learn in AP physics at a higher intellectual level, and the psets really made me think without being busywork at all. Go to study halls - Emma was an incredibly helpful TA and it was fun to work with other students. I wasn't initially sure whether to take this class or 180 and I'm so happy I took this class - the concepts are way more interesting and the work is way more rewarding. Sarah is an inspiring teacher. The end of the semester was a little scattered but Shankar's videos are really good supplements for class. ",

I took this class having taken an intense AP Physics experience in HS, and looking back on it, I'm not sure if I would have made the same decision. I didn't learn much until the first midterm. To be fair, it wasn't like the problem sets were easy, it just felt silly to be putting so much effort into a class that I felt like I had learned a decent amount of last year.

This is the happy medium introductory physics course in terms of complexity, but also had far less work (based on my discussions with other students in other classes) than the other classes, especially compared to 180. Problem sets in 200 are very straightforward and usually only take up one page  you don't need to read paragraphs on paragraphs to answer a simple mechanics question. In the end, it is also an enjoyable, interesting, and well-taught course with some new ideas to learn. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, this course provides a wide range of physics concepts and it also provides a deep analysis of each concept. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it's a good class for intro physics sequence, especially if you don't want to be in 180 and like physics/calc a little more, but don't want to do th 260 sequence. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to others. It was well taught and had a lot of support between the students and the TAs. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course, but ONLY if it is a requirement. If you took AP Physics in high school, only take this course if you feel confident with the material. If there is any doubt, it is probably better to take 180. ",
            "\u00a0If you want an overview of physics that covers a lot of topics fairly well, then yes ",
            "\u00a0If youre interested in a semi challenging physics class yes ",
            "\u00a0If you need it as a prerequisite, then yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would I thought it was a fabulous class that will only get better as Professor Demers teaches it more and more. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend to someone that has a good handle of the basics of physics and calculus wanting to learn more about how the two are related. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this to someone who really likes physics but isnt so experienced or mathematically inclined as a 260 student. It really does cover the important topics in an effective way. It is deceptively challenging though. I thought the the class was rather easy, but it ended up being my lowest grade of the classes I took this semester. I would say, dont forget that physics problems involve a great amount of attention to detail ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who was taking physics because it was a good overview of the basic concepts. ",
            "\u00a0I took this class for a science credit and because I always liked physics and wanted to learn relativity. The relativity unit was pretty short, but overall I enjoyed the class and got a good foundational knowledge of physics, reinforced by solidly challenging problems in the manageable psets. Sarah is a great lecturer though sometimes disorganized, but shes very great about student feedback. All exams were fair and not bad. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class was a great introduction to college physics that quickly summarized what was learned in high school but forced us to relearn the material in a way that demanded a mathematical understanding of why things are the way they are rather than just memorizing formulas. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Even though this class moves faster than PHYS 180, I think its worth it in order to learn about other concepts, especially relativity. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you have had prior experience with physics in high school (AP/IB Physics, etc). It can be hard to follow at times but when it is interesting, it is REALLY interesting. It is very good in exposing you to the various topics of physics. It presents a good intellectual challenge without being insanely hard. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. It's a great introduction to college physics and Prof. Sarah Demers was a dream to learn from. Always helpful and kept the class alive (which was a heavy task at times). "
