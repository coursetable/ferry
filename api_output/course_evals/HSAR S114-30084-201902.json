            "\u00a0So much knowledge about religion, which I had no background on before. ",

            "\u00a0The skill to appreciate art, to record my observation and feelings.\r\nThe outline of development of art history.\r\nCharacteristics of several art cultures. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the background knowledge of many masterpieces in history and also developed the ability to appreciate the works of art from a professional angle. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to see the architecture and ancient paintings. I never think architecture is fun, but after the class, I believe architecture is much more meaningful than paintings. I even tell my mom my understandings of some buildings whenever I see the style that I've learned before. It just feels so good that I can actually understand some paintings and architecture in the museum instead of just walking by and buying souvenirs. ",
            "\u00a0Ability to appreciate art from a historical perspective, close observation and descriptive skills, and a broad knowledge of characteristics of different civilizations through their artistic styles. ",
            "\u00a0I have learnt many of the ancient artworks that are all fascinating, I've known their materials, provenances and so on. I've also developed a deeper understanding of all these works through analyzing them in terms of different time period and different media. Through the writing of looking diary, I think I've acquired the skill of spending long time observing a single object and then write detailedly about it. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt why art is so preciously preserved in many nations and the value it give to us. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I felt that the pieces of art we learned about could have been a bit more contextualized with the history of the time period. I felt we often looked at pieces and took note of their characteristics and analyzed them but without having much information on the history. ",
            "\u00a0I think we can have some content relevant to theories in art. ",
            "\u00a0Very high engagement and well-led in-class discussion. Hope the organization of knowledge could be more systematic. ",
            "\u00a0All the materials of this course were logically organized, and all the processes were easy to follow. The course involved visiting the art gallery and observing the works of art, which contributed to the understanding and implication of the course materials. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is wonderful. I just hope that maybe we can analyze more paintings or buildings during the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course makes full use of the Yale University Art Gallery, which make students feel engaged in both classroom settings and in front of the art pieces them selves. It is very well designed in chronological order, and covers a broad range of civilizations. I like the part of presentations very much, where the instructor assigns every student to talk about a field that he or she is interested in. It can be improved by adding more basic content for students who are not familiar with the subject, like listing out key terms, maps and references. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is that Professor Coyle is a very engaged and creative teacher. He is very involved in the discussion, but at the same time he encourages us to talk more. He has come up many interesting ideas such as letting us go out into the campus to fins architectural elements that are from classic times. I really enjoy every class he gave. \r\nThe only improvement that can be made is probably about the readings. I think the readings could include more basic information instead of deep discussion. I think they are great works, but for an intro class, they may be a little bit difficult. "

            "\u00a0Yes!!!! I not only loved learning about early history and religion, but think that Yale is a great place to take an art history course because students have the opportunity to interact with the on-campus resources like the YUAG. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.\r\nThis is a really amazing journey to art. It helps me have further understanding of the masterpieces in ancient times. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to those who are interested but have no background in art history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I will. The reason is that by taking this course, I obtained much knowledge and gained insights into a new area. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend the class to others because it really changes my opinion on architecture and art history in general. I thought architecture--  was nothing before I took the class -- I can only appreciate the beauty of paintings. However, now I think architecture is even more engaging than paintings. It's much more complicated than paintings. This class even encourages me to take art history class when I get into college because it is so fun. ",
            "\u00a0I will definitely recommend it. It is very enjoyable to go to the gallery twice a week and look at the fine arts with the nicest group of peers. Art is something good in itself, but learning to share ones aesthetic experience with other can enrich the meaning that art is to us. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because it's a very informative course for people who are interested in art history. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It would be a great opportunity to have access to art history for beginners. "
