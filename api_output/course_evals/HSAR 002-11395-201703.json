            "\u00a0I have learned so much about a field that I have never experienced before in one semester. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a general knowledge of furniture (woods, joinery, styles, trends) from this class. I was able to practice my public speaking through our weekly presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to view the world around me more critically. I took furniture for granted for a large majority of my life, but now I am able to better understand its construction and purpose. I also now find it entertaining to identify pieces and think about their history. ",
            "\u00a0I became a much better writer ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze a piece of furniture and draw from that analysis conclusions about broader trends in American society and history. I learned how to make my writing more clear and concise. Through class presentation I gained confidence in public speaking and I learned strategies for engaging the class in my presentations. ",
            "\u00a0I gained much greater appreciation for decorative arts and learned to consider art in a greater social context. ",
            "\u00a0presentation skills, knowledge of furniture and development of furniture, furniture jargon, writing skills and organization ",
            "\u00a0Learning the basics behind furniture. Never took a woodworking class in high school, and didn't feel under prepared taking this class. Learned about different time periods in american history by looking at furniture. ",
            "\u00a0So many! This course really teaches you how to interact with objects and care about something you had previously probably given very little thought to. ",
            "\u00a0This taught me how to examine and analyze material in depth. Also, taught me how to connect little tangible objects to the real world and how life is at that time in history. "

            "\u00a0The course is interesting and the readings are not too long. Maybe if the course is given at a later time of the day, I would have enjoyed it even more. ",
            "\u00a0I think a strength of this course was definitely the level of student engagement required with the presentations. The structure of the class made it so that each of us had to be attentive and active, which also really allowed us to get to know each other much better. I overall really enjoyed the course but I think that a potential weakness could have been how little we outwardly discussed the readings each week. A lot of the information was relayed through student presentations, but it would have been nice to have ten minutes each week to really discuss the time period of study. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught alongside a huge collection of pieces, which is a huge strength as students are able to interact with the pieces in person.\r\n\r\nA weakness is that some students never did the readings which did not help in class discussion at all. ",
            "\u00a0It is wonderful to be able to research and look at the individual pieces of furniture each week. However, as the class is a writing credit, it might have been helpful to make the written assignments a little bit longer. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well designed. We covered three centuries of American furniture, but it did not feel rushed. The Weekly presentations keep me engaged and distilled the large information dump of an entire era of furniture down to a single more manageable piece. I honestly can't think of improvements for this course it really was incredible. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is structured very well. ",
            "\u00a0Every student is given  opportunities to express themselves in the classroom. Perfect amount of engagement and professor talking about the topics. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging, feels student-directed. \r\nWeaknesses: Readings are sometimes VERY long. Also, sometimes you have to go to Haas to read the books and I feel like those should be scanned in. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great course, fun, interesting\r\n\r\nWeak: Repetitive "

            "\u00a0Yes, it exemplifies the diversity of resources that you can take advantage of at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely, Professor Cooke does an amazing job engaging his students. I gained a genuine interest in many of the case studies that we did and I feel as if I learned a lot on the subject as well as improved my writing. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course. Professor Cooke is wonderful and does a really good job of explaining the material. Once you get into the groove of the class it becomes very fun and engaging with fellow peers. Enjoyed this class very much. ",
