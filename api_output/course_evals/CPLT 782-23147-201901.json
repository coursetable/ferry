I got exposed to - and hopefully learned - some unique and highly interesting approaches and possibilities of reading. "

            "\u00a0I liked a lot the co-teaching approach of this course. In addition, I appreciated the short repetition of the former discussion at the beginning of each lesson. This summarization created a sense of continuation of the discussion.\r\nI think the classroom and the way of sitting affected the seminar, I believe that a normal classroom would have been better for the discussion. ",
            "\u00a0The materials and the questions were very interesting and I found that the co-teaching was broadening the conversation and contributing to the exposure and the collaboration of different points of view, which ended in truly varied materials and readings. The professors were great, very knowledgable, generous and kind with students. The idea of combining those different materials in one sequence of readings was also really interesting.\r\n\r\nWhat could be improved: I found the group to be too big to hold intimate discussions. There were too many people, coming from many different disciplines, which created discussions that were sometimes surprising and interesting, but sometimes struggling to connect. "

            "\u00a0Yes. I think the variety of texts discussed in this course, provide students with the ability to address a singular issue from multiple perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was very interesting, thought-provoking, and broadening the perspectives of thinking. It was also connecting between intellectual work does in humanities and contemporary social and ethical questions. "
