            "\u00a0deep understanding of popular music, 1930s to 2000 ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about rock and popular music history, as well as some of the formal music theory behind trends. It was super cool material, and definitely is stuff I will remember for a long time and pull out of my back pocket in casual conversation as fun facts! ",
            "\u00a0The most interesting class that I have taken at Yale, entirely because of the content. Rock and Roll baby. ",
            "\u00a0This was a fantastic course! I went into this class knowing very little about rock music and feel that I learned a great deal about not just rock, but music in general. There was a good mix of history and music theory and well suited for beginners. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the elements of music and what to listen for in music. Also how the different decades of rock differentiate themselves ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better listen and appreciate music. I was also exposed to a lot of great songs I had never heard before! ",
            "\u00a0Learned about trends in music since 1950s, some musical elements - now better at identifying music by style and period ",
            "\u00a0This was an amazing course that taught a little bit about the technical aspects of rock music and basic music skills, but focused more on the evolution of rock music and the social aspects about it. We started in the early 1900s and went through present day. There were a lot of music listening components which was very fun! Professor Harrison and the TAs did a great job at making the close super fun and engaging. I came in having never taken a music course and I am so so happy that I was able to take this before graduating! Such a fun course!! Def recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about rock from a historical point of view but also a bit about music generally, which was cool. ",
            "\u00a0So much new information about rock music, and music in general! I feel very cultured with pop media after this course. ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me many skills regarding music theory and musical history! Coming from a very limited background in music theory, this course taught me the simple principles about how to correctly listen to music. As for the historical background of Rock, I truly was able to learn about each decade historically further through the lens of rock music as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the structure of songs and how to identify certain aspects of music upon listening. Additionally we learned about the history of rock music culture. ",
            "\u00a0INCREDIBLE and important knowledge about recent music history ",
            "\u00a0Learned so much about the history of music as well as the development of what is popular today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much more about the background of the musicians and songs I had grown up listening to. Before this course, I didn't know how much artists/genres influenced each other nor did I know how culture played a huge role in the music of the time. "

        [
            "\u00a0I wish it would have appealed to individuals that have had no musical background. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent first year of the course! Some suggestions for future years:\r\n\r\n-Assign more listening homework, readings outside the textbook. The textbook is great, but the workload is so light that I would have happily done more.\r\n-Somewhat more focused sections would be helpful.\r\n-More music theory and faster! I seems that most people got the hang of what was taught pretty quickly and could have learned more about chord progressions etc. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course, but less Beach Boys, some prog would be nice, and I feel like there was a lot of 80s/90s rock that we skipped over in class (R.E.M., U2, RHCP, etc., which were all covered in the text at least). Also, and this is big: ditch the textbook for some curated readings! Rolling Stone profiles and album reveals, scholarly works, etc. ",
            "\u00a0Material was super fun and engaging! Exams were much harder than expected as it was really difficult to identify songs from a list of over 120 based on a 30 second clip or answer very specific multiple choice questions from random passages in the book. ",
            "\u00a0The course sometimes focused more on what music Professor Harrison or the TAs enjoyed rather than what actually defined rock history.  Please include Pink Floyd and Radiohead into the course next year. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- the class was extremely interesting. The teaching staff was amazing!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses- not always clear on exams what we were supposed to know. A lot of trivia on exams that didnt have anything to do with class. But I still feel that the grading was fair! ",
            "\u00a0This course is just too extra. While the lectures are really interesting, but the exams are just too much. They ask for very specific details, expect us to be able to talk about songs weve never heard before, and the essays are either too specific or too vague. This class is not a gut even if youre taking it cr/d. Not a good senior spring class. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Great professor with enjoyable lectures. Textbook was really easy to read too\r\n\r\nWeakness: Sometimes I wish the lectures and textbook overlapped a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: traced origin of rock very well. Great textbook. Great professor and TA's. Engaging lectures with history, listening, and song-structure visualization software. Short writing assignment was fun, as was the last day where 5 songs were presented and discussed for the whole lecture.\r\nWeaknesses: did not mention many important artists at all (Pink Floyd, Grateful Dead, Steve Miller Band, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Ozzy Osbourne, Deep Purple, Poison, Black Sabbath, Simon and Garfunkel, REO Speedwagon, Styx, .38 Special, Genesis, Phil Collins, Def Leppard, David Bowie, Arlo Guthrie, and Rush, to name a few) and only mentioned other important artists only for one song (Led Zeppelin, Queen, Cars, Metallica, Bob Dylan, Boston, Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Peter Gabriel, Heart, U2, The Police, Bruce Springsteen, Mtley Cre, and the Rolling Stones). WAY too much time spend on obscure oddities like The Secret Life of Plants and the Shaggs. Completely ignored all of heavy metal but included pop stars like Michael Jackson and Madonna who are not really rock. Lectures were usually disconnected from the book and the assessments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - section \r\nWeaknesses - lecture ",
            "\u00a0I think organizationally there were some weaknesses just because it was the first time it was being taught. I also think that there could be more focus on some of the racial/gendered aspects of the history of rock, but other than that it was a great course! ",
            "\u00a0Great lectures, section, and textbook. A better idea in advance of what the exams would look like would be nice, but it was the course's trial run so I understand why it was like that. ",
            "\u00a0While I learned a lot, the structure of the course was heavily based on the book rather than anything taught in class. ",
            "\u00a0This class is amazing- the only thing is I know Prof. Harrison said he is going to make it a big lecture next year but I think part of what made it so good was the small class size, so he should consider keeping it small. Also, having him lead my section made the class much more enjoyable than friends who had Tfs (to be clear, the TFs were great, I just think Harrison brings a more fun and unique vibe to section). ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course include the professors and the TAs. They were each super engaging, extremely helpful, and really made the course amazing. The overall material of the course was also great and allowed an insight for students into each decade through rock's manifestations during the time period. Another strength was the assignments of the listening quizzes and the 500 word essay. Each were fun to do and offered a nice break from the monotonous coursework that most other classes consist of. (Just make sure to play the songs twice). The weaknesses though include the tests. The tests were much heavily weighted towards the readings and material that was never truly discussed in the class. Even though I did all of the readings and took notes, there was just too much dense material covered to expect the students to know very specific nuanced details. It would have definitely helped to try and integrate the readings into the general course material more so we could gain a context and focus for understanding. ",
            "\u00a0This course have easily been a large lecture, and would have been great as a seminar. The 50-person cap/size didnt really make sense. I would have loved to learn more about how cultural movements influenced the bands/the relationships between the bands. ",
            "\u00a0This was one of my favorite courses at Yale. I think there were a few areas of disorganization solely because it was the first year this course was taught, such as an unclear structure of the final. Prof. Harrison is so passionate and knowledgable about the subject and it was so much fun learning from him. ",
            "\u00a0strengths -- incredible professor, engaging material, interesting lectures, reasonable workload\r\ncons -- sometimes unclear about how much of textbook and to what detail we were expected to know ",
            "\u00a0Exams were a bit disorganized, but the lectures were wonderful. ",
            "\u00a0The lecture material could sometimes be a bit dry, but Professor Harrison always brought a ton of energy which helped. Sometimes I felt like there wasn't enough to do or say in section. Also, the midterm seemed to test us on trivial details of history that no one will remember into the summer. "

            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class! It was like nothing i'd ever taken before at Yale, but Prof Harrison is amazing and fun, and the class overall is interesting and engaging. It is my favorite class i've taken in my four years of Yale! ",
            "\u00a0A really fun class. ",
            "\u00a0Take this course. The subject matter is inherently interesting and Prof. Harrison makes it even better. Beware that this course is not super difficult, but could easily become a lot harder if the professor wished--the potential is there. But, this was an amazing course that I looked forward to going to every time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! take this! The class is really fun and isn't that hard except for some memorization things. Prof. Harrison is super cool and clearly cares a lot about the material and his students. ",

They ask for very specific details, expect us to be able to talk about songs weve never heard before, and the essays are either too specific or too vague. This class is not a gut even if youre taking it cr/d. Not a good senior spring class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes 100%. It is a great senior class. Workload isn't too high and you learn a ton of cool stuff about rock and popular music in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. There is not too much work, the subject is really cool, the professor and TA's are amazing, but be prepared for your favorite classic rock song or artist to be completely ignored (e.g. Pink Floyd) and random curiosities to be talked about at great length (the objectively terrible Shaggs). ",
            "\u00a0Take the class if youre already insterested in rock. Also, this was a first time run so it will definitely improve ",
            "\u00a0YES it was so so much fun to \"study\" for quizzes by just listening to great playlists! Please take! Professor Harrison is amazing and so so passionate! He gets you up and dancing in class and it's great! ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic class! Engaging lectures, section, and fair exams. You don't need to do the readings if you don't want to, but the textbook is amazing too so they're worth it. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS CLASS! I found it on a whim and LOVED IT. It was super fun to come into lecture each week and section was even better. We learned a lot about music in a relatable, relaxed way and I legitimately feel more cultured now. I wish I could take a class like this every semester! ",
            "\u00a0This course was amazing! Professor Harrison loves this material and his engagement shines through. Each lecture and reading is extremely interesting and you genuinely want to go and do them. I always left the class much happier than when I came! The assignments offer a nice break from the monotonous classwork that many other courses consist of. The listening quizzes were a lot of fun and the essay allowed you to explore your interests further, but a word of warning deals with the tests. The midterm and the final were both relatively hard due to the multiple choice and the essays being very detail heavy from the readings. I took this class credit/d/fail and it was the best decision for me as I am not very well versed in music and I found it hard to \"name that tune\" for the quizzes. But due to this, I had such a blast taking this class and could do the work truly for the enjoyment of it! ",
            "\u00a0YES! Prof. Harrison is a very enthusiastic instructor who truly enjoys the subject and does a fantastic job at captivating the students in a manner that we also enjoy it as much as he does. If you like Rock or pop music or just enjoy a fun learning experience, TAKE THIS CLASS! You will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It is a must take if you are interested in music and the history of popular music culture. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a must-take for every Yale student. Professor Harrison is one of the most wonderful professors I have ever had at Yale, the material is incredibly engaging and exciting, the workload is very reasonable as long as you prepare for the quizzes. YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC IN CLASS. YOU GET TO LEARN FROM THE HAPPIEST MAN WHO LOVES MUSIC AND LOVES HIS JOB. THIS CLASS IS THE BEST THING AT YALE. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a fun class (mostly seniors) with little work. Professor Harrison is kind of like the goofy dad of the class. We listen to a lot of music in lecture and section which was always entertaining and a nice change-up from other Yale classes. Take it, but I'd recommend Credit D. ",
            "\u00a0If you like any kind of rock music, definitely take this class. You'll learn about the history of rock music and where/how it originated and follow its development and divergence throughout time. Not a heavy workload - the tests are not too bad if you read some of the textbook or more generally read about the topics online, and the listening quizzes can be easy and fun if you get into the playlist and listen for pleasure. Overall, great class and there is so much interesting stuff to learn that I wish I could take it again. "
