            "\u00a0Lack of clarity in the rubric and expectations for homework and assignments.\r\nProfessor would update his requirements randomly after assignment and would not make an announcement. The TA would tell something different to people in office hours and made the overall situation very confusing on what the expectations are. ",
            "\u00a0The course was structured well and I feel like I gained some useful technical skills.  I think that the course could be strengthened by having more assigned reading before lecture so that the materials isn't completely new during lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Awesome course- obviously very challenging but I really felt like I learned so much from this class, and gained real-world skills that will make me competitive in future job markets. ",
            "\u00a0The class covers pretty interesting information and seems like a good follow up to Cost Effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe class is a lot of work. Furthermore, it uses Python (which could be a good thing for us to learn new skills) but there is just simply not enough teaching on this for us to write our own code for the homework. The homework also take an incredibly large amount of time and becomes more of a struggle to find the correct code than actually applying the concepts learned in class. The class also has only 1 TF which does not seem like enough. The office hours are too crowded to ask for enough help and the homework isn't graded on a timely basis or with enough detail to show us what we did wrong. It seems that this course would benefit more from a lab than a 2 hour session every week (which is not enough). ",
            "\u00a0the topics are interesting but there isn't enough support for the python code. Completing the homework doesn't allow me to fully understand Python. I think this course should have a lab section where the code is explained in a more detailed way. And start simple. To be honest, I'd rather have more class time but more thorough teaching on the topics. Right now it feels we are touching briefly on both the model and the code. I'd rather have fewer topics but a deeper understanding of those we do cover in the class. ",
            "\u00a0It is not suitable for students without strong statistical background or Python experience. Maybe this course can try to be more accessible. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material and skills gained actually feel useful; homeworks felt designed to push students to think critically about skills taught in class rather than just regurgitating ideas; Final project provides an excellent opportunity to further apply skills and develop a project for job/internship applications.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Homework instructions were not always clear but assignments were graded harshly (e.g., instructions may not mention certain output requirements, grades sometimes based on output from specific seeds); Students have no way to implement homework feedback (see below); final project presentations rushed.\r\n\r\nIn the future, I would recommend offering students the opportunity to resubmit homeworks for a slight bump in grade. This would require delaying posting answers for, say, a week, which may not be suitable in the professor's opinion. I would also recommend removing discrete-event simulation models or at least offering that homework as an optional assignment during the break--it would have been much more useful to have had a homework on sensitivity analysis, for example. Finally, I would recommend stretching the final presentation schedule out to two days or maybe promoting students to work together so as to reduce the number of presentations. ",
            "\u00a0This course was challenging and taught me a lot. I believe that students would have benefited from an additional TF, as Savanah (who was great!) seemed overwhelmed at times and sometimes would not reply to emails. In addition, I would have liked to have been able to download PyCharm and start getting familiar with the syntax of the program prior to the start of the semester. A big barrier for me in this course was understanding Python itself, which at times detracted from the time I had to solidify my understanding of the actual core concepts of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - amazing subject matter with great potential application to a variety of public health topics and current issues, encourages understanding of Python as a means to accomplish a full project individually as a result of the lessons \r\nWeaknesses - is not at all an intro level course and should require some additional supplies or requirements, heavy work load that requires TF assistance ",
            "\u00a0Great class, rough in the morning! ",
            "\u00a0This is an excellent course and introduction to more advanced topics in modeling for healthcare decisionmaking and also as an introduction to Python. I think the course strengths are in Reza's lecture notes, in-class labs, and homework assignments to begin to think about the implementation of the various modeling principles.\r\n\r\nI wish that there were more opportunities to discuss and review implementation of sensitivity analysis -- basically, I'm saying I wish there was a homework for us to think about the implementation before the final project. HOWEVER, I really appreciate preserving the sanctity of that last week where there is no homework, because the final project takes a long time. Perhaps there may be a way to combine two smaller homework assignments and give another one to discuss implementation of the sensitivity analysis.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would be nice to get a bit more discussion and feedback on implementation on model calibration. I understand that this is a challenging topic, and many students are coming in with different levels of exposure to Bayes theorem; however, I think we were missing a practical discussion on how the model implementation using weights and resampling related to model calibration in the discussion of Bayes theroem.\r\n\r\nLastly, it may be helpful to discuss some of the theory in terms of identifying questions to model. Some of the readings related to this, but it may be nice to have a bit more discussion. It was very challenging to think about how to simplify a system to create a model, and I felt somewhat unprepared in this process. I understand that assumptions and uncertainty is inherent in model-building, but it would be nice to be a little bit more familiar with some of  the theory along with the implementation. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths\r\nSubstantially improved python and modelling skills\r\nComfortable understanding academic publications on modelling and creating simplified models\r\n\r\nWeaknesses\r\nMay have benefited from a flipped classroom approach ",

It would be better to have a more descriptive rubric where students can earn partial credit for each homework problem, otherwise there ends up being a lot of panic for very few points. There were many times where I had a code with an error that I could not figure out and did not have timely feedback from the TA, which left me to submit an assignment with errors that then resulted in missed points.
