            "\u00a0The lecture was focused on mainly consumer theory which was good. Labor supply theories and principal/agent problems were also good. \r\nGame theories would be also helpful if time allows for him to give lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The main strengths are:\r\n1. The topics are covered in depth and are fully explained\r\n2. Both Professor Boozer and the TA are excellent.\r\n3. The problem sets are really well thought, based in real world examples and make students understand fully the topics covered in class and engage in interesting discussions, and encourage us to read more.\r\n4. The topics covered are really interesting and VERY well focused, bringing very interesting applications.\r\n5. Lecture notes are very clear and well written.\r\n6. Throughout the topics covered we acquired a good tool kit to solve microeconomic problems. \r\n\r\nThe main weakness: we did not have enough time to cover all the topics planned in the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Can be done in a more structured way ",
            "\u00a0The strength lies in the thoroughness by which the course covers some core topics in microeconomics, and in the way it allows people from different backgrounds (including less economics-oriented) to catch up and get to the same level. The lecture notes are also very useful and detailed. There are a couple of ways in which the course could be improved. First of all, the amount of time spent on the first set of lecture notes (the axioms) could be considerably shortened. This material was never really used again in the course and could have been covered in one lecture, leaving several lectures for more useful parts of the course. I also think that it would be possible to cover more in the lectures by going on less tangents. Finally, and this might be a case of \"careful what you wish for,\" I think we could have had a couple more problem sets, since those are by far the best way to learn the material, and sometimes several weeks would pass without a problem set. ",
            "\u00a0The course was insightful and thought provoking. Less time could have been spent on the Axioms as the pace increased significantly towards the final few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0I feel that we perhaps dwelled too much on topics that could have merited less time, such as the very first lectures on axioms, at the cost of covering theory of the firm later in the semester. Other than that, it was an enjoyable course that covered important topics well. ",
            "\u00a0A strength were the in-depth lectures and the problem sets. One weakness is the fact that we did not cover theory of firm. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are in the depth in which it goes to explain certain concepts. The problem sets are very useful. It brings about a strong intuitive understanding.\r\n\r\nWeakness of this course is in how little of micro it tends to cover. While I understand that time is limited, for a Master's level micro course to just cover Slutsky equation and Risk is a little underwhelming. Some initial parts of the course can be sped up to include more material and applications of Slutsky don't need so much time to be spent on. More mathematical basis would be better as well. "
