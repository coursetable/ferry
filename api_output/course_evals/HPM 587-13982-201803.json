            "\u00a0For me, I enjoyed the course very much because I expected it to be a deep dive into methodologies of economic research, critiquing research techniques, and evaluating how causality is established and exactly that was delivered.  I had expected a little bit more mathematical reasoning, but was ultimately OK with the amount we got.  Some weeks I was very excited by the readings (the fetal origins hypothesis week, or the innovation week), and other weeks I found them a little more boring (the calorie labeling week, or the blue-law week) but that is to be expected. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Very interesting topics, and a deep-dive into specific research articles that were relevant to the topics of discussion. It was helpful to read these articles through an economic lens and hear the discussions from classmates.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Would have been nice to have the written homework assignments uploaded to canvas slightly earlier so that we could have the option to read and/or work on them in advance. It was sometimes unclear whether or not something was due each class period. ",
            "\u00a0The readings and topics covered in this course are very interesting and inspiring. They are very helpful for my future research. ",
            "\u00a0This course is extremely useful - you learn how to interpret findings and identify high-quality research studies. The course was intimate, and participation was highly encouraged which was not difficult because all of the readings were engaging. Perhaps more in-class activities could be great, but otherwise, I enjoyed the way the class was organized. ",
            "\u00a0I like how structured this course was. The readings were thought-provoking, and the amount of reading each week was appropriate. The reading assignments were also very helpful, and I wish we had more of them, especially towards the end of the semester. But I also appreciated the extra time we were given to work on our final projects. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was a fine course, I would have liked to have a little more micro econ application. I know the course is set up to be literature based, but a little more micro application would have been interesting ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- Applied economic theory to public health, particularly behavioral economics, which is a component I feel has been missing in my other coursework\r\n- Professor Busch challenges the students to think critically and to further apply what we're learning in class\r\n- Open discourse \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- Doesn't equip students with hard skills--we talk a lot about models, but never actually went through the process of conducting a data analysis to test one (had the option to for our final project, but most chose not to)\r\n- Misleading course name -- you don't need a baseline level of microeconomics to do well in the course; but I expected to take those concepts we learned in micro and delve deeper. This course is more application-based, so just mismatched expectations ",
            "\u00a0This class was great at building on economic concepts and principles specific to health care and health research. Great overview of how economics plays into the health care industry and health care research. The articles selected were fantastic to delve into deeper with discussion in class. Improvements could be having consistent weekly responses to ensure that we're focused on the readings and the concepts. Perhaps including a section to ask specific questions about the readings for weekly discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Class discussions are engrossing, though it can be difficult to find space to participate given the class size; Readings are well-selected, interesting, and informative; Class covers a range of topics, giving everyone an opportunity to find their niche.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class size is too big to support consistently engaging conversations and, likewise, hampered enjoyment of the final presentations due to length; Feedback, especially on the final presentations, was too brief to be truly helpful (likely a function of class size as well). ",
            "\u00a0Course was fantastic in allowing us to apply economic theories to healthcare issues. ",
            "\u00a0Great! Discussion based course so it depends on who else is in the class. Professor Busch did a great job of mediating conversations and encouraging participation. ",
            "\u00a0Outstanding class, the only criticism would be that the problem sets were a little too broad to generate specific thoughts/not directed enough. ",
            "\u00a0I loved this course - both the instructor and the course content. Strengths are the organization of the course, the clear expertise of the instructor and the assignments. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses have more to do with overall requirements. It seems like this course was more helpful than regular health economics and Im not sure why both are required for policy students. ",

            "\u00a0Susan you are a joy!  I appreciate your steadfastness in ensuring that we used economic principles and language to express our ideas and when we did not, you translated our jumbled language into something more precise.  The classroom felt lighthearted compared to other ones I have been in which definitely helped foster more discussion and made learning easier.    \r\nI think a weakness may have been in not disagreeing more strongly with students who said inaccurate things or used evidence that is weak to justify their arguments.  I felt confused sometimes in class when several new concepts were written on the board but you referred to them with demonstrative pronouns and I was unclear on which you were referring to. ",
            "\u00a0Facilitated great discussion, and extremely knowledgeable about healthcare economics and all the topics discussed. It was always interesting to hear her responses and analysis of the articles we each read. Made students feel included in the conversation. Everyone learned a lot! ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciate that the professor is willing to schedule personal meetings with each of us to discuss our final paper. I got many useful advice from our meetings. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Busch truly cares about her students, I have never been in any class at YSPH that allows you to have one-on-one time with your professor to discuss thoughts/ tentative research ideas. I sincerely value her insight and empathy as well - she was very understanding when I had to miss class a few times for interviews. Overall, she wants everyone to succeed and feel fulfilled from the course, which is a great feeling to have as a student. ",
            "\u00a0She was a great facilitator of classroom discussion. She seemed to really care about each student's input in the class, and she met with each student to discuss our final paper. ",
            "\u00a0One of the most thoughtful, intelligent, and eloquent teachers I have ever had. Susan transformed my understanding of health economics and pushed me to critically analyze topics ranging from addiction to insurance to innovation through an economic lense ",
            "\u00a0Susan was great! My only critique is that there was a person in our class who often made offensive or naive comments. would have been nice to see her manage this a little better. This person also spoke A LOT and it would have been nice to see her encouraging others to participate more rather that continuing to engage this persona and their follow up questions that took speaking time from other students. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Busch is great! She really challenges the students to go deeper and to think more critically. She does a great job in guiding students, especially for the final project. It's not as didactic of a course compared to microeconomics or epidemiology, so I'm not sure what to say about her teaching style, but she does act as a great facilitator of discussion! ",
            "\u00a0Truly one of the best professors at YSPH. ",
            "\u00a0Susan was a wonderful professor to learn from. A wealth of knowledge. Great teaching style. Kept everyone on point with discussion and provided a great learning environment that was always attentive. She was also very supportive for the final paper, meeting with students multiple times to ensure they they were on track. One of the best professors at YSPH and a pleasure to learn from! ",
            "\u00a0Professor Busch is a phenomenal professor who, like many at YSPH, found herself in command of a class a multiple of her preferred size, I think. Professor Busch did more than admirably, managing to steer the class towards compelling conversations weekly. For the future, I think a TF may be helpful for providing additional feedback on weekly assignments/final paper. ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Busch engaged students well through her discussions - would ask good leading questions to help students develop their own perspective rather than teach top-down. ",
            "\u00a0Fantastic!! One of my favorite professors of the semester! Super helpful in office hours and very flexible with meeting times. ",
            "\u00a0A clear and intelligent communicator who brought up many interesting issues. ",
            "\u00a0She was amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Dr. Busch was an awesome instructor. It is clear she has a mastery of the topic and is really interested in developing students critical thinking skills. I love her style of teaching as well and would highly recommend taking the course. Sometimes there were some delays in posting Canvas assignments but that is my only comment. ",
            "\u00a0the professor was fantastic. you can tell she is passionate about the topics. ",

        [
            "\u00a0Again, like much of the MPH curriculum, this is a deep dive into methodologies of health economics research and behavioral economics.  It is of value to students who do not want to become researchers as public health professionals of any type will need to understand and communicate research as evidence.  This was one of my favorite courses this year because there wasn't a lot of artificial work associated with it or an overload of readings merely to justify some grades, which I find some professors do for some reason.  It left space to actually enjoy the readings and think critically about them before class.  As usual, I wish the class had been smaller but I think a good discussion developed between students over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Deep dives into 2-5 health economics research articles per week on topics carefully selected by the professor. Students are able to analyze articles and discuss them from an economic lens by the end of the course! Professor is great and would highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to other students who have some background in economics and are interested in doing some independent research. ",
            "\u00a0If you are excited about the future of healthcare and economic theory, Professor Busch's course is the right fit! ",
            "\u00a0Highly recommend if you are interested in economics. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the professor and the class discussions, but I really never understood what the class was supposed to be about.  I probably would not take it again. ",
            "\u00a0Overall, expect a lot of readings. Expect to do the readings before class and to discuss them during class. That was the pattern week by week--no real \"homework\" other than reading responses. I would recommend it--not the BEST course ever, but it was nice to be reminded of economic theory to support my other coursework. ",
            "\u00a0Evaluates the methods of economic analysis to healthcare issues and uses journal articles to illustrate the different concepts. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview for health economics, giving you a broad range of topics to delve deeper into. I came away with a basic knowledge of how health economics research is conducted in a variety of settings. Worthwhile to take. ",
            "\u00a0If you've enjoyed the health economics courses at Yale, or if you have a strong econ background through undergrad, I suggest at least giving this class an opportunity. This class will afford you the chance to dive deeper into a range of health economic topics, understand the literature/current conversations, and try your hand at contributing to those discourses as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the language of economics provides a nice framework for evaluating the complex variables involved in health outcomes and this course provides the ability to use this framework effectively. ",
            "\u00a0Great! This class gives you a wide range of economic tools and frameworks to evaluate situations and leaves a lot of room for personal interests and opinions. ",
            "\u00a0A way of understanding economics in the real world, who highly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0This course goes far beyond health economics course - it provides a background on economic methods and the readings are well chosen. It definitely helps you to read economic literature as well as popular literature in a more critical and informed way. ",
