The prime example is the required memorization of 20+ obscure formulas I will never use later in my career. The lectures are just reading off a slide- I found that 70% of the class didn't even bother attending.\r\n\r\nHaving multiple choice tests with no room for partial credit is lazy grading and does not measure how well we have learned the material. This shows very well in the class average on tests (78%, in an intro course). ",
            "\u00a0The course material was great, and it gave me a wonderful foundation for epidemiology. My one problem was that the lectures were often very dry, and classes consisted of Dr. Risch reading directly off the powerpoints, so it was difficult to remain engaged. I also feel like some important concepts that would be critical for homework/exams were reviewed a bit haphazardly during lecture; much of my time preparing for assignments and exams was me trying to teach myself things that should have been more emphasized in class.

The problem sets and structure of 3 exams were good since they helped with material retention. \r\n\r\nHowever, the exams were poorly written for the most part. The wording of many questions was awkward and ambiguous, and it was concerning how this trend was common among all three hourly exams. The lectures were not engaging, since it involved reading off a powerpoint presentation. I noticed many people stopped showing up for this reason. ",

I sometimes felt that the instructor inserted too much of his own opinion on certain topics, and this complicated the subject and detracted from my understanding of the material. I sometimes felt as though the exams were made up of purposefully tricky questions (unfriendly or unclear language that the TFs could not or would not clarify) and very specific examples discussed maybe only once in a single lecture.

Our professor did a horrible job conveying topics in lecture and I found myself relying almost entirely on self-study and section. As an HCM student with limited science background, this course was a challenge, but one I looked forward to. Since my science knowledge isn't as robust, this will likely be the only Epi course I take. Unfortunately, I am leaving it feeling bad about my performance and what I took away from the course. I found that all the learning I did was entirely based on trying to answer homework assignments or test prep, and no natural learning took place. ",

I had to teach myself 100% of the material because the lecture and the lecture slides were overwhelmingly confusing and completely unhelpful.  I am offended that after all the money I pay to attend this school, this was the quality of class I got in return.

Prof Risch usually used very complex syntax to explain concepts, and as an international, I would find it harder to follow sometimes, but fortunately, we have the records, and I could come back to where I didn't really understand, and it was very helpful during the final weekActually, I believe if I am more familiar with English language, I would be enjoy much more than I could've in this class - whenever I went back to the video, lectures were really well-structured and logical. The way Prof. Risch spoke and structured the class was truly amazing. Especially enjoyed all those cartoons throughout the whole courses!! ",

The strength of this class included the details of scientific knowledge on epidemiology, systematic methods of conducting epi investigations and analytical skills. I liked the online course format since it made the time of joining in the class much more flexible. Also the online course format made it possible to review the lecture for some difficulties several times. However, the weakness is that the speed of professor is a little bit fast on class, sometimes I cannot catch him, also, I think the professor need to translate some difficulties into understandable language instead of just reading the slides, which will make students truly understand it. ",
            "\u00a0The large class size of this course was its main detriment in my opinion. It was hard to be engaged in this heavily didactic environment. I would have prepared to learn the material in a more intimate, discussion-based setting. Discussion sections were effecting in providing this environment, and this is where I learned the most I believe, and was were I could bolster my understanding. The content was dense and heavily detail oriented but also was effective at pointing out important concepts nested within the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think that there is great room for improvement in the development of this course. Lecture was not very engaging and I really felt like I could prepare myself for exams by just reading the lecture slides. The slides themselves had so much written information on them, it was almost difficult to sort through to understand what was most valuable. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the instructor didn't just read off the powerpoints. I stopped going to class halfway through the semester because I could get the exact same information looking off the powerpoints at home. Why am I paying for an instructor to teach when it doesn't seem like his presence makes any difference? ",
            "\u00a0One strength of this course was the sections with TAs on Fridays. I think it was a good way to connect what we were learning throughout the week with specific examples. I also enjoyed that the homework was pass/fail because it took the pressure off of getting every answer right and allowed me to focus on learning in general. \r\n\r\nOne weakness of this course was the lectures. I know that I could have learned more from a smaller class size and more face time with the professor and other students. \r\n\r\nI am also very annoyed that I bought a book for the course, and the course barely followed it. \r\n\r\nI am also annoyed that we had to memorize equations for the tests. Memorization is an outdated, ineffective, and inefficient teaching model and its actually kind of embarrassing that Yale is still allowing professors to enforce that especially in a field as applied as Public Health.

Even if one felt like the mastered the material and concepts and could explain it to others and understand what was going on, the wording of the tests made it so it was not a completely fair representation of how much students knew.

When told a student would miss class, they would express disapproval. \r\n\r\nFurther, students were told that if they did not attend and did not get the homework 100% correct they would fail that homework.

He also would give us rules about what language to use for epidemiology (for example calling people \"patients\" and not \"cases\" in a case-control study) that he would always forget to follow himself, so his criticisms of his colleagues seemed hypocritical and entirely out of place for an introductory class. During tests, he had a policy of not letting the TAs answer our questions for fear that different ones would answer the same question differently.

In other words, after 20 or so minutes of lecturing, have a practice problem and give people 5 minutes to work on the problem in the middle of lecture. This would help people engage with the lecture material, give them a sense of how well they are understanding the material, and would vary the pacing of lectures. \r\n\r\nAs stated in the previous response box, I think the most important change this class should make is how problem sets are graded -- they should be longer, worth 40 percent, and due BEFORE section starts.
