            "\u00a0I learned varied Spanish vocabulary, grammar, and speaking and writing skills. I also learned about Spanish culture. ",
            "\u00a0I learned basic conversational Spanish. I can now understand Narcos without subtitles. ",
            "\u00a0I became more confident in my Spanish speaking abilities, and I learned much about how Spanish language is structured. For me, the most important thing was that I was able to start understanding my professor in class verbally, and through that I was able to get a better grasp on Spanish grammar which made all the difference on how I view my capabilities in Spanish. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a more in depth knowledge of the Spanish language. I was able to improve my speaking, listening, and comprehension through out the course. ",
            "\u00a0I really developed my language and communication skills in this course. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course covered various aspects of the Spanish language (speaking, reading, writing) very well. It was interesting and engaging, and the instructor was very good. The class made me eager to master the Spanish language. The course could be improved with more prompt grading - assignments took a very long time to be returned. More in-class writing assignments would also be useful to improve writing skills. ",
            "\u00a0So, I can appreciate that languages are taught in seminar form. This fosters more personal interaction between students and other students as well as students and the professor (thereby supposedly increasing the overall participation of each student bc they feel more invested). That being said, I don't know if meeting every day and only for 50 minutes works super well? I don't know, I'll probably take the intensive classes next semester which don't meet every day, but do meet for 2-3 hours. That could just be a weird preference of mine though. ",
            "\u00a0The required books are ridiculously expensive and you only use half the book for L2. ",
            "\u00a0For the strengths, I think that the course has an extremely thought-out curriculum that has various components that complement each other greatly. I really appreciated having a course catalog that went through day-by-day what we were doing, and with the matching homework assignments included as well, so it meant that no assignment or big project was ever really a surprise. I am not sure how you could make it stronger, but I know my professor struggled with keeping on top of all of the grades, so maybe the course could try to accommodate that a bit more. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized and spread out the learning material well through the semester. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very organized and the professor very competent.  It moved somewhat quickly but that was fine. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, I would. It was a great language course. The workload was heavy at times, but it was manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This is how I would talk to another student: Like, you need to take a language credit. For a person like me who thought they were done with language stuff in high school (and didn't take language up until this point at Yale) that's a bit of an adjustment. Get your language requirement out of the way your Freshmen year. There's nothing particularly exhilarating about learning the subjunctive mood in Spanish, but the professors do their best to be as engaging as possible. Go in with a positive attitude and this class will fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would not, because the books are too expensive. It's a shame because the course itself was great. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would because I think this course is so important for anyone who wants a better understanding of both Spanish language and Spanish culture. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because it is still introductory to Spanish, but also a higher learning level for advancement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the professor was great, and the material engaging. "
