            "\u00a0Learned ASL vocabulary and grammar. Also learned about Deaf culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0An understanding of sentence structure, ASL grammar, expanded vocabulary (from ASL 110), ASL slang, and how to communicate well in ASL. ",
            "\u00a0My ASL improved so much this semester. Because we started learning grammar, I really felt like I was pushed further than I was in ASL 110, in the best way possible because I felt myself get better and better. We learned about signing different types of sentences, conceptually accurate signs, ASL slang, new vocabulary, conjunctions, and many other topics. We also learned more about Deaf culture, as we all did presentations on important figures and advocates within the Deaf community and history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot more ASL vocabulary (money, food, slang) and grammar (questions, rhetorical questions, negation, role shifting) as well as learning about important Deaf and hard of hearing figures in history and a bit about ASL storytelling. My fluency and understanding of signing also improved through practice. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my skills in ASL, not only increasing my vocabulary but learning how to have more in-depth conversations, ask questions, describe long events, tell multi-part stories, and \"think\" in ASL structure! I also tested my receptive skills every day and was challenged with guest signers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more advanced ASL grammar and more vocabulary ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Very engaging, Jessica is an amazing teacher and class is very fun. The environment is great for learning and practicing, and making mistakes is okay! \r\nWeaknesses: Practically none! The only thing is that there is not a lot of homework besides the midterm and final project (we had little assignments on the weekends), which means we didn't have a lot of work outside of class to practice and receive feedback. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the professor, the content, and the pacing of the course. This class is well run and I never felt like like we were being tested on subjects we hadnt learned. \r\nWeaknesses are that presenting in class takes a while so some classes were dedicated to just watching our classmates sign homework. However, even this allowed us to practice watching others. ",
            "\u00a0I can't think of any weaknesses related to this class. It is full of passionate people who want to learn ASL and has become a very nice learning community. ",
            "\u00a0This course, thanks to Professor Tanner, was always something I looked forward to, 5 days a week. It was so fun and engaging and I always knew I would learn a lot and be supported in that learning. That is a huge strength because it really motivated me to pay attention, practice, work hard on projects, and improve my ASL skills. It was difficult sometimes because we had such a large class to complete class activities in time. Yale needs to hire more ASL instructors so that there can be more sections offered, particularly for ASL I and II. Professor Tanner really made it work within those constraints but the program should expand to meet the student interest!! The one other weakness I would mention is that the grading on projects does not always feel holistic, because a lot of the feedback and points lost are focused on small mistakes in signing-- but I do think that the additional feedback and comments that were possible for the final project using GoReact were a big improvement. ",
            "\u00a0I loved ASL 120 and the course has so many strengths. Professor Tanner creates wonderful activities that really test your knowledge. She builds the course well and invites fantastic, intriguing guests. She fosters a warm, collaborative community. The one weakness is that I felt there were not enough formal assessments in some units. The projects were great, but would have loved more mini projects through out- I understand that it's difficult to grade so many classes, but maybe the grading can be staggered. ",
            "\u00a0It was an excellent course! Professor Tanner is the best. "

            "\u00a0Yes yes yes professor tanner is one of the nicest, sweetest, people ever. Though the course doesnt feel hard at all, you learn so much by the end! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! ",
            "\u00a0I would 100% recommend! Jessica is amazing, and the course is so helpful in furthering your knowledge of ASL. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! Deciding to take ASL was one of the best decisions of my first year at Yale. It has been such a wonderful experience and has opened my eyes to the strength and struggles of the Deaf community. Going to this class every morning has been the best way I could possibly have started my days at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend ASL to any student, and ASL II to any student with some prior ASL background. It is a super fun course and you will learn so much. I was glad I continued after ASL 1 because I have so much more confidence and fluency in conversations now. Learning ASL has really opened my mind to a whole new way of thinking about language and how ideas can be communicated, and it has also made me much more aware of Deaf culture, Deaf perspectives, and ableism in general. Also incredibly useful to communicate across rooms or in loud dining halls even if you are hearing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Hands down! ASL is such a unique language; it's beautiful and emphasizes things no other language does in communication. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! ASL is an incredible language and I'm very glad to have learned some of it. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course with Jessica Tanner  she was engaging, taught efficiently, and had students practice the language well. I felt comfortable and confident making language errors and learning from them. The skills learned in ASL II are good enough to get to basic conversation, presentation, and storytelling, and are a great step to being able to speak ASL to others. "
