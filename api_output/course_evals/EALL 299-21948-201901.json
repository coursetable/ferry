            "\u00a0By far the most intellectually stimulating class I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about different decolonial theories, history, and literary works from this course. ",
            "\u00a0I see the world in a completely different light now. The role of coloniality in modernity is something so crucial, and yet though this is my final year at Yale it was the first time I'd come across a course like this. ",
            "\u00a0I learned an incredible amount about a content area barely touched upon by other Yale courses, even within ethnic studies courses: ethnic studies with regards to East Asia. I learned to apply postcolonialist theory to East Asia and I learned for the first time about colonialism within East Asia. ",
            "\u00a0Contextualizing power within East Asian geopolitics and society was a fundamental goal of the course, and the course kind of functioned as a critical examination of certain aspects of East Asian history, territoriality, and societal dynamics. We got tastes of examining East Asia (and the concept of \"East Asia\") through all your classic decolonial lenses--gender, sexuality, race, coloniality, environment, language, borders, etc. ",
            "\u00a0A course like this is not taught anywhere else at Yale, not in ER&M, certainly not another in East Asian Studies. I learned to do intensive research, to primary texts in conversation with secondary sources, and to continually challenge my own thoughts and ways of learning. ",
            "\u00a0Poland is an incredibly thoughtful and engaging instructor who is deeply concerned with the issues of the class as well as the well being and intellectual growth of his students. I wish there were more classes at Yale that centered on the decolonial questions that this course examines--I would have happily taken several more courses on the topic taught by Professor Poland and still felt like there was much left to learn.\r\nWhereas many other courses at Yale, especially those in Global Affairs, Economics, English, Philosophy, and even History not only fail to grapple with the global inequalities that result from historical and continued forms of imperialism and power orders but in fact propagate these inequalities through their American/Eurocentrism, this course sheds a light on these dynamics and their real effects on knowledge production, historical trajectories, art, and lived experience.\r\nI cannot rave enough about how fearless and independent Professor Poland and this class is in its willingness to question what has been authoritatively said before and instead look to reframe things from perspectives that are marginalized and disempowered.\r\nBy far, this course was one of the most intellectually stimulating as well as academically and personally productive of all those I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Taking this course, I was exposed to a wide range of literature, primarily, from East Asia from authors around the twentieth century. We obtained knowledge by putting the texts, such as news, narratives, films or essays, in conversation with one another. The most crucial skill that the course developed was the practice of understanding texts across platforms by considering subjectivities found in each. In terms of insight, I think the capacity to see the relations of coloniality in various fields will be informative throughout life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Open discussion floor for everyone. \r\nKeep in mind that this class is not easy and very challenging. It also has an enormous amount of readings. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed this course because of Professor Poland and the artistic work we read. I think I could have gotten much more out of this course if I was able to read all of the theory that Professor Poland provided us with. He is very excited and enthusiastic, which I really appreciate in a teacher. The only, unfortunate thing, is that, sadly, Yale students are really busy and often don't have time to do all the reading - especially in this class when there is so much reading assigned. This can lead students to just not do the reading at all, making for even less understanding. I think it would have been better if there were a couple of key concepts that Poland wanted us to know, and that instead of providing heavy and dense reading that would take up a lot of time, he provided short readings or just discussed and explained these concepts in class. Then, we could apply these concepts to the literary works that we were looking at. I think this would have been more helpful in terms of actually learning and retaining these concepts. Because there's so much richness to work with, Professor Poland's desire to fit it all in is understandable, but often times it was too overwhelming and made for even less retention - such as the history overviews. It's hard to remember everything from the history powerpoints, even though that is really important information for us to know - this is really sad to me, because I feel like I could have gotten much more out of this class. It's just that, realistically, Yale students can't really juggle it all. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: student led discussion facilitated by prof allowing us to wrestle with hard-to-understand content ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness I can think of for the course is that at times we got too bogged down in academic language. This was honestly a minor thing and is to be expected of a class that grapples so much with abstract theory. I would have liked to start film screenings earlier in the semester, too. The strengths of the course were countless - Professor Poland provided us with a foundation in theory first before we began to closely analyze literature and film. I also liked the progression of the syllabus; everything built on the previous material. ",
            "\u00a0I really, really enjoyed the readings for this course! ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is an absolute strength. At times it felt like the readings were too much, but I definitely feel like this is one of those courses where I gained more from the challenge of heavy coursework than was discouraged by it. The reading responses (having 7) were a great idea; they kept me engaged with the material and made me feel in constant conversation with Professor Poland. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Poland is unique amongst all of the professors I have had at Yale in that he is singularly the only instructor I had who seriously encouraged intellectual and academic risk-taking amongst his students. In most other courses, I find myself constantly reminded by instructors to make more conservative arguments and adhere to the norms and forms of the field. Professor Poland, on the other hand, is much more interested in the generative possibilities of a college course--how we as students may learn to think creatively and originally in relation to texts and traditions rather than merely regurgitate what the field has already produced. \r\nI have never felt so free to be honest about the academic and intellectual quandaries that I have as I did with him, in his class, and in assignments for him. This is not to say that he did not challenge us. One of the distinctive features of his teaching style and his syllabi is his ability to sit well with complexity and liminality, and to model for us how to do the same.\r\nMoreover, the bend of his courses is distinctly ethical--concerned with the perspectives and stories that have been marginalized by history, politics, and power relations. More than any other instructor at Yale, Professor Poland has encouraged me to take such perspectives and positions seriously, in addition to my own.\r\nFinally, Professor Poland is ridiculously personable and accessible--I have spent hours with him in office hours just discussing one assignment. He believes in his students and at an institution that seems often overly concerned with \"getting it right\" and with prestige, he believes in giving his students chances to keep trying. This is because he teaches out of a genuine care for education. ",
            "\u00a0The course invited students to take ownership of their experience by considering the syllabus and encouraging us to bring what we have to class. It was certainly the most engaging seminar that I have taken at Yale. It was also the most self-conscious class that I have taken and led to a very intellectually stimulating learning experience. I would not necessarily recommend making the course material less, but one thing to consider is that we do not get to fully discuss each text in the syllabus. However the student still has the chance to think over and receive feedback on material through reading responses. "

            "\u00a0Yes, but would caution you. Very challenging, but you learn a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student - the readings/films are super interesting, Professor Poland is a wonderful teacher, and you're able to broaden the ways you think in many ways. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! 100% Wish Prof. Poland would still be around to teach it. This course was life-changing. So many ways in which capitalism, imperialism, decolonization, and modernity connect and it's never been discussed in any other course I've taken. ",
            "\u00a0I would wholeheartedly recommend this class to everybody. In fact, I'd say this class is essential for any ethnic studies scholar. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Poland is leaving after this semester, but absolutely! De/post/coloniality and critical theory in East Asia is honestly underrepresented within decolonial studies as well as Yale departments (East Asian Studies, ER&M) and this course was so important in trying to bridge the two. If the departments bring this course back (and they SHOULD), I would absolutely recommend this course ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student at Yale. The course material is unique; the level of challenge is unique; the professor is unique. I don't think very many courses about East Asia focus on its relationship to colonization throughout history and I find myself to be incredibly lucky to have taken this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Poland is an incredibly thoughtful and engaging instructor who is deeply concerned with the issues of the class as well as the well being and intellectual growth of his students. I wish there were more classes at Yale that centered on the decolonial questions that this course examines--I would have happily taken several more courses on the topic taught by Professor Poland and still felt like there was much left to learn.\r\nWhereas many other courses at Yale, especially those in Global Affairs, Economics, English, Philosophy, and even History not only fail to grapple with the global inequalities that result from historical and continued forms of imperialism and power orders but in fact propagate these inequalities through their American/Eurocentrism, this course sheds a light on these dynamics and their real effects on knowledge production, historical trajectories, art, and lived experience.\r\nI cannot rave enough about how fearless and independent Professor Poland and this class is in its willingness to question what has been authoritatively said before and instead look to reframe things from perspectives that are marginalized and disempowered.\r\nBy far, this course was one of the most intellectually stimulating as well as academically and personally productive of all those I have taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is interested in picking up new practices of reading and challenging the vocabulary that we use to describe the world. The course provides literature from East Asia, in the form of news, narratives, films as well as theoretical texts to produce decolonial knowledge. The course is possibly the most engaging and intellectually stimulating seminar that I have taken. I would highly recommend the experience! "
