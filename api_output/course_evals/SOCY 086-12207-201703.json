            "\u00a0I learned about modern Chinese society and its roots, both from a top-down governmental and economic perspective and from a bottom-up social and environmental perspective. I also learned about basic sociological theory, practice, and analysis. Finally, I learned about today's China-US relations and the future of China on the global stage. ",
            "\u00a0The topics are well chosen and organised, going from broad overviews to deep case studies drawing on Davis' extensive knowledge of China, probably the biggest draw of the course. \r\nThe debate is a good chance to really make sure you do actually know the material, as you never know what will come up.\r\nI learnt where most of the provinces are in China, but I am not sure this helped me understand the rest of the course ",
            "\u00a0This course was an incredible overview of issues in Modern China--I loved listening to Professor Davis's lectures on the development of Chinese family and relations, sociological trends such as civil spheres in China, and economic growth. ",
            "\u00a0I chose this course because I wanted to better understand modern and contemporary China, which I did learn very much about. However, I ended up appreciating most the insights into the field of sociology that this course imparted. The lectures, debates, and guest speakers really allowed students to sample material, including research, in many different subfields of sociology, which was especially interesting in the context of China, since so much information about the country in recent years is just from the perspective of politics. ",
            "\u00a0I developed some of the skills a sociologist might employ such as analyzing statistical data, ethnography, field research. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an excellent introduction to modern China. We took broad view of the social, political, and economic institutions in China and how they have developed to become what they are now. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about recent China. Everything between the communist revolution to the present, I feel much more knowledgeable about the very large and diverse country. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: I loved what we talked about in class and our readings. They genuinely gave me so much new information about today's China and its population, as well as a new perspective on societies at large. Professor Davis is an absolute expert on China, as well, and she brought her passion for the topic and insights into the areas she was most interested in into the class, which made it even better. I also really liked the debates we did in class, since it was a good way to use the knowledge we had gained and to really delve into a topic. \r\n\r\nWeakenesses: At times, the class felt like just a lecture to a smaller group of students. The time we got to discuss some texts was limited, and we had to rush through certain topics, so we couldn't go as in depth as I would have liked. ",
            "\u00a0The most obvious strength is the in-depth knowledge of the instructor, and she does know how to teach a class well.\r\nThe essay pieces are perhaps too short to fully answer the question in detail, so perhaps more specific essay questions would be more engaging.\r\nMy biggest issue with the class is that it was taught like a lecture, entirely by powerpoint. This is a fine way to get the information across but wastes the fact that there are only 14 people in the class. There was rarely any organic discussion that makes some other yale seminars exemplary. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures could be made more interactive. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course could have been more engaging at times, but I understand that the lectures are necessary for a full understanding of the material. Also, it was not always clear what readings were expected for which class session, since the readings are grouped by weeks. There were a few times when an assigned reading wasn't discussed in class at all. ",
            "\u00a0Class time could be more consistently structured. We had classes of lecture and classes of discussion, but when we did one or the other was fairly random. More structure could have helped the complexity of modern China feel more manageable. ",
            "\u00a0This course had some really interesting readings from the New Yorker and other cool publications, and the discussions in class usually resulted in stimulating discourse. Lectures were largely disorganized, however, and there were a many readings that were too long, irrelevant to most of the material, or both. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the strengths were the wide range of topics covered. I think one of the areas of improvement would be to have fewer debates. While I think they were engaging and helped me learn about the content. Maybe one fewer debate, and have it replaced by a regular essay would be beneficial. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a wonderful job of introducing the basic elements of sociology; however, it feels a bit dry at times, since sometimes the lectures repeat the material covered in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The subject is intriguing and the course material provided is intriguing. The teacher does a good job picking good information out of a crowd of mediocre information. \r\n\r\nSometimes it can be a lot at once and a lot of useful/interesting information gets pushed aside. Additionally, basic information needed to understand the topic at hand often is not provided. Not ever needed for a paper or quiz but is often really helpful as a building block for complex topics and relationships. Additionally, sometimes teacher gets carried away by course material and doesn't directly answer questions or address topics but, like I said, course material is a lot and it might be because of that as well. "

            "\u00a0Yes! This course is a fantastic way to learn about China and to gain a deeper knowledge about sociology in general. After taking the class, I feel more prepared to take future sociology classes and classes about China with the historical and modern perspectives the class showed me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is well equipped to teach those at all level of knowledge about China, and the topics are engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to another student--this was a great experience for the first seminar I've been in here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are looking to gain just a general understanding of modern China, it is great. ",
            "\u00a0If you're looking for an introduction to modern China, definitely take this class. I came into this course with extremely little knowledge of anything to do with China, and I feel now that I'm fluent in most discussions about the country. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I recommend this course! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, I think this course has really opened my eyes to a large portion of the world that I never really considered before. I feel like I can take what I've learned in this course to my outside world. I can understand global affairs slightly better now. And Professor Davis is a really kind and caring professor. Would definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone interested in studying China in general; however, if you're not interested in the region, it might not be a very compelling course. Students coming into the class with some background knowledge have an advantage, so do take that into account if you have minimal knowledge concerning the history of the region. However, this course was wonderful overall in introducing students to the subject and to the complex mannerisms of Chinese society. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend the course to anyone with a vague interest in modern day China. Not exactly the most in-depth view of China today but it is enough to wet the palate. Really fun course and that's coming from someone who really isn't into sociology-- the best part of me wishes it took a greater look at the structure of Xi's government and how that affects Chinese citizens instead of a strict sociology approach but the course is still fun and intellectually stimulating.
