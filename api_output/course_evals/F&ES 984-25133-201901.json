I also gained experience working with external clients, which I feel is a valuable skill for professionally-oriented grad students. Dan additionally brought in a few great guest lecturers, who provided interesting insights into current climate & energy topics including New Jersey's clean energy policy initiatives. ",

I really liked the guest speakers that Utech brought in. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: there could have been slightly more structure early on in the semester, in terms of connecting with our clients and creating a project proposal. ",

I appreciated having the structure, deadlines, and support from Dan when needed, and I thought it helped to have pre-set expectations with our clients that were set by Dan/the course. I thought that the list of project topics were good and I enjoyed having the opportunity to dig into a specific policy area for a set amount of time. I think that if what you want is basically a more formal, structured independent study, then this class is a good choice. I also liked the guest lectures we had, especially Kathleen Frangione (chief policy advisor for Gov. Murphy of NJ). ",

Maureen Burke's Business & Environment Consulting Clinic is a better fit for those looking for more feedback from the professor. ",
