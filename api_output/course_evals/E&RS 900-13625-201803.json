            "\u00a0I began the semester anticipating this course. Its title led me to expect a thought-provoking and ongoing debate with faculty and peers about what Europe is. This question - where Europe ends and other geographic entities begin, who is European, when Europe became modern Europe, and whether Europe is defined by geography or culture and history - is one that has and continues to be fraught, with important academic and practical implications. A potential strength of this course could be that it can offer a forum for thorny debates about Europe while also cementing cohesion for a new cohort of ERS students. Unfortunately, as the course currently stands, it totally misses the mark. \r\n\r\nWe met four times as a class, each time with a different faculty member to discuss their research (although one has moved their focus away from Europe since some early work on it). However, these discussions neither clearly fed into the course's stated objective (on the syllabus) of prompting discussion about sources, nor any other general debate about what Europe is, who is European, when Europe is, or other, related questions. Instead, we read three pieces by the faculty member, and the seminar consisted mainly of scatter-shot questions from the class about things that had caught our interest. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it seemed more appropriate to a guest-lecturer series rather than a full-credit course. At most, the faculty sessions could be credited with introducing us to various alternative disciplines' approaches to Europe, yet this was also not emphasized in class, whether by the professor, guest or students. Sessions rarely, if ever, referenced past guests, and only one guest made a significant effort to explain their discipline's approach to scholarship. \r\n\r\nFinally, scheduling for the class was bizarre and problematic. Actual, regularly scheduled sessions were tremendously infrequent. Perhaps to make up for this lack of actual class time, we learned after the start of the year that we were also required to attend a colloquium that met at different times throughout the semester. Not only were the colloquia detached from any clear, overarching course-purpose, they often met on Tuesdays, a historically busy day for Yale students with official class. I had a course that regularly conflicted with the colloquia, and thus only attended one of three \"mandatory\" sessions after receiving exemption from the professor. \r\n\r\nIn the event, this was a blessing - I saw little value in the class and so the less time spent in it the better. However, realistically, this is a problem that needs a better solution. If the course will continue with the infrequent-meeting model, perhaps move it to a less prime-time slot and not be so dependent on a colloquia that meets on a Tuesday afternoon. However, the infrequent courses clearly stands at odds with any effort to make the course a substantial foundation to subsequent scholarship at Yale. So if more time and thought were invested in the syllabus and course structure, hopefully students would also be given more time in class actually engaging with the questions and peers that drew us here in the first place.
