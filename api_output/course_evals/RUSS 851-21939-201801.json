            "\u00a0Our proseminar was a very challenging course, however, I feel that it was one of the most productive course that I have taken at Yale. Being exposed to a vast array of theory and contextualizing that theory with discussions of theory, literature, and our profession was invaluable. Though the work load felt, at times, nearly impossible, I believe that was a reflection of the reality of being a literary scholar. More than anything, I feel that the proseminar was such an important course due to the range of scholarship that was required of us. Not only did we discuss theory and approach concepts in abstract ways, but actively conducted research, worked in genres of public scholarship and service in the field, and explored processes of editing and publishing.
