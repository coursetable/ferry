            "\u00a0As a continuation of L1 and L2 Japanese, this course allowed  students to further develop Japanese language skills. In addition to learning a great deal of new kanji characters, we also gained the ability to develop far more complex sentence structures and to be more detailed in our descriptions. By the end of the course we were all much better at carrying a conversation in Japanese. ",
            "\u00a0I continued to develop the Japanese reading, writing, and speaking skills I learned in L1/L2. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned not only the four basic skills - speaking, listening, reading, writing - but also more about Japanese culture! ",
            "\u00a0My reading and writing skills increased immensely. I found it much easier and less time intensive to complete homework assignments than the past two semesters. "

        [
            "\u00a0One of the strengths of this course was the way it was taught. Some of the grammar structures we learned were tough, but we were given a lot of tools to learn them. In addition to individual studying, the teachers would devote as much class time necessary to make sure we understood new topics. I think if there was a way to practice kanji in class outside of quizzes it would be an improvement though. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well structured for learning. There is quite a bit of daily homework, but if you manage it well and make it part of your routine, it forces you to learn a lot very quickly. One thing I did miss from L1/L2 was having all of our grades on canvas, but this semester we only have 2 rotating professors so that's understandable. ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is great in that the teachers are helpful, the textbooks are instructive - I can see myself putting what I learnt into real-life conversations - the scale of class is small so I can practice a lot, and the homework is carefully designed for me to master the knowledge from all aspects. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\nI like that regular homework assignments drilled reading and writing skills while the time in class was spent drilling listening and speaking skills. I thought it was a good balance\r\nI LOVE the Sura Sura textbook!! It's so well organized and I really appreciate being able to review grammar patterns at the end of the semester.\r\nThis course also focused a lot more on teaching Japanese culture, which I enjoyed.\r\nI actually really appreciated the daily kanji quiz in the last half of the semester. It gave me more of an incentive to really learn the kanji instead of just quickly filling out the worksheet in class. Speaking of kanji worksheets, I think the Sura kanji worksheets were more effective than the JSL ones because they reviewed more old kanji that we were likely to have forgotten.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI don't like that in the JSL textbooks we are never able to review what we've learned/the textbook doesn't seem to make as much of a conscious effort as Sura Sura to practice what we've previously learned. \r\nThere were also some weeks where we had a kanji quiz, a large assignment or skit, and a test within the same week, and that was really stressful. I understand the need to prepare for an upcoming exam, but the work could be spread out a little more so as to not be so overwhelming. "

            "\u00a0Yes. The course is very well organized, and it is very fun. ",
            "\u00a0If a student wants to learn Japanese I would highly recommend this course; it's the best language learning experience I've had. However, if they weren't sure if they were serious about learning a new language or didn't think they'd continue with it I wouldn't recommend it as much, just because the class is a lot of work and I think it's best to choose classes that are worth it to you. ",
            "\u00a0As usual, I would 100% recommend this course to anyone interested in the language. Yale's Japanese program is a great place to start learning the language. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to whoever interested in getting to know the language and the culture, because one can really get those from the course. ",
            "\u00a0I HIGHLY recommend this course. Though I admit it is a ridiculous amount of work (necessary, unfortunately) and I found myself wondering why the hell I ever stumbled into Japanese in the first place, the feeling of accomplishment after completing a writing assignment or knowing the meaning of a string of kanji is like no other. I had a really rough time in Japanese class last semester and was feeling uneasy going into this semester but after about a month in I felt like I was starting to finally get the hang of it. My speaking is still terrible because I'm super self-conscious about it, but my reading and writing skills have improved ten-fold even since the end of last semester. Maruyama and Stever are both incredibly patient and have never made me feel bad for not knowing something. They are also entertaining and taught us a lot about Japanese culture, which was somewhat difficult to do in L1 and L2 since we were solely focused on the language learning. Overall, it's rough sometimes (homework every day, self-doubt, etc.) but truly worth it. "
