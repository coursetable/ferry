            "\u00a0Leadership as a general concept, with specific applications in the education field. You don't need to become a teacher to learn the ropes for how to better work in teams and lead in the real world, which is exactly what this course teaches. Super important skills that will serve you well beyond college. One of the best courses I've taken in undergrad! ",
            "\u00a0- developed a strong framework for thinking about problems, in education and beyond\r\n- gained a stronger sense of the educational field through case study work\r\n- developed leadership and group-work skills ",
            "\u00a0I learned about American public education reform. Lots of research-backed insight into the factors/variables that drive success and improvement. Good selection of case studies that illuminated some of the major debates in current ed. policy. ",
            "\u00a0This course gives an overview of how to approach large, systemic issues in education through the various cases you read each week. beyond just this content, you gain teamwork and communication skills through the final project. There are also several opportunities for student leadership throughout the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about many of the highly complex challenges facing educational leaders at the district, school, and classroom levels. Learned how to break down these complex problems into manageable parts using different case study and problem-solving methods.  Worked in a group on a semester-long project in which we used different methods and diagrams to understand our chosen problem and map out potential solutions (root cause diagram, logic model, driver diagram, etc.). Learned leadership and communication skills working in groups and in class discussions. My big takeaways from the course were the importance of leaders creating a strong mission and a united staff whose members are all bought-in to a common goal. This is especially important for superintendents and principals. ",
            "\u00a0Of the 5 classes this semester, I learned the most in this class.\r\n\r\nFrom a purely intellectual standpoint, I learned about how deeply systemic the schooling system is - dependent on outputs like school safety, teacher quality and cultures of learning that people tend to overlook when discussing education. I also learned about the power of the markets in education and the importance of teachers in education.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I learned immensely from our final group project, able to directly address a problem in education (school finance) and doing so by working closely with 3 classmates. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a new way in which to approach real issues in public education. Specifically, I learned more about the case method and how difficult it has been for public education leaders to solve prevalent problems. I have also learned about the most important and current issues in U.S. public education and have developed the skills to envision myself as a leader in the field one day. ",
            "\u00a0So so much. Learning about the improvement process and improvement science was part of what made this class so incredible, I would count it as both knowledge and skill, because we learned about improvement by engaging in it. Also, I learned how to function productively as a group. Before this class I often felt like working in a group was a hindrance to efficiently accomplishing a goal, but this course helped me see how a group can come to a better answer than an individual. And then of course there was a huge amount of knowledge transferred about the system of American education. ",
            "\u00a0Leadership, communication, and critical thinking skills. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the mechanisms of education in America, compared to other nations. Considering this was my first seminar, I must say I improved my skills in speaking and presenting my ideas. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to challenge my assumptions, practically think about making changes in both education and in general, and about the problems and possible solutions in education. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to switch from thinking strictly about the problems facing our education system to considering methods of organizing to drive solutions.  Given the very current nature of the material, our class was able to have engaging conversations about topics that we both understand on a personal level and feel passionate about and committed to.  I feel more comfortable having those types of group discussions after having taken this class.  Additionally, this course introduced me to some of the tools used in developing educational programs of improvement and reform used in practice by education leadership.  The semester-long project brought us through (albeit a fast-tracked version) the process of identifying a problem and methodically identifying points of intervention.  Rather than doing work that is unique to the classroom setting, the work we did was reflective of the type of work done in practice by professionals in the field of education.  It was a very relevant project that has given me a new set of skills that will be useful beyond college. ",
            "\u00a0I wanted to experience a new style of learning through seminar and project-based class. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0I really love the case and discussion based learning, as well as weekly memos due before class to digest the readings before coming into seminar prepared to discuss them. If I could change anything, it would be having more class! We'd always be done with the seminar block time before everyone finished with what we all wanted to discuss haha. Professor Lemons is fantastic. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\n- case study format\r\n- cumulative group project and exhibition\r\n- Professor Lemons' energy and pedagogy\r\n- classroom organization\r\n- the ways in which the class itself mirrors the framework it provides for problem-solving\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n- time of day ",
            "\u00a0Only complaint was the lateness of the time-slot -- otherwise a really great learning experience. ",
            "\u00a0Cap the seminar! 22+ students are too many. The course could be a lot more rigorous. Instead of spending class time doing norm setting exercises, regurgitating details of case studies, etc. spend more time having a free-flowing, deep discussion about the course readings. Sometimes the assignments were too structured, leading to contrived and superficial academic work. Get rid of the group project or at least add some more meaningful and challenging individual project, like a term paper. That said, being able to interact with a panel of professional educators at the end of the term was pretty exciting and a rewarding experience, though not actually that informative. ",
            "\u00a0S:\r\n\r\nComprehensive look at the systemic aspects of education, opportunity to interface with some of the most important educational leaders in CT, fascinating case studies that look at where education has succeeded and failed.\r\n\r\nW:\r\n\r\nThis course is great as is, but if I had to nitpick I would have liked for Professor Lemons to incorporate more of his extensive experience into the course. Perhaps a case study centered around a consultation that he's done at a school! ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well taught because Professor Lemons made an active effort to provides students of all backgrounds with opportunities to participate in class. He did not rely on a typical seminar-style, but rather used small group discussions, go-around-the-tables, and more. The weekly memos also helped me think critically about our readings and pushed me to tackle an issue in public education myself. In terms of weaknesses, the course could have taken place at an earlier time. ",
            "\u00a0I hesitate to say that a class on improvement could not be improved, but this class could not be improved. Maybe offering it as a double credit, two seminars per week class would help, but seriously this class. The only thing I can think of is that I can't read cursive handwriting, so feedback would have been more effective if delivered digitally. ",
            "\u00a0Very student run and oriented. I enjoyed having a class of wide range with respect to grade level offering a variety of insight and opinion during class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: This course gave us students free reign to discuss the issues we cared about in education. Our professor was very flexible and approachable, and I recommend his teaching style to many of my own teachers at high school!\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel that expectations for certain assignments could be made a little clearer. Also, I wish Professor Lemons didn't post broken links to resources in the assignments on Canvas :((( ",
            "\u00a0This class is incredibly engaging. The seminar style combined with case studies and a semester long project allows for in-depth and useful learning. All the readings were interesting, and I learned something new in each class. The final presentation in front of important leaders in education makes this class special. You have to be okay with group work/projects because that is what the class revolves around. "

        [
            "\u00a0Absolutely would (and any other course Professor Lemons is able to teach at Yale). Professor Lemons is an education/change in leadership field specialist that is invited to teach at Yale through the Ed Studies program. He's really good at what he does and really puts time in to get to know his students and really mentor us. If he isn't able to schedule physical office hours that you are able to meet (because he's flying around the country trying to help kids learn better), he schedules phone calls during his off times to chat with you. That's the kind of professor he is. Also, he's less about the grades and more about the learning, which is something we rarely have as students in an institutionalized system. Definitely check this class out if you get the chance to. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I expect this class would be difficult for someone without some kind of education background (e.g. EDST 110) but still approachable. Came away with more than just a deeper understanding, also built tangible, practical skills for leadership and systems theory. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend it. Overall, this is an enjoyable and engaging course even though it isn't that rigorous. Assignments are easy and readings are brief. Professor Lemons is a really charming and responsive instructor, it would just be nice if the course size were smaller so there could be more depth of interaction. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. This is one of those \"have to take\" courses in my opinion, especially for anyone who is interested in going into any education-related fields. It was engaging, fresh, and forced us to work extensively with others-- a skill that most Yale courses forget about. ",
            "\u00a0I would for sure recommend this course!!! Take it!!! It is an amazing course and Dr. Lemons is a wonderful professor who makes it his goal that each of his students has personal and leadership growth over the semester. He really cares about this course and fostering a classroom community of learning and debate. The only weakness is that it is a ton of work. But if you are interested in education, take this course for sure! Each class was very engaging and interesting as it was discussion-based and focused on analyzing the case study and supporting readings that we did for that week, along with discussing other topics or case studies related to that week's theme. There were also cool educational leadership challenges at the beginning of most classes. The final project presentations were so cool. Lemons invited about 15 superintendents and top educators from Connecticut to watch our presentations and give us feedback on our projects so that we could revise them before turning the final project in. Speaking with seasoned educators about our proposals was so valuable. Take the class! You gain so much insight about the problems facing educators that have to make big decisions that affect thousands of students. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course for those seriously interested in working in education (be it directly or tangentially). Professor Lemons is a master professor who really hammers home the concept of the course.\r\n\r\nAs opposed to swimming in theory, this course dives into the tangible. Students are required to read 1 case study (i.e. the rise of Khan Academy) a week and a few readings as a supplements. The bulk of the course builds up to a final change project where students are given the opportunity to propose a solution to a challenge in education.\r\n\r\nOverall, the workload is very manageable and the course is transformational. I highly recommend it and am happy to have taken the course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Professor Lemons is an exceptionally talented professor and professional. I would take this course because of the professor himself, but the course is even better! Students are challenged to tackle real issues in public education themselves and are asked to work on a semester-long project that challenge their thinking and are critiqued by public education professionals themselves. I learned so much and would even take this class again! ",
            "\u00a0This is the best class I have ever taken and will ever take. I highly recommend the course no matter a student's academic background. All you need is a slight interest in education and this course will be the best thing that ever happened to you. Professor Lemons is an icon and a rockstar but more than anything he is an exceptional and dedicated teacher. Every single piece of this class and move that he makes is thoughtfully designed to help you learn. I did not deserve this man or this class. Seriously, you will come away with a way of thinking about change and improvement that is extremely useful in any problem you approach or project you undertake. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. ",
            "\u00a0Greatly enjoyed the course and have never experienced anything similar to the style in which it was taught. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to my good friend, who cares deeply about the flaws of not only education in America, but our government in general. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Take this class! If you are interested in education or not, this class teaches you so much about the education landscape, leadership, and problem-solving/critical thinking. The case studies are fascinating. The semester long group project allows you to delve in deep to an area of education that is important to you. The presentation to a group of incredible education leaders is an opportunity that you do not want to miss. My favorite class at Yale so far. ",
            "\u00a0I would certainly recommend this course to a student who is invested in learning about opportunities for change in education and thinking about strategies of leadership to carry out this type of change.  Even though our seminar fell at an odd, Thursday night time slot, I looked forward to getting to class each week and left the discussions feeling energized by the topics we encountered.  Professor Lemons is really great at facilitating this course, using his experience and knowledge to guide us while allowing us to explore our ideas in discussion.  He spent much of the time in our discussions as a careful listener, letting us drive the conversation  but always prepared to help us out when our collective lack of work experience left us with some questions.  Prof. Lemons always put into place a useful framework for the day's discussion so that it would go smoothly.  I enjoyed getting to hear from my classmates and having the chance to work with a group throughout the semester.  This is one of the best classes I have taken at Yale.  If you are really invested in education, go for it and take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would love to see another student being engaged in a subject that is closely related to his or her life. I also really like the end-product of the course, which allows students to collaborate and learn from each other as well as professionals in the field. "
