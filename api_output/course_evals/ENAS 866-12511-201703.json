            "\u00a0An understanding of the current state of complimentary metal oxide semiconductor technology for computational applications. Through my individual project, a deep understanding of two-dimensional materials and their application to CMOS. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me a comprehensive background in the previous, present, and future CMOS technologies used in industry, and the physics behind how each device functions. Additionally, much emphasis was put on practical considerations such as price to manufacture, compatibility with existing Si technologies, and reliability when discussing what future directions are going to be undertook by industry. I felt I developed a good understanding of CMOS devices and how their future potential is judged while taking this course. "

            "\u00a0I thought this course was very strong in both the level of detail that went into each section. Each device was given a full treatment in terms of underlying physics, pros and cons of implementing over an existing technology, along with future potential. Additionally, having expert guest lecturers come in and teach sections was also very useful. "
