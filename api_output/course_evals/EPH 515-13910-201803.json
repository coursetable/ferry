It's a necessary class but it was very inconvenient to have it be right before finals when every other class ramped all the way up to then have to add an extra class. People, including myself, made plans to travel and had to change them because the class dates were not announced well before the semester began or even at the beginning. These dates needed to be released during orientation so we could buy Thanksgiving tickets at a decent price rather than waiting until they became more expensive. ",

Also - Friday afternoon at the very end of the day - the last 3 Fridays of the semester was a drag. The TFs were terrible. No consistency - my particular pair of TFs were not good at facilitating discussion. Lots of awkward silences. ",
            "\u00a0The timing of the course was very annoying. Having it late afternoon the last 3 Fridays of the semester was a bad idea. The format also made it hard to engage because we were thrown into pretty big sections with a lot of people we didn't know and were not given time to get to know them before we were asked to discuss highly fraught topics. It was poorly designed. Breaking out into small groups and then coming together might have been more useful. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course should be extended into a semester and made as an actual requirement. Three short meetings are not enough to do the topic area justice. Additionally, people would scan into the course and just leave the auditorium. There needs to be more accountability for people and I think this could be done through a smaller class/seminar environment. ",
            "\u00a0This topic is so interesting and important, but this class is effectively worthless.  I have heard great things about Kaveh, but the structure does not allow him to shine; and the student-led break-out sessions had no hope of succeeding given the short amount of time allotted and the complexity of ideas that theoretically should have been covered. I hope that YSPH will consider a significant refresh of this class.   (Sten's guest appearance was the only truly interesting aspect of this 3 session course.) ",
            "\u00a0I strongly enjoyed the content of this course, however the timing of this course was largely problematic and prevented me from getting as much as I could from the course. The first class met the Friday evening before break, a day when YSPH first years otherwise did not have class. I was planning to leave Thursday night, but had to change my travel plans. The next two sections met during the final two weeks of class, arguably the busiest time of the semester. It seems like students were disengaged and most people in my section did not complete the reading. I think it would be far more beneficial to meet during orientation before classes start. Especially because some students (myself included) participate in research during their first semester, having an ethical mind state is imperative from the very beginning. ",

            "\u00a0This is an excellent class and should be made into a normal, full-credit course! Three sessions is barely enough time to begin to scratch the surface of ethics, and the material is so compelling that it deserves much more time and should become a more significant part of the core courses. This was one of my favorite classes of the semester and it is a real shame that we get to spend so little time on this subject (especially considering the fact that there aren't many bioethics classes available outside of this). ",
            "\u00a0I think it's very informative, but we should definitely of had the guest speakers speak the whole time and not split up the classroom. They were so interesting and informative and I don't think we needed the small classes to get people to participate. I would also front load the class by making it in the beginning of the semester instead of the end. The end of the semester is very busy and adding a course near the end did not help that. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course could have taken place closer to the beginning of the semester. The material could have served students well in their courses or outside research projects. ",
            "\u00a0The small group discussions were super awkward and almost no one talked. The few who did speak were all just repeating themselves. Should not be on a Friday afternoon, especially before a holiday when people need to fly home. ",
            "\u00a0I really enjoyed the class and the ethical questions we were asked to consider - I wish the class had been longer though; 3 weeks did not feel like enough to have the discussions I think are necessary to be well informed conscientious public health professionals. ",

            "\u00a0It would have been good if classes were more spaced out- I wish we didn't have class right before Thanksgiving break ",
            "\u00a0This seminar should have been an entire course. It was poor timing that they were held on the last three weeks of classes, on Friday afternoons. By that point in the semester, many students were already exhausted and unfocused. Having discussion in Harkness Auditorium was even worse. The readings were incredibly interesting, but also complex and it felt like the majority of our conversations were students just positing in lieu of learning. Meeting in separate rooms and then coming back were great in theory but only added to the disjoint and unengaging environment. Having the speaker come in the second seminar was the highlight of the course and could have been the model for the other three. ",
            "\u00a0This was a very interesting course. It should be a required course. ",
            "\u00a0Needs to be a half credit, half semester class!!!  Split this with social justice for the first years, each with a half credit.  These topics were way more interesting than our other classes, yet we didnt spend any academic energy on them.  Real world case studies are valuable to us!\r\n\r\nDiscussion sections with the TAs were lackluster...no one did the readings because there was no incentive.  Great topics, poorly executed. ",
            "\u00a0fine but unnecessary course and the timing on Friday is silly. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very valuable and important, but I wish it was scheduled at an earlier time in the semester. The late afternoon Friday courses before breaks created a sense of resentment before the class even started. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very important topic but to cover it in three seminar sessions is not doing it justice. I think this should be a full semester course. Ethics should not just be 'brushed' on. It is insufficient. Yale has a responsibility to train future healthcare leaders in ethics and how to perform ethical practices and research and covering this extremely crucial topic in 3 seminar sessions is not enough. I was disappointed in the format of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I felt that this class would have better served me as an addendum to an existing class (i.e. an ethics component attached to a research methodology class). In this way, it could have been more prolonged and we would have been able to get into more depth. As it was, this class only met three times during the semester and the meeting times were quite inconvenient (right before breaks, not really told to us at the start of the semester, at the end of the semester, etc.). It felt kind of like an afterthought. I would have appreciated a more formal, prolonged class. The professor was professional and knowledgeable and I really enjoyed his insight. I just wished I had more time. ",

            "\u00a0Pretty basic ethics class, especially if you have a background in medicine/law/industry/etc. Small groups weren't terribly helpful. ",
            "\u00a0This is a very useful and thought provoking course in public health and I think it's important for everyone to take an ethics course in a public health graduate program. However, the odds for this course were stacked against it. This course required online certification and met during the last three Fridays of a painful semester. Few people were able to put in any significant amount of time and effort into this class because first year students were managing their other course requirements. I think this would have been a much more positive experience if the entire course was conducted during orientation or during the first two weeks of the semester when the workload was significantly lighter for first-years. I am confident that I would have gotten more out of this course and put more effort into this course had it been scheduled at any other point in the semester. \r\n\r\nThat said, its biggest strengths are that the content is useful, interesting, and important. ",
            "\u00a0Three sessions is not enough time to learn anything in any sort of deep and critical way. It felt like no one was really invested in this course, and this was reflected in what people got out of it. ",
            "\u00a0I was honestly dreading taking this course, so I was honestly floored by how interesting it was. The guest speakers with direct experience in the discussed topics really brought life to the complexities of the issues at hand.\r\n\r\nWhile it's always tough to organize a mandatory, no-credit course in a way that engages students, I think that scheduling class for the last three Fridays of the semester (in the middle of the holidays and finals) made it especially tough. I actually think that I'd prefer a one-day seminar/workshop format, where you rotate between different discussions with different speakers/facilitators. ",
            "\u00a0too short; would better be a semester long course ",
            "\u00a0I think that considering the course only ran for a few weeks, it did a good job but I wish the class was more extensive. I know that due to time constraints the curriculum had to be cut down a lot but I wish that this class went on for longer and could start with the philosophical foundations for ethics (e.g. consequentialism, utilitarianism, Kant) before delving into case studies. I think that case studies help a lot in terms of expanding ethics into the specifics of how ethics could apply to public health research and projects but I think it would have been nice to understand the theoretical framework because it would help students better learn and further apply what they learn beyond a few specific studies. But I do think that the case studies that were chosen were really helpful since those circumstances discussed are probably what most people in public health will encounter more, in comparison to other classical situations. I do think it would be really nice to have discussions also relevant to the biomedical world and established pieces of literature surrounding biomedical ethics decisions, e.g. \"A Defense of Abortion\" by Judith Jarvis Thomson, as I think these pieces would help guide public health students in how to think about ethics. ",
            "\u00a0I LOVED THIS COURSE! PLEASE Make it a graded course in the future. I would take a full semester version of this if offered. I would recommend making it a required half semester course and making social justice the other half semester (bc there wasn't enough to cover a full semester there). Readings/ case selection/ speaker selection were all excellent though! ",
            "\u00a0This needs to be a semester long course. Public Health has a very messy history of violent imperialism and ethical mishaps. We need to engage with this extensively and for longer. It should still be in the first semester or year. But if you keep it at 3 classes, then move it to the beginning of the semester so we can begin to engage with ethical dilemmas from the beginning. Alternatively, the semester long course can be Public Health History and Ethics. This past and current state need to be known in detail by students getting ready to go into the world and potentially make the same mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the case studies that were selected to discuss. I found this very interesting and thought provoking. I do wish that our discussion sections were a little longer as well as having more time to hear the speakers present. Maybe separating the discussion and the speakers would be more beneficial? ",

I understand the motivation to make it a quick overview in health issues, but I think I would have been more engaged and gotten more out of it if it were a full course. I think the topics we covered were fascinating, but the nature of it being a three-meeting course left many people disengaged. At the very least, I think that it would help to hold the class at the beginning of the year, in future years. As it fell during the end of the year, people were both busy/less willing to do the readings and were unable to apply what they learned to the courses we took this semester. ",
            "\u00a0The large group sessions were informative and provoking. In particular, the guest lectures enhanced my understanding of the material. However, given that this was only 3 sessions, I felt that we really only skimmed the surface of bioethics. Perhaps this course would be better suited as a full semester class, or a day long seminar during orientation to be able to delve into the content more. ",

Having it the last 3 weeks - especially given the proximity to the holidays - made it more difficult for people to attend. ",
            "\u00a0I think this was a very poorly structured course. The timing of it also seems very odd (end of semester in the midst of thanksgiving break and finals). The small groups didn't benefit either because they were so short and took away time from listening to the instructor/guest lecturer. My TFs--Janine and Miriam-- were also very aggressive and condescending by telling our group to read next time, implying we hadn't, simply because not everyone participated (when in fact majority of the room did). It left a bad taste and aura in the group. I don't think trying to talk about ethics in research is possible in three sessions in a setting of 200+ students. Simply didn't add value. ",

            "\u00a0Good overview of ethical issues in public health and global health. I think instead of having a 3 day series, the ethics portion of the MPH could just be incorporated into our classes like epi, health policy, social justice or environmental health. It'll make the material seem more relevant to our classes, and having three separate sessions toward the end of the semester when people were a bit burned out from school was a bit too much. I think this \"class\" had WAY too many TFs, which seemed like a waste of resource for the school.

I gained nothing from this. This course could be improved if it dared to present more controversial material, and if it didn't seem like it was designed as an afterthought, probably to help fit public health certification standards. The only valuable part of this course was the interaction with dean, which was the best opportunity YSPH students have had to interact with him to date. Everything else should be scrapped and this entire course should be brought back to the drawing board.

It felt like we were going over a scattered variety of journal articles that had some sort of ethical component to them. It didn't seem like there were particular takeaways across all of them tying the different articles and classes together. Perhaps having us make a list of the main objectives at the beginning of  the course and then structuring each class according to those objectives could help. It might make sure that we all learned the main takeaways by the end of the course, and it can help focus the conversations in class. ",

As someone who studied ethics in my undergraduate career, I found this to be quite disturbing. We need a course to make these topics more deeply understood and engaged in, but the way it is set up now made it seems like more of a bother to many students than anything else. ",
