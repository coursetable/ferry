            "\u00a0Learned all about the world of political journalism, as well as what is truly going on in the world of politics. Colin gives a real insider perspective of what we're seeing going on in the world of politics and journalism. ",
            "\u00a0How to read the news critically, how to identify and examine patterns of reporting, how to think more critically about media, some of the driving forces behind media, how to analyze news stories and how certain events are covered and how that varies between organizations and media forms, more about current events, and much more. ",
            "\u00a0In this class I learned the importance of a diversified media diet and so many different resources and platforms that I can turn to in my efforts to achieve one. It's hard to distill everything we discussed and what we read into a sentence or two, but I'd say this class gave me an additional lens through which to view current events and the way they are reported on, and also exposed me to insights of Professor McEnroe and my classmates that truly broadened my perspective and posed new questions to think about as I consume political news going forward. ",
            "\u00a0Political Journalism. How to read news and see the different viewpoints being forwarded. Wording. Every day something has to happen. Really understand how and why some stories take long and why others don't. Media and government relations. How and where to get and read your news. Questions to raise when you hear a certain news topic. Power of memes. Random info about the 70s-90s media and political landscape ",

            "\u00a0Nothing weak about it. Would do it over again and again. Best decision I've made at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect. ",
            "\u00a0This class was excellent, and I think it was very well organized considering how much of our class discussions was dictated by the events of any given week. I liked that we had a general theme to discuss each week but were still able to devote considerable time to discussing our media diaries and that week's happenings, as well as synthesize them with earlier weeks' topics. I think the workload of two papers, weekly media diaries and final project (which was a good time) was very fair in that it gave us a lot to talk about but didn't feel too onerous. I think this is the perfect class in which to have a class blog, although it was stressful at times to keep checking it throughout the week to make sure I'd read everything before class (just because I personally prefer to dedicate one slot of time to doing the week's reading for any given class rather than spread it over multiple days), but the same thing can be said for weekly diaries and the entire foundation of the class - it's inherently overwhelming to keep up with the daily news cycle, but I took comfort in the fact that all of these disparate pieces of news seemed to make more sense after we discussed them in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course discussions are really good. You get to analyze the week's news and still cover a bigger topic. It's really good that Colin brings out the best in students. The media diaries were great and helped process what we were reading. I think they should have got more direction somewhere in the middle of the semester. Really a chill way of having class and connecting it to the real world. The media strategy at the end of the semester was really engaging and excellent in teaching us how to convert theory into practice. Most importantly, this class produces better civicly engaged citizens ",

            "\u00a0Yes 100%. Colin is an absolute stud that knows what he's talking about, makes class a fun time every single day. You will look forward to going and will be sad at the end of the semester I guarantee it. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY. I paid more attention to current events than ever and consumed media from different outlets and in different formats than I really had before (which honestly was exhausting and I will likely need a long break from Fox and Brietbart), and learned how to engage with the news in a more critical way, essentially becoming a more informed consumer of news. Colin is incredible and does a great job of tying things into his actual experience as a journalist and in media, not to mention that he brought in guests he knows from his work in political journalism to talk with us, which was very valuable. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class, whether or not you read the news! I think this course is of particular interest to students who are avid news consumers or are interested in pursuing journalism themselves but is extremely accessible even to people who don't keep up with the news  it has broad appeal and literally any student would be lucky to take it. It's an incredible way to process, analyze and think critically about what's happening week to week and how these happenings are being covered. ",
            "\u00a0YES! TAKE THIS CLASS! You are really missing out if you don't take this class at Yale. You will get a chance to engage with your news consumption, your politicians and your media all in an amazing chill learning environment. Colin is really the best but I think your classmates also help guide your experience. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this course. Excellent, super fun and informative ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This class is extremely relevant and the discussions were always engaging. Professor McEnroe was great at including everyone in the conversation and creating a comfortable seminar environment. This has probably been my favorite class I've taken at Yale. Professor McEnroe accomplished the rare feat of requiring a relatively small amount of weekly work while packing a ton into our class meetings and teaching us so much. If you're interested at all in political journalism, this class won't disappoint. ",
            "\u00a0Most Definitely! It is one of the best courses I have had at Yale! Interesting speakers and great insights and content. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. It completely changes the way you think about the news "
