            "\u00a0I learned a lot about how to view the people aspect of environmental problems and gained the tools to critically evaluate how environmental projects incorporate or exclude the social structures in an area. ",
            "\u00a0By taking this course I was able to learn about the social science of conservation and development in a very systematic way, which I really appreciate. ",
            "\u00a0I gained valuable perspectives on conservation and development from this course.  I learned about the different ways in which these types of efforts are complicated by all sorts of different things. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a new way of thinking about conservation and development both in general and in specific projects. ",
            "\u00a0Was exposed to a body of knowledge (social science and anthropological approaches to conservation) that I had never considered strongly. Learned many different ways to look at conservation and development projects from a critical point of view. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot from this course. It is an extremely important course to take for people who will work in conservation and development, as it helps us understand the shortcomings of some approaches, and how to navigate and understand the complexities of the world around us so we can be better practitioners. ",
            "\u00a0This course made me question my understanding of the world by showing me that conservation and development are discourses.  We then went on to examine the power of discourses and how they influence people and the physical world. And how the physical world influences our thinking. We also read and thought about what the economy is. I also learned the skill of summarising the essential arguments of the readings. ",
            "\u00a0I read an interesting array of texts that nurtured my thirst of understanding the relationship between humans and the environment. I found it really helpful as a basis course for those of us who are interested in deepening in the social science/management side of the environment ",
            "\u00a0This class changed how I conceptualize the work I want to accomplish in my career. It was eye-opening and incredibly rewarding. Carol Carpenter was a magnificent professor and the reading material was equal parts challenging and rewarding. "

            "\u00a0very well - i expected the readings and discussions to be enlightening - and they were! ",

            "\u00a0The information covered was more theoretical than I expected. ",
            "\u00a0I think I expected more concrete skills regarding conservation work.  Instead it was a long critique of bad practices/ideas in the field. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know exactly what I expected, but this class turned out to be one of my favorites this semester. ",
            "\u00a0They exceeded my expectations. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to be challenged by this course and I was. It made me question what I want to do with my life and how change can be affected.  However, I believe that this questioning will allow me to be more realistic about what can be done and what part I can play. ",
            "\u00a0I knew from the beginning that the course was going to be hard, given the demanding flow of readings, and mainly the final paper. All the readings were really engaging and thought-provoking. Also, I found helpful and compelling all the discussions we had in the second half of the class. \r\nI would have found extremely useful though, if the professor had given us more time to solve all the questions we had after doing some of the readings. ",

            "\u00a0The class discussions were very interesting and greatly added to my understanding of the topics covered in this course.  The thesis sentence exercises were also helpful for me to work on determining the key arguments in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0The readings assigned in this course were the most useful part of it.  I am torn because they often felt unnecessarily academic and unclear, but it is from them that I gained tremendous knowledge and insights that I will use in my future career.  The lectures were too focused on critique of the pieces themselves and should instead focus on analyzing their importance to the subject matter.  The discussion should be given more time; lectures should definitely be shortened, if not eliminated entirely. ",
            "\u00a0The class discussions in this course were amazing, although occasionally the pre-discussion lectures got a little bit too long. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course include the focused, organized approach by Carol. I liked the longer reflections we were required to write that allowed us to delve deeply into certain topics. I wish we read more Latour and Scott. \r\n\r\nThe thesis sentences due every week are a significant amount of work, and I wonder if that load could be reduced a bit. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was an excellent course. Having to write thesis sentences every week was a very useful discipline - it makes you read the readings thoroughly and with purpose. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is that it develops as a seminar, which makes it ideal for discussions. \r\nOn the other hand, I wouldn't bother if the course had more theory behind all the readings. For example, all of the readings were based on Foucault, and in the final paper we had to use his concepts, but we never get to read him (well, they were only optional readings) ",
            "\u00a0I think I would have benefited more from two shorter papers than a 30 page paper due at the end of the term. "

Try to encourage the instructor to stop lecturing and facilitate more discussion.  If you want to work in any sort of field related to conservation or development, at worst, this class will make you think a tiny bit harder about what you're doing; at best, it will stop you from making a horrible mistake which will have devastating ramifications for centuries. ",
            "\u00a0If you would like to have your presumptions about conservation and development challenged in an intellectually fulfilling and exciting way, take this class. Don't take the class if you're looking for specific management strategies. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class to understand power and how good intentions in conservation and development aren't enough. We need more nuanced, thoughtful and reflective approaches. ",
            "\u00a0I would thoroughly recommend this course - it will change the way you think about the environment and everything else. However, it does involve consistent work throughout the semester and it is easy for the research paper to creep up on you. Start early! But Dr Carpenter is very helpful to talk to if you get stuck. ",
            "\u00a0Even if it looks difficult by the fact of not having taken any social science course previously, do not hesitate for one moment to enroll; you will learn a lot and it will provide you with a fundamental framework to all environmental practitioners ",
            "\u00a0Be prepared to (and comfortable with the idea of) writing a 30-page paper at the end of the term. Be open to having your ideas and values challenged. "
