            "\u00a0I learned how to read and write better. ",
            "\u00a0I got a better understanding of how athletics has changed this country in the past century. ",
            "\u00a0How to examine sports from a historical perspective, how to read and write critically ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the social history of sports, in the context of American history. In the course, I greatly developed my writing and ability to prepare historical research papers. I also learned how to manage and learn from large amounts of sometimes dense reading each week. ",
            "\u00a0I think that this course helped me to understand what it means to look at history through a critical lens. I learned to manage a fairly heavy reading workload to gain knowledge of the topics. ",
            "\u00a0From this course, I was able to develop an in-depth understanding of the History of American Sport in the United States from the late 19th century till today. We dived deep into all the social implications of sports and spoke about how those morphed over time. We looked at different figures of importance and saw how they continue to influence their respective sports today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned the most in this class out of all my classes this freshman year. Ive never understood history or liked it until i took this class. Understanding the state and involvement sports had through the 19th and 20th century has enlightened me in numerous ways. ",
            "\u00a0As a devout sports fan, I was especially surprised by how much I learned about the History of Sport. This class gave an incredibly thorough understanding of sport through the lens of race, gender, the human body, and more. In the meantime, I learned a lot about American history, and in a way this course acted as modern American history through the perspective of sports. In fact, I gained a better understanding of popular American history than through any previous courses. In terms of skills, I learned a lot about synthesizing ideas across history and about discussing history in general. Meanwhile, I also learned how to better apply these ideas to my writing. With the final research paper, I learned how to use Yale resources to do significant research, including the library books and archives. "

            "\u00a0No weaknesses. Making students read and then taking reading quizzes is perfect. ",
            "\u00a0The small group setting was engaging, readings were mostly interesting but were very long and time consuming ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the chronological nature of the material and its ability to be connected across decades. I also liked the reading quizzes as they ensured everyone did the reading and could participate. Dean Gleason also did a great job leading these discussions. A weakness was the meeting time at 9 am, since it was hard to fully focus at times. Our basement classroom in WLH, with one long table, also didn't help class discussions. ",
            "\u00a0This is by far the best course I have taken while at Yale. Dean Gleason makes the class very enjoyable, but in order for this class to treat you well, you must treat it well in return. If you don't do the readings, you won't be very successful and the in class discussions will go right over your head. If you do the readings, everything about this class is phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: takes you chronologically through the 20th century and facilitates easy learning. \r\n\r\nWeakness: A LOT of information but for a history class I figure thats the standard. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strengths of this course were the fascinating topics and great discussions about the material. It really thrived as a seminar, with everyone giving their opinion and asking good questions. The emphasis on pursuing personal interests through This Week in Sports and the discussions themselves manifested perfectly in the final paper, which gave very little limitations on topic choice. While the weekly quizzes may seem like a weakness or inconvenience at first, they actually worked really well to encourage everyone to do the readings carefully, and they were ultimately not unreasonably hard. The only significant weaknesses were the occasional confusing or badly written readings, but on the whole the readings were pertinent and interesting. "

            "\u00a0Absolutely, great course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Very interesting class and Dean Gleason is an incredibly caring and dedicated Professor. There is a lot of work in this class, but the material is fascinating and the class discussions were all very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I enjoyed the class and I thought it was very engaging. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think taking this course was a unique opportunity for me and focused on a very interesting topic, which was sports. I was able to read and write about things that actually interested me and this made the class engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. I learned a lot about writing and sports. ",
            "\u00a0yes, I would recommend this course to another student. It is by no means easy but I feel like I learned so much. I enjoyed looking at American History through sports. It was refreshing to see another side of history that is not talked about often. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This is such a great course, and really gives you an in-depth analysis of sports and their social impact in American society. Dean Gleason does a fantastic job of giving really great resources for each week and designates each week to a certain decade which makes the class really well structured. This class was the best class I have taken at Yale, so far. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I believe it will influence his or hers understanding of the world and history that they are benefiting or suffering from. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in sports or history, especially if they enjoy or want to improve their reading and writing. Not only are the readings very interesting as a sports fan, but they also challenge and improve your reading comprehension skills. The response papers are actually very fun, and they provide a good opportunity to synthesize historical and sports knowledge. However, if you do not like sports or are not prepared to do a substantial amount of reading, I would not take this class. "
