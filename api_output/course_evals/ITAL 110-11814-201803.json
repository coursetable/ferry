            "\u00a0This course teaches you basic Italian skills relatively efficiently. I came in with a knowledge of basic Spanish, so the grammar structures were very familiar, but Sarah teaches the concepts very well and it didn't seem like anyone had a great amount of trouble grasping the information. ",
            "\u00a0This was my first time ever taking Italian, and I learned so much in just one semester. I learned the basics and introduction of the language and so much more. We also were introduced to Italian film, literature, and culture! ",

There were not too many weaknesses, but the class did feel a bit slow sometimes. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very good for any people first learning Italian like myself. It wasn't too fast-paced but it covered a good amount of material over the semester. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: excellent teaching style, class interaction was wonderful and I got to practice actually speaking the language a lot more.\r\nWeaknesses: nothing, Id just like a reminder on when VHLs are due. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths-the Professor was great and I liked the setup, it was very fun ",
            "\u00a0The workload of the course is not very heavy, which I greatly appreciated during the stressful period of midterms. However, sometimes, I would have liked a bit more assignments to encourage me to practice outside of class. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing instructors that really want you to enjoy learning the Italian language and culture. ",

            "\u00a0If you are looking for an L1 language class to help fulfill your language requirement, I would highly recommend ITAL 110 with Sarah. This class sparked my interest in Italian and it acted as more than just a class to fulfill a requirement. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if a student is looking to pursue a new language, I definitely recommend trying Italian! ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a great language for people who have never spoken a language before and aren't looking to overwork themselves with French or something. The work of this class is super manageable and Sarah's energy makes every lesson exciting. ",

            "\u00a0Yes, if they are interested in learning Italian as it does require work, but I find that it is worth it. ",
            "\u00a0It was great because there was a high correlation between what we studied and the feeling of learning. In some classes, after the final, you walk out feeling like you learned nothing, even if you did fine in the class. In this class, after every test I knew I knew more! "
