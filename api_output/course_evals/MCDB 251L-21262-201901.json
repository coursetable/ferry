            "\u00a0I learned a lot of laboratory techniques - Immunhistochemistry, Western Blotting, etc. - for studying human cells and their structures. ",
            "\u00a0A lot about reproductive biology! I havent taken the lecture, but this was a great introduction to the field. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about histology and how to perform important lab techniques such as Western blots. ",
            "\u00a0Preparing of histological samples and western blots! Very cool. Also was exposed to many topics in reproductive biology that I had never encountered before. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the chance to take part in an abridged version of the immunohistochemistry and staining that took place in the course. It provided me with a taste for the work that goes on in pathology and gave me a chance to look at interesting samples. "

        [
            "\u00a0It was really repetitive. It would have been better if we had tried out more techniques. ",
            "\u00a0The final presentations were a really interesting and fun way to apply material learned during the course to human pathology. The lab itself gave us different techniques for studying similar things within the reproductive system, which helped hammer the biology home and also taught me a lot about working in a lab. ",
            "\u00a0Great labs that are well-planned, great instructors, great class environment, great emphasis on student learning. Weaknesses are the labs sometimes get busy and you have to wait around because there is only one or two stations to perform lab tasks. ",
            "\u00a0Great workload but sometimes questions were quite difficult, as we had never talked about it before. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very hands-on and really allows students to learn in an engaging way ",
            "\u00a0It was ideal. Perhaps access to background materials (other than research papers) relevant to the content of weekly labs would be helpful in ensuring students aren't just performing lab skills but also gaining better understanding of reproductive biology (for those students not taking the associated course). ",
            "\u00a0I think the course is great because it is low-stress and allows students to get hands on experience with the coursework. I enjoyed the workload of the course and the group that I was assigned to. I would say that the grading could be improved to allow some mistakes to not have a huge impact on the overall grade. "

            "\u00a0YES! Amazing lab class for seniors in MCDB. Coming in with the relevant knowledge about lab techniques and content made this lab very enjoyable for me. Emphasis on real-world and application, which I very much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great lab course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dr. Guller and Dr. Whirledge are fantastic people and care about student learning as much as their own fields. ",
