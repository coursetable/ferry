            "\u00a0The course material was wonderful and professor Zhu was very responsive to student needs and regularly made himself available to us.  My only suggestion would be to add a few more labs in the course so we can practice the skills discussed in class. ",
            "\u00a0The class was exactly what I needed this semester. It was interesting and it opened up a new field for me to consider and explore. Dr. Zhu was also extremely understanding of how his students had a ridiculous workload in other classes and tried not to overwhelm us with more work. I believe he was successful in his goal: teach us the basic tools and foundations of molecular epidemiology and inform us on who to go to if we want to do a molecular epidemiology project. "

            "\u00a0Dr. Zhu was an excellent professor. As stated before, he is extremely understanding and reasonable in his expectations. I also thought his slides were very informative on the subject and focused on the most salient elements of genomics for epidemiologists. "

            "\u00a0This is a great course if you would like a relaxing tour through molecular epidemiology and what it has to offer. This course, however, only skimmed the surface of what molecular epidemiology has to offer, but it gives you enough tools to explore it yourself. Additionally, I strongly recommend that future students have a strong background in biology, specifically genetics/genomics before taking this course. This is a higher level elective and it assumes you have somewhat of a foundation in genetics and wet lab work. However, Dr. Zhu will evaluate the class's level of experience and is open to feedback.
