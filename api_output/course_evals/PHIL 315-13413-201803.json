            "\u00a0I learned about the major philosophical positions regarding truth, such as correspondence, coherence, and deflationist. I also gained a deep understanding of what exactly relativism is, and the major arguments for and against this position. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely improved my reading comprehension with dense analytical philosophical texts, Im not sure how much real information I gained though. ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus of this class is wonderful. You go through many different texts and get exposure to many different ideas in such a short amount of time. The amount of writing in this course also trained me to develop my ideas in a short amount of time and to express them with clarity. ",
            "\u00a0Very good survey of efforts to define truth and fact. Also explored how to understand relative truth (or if such a thing is even conceivable). ",
            "\u00a0The different possible definitions of truth and their strengths and weaknesses; an understanding of relativism and why it is valuable. ",
            "\u00a0A very thorough understanding of philosophical relativism, both epistemological and mora ",
            "\u00a0- Different theories of truth and relativism\r\n- Epistemology ",
            "\u00a0This class delivers what the title promises -- it offers a good overview of theories of truth, and then different versions of relativism. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to better read and analyse philosophical papers, and how to effectively compare different schools of philosophical thought. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0The course covers a very fascinating subject with great breadth. However, this breath is sometimes too great. I think that the course would be better if less papers were assigned for reading and more time was given to discussion of a particular argument. This would make it possible to discuss the intricacies ad implications of the argument rather than just surface level/comprehension things. ",
            "\u00a0I would have liked there to be more focus on how to go about writing the papers on the thinkers we read in class. ",
            "\u00a0I would have preferred more engagement with the actual texts. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this course was well structured. Basically, a very small lecture where we were free to ask Professor Szabo questions at any time. Writing assignments awarded close analysis of the course reading and final paper left us a lot of flexibility. The class moves quickly between authors and theories which I thought was a plus. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: well-organized, very helpful handouts provided with each class, manageable amount of reading assigned, interesting class discussions\r\nWeaknesses: readings could be difficult to get through on your own, but they were always clarified in class afterwards ",
            "\u00a0The main strength is definitely its scope, with over 20 different philosophers covered. Additionally, the professor created very detailed, helpful handouts for each of the philosophers. \r\nThe main weakness, while pretty specific, was the lack of serious coverage of the correspondence theory. For all of the other theories of truth, we read texts from their supporters, but for the correspondence theory we read only criticism, despite it being the majority view historically and today. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: very interesting material; course is very organized; the professor is very knowledgable about this topic\r\nWeakness: sometimes the professor spends too much time answering questions from students, and maybe it would be better if he spends more time on explaining the ideas of the philosophers. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Szabo is an amazing lecturer: very personable, funny, bright, passionate, and good at answering questions. The style of the class is a leminar, so really just a very small lecture where students ask questions often. I personally really enjoyed the course because the lectures were very fun and I always came out feeling like some of my questions had been clarified. The readings are very light, though not easy, but Szabo's handouts and lectures go a long way in untangling the readings. The writing workload is very do-able, three short assignments and then one final paper, but I found that his grading was very exacting (though fair). Finally, I would highly recommend going for Szabo's office hours. He is extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was extremely useful in deepening my understanding of truth as not only a theoretical concept, but a linguistic tool that reveals interesting psychological traits of people and their interactions. I did feel that some of the readings were slightly repetitive, especially those that reflected the same or essentially similar philosophical viewpoints, but Professor Szabo did a good job of differentiating even the most seemingly similar schools of thought from one another. "

        [
            "\u00a0No. I think the course moves too quickly for it to be worth it. You'll be reading too much to quickly to really retain anything. ",
            "\u00a0This is an extremely analytical course, if you know thats what youre interested in then definitely, but if youre just exploring philosophy probably take something else. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. The topics are interesting and the amount of reading is very manageable each week. Professor Szabo also gives plenty of time to complete written assignments and will give feedback before submission. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who wants to understand what relativism is and how one can defend it. The class is very well-organized and the professor is excellent at explaining difficult concepts you would be unlikely to figure out from just doing the readings alone. The first half of the semester is about different possible definitions of truth, and the second half is a defense of relativism. Because it is a class about the nature of truth, the readings and discussion are very abstract. Additionally, not many of the readings are by absolutists, though they are on the syllabus. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, with the caveats that some of the work is fairly difficult, and you are really graded on the strength of your arguments and clarity of your ideas. I would not recommend this for students without at least some philosophical background. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Professor Szabo is very knowledgable about this area, and he can make difficult ideas clear to understand. The course is very well organized. Each reading is not too long but captures the essence of each philosopher's ideas well. And the handout for each class is very lucid. Would definitely recommend for people who are interested in truth or philosophy in general. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course if you are interested in these topics -- that is, very firmly analytical, quite technical, and extremely abstract. Szabo will help you understand confusing concepts and you will be better off for having taken it. "
