            "\u00a0Chinese 150 gave me a better knowledge of how to effectively speak and write in Chinese. ",

            "\u00a0Worked on writing, speaking, tones, and vocabulary. ",
            "\u00a0Chinese culture as well as new vocabulary words and grammar structures! ",
            "\u00a0This course is very comprehensive in its curriculum; we covered speaking, reading, and writing to an extensive degree. I also enjoyed how the topics we covered were very broad and were definitely weighty. ",

            "\u00a0This course does a good job of quickly teaching students a large amount of Chinese. While the alternating teacher format was perfectly effective, it seemed unnecessary. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very work intensive which I felt was very beneficial to helping us learn our Chinese skills very well. ",
            "\u00a0The class definitely keeps you on track, and really forces you to learn. ",
            "\u00a0A strength of this course is that it covers a lot of material, and very in depth; I definitely was challenged to learn a lot in this course, and it definitely made me exponentially better at Chinese than I was at the beginning of the semester. Grading was very clear, and assessments were abundant. \r\n\r\nAn unavoidable weakness of this course was that students came in with different levels of experience and it could be hard to catch up to more experienced students, although the professors do try to account for this problem. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is that the course goes over almost all aspects of Chinese culture, different topics ranging from serious discussions to light stories, etc... This is by far the most comprehensive language course I have ever taken. Weakness is that you have a lot of homework and since the course is everyday, expect to sometimes memorize as much as 40 vocabulary words in one sitting. "

            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning Chinese, this course is well organized and well taught and you will become better at speaking and writing Chinese. However, do not take this course if you are just trying to complete the language requirement, as it is very time consuming and if you do not want to learn Chinese you will be miserable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would, if they are serious about speaking and understanding Chinese language and culture on a more serious level. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to other students! Great way to improve your level of Chinese. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely- I've learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to a student looking to learn Chinese in a fast paced and challenging environment. It's a lot of work, but you definitely will show great results if you put in the effort. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course as 5 days a week of intensive high level Chinese will lead to very fast improvement in all aspects of language proficiency. "
