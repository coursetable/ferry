            "\u00a0To call attention to the ways that racialization occurs as a process, to adopt a more complicated and large-spanning view towards these social processes (e.g. viewing race relationally in terms of networks and the zooming-in and zooming-out of spatial units of analyses). To enmesh one's analysis in the ways racialization intersects with other modes of differentiation such as colonialism, gender, etc. and the ways these coincide with other issues of complicity and the like. ",
            "\u00a0This course culled from a wide variety of topics and disciplines, many of which I was previously unfamiliar with. It facilitated conversation well, so that I ended up learning a lot from fellow students ",
            "\u00a0Although I had some familiarity with the general academic/mental space of this course's content beforehand, the key themethe relational study of racewas new to me. Through our readings and discussions I developed a new and (eventually) nuanced understanding of the way in which racial formation occurs not only between white and non-whites, but between different groups of non-whitesnot only different races or ethnicities, but also different genders, political statuses, etc. I also, I think, strengthened my ability to understand and grapple with academic arguments at the relatively zoomed-out level of the book-length study. This was my first graduate course, and although there are many undergraduate seminars that assign full books as reading, my classmates in this course who are from the graduate school seemed somewhat better at this kind of engagement. I think I actually learned as much, at least in terms of academic practice, from my classmates as I did from the scholars whose work we read. ",
            "\u00a0I exercised the skill of employing and critiquing the theoretical and methodological frameworks that are presented in the first half of the class. The way this class was structured and its content allowed us to critically engage with specific theories or schools of thought related to studying race relationally. I learned how to talk about race on multiple registers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about the many ways one can study race and especially about what it means to combine different subfields like African American history and Latinx history together under a \"relational\" framework. I also learned how to adopt a worldview of generosity and generative-ness when engaging with scholarship and peers. I became better at editing papers and writing, and I learned how to become a better participant in class. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: wide survey of material for race relationality which varies in terms of popularity, topic, and accessibility, a firm understanding of the theory of race, historiography, etc., a number of great guest speakers, the class workshop for one's final paper, the advising periods for one's work, and an attempt to foster a more collaborative learning environment\r\nWeaknesses: relative lack of discussions considering how few classes there are, more texts needed to establish what race exactly is, perhaps some semester-long collaborative project would help the learning environment ",
            "\u00a0Its great strength is its breadth, its corresponding weakness is relative lack of depth. This was often adequately made up for by the extensive efforts to bring readings in conversation with each other throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor HoSang's clear and constant dedication to this course, his students, and the scholarly work before us.\r\nThe encouragement of discussions about academia as practice, rather than simply as the content of the academic works in front of us. By this, I mean the willingness on Professor HoSang's part to bring in other scholars to talk to us about how they get the work done and why. For me at least, this made it easier to see \"the point\" of our studies.\r\nThe diversity of perspectives (in terms of both identity and academic orientation) represented in the syllabus.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nI wonder if there might be a way to incorporate workshopping our group projects earlier on in the course. Since one of the goals of this course is to have each student produce an article-length work for possible publication, this might allay some anxiety and help keep students on track. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor HoSang's forthcoming co-edited volume on studying race relationally was an extremely exciting project to have as a model for the contemporary writings on these issues. While comparative ethnic studies has been around for a while, the intentional RELATIONAL framework is just now gaining prominence so it was exciting to be learning about it as Dr. HoSang contributed to the formation of the field. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Sometime some peers in class would be awfully quiet, which did not allow for fruitful conversation. But most of the time it went well! ",
            "\u00a0STRENGTHS\r\nThe trajectory of the readings from week to week felt connected and cohesive. It was nice to engage with each week's readings by thinking about how previous weeks' readings related to them.\r\nClass felt like an open space to sort out murky issues and confusions about race\r\nThe peer-editing process taught me a lot about what it means to study race relationally and to be generous to others' work\r\nIf at times hard to fully decode, the readings all felt like required reading for the relational study of race\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS\r\nThis seems like a small thing, but I think a smaller seminar table (like physical table) would facilitate more participation in discussion.\r\nWhen class speakers came, it felt a bit unnecessary to read their entire books. Maybe it would be good to just choose one or two chapters to read for those weeks, since we ended up just asking the guests questions anyway. "

            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to students interested or working within the fields of the history of race, the social sciences, and so on. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, both because of its breath and adaptability and also because I think many different students can contribute in different ways ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course without reservation. Professor HoSang is an incredible instructor, and the course and its content fill a gap in the general framework of the study of race at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, because relational racialization is imbricated into the United States' existence and thus everyone should gain some of this knowledge. Especially in the current moment, especially at Yale, students have to be aware of the social construction of race and ethnicity and how it affects social stratification, marginalization, and processes of violence. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class for anyone who wants a broad framework for studying race that takes into account the specificities of the racial formations of various groups. The readings push you to think deeply about what it means to study racial formations in relation to each other, and to sort out larger ethical and political questions that are often involved in this sort of scholarship. HoSang is a warm and generous instructor and seminar leader, and in classes he pushes you to think deeper and deeper. Take this class! "
