            "\u00a0Strength of the course is that the slides are very comprehensive and conducive to learning all the material - weakness is that lectures are very confusing and Eva is very funny but often hard to understand, and she moves really quickly...I leave every lecture feeling like the material is super complicated, but then I read the slides and it seems very simple and I am left uneasy as to whether I am not studying something I should be etc. ",
            "\u00a0Eva has great lecture slides and is very thorough in her explanations and examples. However, she sometimes moves too fast. ",
            "\u00a0The course is taught very well- both by Eva and the TFs. It is well organized and expectations are communicated clearly. Lectures are clear. All of that being said, I think the actual content taught is really quite useless and boring. As much as Eva tries to connect it to the real world, it is outdated material and I question the existence of a course like this in the first place. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest weakness is that the learning is heavily focused on math rather than concepts.  The majority of people in the course are taking it to develop an understanding of the concepts behind economics, not to practice calculus and algebra.  Psets take hours not because they are teaching you difficult concepts, but because you have to carry out tons of math.  Eva was a good professor, but the course itself felt pointless.  It could be improved by dropping significant amounts of mathematics and focusing instead on understanding the concepts driving the equations.  It honestly adds nothing to the course and takes away from time that could be spent developing an understanding of the topic. ",

If you do your PSETs and understand most of it, you'll be fine in the course because the exams are PSET questions but easier. Don't be daunted by how hard the practice questions for the exams might be.\r\n4. It's not the demon that people make it out to be.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\n1. Can become a very competitive environment depending on who you hang out with\r\n2. Abstract concepts\r\n3. More math than actual economics--and I didn't always feel like I learned about *economics* as much as I did how to take a partial derivative ",
            "\u00a0Good course ",

            "\u00a0Need to upload solutions to problem sets that are fully correct and re-upload if it is not. Solutions do not show the full process as to how answers are found. ",
            "\u00a0Something that would improve this course a lot would be review sessions of the material before finals. There is a lot of material covered, and for students who are not good at Economics or Math, the review sessions would be good to help understand concepts (instead of brute memorization, which is pointless for future uses). ",
            "\u00a0The main weakness of the course is the Professor. She often stumbled while explaining key concepts and spent more time explaining unnecessary things than covering materials relevant to assessments.  Another weakness of the course was the amount of unnecessary time spent on homework assignments, specifically the podcast responses. It wasn't clear why we had to do these for our homework assignments.  The strength of the course is the TA's. Most of the learning takes place in section as opposed to lecture. Another strength is the lecture slides, which to an extent compensate for the Professor's lecture style. Professor Chalioti has some of the most thorough lecture slides of any class I have taken so far. ",

            "\u00a0There should not be a curve in this class if it deflates student grades. I think it is demoralizing and encourages competition rather than collaboration. I also felt like a lot of the material is psets were not taught in class so it was necessary to attend office hours. People who have more free time will do better because some of the TAs basically give people answers, but if you dont have the time, then you are at a disadvantage. I feel like this is a corrupt model. ",
            "\u00a0Very straightforward course and it is well taught. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Overall not too difficult of a class. Some material is really interesting. Workload is not unreasonable and I enjoyed the mathematical focus of the class. Dr. Chalioti is a great professor. She's also super sweet and always willing to help. This made the class much stronger. This class is also very well organized.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The psets are TOO long and tedious. Everyone seems more interested in beating the curve than learning/doing the best they can. Lastly, Dr. Chalioti starts off her lectures slowly but is going way too fast by the end. No one could keep up with the last 5 minutes of her lectures. This isn't a huge problem because slides are uploaded immediately after class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor was pretty good, Eva Chalioti helped me learned so much! She taught the curriculum well and I learned lots!\r\nWeaknesses: the slides given and the psets and tests did not entirely match up. It seemed as though they assumed our intuition of economics was greater than what it actually is ",
            "\u00a0It teaches a lot of economic theory. However, it feels like after learning the initial idea of maximization, the rest of the course follows fairly naturally. The way the new material was presented was sometimes more confusing than it turned out to be. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness of the course was the great variability of problem set difficulty. Some were tediously long because of the complexity of the utility equations, while others were surprisingly short. It would have been nice to have consistently medium-length psets.\r\n\r\nA strength of the course was the straightforward nature of the exams. Especially the second midterm and the final seemed totally fair and seemed like good assessments of students' knowledge. ",
            "\u00a0This is moot -- you'll only take this if you have to. Way more math than necessary. Eva is the best teacher who teaches micro, but she still sucks at explaining things so that's just a reflection of the sad state of teaching in big econ lecture courses at Yale. Curve is unduly harsh (need almost-perfect scores to get an A). Is there really a difference between someone who missed four points for algebra mistakes and someone who didn't in terms of knowledge of microeconomics? ",
            "\u00a0I really really loved the lecture slides. I think they are easy to follow and offers just the right amount of material necessary to help us review for exams and also remain as concise as possible.\r\n\r\nI also liked having weekly problem sets, that albeit long, definitely helped us practice what we are taught in class. Allowing collaboration was also helpful, since it actually encourages me to discuss the problems with other people, and as a result trade ideas off each other in a way that is beneficial for everyone.\r\n\r\nI think the midterms were definitely fair, in the sense that they are similar to the problem sets, but always had an additional concept tied in in order to make it just challenging enough. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Chalioti, most of the TFs, good slideshows. Weaknesses: classmates (people were really rude/disengaged), mismatch between textbook and course (apparently there was a better textbook but this wasn't made clear until I had already bought the \"required\" textbook), lack of meaningful practice problems (mismatch between practice problems before exams and the exams). The problem sets were often short in terms of concepts practice but long in terms of wrangling with complicated numbers and set ups. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: exams were very predictable, and you're given lots of review material\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: not the most engaging, just given how repetitive the material is. But that can't be changed ",
            "\u00a0This course did well by introducing the main tool early on and expanding on it very well ",
            "\u00a0Heavy derivatives of math. Liked the podcast. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a bit disorganized, however it is understandable given the size. My biggest issue with the course is the lack of review sessions and organized review material and practice exams. ",
            "\u00a0Make the course about teaching the intuition behind the fundamentals of micro, not just an applied calculus class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:  learn the basics of economic modeling; given external readings and resources for deeper understanding for those that so desire\r\nWeaknesses:  sometimes, there was a discrepancy between what was taught and what was tested ",
            "\u00a0Good use of the Lagrangian method to a wide range of problems. Psets helped to reinforce concepts. However, lectures often didn't help in solving pset or exam questions. Professor Chalioti isn't clear in her explanations, doesn't help to develop our intuition. A lot of the math is glossed over and we are left wondering why what we are doing works. Exams are set too easy and an exact replica of review problems. How are you going to test if students actually understand the material? ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets were hard despite being graded on effort. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from struggling to do them. I think the problem sets were my primary way of learning in this class though, the lectures were really good at explaining the concepts. My biggest problem with the class was intimidation. I was unable to perform well on the first exam because I was scared that I was unable to do the work. That change after I reviewed the questions I missed on my own and recognized that I was able to do them.\r\n\r\nI do think that intermediate mircoeconomics has a bad reputation for being extraordinarily hard which is why I was so scared during my first midterm exam. While it is a difficult class, it is definitely doable. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chalioti does a great job of covering a wide expanse of material over the course of the semester by utilizing real-world examples and going through examples of the problems. The pace is quite fast; it is really useful to know the Lagrangian method before coming into the class. I had a hard time feeling engaged at times because it's such a large lecture class. Furthermore, some of the pset material does not reflect the material that we go over in class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: good lectures- very based in practice examples\r\nWeaknesses: practice material for exams should be more representative of the exams ",
            "\u00a0The professor and TFs were kind and clearly tried their best to offer help and support, but the required teachings for this class (and unclear textbook) made me feel as if I was suffocating. ",
            "\u00a0This course makes Yale look like a joke. I am an economics major, not an \"advanced algebra\" major. It only tests your algebra skills. Pathetic. This course should focus on the microeconomic concepts. I didn't learn any. Good thing I took intro. NOt the algebra. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures are very bad and incredibly hard to engage with. Section is where you really learn how to do the problem sets. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are relatively engaging but  they focus mostly on explaining mathematical concepts, proofs, and graphical appraoches to solving the set questions. Not that much time is spent actually discussing how these mathematical concepts can be applied to real-life economic scenarios. The sections are very helpful at providing tools to solve the pset and exam questions. Some of the topics and approaches are discussed only briefly or at surface-level in lecture. The psets help to better understand lecture material, and the weekly podcasts add a bit of real-life context for the generally mathematical focus of the class. ",
            "\u00a0The highlight of the course was the real world applications. Sometimes the math was overwhelming and there was a lot of theory to digest at once, but reviewing the concepts in terms of current events through discussing excerpts from the news/podcasts/etc really helped my understanding of the course material ",
            "\u00a0strengths: taught extremely well, doing practice problems during class when teaching the topic area for the first time, posting practice notes before exams,  productive and helpful TF office hours, straight-forward and not trying to trick you ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are clearly outlined, and office hours are always announced clearly. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: No real surprises on exams and they are graded fairly, section seems fine and there is plenty of practice material, professor Chalioti actually takes feedback and is willing to work with students\r\nWeaknesses: The curve was always insane, especially since they made the second exam too easy, another slight weakness is that the class material is not so diverse (basically just Lagrangians all day) ",
            "\u00a0Lectures were often hard to understand and not well explained. Sometimes slides were clicked through simply to get to the end of the lecture, if we were running out of time ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a lot of resources to do well ",
            "\u00a0strengths lie in interesting sections and great review during lecture while weaknesses lie in psets being exponentially harder than what is presented in class ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the sections. Slides could include more information. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of the course is that the TA's can really teach students the material during section. To be honest, most of my learning happened during section. I think this course could be improved by focusing mostly on the types of problems and running through more clear examples during lecture, as if it were a section. ",
            "\u00a0Professor is good, but class often felt like a waste of time because you could learn the same amount by just reviewing the lecture slides she posts. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Chalioti is an excellent professor and a great lecturer. I enjoyed her lectures. However, the material was extremely difficult, especially with regards to the level of math. The prerequisite for this course was a math course level 112 to 120. There is a great difference between having taken 112 and 120. I was not prepared for the calculus involved in this course having taken math 112. ",

Also, the materials provided to help us study were thorough and useful.\r\n\r\nOne change I'd like to see is more explanation of the limitations of the models we study. Economics is not (by any measure) an exact science, so it would be useful to cover how some of these ideas are used in the real world and how they fail and succeed. ",

However, there are times when problem sets or practice materials are significantly harder than what is taught in class, which rendered a lot of people worried more than necessary. I do think that the topics covered are reasonable in breadth and depth; maybe some more easy-to-understand practice materials can help. ",

She also included podcasts on each of our problem sets, which I really enjoyed because it helped make the class feel like an economics class rather than plug-and-chug math class. It could be improved by having more standardized p-sets, p-sets that utilize real numbers rather than variables, and exams that look more like the p-sets (or vice versa). ",

Her attitude every day during class made a real difference in my overall experience of this course. (2) The podcasts. These were kind of a pain in the butt to listen to every week, but I really did learn a lot! They were super interesting and I'm glad that they were a part of the assignments (3) Well-organized and fair exams that actually test the topics covered in class. (4) Plenty of office hours that were scheduled throughout the week. Made it possible to accommodate really busy schedules. (5) Quick turnaround on grading psets and exams\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: (1) The practice material posted was much appreciated, but the topics covered there tended to be much more complex than the ones tested normally. So perhaps just adding a practice material page with more straightforward problems in addition to the more complex sheet. I think both would be helpful in their own way. (2) The pset numbering and lettering. Would be really great to standardize that. The current system was pretty confusing. (3) My friend says that there's an easier way to optimize with constraints instead of doing Lagrange? I don't 100% remember what his method was. He learned it from taking Econometrics though. Would be great to standardize best practice methods across these courses. I'm sure more than one topic overlaps as well, so maybe there's an opportunity there to cooperate on more things as well.\r\n\r\nOverall, minor weaknesses. Definitely a well-organized and well-run course. ",

At times, I found myself wishing that she would teach material at a slower rate or without unnecessary math. For example, to this day, I don't understand the point of learning Slutsky. Furthermore, I don't understand the point of testing us on Slutsky since I cannot imagine a time when I will be required to Slutsky a real-life scenario without the help of a calculator or the Internet. Also, problem sets were way, way too hard and time-consuming. I am not kidding when I say that I spent a good 15 hours working on one of our problem sets. It's nice that they're graded on effort, though. Also, didn't like how we didn't get comments on our PSets. ",
