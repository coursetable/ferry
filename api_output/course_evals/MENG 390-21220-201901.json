            "\u00a0How to create a mechatronic block diagram, brief history of computer memory and how current systems work, introduction to programming in Assembly, how to use Arduino, how to debug a mechatronic system, how feedback loops work, how to characterize a motor, how microcontrollers work, how to convert between decimal, binary, and hex ",
            "\u00a0I learned the skills to code in assembly (isn't that cool???), to make sense of microcontroller datasheets, concepts such as registers, interrupts, counters, and how a PID controller works. We also discussed and characterized DC motors, and did a survey on transfer functions in the context of feedback control block diagrams. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about a lot of material at the bridge of mechanical and electrical engineering, including microprocessors, assembly language,  Arduinos, sensors, active electrical circuit components, and feedback (PID) control. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about PID control, developed a greater understanding of micro controllers and how they function, improved my skills from EE 200. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about mechatronics and controls. I also gained confidence in myself as an engineer. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot of basics about motors, circuits, controllers, Ardunio ",
            "\u00a0I gained experience in applying the theoretical things that I've learned in other engineering classes in a very hands on and practical environment. The major conceptual understanding that I came away with was the basic principles of controls. This was one of my favorite engineering classes that I've taken here. "

            "\u00a0The lectures are interesting and entertaining, and the labs (while time consuming) are well-organized and informative. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: a very enthusiastic professor teamed with approachable, patient and knowledgeable TAs. Madhu, Khoi and Ali could not have been a better trio. The environment is very supportive, which is important as the final projects happened very quickly and the scene was rather hectic.\r\n\r\nweakness: the final project was really hectic. Maybe make the kit available at the start of the semester so that students can slowly work towards the end goal? The labs were designed to be building pieces of the final product anyways, and having the \"application\" on hand makes it far less of a crunch and the concepts covered in class a lot more relatable. ",
            "\u00a0I was disappointed with this course. Rather than digging into the material, we kept everything very high level and just dipped our toes into many different topics. This course needs to be broken into 2 (or maybe 3) courses so that we can fully appreciate the material and apply it to real world applications. Many of the labs were poorly organized and didn't facilitate learning. Most of the labs we were given a huge chunk of code and were told to make minor changes to it to complete the lab (which required digging through 1000+ page manuals to find assembly code functions). For future improvement, I strongly suggest this class be reorganized so that the students build the circuits, devices, and code from scratch so that they can develop an intuition for designing electro-mechanical systems. Additionally, I found many of the lectures useless because they covered all theory and weren't relevant to the labs. ",
            "\u00a0I liked the alternating PSET and lab so neither were overwhelming and they informed each other. In the future I'd recommend more access to the lab to be able to work on the final project. ",
            "\u00a0I thought the lectures became very dense, especially towards the end of the semester ",
            "\u00a0Overall the course was very good, but a few improvements could be made. I feel the classes which go over the derivations of Laplace / Fourier transforms are probably unnecessary and should instead be a set of notes people can read on canvas; most people have probably seen the derivation at least twice before this class.  I think a bit more time should be spent on discussing control and PID, and going more in-depth. Of course, control is a difficult subject but it's super important!\r\n\r\nAlso, some of the labs might be better done if they're functional programming exercises. I think some of the characterization labs (e.g. the motor lab) are probably pretty important because they force you to really think about the complexities that present themselves when using motors. But other labs (e.g. the line sensor lab) can probably be omitted, because the sensors discussed are relatively straightforward to use and understand. Have no idea what next year's final project will be, but I think it would be a good idea to get people to write code to interface with a sensor. Also maybe have people code up a simple PID (like the one we were given), might help them understand the concept better. Not sure how good of an idea this is because the general attitude I got is that Mech E's really hate programming; unfortunately functional programming is a huge part of a ton of Mech E positions. ",
            "\u00a0The major strength of this course is in its ability to make many of the conceptual topics that I've grappled with (differential equations, circuit design, equations of motion etc...) and made their application quite clear. My view of engineering was totally opened up in a wonderful way.\r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses in the final project is that we spent a lot of time doing guess and check work to find the gains for our robot's PID controllers. Although there is value in this process, I would've preferred to spend some of that time learning how to code a PID controller (which isn't really that many lines of code) or the encoder interrupt that was given to us as part of the code modules.

            "\u00a0If you're reading this review, you're probably ABET MechE and required to take this class. Regardless, I would definitely recommend this course to any MechE student (including B.S. 12 students!). It's well-organized, informative, useful, and enjoyable. Madhu is an incredible professor and the TAs were helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Although many of you probably take it because it is required by ABET, it is actually one of the most interesting and applicable engineering core requirements that you can take. Extracurricular projects will become a lot more doable now that you know your way around controllers, electronics and sensors. This class should really be taken before senior year. ",
            "\u00a0I hesitate to recommend this course. If you are MENG ABET, you have no choice. But if you are EE or another STEM major, I would recommend taking another course in the electrical engineering department instead. This course is very high level and doesn't dig into any of the topics, and most of the labs are trouble shooting code that was provided for you (rather than writing the code yourself and designing the systems).

            "\u00a0I would absolutely reccomened this course to other engineering students looking to gain a better understanding of robotics. You will get out of this class what you put into it. It completely changed the way that I look at the word. Get ready to use a lot of the tools you've been developing in your other classes! "
