            "\u00a0I improved my reading, learned how to write, and expanded my Russian vocabulary. I also learned about Russian grammar, including case, declension and conjugation. ",
            "\u00a0I brushed up on Russian orthography and grammar and improved my composition skills. ",
            "\u00a0My Russian improved tremendously during this course, I cannot recommend it enough. ",
            "\u00a0A grammatical journey through the Russian language accompanied by all of the Russian classic texts and authors :) ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my writing, reading, and grammar. I did not know how to write when I started the term, and now I can write formal essays about literature that we read. I am still slow at reading, but I have gotten a lot faster. First, we learned spelling rules and then wrote our first essay about half-way into the term. We read two novellas, by Pushkin and Chekhov, and wrote an essay about each. We get to submit a rough draft that is reviewed by Prof. Titus before sending the final draft with corrections. Then, we practiced verb conjugation and noun declension. I improved by speaking somewhat too, and I am most happy about being able to write now. Definitely, our new skill still needs more refinement, but the progress from this course is excellent. ",
            "\u00a0This class gave me the opportunity to practice my Russian several times a week, and start learning some of the grammar and rules that I had not had any prior exposure to. I also gained exposure to some classical Russian literature, and got practice reading and writing in Russian. ",
            "\u00a0I developed the ability to read and write with more confidence in my native language. ",
            "\u00a0How to read and write in russian, russian grammar, and russian culture. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great overview of Russian orthography, grammar, and literature for students who already speak the language at different levels of fluency. It allowed me to read and write with much greater fluency than I have ever been able to do. ",

            "\u00a0The course is a very good formal introduction to the Russian language for heritage speakers. Professor Titus does a great job of giving helpful feedback on every assignment turned in and making the workload manageable. The course also does a good job of challenging students with ambitious assignments that aid in their progress. I do feel, however, that sometimes the class moved too fast, especially at the beginning when I wasn't as comfortable with the language. Also, I think the means of grading for this class, especially for the homework, could have been made clearer, and I think that there were some questions on tests that we did not cover in class. ",
            "\u00a0The course is well paced and the amount of grammar/orthography taught in each unit is very manageable. However, it would be helpful if class was more uniformly structured. Some days we just went over homework, other days we just listened to oral presentations or discussed readings, and other days we exclusively learned new information. Since class only meets twice a week, having a bit of all of the different instructional components of the course on each day would make learning better. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was perfect! The professor also is hilarious and brilliant. ",
            "\u00a0The class is a good accelerated course on Russian grammar, writing, and speaking for Russian bilinguals. The work-load is very manageable, and there are two essays and an oral presentation. These assignments take more time, but I improved a lot more after writing or presenting. I would not want there to be more presentations, but this oral practice and tutored essay writing is a good aspect of the course. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a great way to improve your knowledge of Russian, if you grew up speaking it. Some background knowledge of the language is expected, and you will find yourself falling behind if you are not very comfortable reading and writing. Julia does a great job of forcing you to practice and improve over the course of the semester, although I personally would have learned more had we gone through the material more slowly. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course the reading assignments that we have and the essays we have to write about that reading. ",
            "\u00a0Great course! Prof Titus really tries to grade based on each person's individual level (which varies since this is a heritage class), and gives students the tools to do well on exams. ",
            "\u00a0Not everyone was on the same level so it felt very difficult for people in the lower end like myself and very easy for the people who came from Russia a few years ago. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very flexible to the needs and the knowledge of its students. The oral presentations could be improved by requiring discussion - either by grading students on responses or by requiring at least a couple of people to prepare responses. ",
            "\u00a0Covers all ends of grammar. Ability of students in the class varied largely ",
            "\u00a0Strength - small class size, very individualized towards each student's needs. Weaknesses - not that much interaction during class time (mostly lecturing) "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student who is very dedicated to improving his or her Russian. This class is definitely one in which a student gets what he or she puts in, and if a student is willing to put the time in to better his or her Russian, that student will really see a drastic improvement, no matter the initial experience with the language! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you're a native Russian speaker, this is a great opportunity to polish your language skills. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0Yes! A stress-free course to improving your grasp on the Russian language and fulfilling your language requirement! If you're already pretty fluent in Russian, I would opt for an L5 Russian course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course is great for native speakers. There will be some in the class who know Russian more formally, but Prof. Titus does well in separating our needs. The textbook work is sometimes tricky, but the class does not have the usual language work overload. If you want to finally learn formal writing and really be fluent in the language that you almost have, then take this class. ",
            "\u00a0If you speak Russian at home, I think this is the best way to avoid losing the language and keep in touch with your Russian side. I would definitely recommend getting comfortable with the language the summer before taking this course though, or else you'll be in for a rude awakening. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's nice to meet other bilingual students, and it is very useful to have a setting where only Russian is spoken if you want to improve your language skills. You will also quickly learn to read and write. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend it to students from a Russian-speaking background. ",
            "\u00a0Yes for students who know basic Russian ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If they are a heritage Russian speaker, this is a great class to take. "
