            "\u00a0I learned about kinematics, conservation of energy, momentum, rotational forces, torque, acceleration, and friction. Learned what happens when you shoot a bullet at a block, what happens when a block falls down, what happens if a ball spins in a circle, what happens if a block hits a spring, what happens if a bullet hits a block on a spring on a ramp with friction, etc. ",
            "\u00a0knowledge of the fundamentals of physics ",
            "\u00a0During this course I learned how to apply my prior calculus and general mathematics knowledge to physics concepts. I learned a different way of looking at problems and realized that the process may not always be front to back and that doing things backwards is sometimes the most efficient way and best way to complete problems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned classical mechanics. ",

In class, we went over vectors, kinematics, energy, dynamics, momentum, gravity, oscillations, waves, etc. I have also developed the logic and ability to think like a physicist, to think more logically and abstractly when solving problems. For example, when solving a specific problem, I would write down the givens, and figure out what are the unknowns and thus determine the most relevant formula and with which concept to solve the problem. Moreover, I also realized that physics is everywhere in our daily life, learning physics is extremely beneficial and useful in everyday life. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: This course did a good job with pacing. It was fast (as one might expect from a summer course) but was not unbearable or unreasonable. The problem sets were representative of the kind of difficulty of problems on the exam. I also really liked that this course did not meet on Wednesdays, as it broke up the week. I'm sure the students who took physics lab (I did not) also found the Wednesday break useful. \r\nWeaknesses: I can't really think of any weaknesses. ",

            "\u00a0I think if the tutor hours were placed not on Tuesday/Thursday at the same time as lab, this would be very beneficial to students taking lab. I also think having the exams on evenings and using class time to review instead of having exams during class would help maximize the effective use of our time. Also one weakness in the course was the difference between the quality of the TA's. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor was very good at explaining \r\nVisual demonstration of different problems \r\nLab session\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nIt might be better to incorporate lecture and discussion into one session. For example, once theoretical background of a topic explained, straight away should be followed by practical problems. \r\nMaybe changing the date of the first test. Maybe make it at the end of second week rather than beginning. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: \r\n- small class size\r\n- amazing professor\r\n- felt comfortable asking questions \r\n\r\nWeakness:\r\n- fast paced but that is just the nature of summer session ",

            "\u00a0The strength of this course is that it is well-designed to cover a lot of materials within one summer session. It is also very useful as a general science class to learn more about physics and apply those concepts and logics to everyday life. It is also very advantageous for establishing a strong foundation of physics for learning more advanced physics in the future. The room of improvement could be to have review sessions before each exam, I believe students can review much more efficient when in review sessions, rather than just reading through textbook alone.

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student. Prof was great, cared about his students and making the material understandable. Prof was always willing to help students, was kind, and was a really great person in general. (also has a great sense of humor lol you learn some life lessons in this class). Did not use PPT slides (which I found to be very helpful in such a problem-oriented math-y class) and wrote on the chalkboard. You can stop him at any time if you don't understand something and he's very responsive to questions and emails. 10/10 would recommend. ",

            "\u00a0I didn't learn much, so not really. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student because this course is very beneficial even for non science majors. This course has a great balance between depth and introduction. It helps students to review calculus and physics from high school (AP Calculus or AP Physics) as well as learning some new concepts. More importantly, it can help you to establish better skills for problem solving, the logic of a physicist. This is one of the best thing about this class. The class atmosphere is also very good, and the professor is benevolent and humorous. "
