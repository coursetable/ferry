Unclear if Aspnes curves. Aspnes is horrible, but considering he's the DUS of Comp Sci and this is a comp sci class, these complaints are likely falling on deaf ears, so have fun with him.

            "\u00a0James Aspnes, the professor who teaches this course, truly cares about the students who take the course. He also understands the material, which is why the textbook used for the course was written by him. The downside to this is that the explanation of the material is the same everywhere:  the same person wrote the textbook, gives the lectures, makes the assignments and exams, and responds to student questions on student forums like Piazza. Since there isn't a great deal of outside information that can be referred to, students are stuck hearing the exact same explanation in different formats. Sometimes this is alright, but if a student doesn't understand Aspnes' explanation, there aren't strong alternative resources to turn to. ",
            "\u00a0Don't have Aspnes teach it. Focus on examples rather than just proofs. Either make the psets easier or don't be surprised when most people in the class just go to discussion section and get the answers there. ",

Prof. Aspnes seemed to come to class unprepared, frequently side-tracking into proofs which we would produce off the top of his head. As impressive as it was, he would usually make errors and correct them 10 mins later, resulting in half a page of notes being useless. ",
            "\u00a0202 simply tries to cover far too much material in far too little time (at the pace most students are accustomed to). The lectures move too quickly for most, and only those students who diligently prepare seem to get much out of them. Furthermore, the assignments are nuanced and difficult given the lack of preparation provided in class.\r\n\r\nThis iteration of the course in particular suffered from all of the above. Classes, in addition to being entirely too fast-paced (for the most part), failed to go over examples (which I believe is key preparation for homeworks and exams). As a result, students struggled heavily with the assignments and resorted to overutilizing the teaching staff to complete them. This resulted in horribly inflated grades (75% of the class with a 100%) despite the fact that many students remarked that they \"aren't really learning much.\" In a way, success on the assignments was determined by the ability of the student to attend office hours to be spoon-fed solutions, rather than on merit and hard work. As concrete proof of this, the exam grades were much lower than homework performance would suggest.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the major weakness of this course is the volume of material and the lack of proper preparation for the student to handle it. Additionally, the underlying teaching assistance structure is horribly broken and has created a roller coaster ride for grades over the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Course tries to fit a lot of topics into a short amount of time. I found the psets very difficult to do without going to office hours, which I don't think should happen when you go to class and are very engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The final two topics (linear algebra and probability) seemed unnaturally squeezed into the end. If they could be omitted and we could spend more time on other topics, it would be better. ",
            "\u00a0Everything about this class was terrible. I can't think of one good thing about this class. The class can be improved by getting a new professor. ",
            "\u00a0The major weakness is Professor Aspnes. He is a terrible lecturer. ",
            "\u00a0The course content is pretty interesting but really just covered too much. The course is aimed at people with a limited math background, and it started out very slow, but then the pace increased extremely quickly. A number of topics felt like they just weren't well explained in any practical sense, which is a shame because the class is aimed at math that is useful for computer science. Also, the linear algebra section - which I was looking forward to all semester - was very shoddily covered right before the exam, and then way over-emphasized on the exam itself to the point where the class average was a failing grade. \r\n\r\nAlso, and I know this isn't going to change anything - I absolutely hate grading based on distributions. It causes stress and confusion and competitiveness, which should not be the goal of the class. You shouldn't have to worry about doing better than everyone else. The tests should just be fairly written. If most people fail, then what are you testing? It's incredibly discouraging. Same with the psets - if everyone's getting 100s because they all just go to office hours, something has to change. Just don't curve the class because the perfect pset grades pull everyone's average up. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TAs made the class bearable. They were very understanding and approachable.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The TAs also made the class a struggle. They would constantly give out answers, so everyone got high grades on the psets. While this may sound great on the surface, it resulted in a class that was only stratified by exam grades, which added unnecessary pressure to tests. The structure of the class was also a weakness. With lectures covering an unreasonable amount of material every class. It was overwhelming and unnecessarily tangential at times.\r\n\r\nImprovements: Stop the TAs from giving out answers at office hours. Keep lectures focused and do not go on tangents. Have examples ready before class rather than going through examples on the spot. ",
            "\u00a0There's a lot of work that needs to be done to improve this class.  I think breaking up the course into two classes, CPSC 202 and CPSC 203, would be ideal, but make it so that 203 is optional for majors.  It would be unfair to force another requirement onto students who may already be bogged down with required courses.  In all seriousness, this course is terrible, and it needs to be fixed soon.  One easy way to start is to not have Aspnes teach it. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredibly cursory, to the point where I don't think I retained any of the information at all. The psets were incredibly difficult, and were nearly impossible without the help of at least one of the TAs. Lectures were fast paced and almost incomprehensible, especially for someone going in with a minimal math background. This course could be improved by not having it go over so many topics in such a short amount of time, and if class understanding was assessed throughout so that most people don't feel overwhelmed every single day of this class.

            "\u00a0The lectures were extremely dry. Most things were explained relatively clearly, but sometimes Professor Aspnes would introduce a whole new topic and just zoom through it without slowing down to make sure everyone understood. It was at the point where he would stop and ask if we had questions, but we were all so confused that we didn't even know what to ask, and so he would just move on. Also, the homework assignments were often very very different from what was presented in class, and often required proofs or insights that were nearly impossible for students to come up with on their own. If not for office hours, I would have failed every homework assignment. \r\nThe online course notes were well organized and comprehensive, if a little daunting as just one giant online PDF. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great lectures and very helpful office hours. Super responsive on the Piazza.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the more complicated topics could have been gone over a bit more in depth (graphs, relations, etc) ",

The material itself is interesting and relevant\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the material was taught too quickly without checking to make sure that students were following. Prof Aspnes is good at explaining concepts, but often glossed over his explanations unless prompted. I felt pretty lost during lectures because he assumed some understanding was already there. ",

            "\u00a0Problem sets could be much more specific and comprehensive. I feel like most of the time, I was unable to do the problem sets myself without direction and help from office hours. Maybe a progression of questions that are relatively easy to difficult questions with more varied styles (instead of the 3 questions posted every week) would allow me to develop a more comprehensive knowledge of this course. Lectures were sometimes confusing and most of the learning was taken place outside of class. Finals were unexpected; I don't think I could've prepared for it at all and the proofs were hit or miss. Average for the final was 40.5/80, which was indicative of the confusion most students shared of the class and the unpredictability of the ranges of questions finals could present. Overall, it was a very difficult class and I would only recommend taking it if it's for the CS requirement. ",

Depending on the TA, feedback on Psets was sometimes either unhelpful or flat out wrong ",

            "\u00a0The notes pdf is very helpful and the TA's are extremely helpful at office hours.  However, Aspnes often has trouble proving examples during lecture.  Also, the final was on topics that we could not be logically expected to have learned during the course, and was unreasonably difficult, leading to a median score of ~50%. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course is very flawed in the way that it was taught. The lectures were unclear at best, and although they tried to be a rendition of the notes, they ended up seeming to drone on and were very hard to follow. The homeworks were also intentionally difficult, which is fine in itself, but when TAs hand out answers to homeworks to certain students and the homeworks count for 70% of the grade, it is very demoralizing to students who try for hours and get a few points off for syntax when the students who received answers from TAs account for 25th-75th percentile. ",
            "\u00a0Strength - psets good for learning material\r\n\r\nWeakness - lecture not helpful in learning material at all (many classmates agreed) ",
            "\u00a0One strength was that the course covered a lot of material and gave a lot of information on many different topics.\r\n\r\nI thought the homeworks were not very well designed. Many of the problems were too hard, and students were forced to ask TAs for help before we could even get started. I also think that lectures sometimes became out of focus and hard to understand. ",

I did not learn anything from the classes I went to, and many peers felt the same, leading me to stop attending all together. The lecture notes from another teacher from past years, however, were excellent, and I learned from those. Thus I think the biggest weakness was the quality of the teacher and his teaching. It truly was unlearnable. For example, his class on RSA encryption was unintelligible, even though I had seen the material before. Halfway through the lecture he decided to switch the notation so that the \"m\"s were \"n\"s and \"e\"s were \"d\"s, making the notes I was taking worthless and leaving me utterly confused as to what he was doing on the board, as he had effectively switched the roles of every concept in the proof. I was baffled by the ineptitude of that decision. If you take this course, make sure you are good at self-learning, because that's the only feasible way to grasp the material. Professor Aspnes also used non-standard mathematical notation, leading to great confusion, at least for me. \r\n\r\nI also think that the CS department needs to strive to hire/recruit better TAs for the course. While I understand they have a difficult job, some of them were mathematically illiterate and didn't understand (or didn't take the time to understand) basic proofs; they failed to recognize at least two perfectly acceptable proof methods and assigned a low grade because they didn't understand it, even though it was correct. Since the majority of learning takes place in the form of the psets, it's critical that the TAs know what they are doing. \r\n\r\nOn the flip side, one of the past professor wrote truly excellent course notes, and they read like an entertaining book; I didn't even feel like it was difficult and draining to read and learn from them, it was more fun and actually funny. I highly recommend taking that route if you take this course. ",

No disrespect to the instructor because he clearly knew the material and understood what he was talking about, but lectures were extremely dry and confusing. Exams were incredibly difficult, and with only 4 questions on each, it was very easy to do poorly. Homework was doable, but especially by the end of the term it felt like no one was actually learning the material covered in the problem sets, and instead everyone relied on office hours to get the correct answers. The TAs for this class were very good at explaining homework problems, but it was more in a way that only made a problem make sense rather than an entire concept. The professor had this same issue, and it was then very difficult to try and apply previously covered material to new problems. Overall, this was my weakest class of the semester in almost all aspects. The material was bland, and didn't feel entirely relevant/necessary even as a CS major. The one strength this course has is the in depth notes. However, even though the notes cover all material, they can be difficult to understand on the first read through and lectures don't seem to do much to make them clearer. Overall, I really would recommend reevaluating this course. ",

The difference in location was really the distance, I thought the move was unnecessary and made commuting difficult. The instructor, Professor Aspnes, didn't seem to have a sound understanding of writing out proofs during lectures, and I was unconvinced that he knew what he was teaching. The online notes didn't contain a lot of helpful insights for proof-constructing, just a lot of material that we needed to memorize for solving proofs. The notes are very dense and could be conveyed in a more direct, concise manner. ",

The professor had to rush through it to finish in time even when we did not/ needed more time to understand everything. Another weakness was the \"final\".

For instance, the equivalent of a few weeks of MATH 222 was covered in the last two lectures.\r\n\r\nUnless youre a math olympian, or have prior math background, Id recommend staying away from this class.

Be prepared to spend a lot of time in office hours attempting to piece out the solutions with the help of the TAs, as this is often your only recourse for solving the tricky homeworks. You'll gain exposure to a wide breadth of mathematical concepts, including an interesting perspective on its foundations, but you need to be able to keep up with the incredible pace of the course and not get quagmired in tricky concepts (as you'll just end up stuck behind).

Lectures were a joke, just Aspnes going through pointless proofs incredibly fast, making mistakes along the way as he was never prepared for lecture and did all the math on the fly.

Psets are impossible to do, and unless you've taken classes that cover the topics before, the only way you'll do well is if you get the answers from your TAs at office hours. Trying to do them on your own is a bad choice. \r\nMidterms and finals are all badly structured. The 'final' isn't even called a final because respecting the spirit of reading period and finals period is for the weak. \r\nIf you do have to take this course, start using Wikipedia and youtube as soon as you can.

",

Professor Aspnes teaches entirely too fast, and the problem sets were far too obtuse for the amount of time each topic was given. The first exam was fair given the time constraint, but the second exam was incredibly difficult, and included an entire problem on a topic covered on the last day of class, which was only two days before the exam. If this course is taught by James Aspnes, do not expect to gain a healthy understanding of all the topics unless you are fully devoting your time and mental energy to this course. The CS major already has several weed-out courses, this class should not become one of them and I hope it changes in the future. ",

I would recommend taking Math 244 if you want to learn something because, odds are, you're taking this to be a CS major, and you need this stuff for algorithms, so I would urge you to take Math 244, which may be harder but at least you'll learn something. ",
            "\u00a0I went into this course looking to become more familiar with proofs and math generally, and this course was appropriate for that goal. Aspnes gave the lectures and also wrote the textbook, so the lectures and textbook were quite similar. For me, the best way to learn the material was to first read the textbook chapters and then go to lecture. Attending lecture without having first read the textbook was not as helpful. I found Aspnes's lecture style entertaining and engaging, but difficult to follow. TA office hours were quite crazy but necessary to complete the course successfully. ",
            "\u00a0As I assume you've gathered from every other review: don't take this course unless it is required for your major. It's extremely disorganized, and the professor flies through the material so quickly that by the time you've thought about what he just said enough to even realize that you don't understand it and formulate a basic question, you've already missed the next thing he said and have moved on to something else. You'll get a very surface-level understanding of the topics and not much more, and not much understanding of how the concepts are applied in any field. I didn't feel like almost anything we did would enhance my knowledge or understanding of computer science, and it wasn't in-depth enough for it to be very useful in mathematics. If you're good at math and really are interested in the material, I would recommend taking math 244. The students in 202 are basically all CS majors who have to take the class but don't want it to be as hard as it is in the math department.\r\n\r\nWhen you do take this class, make sure you go to office hours for each pset, even from the beginning of the semester. The graders can be very particular and have a strict rubric, so you'll want to make sure that the TA's at office hours don't think you're missing any key steps. One of the hardest things about the psets is that sometimes a step in the proof seems trivial and obvious, but can't necessarily be written without explanation, and you'll lose points for it which will be frustrating. Err on the side of writing more, and don't be shy about asking the TA's whether they think a step needs to be explained or whether it is indeed obvious enough. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend the course if they already had an understanding on how to write proofs and knew a bit of discrete math beforehand. ",
            "\u00a0Not really, the professor didn't teach very well, so I didn't attend many lectures. Math 244 would be much better taught, more engaging and has a better professor, so that would be my recommendation. ",

            "\u00a0The difference between this class and MATH 244 is that MATH 244 is honest-to-god math for math majors or those who are very, VERY familiar with how to study math. This class is better suited for others, but you will still do better if you are familiar with some maths at Yale (not necessarily how to study it, but the math itself)MATH 115 will be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0NO! Absolutely not. Only take this course if you are in the major and if it is still required. Otherwise, this course is dry, dense, and doesn't really seem necessary. If you do end up having to take this course, go to as many office hours as possible, and if you can find a way to teach yourself the material through the class notes, try to do that because going to every lecture does nothing. Overall, I really would not recommend taking this course because the material is not enjoyable, and the concepts can be pretty difficult to understand with the way they were taught. Its probably better than the alternative course that fulfills the CS major requirement, but know what you are getting into, and don't set your expectations high. ",
            "\u00a0I mean if it's required for your major then sure, it definitely goes way too quickly through major math topics but if you go to office hours then the psets are not bad. \r\nThe final exam was wilin but what's one insignificant exam in the grand scheme of things. ",
            "\u00a0No, take Math 244. ",
            "\u00a0Where do I even begin. *shaky sigh* If you need to take this course, then by all means get through it but here are some pointers that I believe would have helped me out from the beginning.\r\n\r\nFirst, this course is all about proving and disproving all sorts of mathematical and logical phenomena, so make sure during the first few days when you're learning proof techniques that you really get it down.\r\n\r\nSecond, you don't always have to go to lecture- Aspnes has great, detailed online notes that he goes off of in class and often they are more understandable than his teaching in class (especially when he drops a proof midway through doing it and then erases all of it). Aspnes is quite funny, though, but it's only funny when you're not getting screwed over by that week's problem set.\r\n\r\nThird and most importantly (!), if you are not fully comfortable with the material, do NOT attempt the problem sets without office hours. The TAs were our literal guiding light in the darkness of this class- it was as if the problem sets almost could not be successfully completed without going to office hours (or if 202 was your only difficult class).\r\n\r\nHaving said all this, there *will* be a curve at the end of the class so don't fret too much. But seriously, if you go to office hours from the very beginning (the TAs are superb at teaching the material), you should ride along fine in the course! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if it was not a core requirement for computer science majors I would still recommend that you take it. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely not if Aspnes is teaching it. ",
            "\u00a0honestly i dont even know if i have the words to describe how terrible this class was. im sure other people will have covered this in other evaluations already but just for emphasis: lecture and class make no sense, are impossible to follow, and the professor completely disregards if the students are understanding what he is saying, instead simply brain dumping every concept and formula and proof he knows about a given concept on the blackboard. also multiple times in the semester we would get halfway through a proof and he would stop and say oh wait im lost. or oh wait that was wrong and erase the entire thing. often times things on the board would be wrong and he would not explain them or erase them. if you work on the psets on your own and actually try to understand them, and spend hours on them, you will get a worse grade than your peers who will go to office hours for 30 minutes on the day they are due and copy down the answers from the TAs. the grading for this class is completely skewed, and on multiple psets 25-75% percentile of the class would get 100%, so if you lose one point for a typo or minor error you are automatically in the bottom 20th percentile of the class. having psets that are impossible to do alone leads everyone to go to office hours and seek help from TAs, learning nothing on their own. which in turn leads to catastrophic tests, because no one actually learned how to do any of the problems on their own, the averages on the tests will be 50%. if you go to aspnes, he will tell you nothing about your grade to help you or assist you in anyway, and will suggest you ask more questions on piazza to learn better. also, on both the midterm and the final, points are taken off in increments of 5 (out of a test worth 80 points) effectively making it a 16 point test, and little to no explanation is ever given to explain why points are taken off. there is no textbook, only a cryptic pdf written in latex with tons of errors that is impossible to understand. students are forced to teach themselves just about the entire course, as going to class is a complete waste of time. overall, this was honestly one of the worst courses with one of the worst professors i have ever had in the entirety of my academic career. i would not recommend it to anyone, under any circumstances. if aspnes teaches again, take 244, or wait until dana teaches it. ",
            "\u00a0Only if you are prepared to put in the work yourself to learn the material. 244 is probably a better course but if you don't have the math skills, there's not really any other options. "
