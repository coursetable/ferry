            "\u00a0I got better at reading the staff, sight-singing, singing in solfege, hearing intervals, identifying triads/inversions/chord function, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I honed my ability to listen to music and identify aspects such as scale degree, harmonic function, chord quality, and inversions. I also became cognizant of the predominance of the Western classical perspective in both my personal view of music but also music education programs in general. ",
            "\u00a0learned a great deal about music theory, and developed my ear significantly. by the end of the semester, was able to feel comfortable taking harmonic (two-part) dictation and identifying chords within a particular key. the keyboard lab component of the class was very fun as well! ",
            "\u00a0In this class, I learned how to identify intervals and chords by ear.  I learned how to dictate pieces of music with several voices as well as how to sight-sing music better. "

        [
            "\u00a0Weakness is the silliness that it is .5 credits. It meets twice a week, regular homework, and on top of that a piano lab with more homework. And it isn't easy stuff.... we are mostly non-music students. Strength is just making us drill these concepts, it's hard to make yourself do it on your own. Piano lab is useful. ",
            "\u00a0This course effectively and efficiently taught me important musical skills. I can't really point out any weaknesses because I feel like I already had developed these skills pretty well before entering the course, and subsequently didn't need to learn as much because it was material I was already pretty familiar with it. ",
            "\u00a0It's VERY dependent on your TA, so make sure you shop different sections. I thought there was too much dictation and not enough sight-singing, but not everyone will feel that way. ",
            "\u00a0the course was really well organized overall. I wish we'd maybe done some more of the foundational music theory stuff at the front-end of the class (ie. going over how figured bass works and the different types of chord progressions before being expected to hear inversions and cadences). ",
            "\u00a0I really like the idea behind the course . Ear training is really valuable understanding music and I hope I will continue to get better at it even after the course. I liked that the course had a keyboard lab component, because I really enjoyed learning how to play piano. I also liked the fact that classes were very interactive and had a large practical  component. \r\n\r\nOne thing that I thought was difficult was the different skill levels present in the seminar. Some people had much more exposure to music theory and ear training than others. While the class might have been boring for some people, I really struggled with it. I would have appreciated if there had been one section for people not planning on taking MUSI219  or majoring in music that spent more time on the basics. For example, I would have appreciated a more explicit review of interval identification (and repetitive practice!) early on in the semester. I also would have appreciated a review of what chord quality/inversion is earlier in the semester.\r\n\r\nFinally, it would have helped me if homework assignments included a more repetitive review of the basics. For example, it would have helped if at the beginning of the semester homework were to do 100 correct interval identifications on teoria every day rather than jumping straight into melodic dictations. \r\n\r\nFinally, this course should be more than 0.5 credits. With weekly dictations, piano lab, and class, this course was easily as much work as a full credit class if taken seriously. "

            "\u00a0Yes. Clifton is a great teacher who really cares about student learning and puts in a lot of effort to help us learn the material. ",
            "\u00a0If you want to train your ear, take it. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this class to any musician who wants to improve their listening abilities! I actually came out of this class better able to approach my own music, both in terms of phrasing and on a micro-level, in terms of intonation. ",
            "\u00a0Take this class if you are interested in improving your ability to identify intervals/dictate music. That being said, this class is a lot of work if you are not already good at these things. I came out of the class having improved less than I expected at the beginning. A large part of this is because I ended up not having the time to regularly (every day) practice the material. If you take this class, make sure you're ready to really invest in it. "
