Practically speaking, the broad concrete skills you learn include t-tests (independent samples, paired, and one-sample), one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, t-scores, z-scores, correlation, and regression. You'll also learn how to convey relevant information about your data in APA format, both numerically and verbally. Also, you'll learn how to use SPSS, which is a statistical analysis software. Don't let that scare you: No computer programming experience is required, and the teaching team for this class ROCKS. (I am terrified of computers and had no difficulty learning this program.) You'll eventually get to the point where the assignments will ask you to \"tell a story\" about the data, and you'll be able to. That's really, really satisfying. ",

For example, the class before the final, we reviewed in class several situations and decided which test would be best to run according to that situation. That was really great, and it would be even better if we did this continually throughout the semester. \r\n-I didn't really understand why we were only given 24 hours in advance to prepare the final. While I am definitely glad that we received in the final in advance(as noted above in strengths), this resulted in cramming (not memorization, but in writing terms) the day before.

            "\u00a0The course is impeccably designed to be straightforward and engaging. Lectures move at a manageable pace, and the material is cumulative  not in a way that is overwhelming, but rather in a way that gives you a sense you're really learning something. Professor Gee spends the perfect amount of time highlighting the theory behind why certain statistical tests work, enough to help you appreciate the analysis. She also gives a lot of concrete examples, so you feel ready to import your knowledge into real-world situations. Problem sets require the use of SPSS (I didn't buy it since it's on the Yale desktop computers, and that worked out just fine) and directly reflect what you've learned in class and section each week, with ample time to consult with Professor Gee and the teaching team in advance of turning them in. Also, 10% of your course grade is based on showing up to section and lecture (the latter is measured by clicker data you provide when you come to class). Our daily \"clicker time\" was actually a fun part of the class, as were the lab sections, where you got to cement a new conceptual skill by working with real data sets (often from clicker data!) in SPSS. Additionally, I thought the exam format was brilliant, even though it was challenging. It involves actually working with a dataset during the 50-minute exam and \"telling a story\" about the data through a write-up like you'd do on a real paper in the real world. My only suggestion for the exam format would be to release the exam materials 48 hours before the test instead of 24 hours. I know that makes it easier for people to cheat, but since my Tuesday schedule was absolutely packed this semester, I found myself struggling to find time to prepare in the 24 hours before the exam and would have appreciated a little more flexibility in my schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Homework and exams very well aligned with lectures and section\r\nNo real weaknesses ",

The focus of the course is less about memorizing formulas and solving equations, as it is about reasoning about and running statistical tests, which can actually be fun. It's definitely more of the reasoning bit from quantitative reasoning and it's best to approach the psets and exams with more of a creative eye. The project is also interesting, because you can choose to run an experiment of your own (individual or in a group).

            "\u00a0Yes!! It's a very fun and intuitive class that you're sure to do well in if you put in the proper time and effort. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course to any student looking to study statistics, but from an application perspective rather than a mathematical one. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to another student above all because Dylan Gee is a fantastic professor and lecturer. The course material is extremely useful and actually helped me to complete a project in another psychology course this term. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, for a QR requirement or to simply learn valuable skills for statistical analysis ",
            "\u00a0If they like psychology or math. Not if they are not really a math person, like myself. I took this as a QR credit, but wouldn't recommend it to someone just trying to get the QR credit. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone because its really straightforward and youll learn a lot of statistics fundamentals. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course to another student. This course taught me when to run specific types of analyses by going through lots of real-world examples. I feel more confident running my own statistical tests now. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it is a good QR for those who aren't STEM ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great QR with manageable workload, fair grading, and useful topics. ",
            "\u00a0This course is an easy A and not that much work, so i would recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0It's a good foundational class for statistical concepts. Although it is not very mathematical, Professor Gee works with students who want more of the hard math so I recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0You have to take it if you are a psych student; I definitely recommend taking this class earlier rather than later in the major.\r\n\r\nIf you're not in psych it's a useful enough class to take anyway, but it is a good amount of work. Not overwhelming by any means, though. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone interested in research should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it's a great stats credit if you need it for pre-med or your major. I took both the STAT 10x intro sequence and this course and thought this one was more useful, especially since we used SPSS rather than MINITAB. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ! This is the perfect class to introduce you to statistics. It is interesting and really really useful but doesnt involve math or really hard calculations! Super important stuff to know but a low stress environment! The exam format is also really good (you have 24 hours to work on it before you actually go in to take the test). ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course. This course is good at laying down the essentials for statistics so you aren't confused about unnecessary things but you understand the basis for statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Unless you really need to learn R and all the computational stuff behind statistics, this is the best intro course. You learn what you need and it's not super difficult to do very well. The teaching is really good. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would definitely recommend this course and I already have to other students. I thinks it's mainly because it truly changed my perspective on statistics like now I feel like a knowledgable consumer of statistics in the real world and feel that everyone should be too in order to make the best decisions for one's life. ",
            "\u00a0If you have to take it, it'll go by quickly and it's very manageable. Also a good 5th class if you need a QR credit. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Anyone and everyone can benefit from learning statistics! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, it's a great way to learn statistics and also its many applications. Prof. Gee works really hard to ensure that the class is clear and organized, and the course had great TA's as well. Highly recommend! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great way to introduce yourself to statistics. It is very approachable and applicable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This course is very organized and perfect for students who are looking to learn about basic statistics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think this is a great introduction for students without coding background or any statistics background. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in gaining a basic knowledge of statistics, I would recommend this course. It's not extremely challenging, but I do feel like I have mastered the ability to run common statistical tests and analyze data. I also think I have become a more educated consumer of information because of this course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who didnt take AP Statistics ",
            "\u00a0Everything you need for psyc research in a class. Prof Gee is the best! ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would recommend because it is good background knowledge to have in statistics ",
            "\u00a0Definitely!!! Whether or not you're a STEM person, this course feels so relevant because being able to understand statistical reports or maybe even create one yourself is SO USEFUL for most fields. Also, this is the first QR class at Yale in which I've been able to confidently do the PSets entirely on my own without collaborating/leaning on friends in the class to help me, and I think that says a lot about how well prepared we were week to week to do them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I loved Dylan Gee. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to anyone. ",
            "\u00a0Yes ",
            "\u00a0yes! great easy qr ",
            "\u00a0If a student enjoys- and already has a foundation in- statistics, this would be a good class for them. The course moves a little quickly for a humanities student. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's a great and well-organized course to take if you're a Psych major, need a QR credit or are just interested in stats. ",
            "\u00a0Yes -- it's supposedly a gut, but i had so much trouble with the course, i consistently scored in the bottom 25th percentile on all assessments, but I still ended up with an A- i think ",
            "\u00a0Yes because I think it is a valuable skill to have, and this class provides a simpler approach to statistics for people that are not necessarily majoring in the subject. ",
            "\u00a0I took this course as an English major hoping to take a QR that was interesting. This class was so so SO uninteresting to me. it is exactly what it claims to be, but if you are like me, you will be taken in by claims that this class \"is actually relevant to real life.\" If the idea of learning about psyc stats doesn't interest you, do NOT take this class. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course to anyone. I went in looking for an easy QR and ended up learning a ton. The class is set up so that its really difficult to do poorly. Everything you need to know for the psets and exams is on the handouts you get in section, which are posted online. The psets only take like 40 minutes to an hour and a half and if you do them you master the material. The exams are straightforward and you get the questions 24 hours in advance and then the data at the beginning of the exam, which makes it was less stressful. Also professor Gee is AMAZING she cares so much about about everyone and is an incredible lecturer. She works so hard to make the class relevant and useful to everyone. I highly highly recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great introduction to statistics at Yale (especially if you're interested in Psychology or Cognitive Science as possible majors). Professor Gee and all the Teaching Fellows are extremely helpful and provide very thorough feedback on problem sets, exams, and projects ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course; it is organized, it teaches you the basics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you need a statistics course and plan to do research in the social or behavioral sciences, this class provides a great introduction to the material. If you are looking for a really in-depth, math/comp science heavy course, however, this class definitely does not fit the bill. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, great QR credit even if you aren't interested in psych. If you are interested in psych, it will definitely empower you to understand articles and design your own studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes definitely. I only took this class because I needed to fulfill the QR requirement but Im really happy I took it. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student. I really enjoyed the course. ",
            "\u00a0Great QR gut. But make sure to take it with a group of people you know because you'll need to rely on one another for psets. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - overall I learned quite a bit and while the course is fast-paced and more difficult than it might seem at face value, I am glad that I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. If you need a QR credit, Psych Stats is super interesting and you get to learn a lot from doing a final project on a Psych issue. Professor Gee is super great and approachable. ",
            "\u00a0great class to get familiar with spss, especially if you're planning on doing psyc research. i feel like i can better analyze stats in the news and such. dylan is a great lecturer and it's refreshing to have a dynamic, female prof in a math class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you want a class that has less workload and also provides a basic(intro level) information about statistics, take this class! Also the whole class is designed to facilitate your learning! ",
            "\u00a0If you have taken AP Stats or similar in high school, this WILL be easy and maybe a little slow. But I still learned things we never covered in high school and am glad I took it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, wonderful introduction to statistics, especially if you have no background whatsoever in this field. It moved pretty slowly, but I left the class feeling prepared to analyze data using a the SPSS software and to understand the statistical findings of scientific papers in a variety of fields. ",
            "\u00a0This course was surprisingly very useful. As a MCDB major, I work in a lab where I actually use a lot of the tests we learned about in class. The workload is not bad at all; there is a short problem set every week. Lectures are nice but you can learn everything you need to know in the course in section. If you are looking to take a statistics class and you work in any type of lab, I would recommend taking this course instead of the regular intro statistics class. You will get a lot more useful information out of this class and it is easy enough to be a 5th credit. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It is a fantastic and fascinating course, whether or not you are planning on taking psychology. Professor Gee is hands down one of the best professors I have had at Yale. "
