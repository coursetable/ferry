Although this sounds like a lot of material, most of it interconnects, and Sarah Demers is a great instructor for the second-half of this semester (she loves quantum mechanics). You will learn Maxwell's equations, and many different scenarios on how to use them. Creative problem-solving is a tool that you will develop over the semester, and it is imperative to learning and doing the problems. ",

Welcome to a class where you will be barraged by terrible problem sets, where you will be forced to use a textbook that reads like an old man rambling, where you will not be given a single practice problem, where the professor barely explains anything if she even deigns to show up, and where -- if review sessions are held at all -- the TA's are more clueless than the students. The only plausible \"skill\" I developed was how to collaborate on a problem set in order to not fail. This is not a class where you succeed or feel accomplishment. This is a class where you measure yourself by how lost you feel. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures in this course were very interesting and managed to keep good pace despite the attempts by the textbook to slow down at every turn. I found the topics covered to be very interesting, although I sometimes wished that the material was a bit more challenging. The exams and even the problem sets didn't always reach the level of depth that I was expecting. ",
            "\u00a0I would say that this course is composed mostly of weaknesses. The strongest part is probably the textbook which was written by the professor who used to teach this class. It seems that since that time, Physics 201 has fallen very low on the physics department's priority list. Our teacher clearly did not view our class as a priority. She missed probably over three weeks of class in all, she often came unprepared, and she often struggled to understand her own derivations. We did not get any assignments back in any sort of timely manner, despite the fact that the class had only about 60 people and had 2 TAs and a professor. I was very very disappointed in this class and learned most of the material from reading the textbook or watching Shankar's lectures online. ",
            "\u00a0I really appreciate how Professor Demers was really engaged and interested in the content. I enjoyed how we derived the answers to all the problems. ",
            "\u00a0The professor was smart, explained things well, and structured the class well, but clearly had not taught the class before. I believe that this class would have benefitted from making the PSets due not at midnight on a friday night because it encouraged a) letting it infringe on social lives b) rushing through the Psets to either get to bed or make it to social plans with friends. ",
            "\u00a0The class was very engaging and the material was consistently a good balance of challenging and interesting. It did seem change in structure as the semester went along: the second two exams were very different in format than the first (more conceptual questions and fewer calculations), so at times it felt like the structure and expectations were a bit inconsistent. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness\r\n-took forever to hand back homework and midterms so you could not really learn from your mistakes before the final\r\n-teacher is kind of annoying ",
            "\u00a0Strenghts: Sarah was so passionate about what she was teaching  and this class made me like physics even more ",
            "\u00a0Every lecture needs to be standardized with respect to Shankar's textbook. In 200, Prof. Poland did a decent job at this. In 201, Prof. Demers often veered off course and this made it difficult to keep track of the material. Additionally, the Physics department needs to pick an instructor who will be present to give us lectures 95% of the time. Prof. Demers often had to travel to her various research groups around the world in lieu of lecturing. It was not her fault that she had to travel so much, but the department should pick somebody else who is more focused on teaching to teach this courseespecially because students decide whether to major in Physics based on the 200/201 sequence. ",
            "\u00a0The problem sets are great for learning and Professor Demers is great! One improvement I think that could be made is greater clarity about what we need to k ow for exams and quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0I think that the course felt very disorganized. Students received their first midterm back at least a whole month after they took it. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strangely lacking in test prep materials--even when promised practice problems, we often only received material covering a fraction of what would appear on the test.  TA review sessions were, on the whole, entirely unhelpful (though Professor Urry's review sessions were fantastic, and I'd highly recommend attending), and it was at times unclear how we should proceed leading up to a midterm. ",
            "\u00a0As someone who hadn't taken AP physics or any physics for probably four years I found keeping up conceptually in this class was very difficult. The book wasn't helpful at all, so if concept weren't explained in class I was totally lost. I think using a book that focuses more on a deep conceptual understanding rather than just the math derivations of equations would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: a good overview of the topics, a clear organization ",
            "\u00a0The physics office hour sessions are extremely helpful and a really good tool to get students working through problems together. ",

            "\u00a0Honestly a well-paced, interesting intro physics class--no complaints ",
            "\u00a0The course was taught well and covered many topics in E&M and quantum. It overlapped with a lot of material I had already learned in AP physics C, but I liked the extension to quantum mechanics at the end, and I feel like I now have a better understanding of Maxwell's equations. ",
            "\u00a0Study halls were great! Lectures could have been more well organized ",
            "\u00a0This class is strong in that its super interesting and beautiful, and the professor is very friendly and has a good teaching style.  The textbook is also really good. The psets are also fair. Can't really think of any weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0I think there should be more practice problems and practice outside of the normal psets and exams ",
            "\u00a0One strength I found was the candid and relaxed nature of the instructor, Professor Demers: she brings a calm approach to physics, which helps relieve some of the anxiety of not understanding everything. In one of her lectures, she said \"one thing you need to do is stop trying to understand the material,\" which I think makes perfect sense in quantum mechanics. However, one weakness (for me) was her reliance on Shankar's text: she would reference things in the text and expected you to read some of the chapters from it. However, if you're like me and don't like buying the textbooks and just try and understand the material otherwise, you are in luck: it is easy to gain the understanding of material through just her lectures and the notes you write down from them. Another strength is that the PSETs help prepare you for the exam, but the PSET questions are harder than the exam questions, therefore not requiring you to imitate answers to PSET questions. I found this useful, since I knew that we wouldn't have to know everything on the PSETs, and instead it allowed me to focus on broader questions and topics within the course. ",
            "\u00a0Sarah is a very enthusiastic professor and her excitement can be very motivating. She does well to focus less on vague theoretical proofs and more on practical concepts that are more useful. Unfortunately, however, the course was not structured well in enough to tap into Sarah's potential. We often skipped past some concepts or chapters, and sometimes Sarah would drift off topic and leave others under-cooked. ",
            "\u00a0I had trouble with Shankar's textbook. I felt like my background in mathematics was not high enough to follow, and maybe it was not (because I'd just started taking Math 120 this semester.) Studying for the final exam, I felt much clearer on what the equations meant, because I'd gone through a semester of Math 120 preparation. In the beginning of the semester, I thought the problem sets were fine conceptually, but I found myself struggling to do even the easier questions for problems that involved surface integrals and otherwise. During Physics study hall, other people just seemed to understand how to do the problems, while I did not. Most weeks I had to rely on others' help in order to get through problem sets. In those situations, I understood concepts, but not how to solve problems. ",
            "\u00a0Could be faster grading. Interesting material though. More rigorous proofs would be nice. ",
            "\u00a0As a disclaimer, normally I try to find the positive in classes. Unfortunately, I just can't for this class. There were no positives. This class is miserable and useless. The material was taught poorly. The TA's didn't know what was going on. The textbook provided, rambling, lackluster explanations. There were no practice problems. Our professor was so engrossed in her research that she forgot that there were students depending on her for their education. Problem sets did not correlate to exams. Exams were easy -- if you knew what to possibly study. That was the worst part of this class; the questions on the exams were so easy, but people didn't know how to answer them. Imagine taking a class at Yale, and it being a complete waste of time where you learn nothing. That is Physics 201. How could this class be improved? Everything needs improvement, so start from square one. Get a new professor who actually is knowledgeable about the material and cares, get TA's who know how to teach and explain things to students, get a new textbook that has practice problems and clear explanations, rewrite problem sets to better fit the material, provide practice exams and practice problems to students, provide review sessions to students, and rewrite exams that better fit the material included on problem sets. This class was ridiculously bad. It was an embarrassment to Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Not very in depth, but good breadth. ",
            "\u00a0I likes the breadth of the course. I feel like it gave a nice introduction to a wide variety of branches of physics, and I felt more or less introduced to the material. I think I would've liked to see a little bit more mathematical rigor in the psets, and a little more consistency in the frequency of them. There were some weeks were we missed them, and while my other STEM classes reached pset 11 or 12, we only got to 9 in physics. ",
            "\u00a0The course does a very good job presenting the foundation for each concept and providing homework problems that extend the topics taught in lecture. Study halls are a great chance to work with others on difficult problems and solidify understanding. I would have liked more practice problems to be available before each exam because problem solving practice is such an important part of this course. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student, particularly one with a little bit of a background in E&M. The overall course is actually a bit less difficult than 200, and I personally think that the material is more interesting, so there's that to look forward to. ",
            "\u00a0I don't know if I would recommend this course. However, I have heard bad things about all of the intro physics sequence, so if you need to take physics, there's pretty much no great option. This class definitely has the potential to be good if the teacher cares at all about teaching it. In our case, this was sadly not what happened. The content of this class is obviously important and sort of essential if you want to do anything related to physics, but the structure (or lack thereof) and the teaching of this course really prevent me from recommending it. ",

            "\u00a0If you are thinking about majoring in Physics, shop both 200/201 sequence and the 260/261 sequence. If you think you might be able to handle the 260 stuff, just take that course. 200/201 is just not that great. Some of the material at the end of the course is very exciting, but the bulk of the semester will be on material that is not. I recommend 260 for students interested in Physics and do not take 200 at all if you just need it for MB&B or pre-med. Take 180 instead. ",

            "\u00a0If you are a physics major or very comfortable in physics I would take this class. If you are unfamiliar with physics, regardless of your math background, I would take 180 or 181. I think they move a little slower. ",

This means you will already have an understanding of the concepts before they are taught to you. I also found this class easier when I took CHEM 163, where we learn about quantum mechanics in the first third of fall semester (and take PHYS 201 spring). This is a very interesting class, and it would benefit the most curious students. ",

I think you do learn more and get a better physical understanding than just plugging numbers into equations. The students who are likely to take this class are more likely to be engineers than pre-med, so I think you learn more from your peers in this class as well. ",

Do not waste your time on Physics 200/201. You will be left miserable, angry, and struggling through a class that does its utmost to make you suffer. Nothing about this class was organized in a logical, coherent manner. If I knew before coming to Yale that I would be taking classes like this, I would not have come to Yale. There is no reason for Physics 201 to exist as a class. Combine the worst facets of every lecture course that you have taken, add a sprinkle of an uninvested professor, difficult problem sets, limited study resources, no practice problems, obscure problem sets, a terrible textbook, no review sessions, exam material that does not correlate to the problem sets, and voila you have Physics 201. This class is an embarrassment to  Yale and a disgrace to the student body who worked so hard to succeed with all the odds against them. I am disappointed in Yale for this low-quality excuse for a course. I am in awe and amazement that I actually payed for this. Anyone considering this class, re-evaluate your life choices. Stay away.

            "\u00a0If they were interested in physics, yes. Its a decent course, and provides access to upper-lever courses. If they weren't interested in physics, no. I don't feel that the course is stimulating enough to hold the attention of someone if they aren't sold on the material. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. From the perspective of an engineering major, this course's topics seem like a somewhat odd mix, and optics and quantum mechanics don't seem to add much practical value.
