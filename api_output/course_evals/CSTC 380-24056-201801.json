            "\u00a0None, I lost knowledge, skills, and insights by taking this course. He made me feel uncomfortable, as a blonde white girl he would make comments towards us that was kind of unsettling. ",
            "\u00a0I thought this was an incredibly interesting look at all things Branding, a topic that I would not have been exposed to prior to this class. ",
            "\u00a0I had the valuable chance of learning about the branding of things -- how to write about marketing, talk about design strategy, and come up eith creative ideas. ",
            "\u00a0This class was great at establishing a foundation for understanding brands. ",
            "\u00a0I have learned to think about brands in a completely new way. This course was extremely insightful and fun. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about myself, which was actually very helpful. I also learned that I like brand strategy and marketing a lot! ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a wonderful exposure to what it means to think like a \"brander\" and to appreciate the art of branding in many different contexts, from a more conventional business perspective to less conventional angles (in what ways does \"feminism\" act like a brand, for instance). Great, entertaining reading list exposes you to these different perspectives in an engrossing way (if you do the readings, that is). The final project, in which you craft your own personal brand, is something that is incredibly important for college-aged adults to think about, particularly as we embark on the job search and have to effectively communicate what it is that sets us apart from other candidates. ",
            "\u00a0How everything has a brand and needs a strong brand to be successful and how to figure out the \"special sauce\" of a brand/person. ",
            "\u00a0I learned absolutely nothing in this course. I found the readings to be useless, and class entirely a waste of time. I'm actually pretty sure my writing deteriorated. The most I learned were little factoids about why Santa wears red, or why diamonds are a girl's best friend, and that is it. In regards to advice for writing a solid paper, he said, \"i like to do my thinking before I write.\" That's pretty standard. It's called an outline. "

        [
            "\u00a0Strengths - I had high expectations\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - the professor who:\r\nis racist \r\ndemonstrates blatant favoritism with white guys in the class when he would strike up conversations and ignore others\r\nis misogynistic\r\nis sexist \r\n\r\nP.s two students left the class because of him. One guy who was annoyed by his abuse and a girl who felt she was personally attacked. ",
            "\u00a0I think it was amazing. Mr. Lewis was such an insightful and knowledgeable source. ",
            "\u00a0Very cool assignments that allowed for lots of freedom. ",
            "\u00a0I think Professor Lewis should rely a little more on students. He had some great essay prompts, and I think most of my classmates enjoyed the class. However, Professor Lewis can ramble sometimes, and it can either be really good, when he's giving you keen insight into the thinking of a man in marketing, or it can make class a bit boring. I think he should try to engage with students more and jump in only to steer the conversation or give valuable insight. Nevertheless, I loved the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths were the writing assignments. I really liked them and thought their progression was good, too. Some of the books, though, were not as interesting or worth while in my opinion. ",
            "\u00a0The nature of the subject matter and the thesis of the class (that essentially everything can be thought of as a brand) means that class discussion can go just about anywhere and still be relevant. That said, a bit more structure in class time would perhaps help breed some deeper discussion. ",
            "\u00a0A weakness was that the professor sometimes didn't let the students talk as much as he did and seemed a bit full of himself. Some strengths were that the assignments were all really interesting and fun, the book selection was diverse, and class was always entertaining. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- none.\r\nWeaknesses- Class was just a rehashing of the readings, with no particular insight or analysis provided. I found the professor to be entirely demeaning, vaguely racist and sexist. He'd say things like, \"The show Mad Men portrays women as smarter than they are\" or \"People in Africa don't wear shoes. Maybe that's why they're so good at running.\" Phrases like these are entirely inappropriate and add nothing to the course from a substance standpoint. The professor does not allow for room for creativity in his students' ideas and only grades papers well if he agrees with the topic/thesis from the beginning. He calls out students and tries to make them uncomfortable, which again is wildly inappropriate behavior. In the first class, he guilted a girl for owning Louis Vuitton bags. He was entirely condescending, and I dreaded going to class every week just because I did not want to interact with the professor. He also played obvious favorites, at the expense of all the other students. "

        [
            "\u00a0No, If you are a blonde white girl or minority student stay away. On top of being uncomfortable this semester I noticed that the professor ignored other girls, like this one girl and all the latino guys in the class. Overall, I felt scared to express my feelings on how I think associating being blond with being ditsy. He also called on blonde girls first in class which I guess was a perk, but I felt bad for everyone who had their hand up before me. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Amazing class. ",
            "\u00a0I would. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, especially if they like branding and marketing. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Professor Lewis is an engaging professor and the readings are carefully chosen for this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Fun and interesting. The professor facilitated engaging class discussions and conversations on historic and current events that will change your understanding of brands and marketing. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student looking for a fun, not-too-stressful class that exposes them to a very interesting way of looking at the world likely not at the forefront of one's major. The course's teachings are relevant to quite literally everyone's life and to any profession that involves communicating value to other people (every profession). You get out of it what you put into it, however. Only do it if you're willing to really dig deep into each project. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Really fun and engaging class. Easy reading and assignments. ",
            "\u00a0ABSOLUTELY NOT. NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS COURSE. All my friends know the emotional turmoil I went through with this class and I can't imagine they would ever willingly seek out that same fate. This teacher is racist and sexist, and entirely demeaning. I got nothing out of this class, except for learning how to deal with a misogynist man (which is probably actually a useful skill). It was a waste of 2 hours every week, and a Yale credit. I also found the final assignment to just be an excuse to gain insight into a student that a professor shouldn't necessarily have (personal facts about a person, their history, their goals and aspirations), which he passed judgment on. It was merely an excuse to psychoanalyze us. Not appreciated at all. "
