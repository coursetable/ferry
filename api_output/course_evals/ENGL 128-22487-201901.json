            "\u00a0I learned a lot about world literature and topics that come with these works like post-colonial worlds, the topics of language with culture, and aspects of identity. I gained skills when it comes to improving my writing and also looking for interesting topics to talk about in the context of the culture and history of certain countries. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to conduct close-readings and how to think critically about texts. ",
            "\u00a0We learned about the tradition of Anglo-World literature and about how different cultures and historical contexts have influenced what this genre means. ",
            "\u00a0an understanding of global English texts, and how our understanding of English texts are shaped by circulation and other cultural, political, and social factors ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about post colonial literature, and I enjoyed thinking about what it means to write in the English language and why some international texts are circulated and others are not. "

        [
            "\u00a0I think the main strength of the class is that most of the books we read are incredibly unique. Each work is very different, and there's always a lot to talk about with each one. Also they're all very rich and have interesting storylines. I also liked that there were different kind of sections of the class like we'd focus on a different part of the world and also that there was a focus on female authors the latter half of the class as well. I think one of the things I didn't like as much, although I'm not sure it's a weakness rather than just personal preference, was that two of the papers out of the four were just based on close-reading one passage. I usually find it more interesting to just include close-reading in a larger paper on the book as a whole. I think having two of the papers just based on close reading as a bit much, maybe one would be better. ",
            "\u00a0A strength is definitely the in-class time. I felt as though class time was actually spent really engaging with the text -- I always came away feeling like I had a much better understanding of the book we were discussing, as well as post-colonial writing. I did not love all of the texts that we read (I felt that some were a bit boring) but it was still interesting to look at their depth. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths were the assigned readings: we covered a variety of \"postcolonial\" authors and literary styles. We were able to explore a progression in postcolonial storytelling.  Another strength was the class discussions. We were able to really delve into the readings and Professor Mukhopadhyay helped guide discussions so that they always felt productive. There weren't any major weaknesses, but I do wish Professor Mukhopadhyay provided more detailed feedback on our work. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this included the texts on the syllabus and the diversity of authors that we got to read and discuss. The only thing I wish that were different is our preparation for the term paper. ",
            "\u00a0this course did a good job of giving a comprehensive syllabus of many texts; one weakness might be that there were not many contemporary authors available ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the reading list, and I think that the workload was fair for the course. The projects were interesting, like the one where we got to research archival sources in the Beinecke to supplement our analysis. That was the first time I ever did significant research there. However, I think the Indian magazine reading was far too long and should be cut down some. "

            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student because the reading for the class is very different compared to most other courses at Yale. It makes you think in a lot of different ways and showcases how incredible the voices of people from different areas of the world are. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. I really loved the class. I feel like I got to know the professor and the other students, and had really enriching discussions about texts that I would not have read otherwise. ",
            "\u00a0I would! The course is obviously one way to fulfill the prerequisites for the English major, but I'd highly recommend non-prospective English majors to consider taking the course as well. It's so refreshing to learn about authors and texts that originate from outside the Western tradition, and this course gives these texts their proper space and reverence. You learn about how to think about what it means to be \"post-colonial\" and you get introduced to some of the strongest writers today. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, even if you arent required to take this course for the English major, I recommend being well-versed in these texts. Also, take it with Professor Mukhopadhyay if you can! ",
            "\u00a0yes- this course gives students a better understanding of English texts that are not necessarily part of the standard Western canon ",
            "\u00a0Yes! The literature was varied and interesting, and the assignments were refreshing departures from traditional English projects. "
