            "\u00a0I developed writing, listening, reading and speaking skills in Greek. ",
            "\u00a0This course really pushed me to learn Greek in more of an intuitive way. There is a lot of expected participation, especially since it is a relatively small class. I had to learn how to be confused at times and use that confusion to learn new words or be comfortable with not knowing every word being said in class. It is a really engaging and rewarding class, at times the homework was a bit heavy but I definitely feel like I learned a ton. ",

        [
            "\u00a0The book leaves much to be desired. It has no formal vocab tables, so you as a student are responsible for figuring out every single vocab word through context, which is a huge pain, and also makes reviewing and studying unnecessarily difficult. Besides that, however, the course is good. ",
            "\u00a0It was a well structured course with an intense focus on grammar. The course book could be supported with a practice book since tests were mostly based on grammar questions. ",
            "\u00a0I think the professor makes this course really worth it, she's energetic and very engaging. Expect to be actively participating in class almost every day, which can be hard at times because of hoe early the class is but it really does help with your speaking. The only weakness of this course would be the amount of work at times, since we met every day and would have nightly assignments but for most of the semester it was very doable. "

            "\u00a0It depends on the student's expectation. ",
            "\u00a0I would strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a new language or just reconnecting with Greek. I am not of greek heritage but I still had a blast learning throughout the semester, especially in such an intimate setting. ",
