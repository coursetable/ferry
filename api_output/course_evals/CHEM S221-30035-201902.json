            "\u00a0I learned how to conceptually understand the reactivities of different compounds and rationalize the favorability of reactions. I also learned a lot of different organic syntheses and mechanisms that provided me with the toolbox to understand how to synthesize complex products from simpler starting materials. This course covered Chapters 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 in the Loudon Organic Chemistry textbook  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Reactions of Conjugated Systems, Reactions of aromatic compounds (allyl and phenyl), Reactions of vinyl and aryl compounds, Reactions of aldehydes and ketones and their derivatives, Reactions of carboxylic acids, Reactions of carboxylic acid derivatives, Reactions of enols and alpha-beta unsaturated compounds and Reactions of amines.

            "\u00a0I found it challenging to keep up with the pace of the course, but I had expected this due to the sheer pace of a Orgo II class that covers all the material in 5 weeks. I think Dr. Parr did a great job providing us with a strong understanding of the material in such a short period of time. I also appreciated how available he was throughout the summer to answer all of our questions. ",
