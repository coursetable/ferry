            "\u00a0This was the first art class I've taken since I was in elementary school. I learned a lot about how to use the machines in the shop, and had an opportunity to think and make work that wasn't just the usual readings and papers. I learned how an art critique works, and learned more about how to look at/critique/appreciate sculpture. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a better understanding of the ways wood functions as a material and the ways it can be manipulated to create different meanings or moods. We also thought deeply in this class about the role of material objects in our lives and the meaning of our relationship to prothstetics, etc. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use all of the wood shop tools quite well actually.  Got experience using a variety of techniques, tools, and also learned different way to join and bind.  Also learned about different types of wood and how different artists use wood. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the qualities of wood and the many difficulties one faces when working with this medium. We started making our own sculptures early on in the semester which forced us to really become acquainted with the tools and shop and experimenting. There were many hurdles because there aren't prescribed techniques for every thing you want to do, so a lot of it was compromising and trying out lots of methods. ",
            "\u00a0I learned all about the machinery in the wood shop. I learned the level of difficulty and patience it takes into creating a wooden sculpture out of a plank of wood, or sheet of ply wood. I learned the various creative and problem solving techniques of error and correction. This class has taught me how to appreciate wooden designs, sculpture and architect. "

            "\u00a0This course allows students to jump in right away and use the tools to make stuff. It's a very hands-on course, with most class time and most assignments dedicated to making work. \r\nThe downside was that it was clear this class was not a high priority for Elizabeth, or for the rest of the students. A lot of people didn't show up to class and didn't finish assignments in time for crits. It seemed like a really casual class, which made it seem like the students didn't have to work very hard. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed the balance of instruction and shop time, as well as the various workshops that were held during class time throughout the semester. The class period is long enough (like most art classes) that you were able to get into a groove in the shopElizabeth and Petra were always helpful with projects and troubleshooting, as are the shop monitors who work there. ",
            "\u00a0I really liked the assignments in this course. They were a perfect balance of general so there were diverse results from the prompts, but also specific enough that forced us to really think and consider our projects. I also liked the discussions regarding the readings and artists given as references. The basket weaving and carving workshops were extremely interesting. There was definitely a lack of structure in the course, which resulted in varied levels of effort, but for the people really invested, it was a very fulfilling class. "

            "\u00a0I would! It's always good for non-artists to take art classes, as it allows you to think more creatively and to make work that requires really different skills/labor. It was cool for me as a non-artist to meet other art majors too -- their advanced level pushed me to think harder about what I was making and I learned a lot from them when they shared their ideas and work in class. ",
            "\u00a0If you have a chance to take Wood Sculpture with Elizabeth, absolutely do it. I gained so much from the ways this class asks you to think about materiality and our relationships to objects. I primarily do writing work at school, so the chance to step away from that and into a more embodied way of engaging with the world was essential to me this semester. Focusing on a single material, wood, doesn't feel like a limitation but a useful springboard for every project you start. You'll begin to notice things around you differently, inside and out of the shop. Elizabeth is also a wonderful instructor. They are kind but will hold you to a high standard and are very encouraging of beginners like me to think through projects in manageable but still meaningful ways. ",
            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend.  I feel very proficient in the wood shop now which is very exciting for me.  Projects are very fun and designed to facilitate learning.  Also fun to learn about different artists. ",
            "\u00a0Yes I would definitely recommend this course because it is provides skills and resources that you most likely wont have access to outside of college. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely reccomend this course t another student. This class taught me useful life skills that will be taken with me throughout my life. "
