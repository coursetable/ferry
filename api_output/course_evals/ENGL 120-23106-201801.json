            "\u00a0A plethora of writing techniques. My writing has definitely grown through the many new tools I have learned, the ones I have been using but have refined ",
            "\u00a0How to create vivid, relatable artifacts and subjects within essays that truly provide meaning. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to root my writing in more concrete details to make sure I connect with an audience more while also using symbolism and other literary techniques. ",
            "\u00a0I developed my creative nonfiction writing through reading the work of professionals and my peers. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a more active writer as well as writing with a clear point. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to write more clearly, and effectively, with readers in mind. I learned how to use details, reader positioning, rule of 3's ect. to make my setting, humor, and story telling more effective. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to effectively use different techniques in personal essays and how to critique my own writing as well as others'. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to analyze the craft of creative nonfiction by reading from a diverse array of accomplished authors, identifying techniques that they use in their work (and feeling empowered to evaluate to what extent they work well), and applying these in my own work, a portfolio of five short(ish) essays. This is the basic structure of English120learn to write by reading, and consistent writing (a first draft and a rewrite after comments from Pam/a peer workshop once during the semester). I think one of the skills I learned that is less widely recognized is commenting on your peers writingfor each unit, we left short (150 words- a page) comments on 3-4 of our classmates writing. I loved the challenge of reading a rough piece, having a reaction to it, and then synthesizing and smoothing out my reflections and advice; over the course of the semester I became a lot quicker at this and also a lot better at seeing places for improvement and specific revisions (which I expect will be a very useful skill!). In general, I gained an appreciation for the rich, diverse tradition of creative nonfiction and techniques that work particularly well for different forms.\r\nAlso, my general writing improved a lot, especially my clarity. Creative nonfiction surprised me by offering challenges distinctive from those of academic writingin this class, you need to work to position your reader, use precise language, and build a clear idea of person/place/point without in conclusion, secondly, therefore, or any of the easy markers of academic narrative structure. I gained a lot more appreciation for authorial control and implicit structure as a result! ",
            "\u00a0I loved learning how to \"read for craft.\" It made me appreciate writing in a different way than I had before. It also helped me look at my own writing more intentionally. You also write a lot in this class, which made me feel like I had lots of chances to employ the techniques I was learning. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely developed a greater awareness of how modern essayists structure their pieces and engage their readers. I think I also learned more about the world and how to think about it through the works of great thinkers/writers of our time. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about a bunch of writer moves (like Didion details, reader positioning, etc.) which I now consciously use in my writing. I practiced reading criticially both for the writer's point and techniques. In working on my own creative nonfiction writing, I learned how to write more clearly and with specificity. "

            "\u00a0overall very strong. The one improvement I could think of would be to give us topics to look for in the pieces we read for homework. For each class we have a couple pieces to read. A big focus of the class is \"reading for craft\" were we look for techniques used by the professional writers to then try to use in our pieces, but looking for specific ones can be very challenging. For example, in class we'd then go over a piece looking for a specific tool such as \"push and pull\" or \"authority moves.\" If we knew before going in that a piece was a good example of a writing technique, it would be more beneficial to know that before hand so we can look for it and see it in action when we read for homework, not just when we go over it during class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Readings were interesting and topics were flexible and purposefully vague (enabling students to select their topics more widely).\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Class was somewhat tedious. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are the readings and discussion provoked by them as well as the writing prompts. Weaknesses are in the lack of association of grades with anything other than the five essays. ",
            "\u00a0The course meeting time should be extended because of how much material there is to cover. ",
            "\u00a0The small class size is greatindividual attention is definitely necessary for this class. The pace is good as well. ",
            "\u00a0-Strengths, readings are great and cover diverse set of experiences, opinions, and ideas.\r\n\r\n-potentially a better way of making sure that all the reading are discussed, but I don't think that there is an ideal solution\r\n-choosing  some readings that are shorter in length, that give us a better picture of what we should be aiming to accomplish in one of our own pieces. Having so many long readings, especially initially, made me feel too ambitious about the number of themes and techniques I could explore in the word limit. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very well structured. There was a perfect balance between reading essays by published writers and then writing our own essays based on the techniques we learned. The workshopping portion of the course was also very effective and helped me learn how to critique others' as well as my own writing. ",
            "\u00a0Strengthsthe basic structure (seminar discussion, peer workshops, and diverse readings centered around five basic units that each culminate with two drafts of an essay) was extremely engaging and effective in supporting my learning. It combines learning from the greats, practice by doing, and practice by teaching/helping each other. This class (especially if you take it with Pam, and if you get a good group of students) is also really enjoyable. I looked forward to coming to class each Tuesday and Thursday. Although the writing can become time-consuming if you get really invested in it, I think in general this is a rare example of a class at Yale that has a manageable workload, is fun, and really useful in terms of your learning/growth/skills.\r\n\r\nWeaknessesnot many! I do wish we had managed to sustain more organic student-student discussion instead of falling back into hand raising, teacher-student. Also, writing concise, short essays (1200-1500 words) is a great skill, but the word limit was often frustrating because most of the example essays we read were much longer; Pam said that it was hard to find exemplar essays of the Engl120 length, which I get, but it would be cool to be able to write one longer essay during the class (that said, that would be a lot of grading, and I wouldnt want to lose any of Pams amazing thoroughness in feedback) ",
            "\u00a0The class discussion was great. Pam was great at guiding discussions to help us really focus in and articulate what we thought or observed about the writing. Also, I really enjoyed how we read lots of different types of non-fiction essays. It never felt like we were just reading high-brow stuff from white men, but we also did read some essays by classic writers. ",
            "\u00a0A lot of reading from a wide variety of topics and writers was great in getting a comprehensive survey of the essay world. A lot of opportunities to speak. Could be improved by decreasing the rigidity of the essay prompts, making expectations a bit less narrow. I didn't like the tight restriction on word limit in my class, although it's an understandable constraint to have in place. ",
            "\u00a0Discussions in this class are engaging, readings are awesome, and essays are manageable. Loved this course and my professor. I think that this is the single class I learned the most from this year because I received so much detailed and individualized feedback on my essays. My writing significantly improved over the course of the semester. "

            "\u00a0absolutely 10/10 will improve all around writing skills way more than you would expect from a 3 1/2 or 4 month course ",
            "\u00a0It depends on whether the student intends to pursue a career within this field. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - if you genuinely want to improve personal essay writing skills, this is the best course. In analyzing the best writers and getting fantastic perspectives on your writing, theres so much to learn. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I think it is a great style of writing to learn as well as a break from literary writing and writing analytically about novels. ",
            "\u00a0Yes i would. Its a good foundational writing class. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is a wonderful class for anyone looking to fulfill a writing credit. It is a reflective, engaging experience. You will learn how to write more effectively about your own experiences and opinions. The course load is significant compared to other writing credits, but it is a fulfilling experience. One of my top classes at Yale after 8 semesters. ",
            "\u00a0It's an amazing course! It will give you the opportunity to reflect and learn a lot about yourself as a writer. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a course that I think every Yale student should takeits a great seminar,  so helpful for a writer, and introduces you to a lot of great writers, both contemporary and giants from the creative nonfiction tradition. And you should definitely take it with Pam! She is so nice, extremely articulate/thorough/helpful in her feedback, extremely supportive of her students and publication opportunities, and I loved her rendition of the Engl120 course. It seems that the Engl120 course is uniformly great, but you should be aware that each professor may have slightly different units and different readings. In Pams class we did Personal Essay, then Place, then Profile, then Cultural Criticism (with a mini-unit on the arts, which Pam worked in herself), then Humor (a short unit). Some of my favorite essays in this class were by James Baldwin, Mark Sundeen, Ian Frazier, and Joan Didion. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone looking to read a lot of interesting works. I didn't feel like my writing improved a lot, but I feel like I got the skills to recognize good writing that I can use to help myself in the future. ",
            "\u00a0English 120 is amazing for anyone who really enjoys reading essays. Try reading a few of the popular writers online; if you like them, chances are you're going to love doing the readings for this class. Writing about yourself provides a great opportunity for reflection, too. ",
            "\u00a0TAKE THIS COURSE. Everyone in my class seemed engaged, had fun, and learned something. I've taken English courses in high school and practiced reading material for the writer's point and strategies, but never like this before. We really break down the writing techniques that make a piece effective and then apply then to our own writing. This process totally works, and it works because engagement with other students and the professor (through class discussions and essay feedback) are super high. "
