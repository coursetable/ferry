            "\u00a0I have become a better public speaker as well as a more discerning listener ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me how to criticize public speaking as well as how to speak to large groups. I learnt how to calm my nerves, but more importantly how to engage with a room and capture its attention for a brief period of time. The peer feedback was critical but always honest. I feel more prepared to go into any field where addressing large groups is important. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about public speaking ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to be a better public speaker. Here, we stressed annunciation, voice modulation, poise, gesture, rhetorical tools, and arrangement of words. All of these things will stick with me long after I move on from Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Public Speaking skills, speech writing. ",
            "\u00a0No course could be more valuable to a current Yale education. The benefits and insights are innumerable, but chief among them are as follows: 1.) the opportunity to carefully study the practice of persuasion and compelling storytelling, 2.) the ability to connect personally with an audience or fellow peers, 3.) invaluable exercises in speech craft from invention to delivery, 4.) studying the techniques and theories of performative addresses, 5.) heightened awareness of everyday communication and talking mechanisms, and 6.) engagement in civil discourse that advances ideas and powerful debates. BUT, the finest aspect might be the rare and deeply meaningful opportunity to listen to your peers most illuminating thoughts eloquently expressed every seminar meeting on a variety of topics. These are the kinds of discussions (from personal revelations to contemporary issues) that we should, no must, be having on Yale's campus. A course like Eloquence is a reason to attend Yale. "

            "\u00a0The course provided the opportunity to get high quality feedback from a group of very committed students as well as one of the most passionate instructors and human beings you will ever meet, Professor Roach \r\nAt times I wished there was more attention to the theoretical aspects of public speaking, though Prof. Roach had a knack for distilling the key ideas into succinct, bite-sized chunks ",
            "\u00a0I think the seminar portion of the class can be entirely done away with. My greatest learning from this class always happened during the speech sections that we did in the Chapter Room; and the seminars, although good, aren't as interesting or thought provoking as the speeches. ",
            "\u00a0This course was the highest incarnation of a Yale seminar-- no improvements could possibly be necessary. Appropriately, the course ascended to a pinnacle in the final semester of its offering. "

            "\u00a0Yes, definitely take it if you want to improve your public speaking skills very much neglected at Yale College! ",
            "\u00a0Yes absolutely! It's such an important skill and nothing is more worthwhile. You'll learn a TON ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Becoming more comfortable speaking in front of a group is an invaluable skill for anybody, regardless of their major. Throughout the semester, you really get to learn more about your fellow classmates as well. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah it is so fun, and you become close to the other students in the class :') ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. \r\n\r\nOne of the best classes ever. You will not regret it. ",
            "\u00a0To my fellow students: this has been to-date the finest course I have taken at Yale. I will keep this note brief, as I understand this to be Professor Roach's final semester teaching Eloquence. However, if by some whim of fate, you do see Eloquence appear in the Blue Book... fight tooth and nail to join, commit to the thrilling practice of eloquence, and learn as much as you possibly can from inspiring peers and brilliant Professor Roach.
