            "\u00a0The ability to technically operate a camera, to \"see\" through the perspective of a photographer, and to discuss photography as an art. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to use my camera! And a lot about the history of cameras! ",
            "\u00a0Developed a critical eye for critiquing and developing digital photographs ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to operate my DSLR manually, adjusting shutter speed, ISO, and aperture to create high-quality images. I also was connected to a lot of different photographic traditions/histories and learned about the portfolios, visual languages, and shooting styles of many talented photographers. Finally, I learned a lot about my own visual style and how to productively grow and develop my image-making. ",
            "\u00a0Understand how to use digital camera, print, and use photoshop ",
            "\u00a0I gained a new perspective on artistic expression through this class. Creating art, while perhaps still difficult for me, was a terrific way to be adventurous in the classroom. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: I liked the informal, but enthused class dynamic and felt like I grew a lot in my ability to take photographs and make prints.\r\nWeaknesses: A bit of disconnect between written assignments and photographic assignments. Wish that we had more crits with fewer images in each crit (we ended up combining two crits at the beginning due to timing issues). ",
            "\u00a0strengths: artistic freedom, good and evenly spaced assignments\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes difficult to navigate technology. Maybe create certain handouts/cheatsheets for photoshop and printing processes instead of a verbal explanation that is more elusive ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course are the subject matters. Photography itself was something I had little experience with previously, so gaining a foothold in that was very special. ",
