            "\u00a0I would NOT recommend taking this course unless you are really into the field of microbiology or are pre-med/pre-vet and are required to take microbiology lab.\r\nWhile the material the course includes is interesting at times (especially doing tests to identify which bacteria live in soil outside SCL, meat you buy at the grocery stores, your own gut, etc) and Dr. Dawson's personal passion to the study of microbiology is obvious, I felt there were severe structural weaknesses to the class:\r\nLab manual pages that are provided through canvas were consistently vague and unclear (which can really be rather dangerous considering the chemicals, flames, and potentially pathogenic bacteria we are working with). Not to mention all the \"See Figure X\" or \"Refer to page X in the lab book\" cues in the lab manual pages on Canvas referenced an older edition and were therefore effectively worthless. It made preparing for lab every week unnecessarily more difficult. Even TAs at times could not decipher what the procedure for a lab was supposed to be. \r\nFinding materials in the lab was always confusing, as drawers and stock bottles are sometimes mislabelled, not labelled at all, illegible, or even spelled incorrectly. Furthermore there was often not enough materials - e.g. only every other student having a dissecting microscope, waiting in a line with your slides because there are only two (sometimes just 1 is open) phase contrast microscopes for a class of 12, waiting for someone to finish using only a few gram stain setups (even fewer for other stains).\r\nMaterial covered in the labs often preceded when it was introduced in microbiology class (required to take the lab), effectively teaching us the importance and applications of certain techniques and procedures AFTER when we could have understood them in a practical setting like the lab. There was also little or no camaraderie between classmates (except for occasional work with your all-semester next-door neighbor), and the TAs or professor did nothing to inspire the sense of working as a team that is imperative for any research or professional work - no \"everyone say your name and introduce yourself\" at the beginning of the semester, no switching lab partners, very little group work. MCDB 291 has some of Yale's best future scientists, biologists, thinkers, etc from all four class years, and I was really disappointed that the way class was structured denied us the opportunity to work together and learn from each other and build connections.\r\nLab reports and quizzes were a whole other headache. Lab report descriptions were even more vague than the manual pages, and one's success in the reports was contingent on writing in the scientific style. I understood this demand to be especially discouraging and unfair to the minority freshmen/sophomores in the class who have little or no experience with the \"Intro Results Discussion\" format compared to juniors/seniors, especially when MCDB 291 is advertised to freshmen/sophomores who have either placed out of Bio 103 or are looking for their first upper-level lab course. TAs were the only ones who graded the reports, and their definitions of Intro, Results, and Discussion changed every lab report. It was very hard to improve your grades after each report since your TA who graded it often left minimal, vague comments that did not disclose exactly what parts of your report caused you to lose x amount of points - just some comments and a number at the top of the page. Once I even had to email my TA to find out what may grade was, what comments he/she had for me, if he/she had even graded my report yet, and the response I recieved was given days later, less than two hours before the next report was due. It was clear from the comments and point tallies left on the reports and quizzes that they were graded according to a verbatim rubric, yet hardly any of what was expected from your submissions and answers was disclosed to the students; work was a guessing game.
