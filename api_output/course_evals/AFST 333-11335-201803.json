            "\u00a0Some effects of colonialism on Africa, how the United States and Western European nations are complicit, some really cool history ",
            "\u00a0This class served as a great introduction to postcolonial African literature and presented really interesting commentary on contemporary and historical developments on the continent. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so, so much - about African encounters with colonialisms, but also about how to think about Western conceptions of Africa, how to think about history itself, how to read novels for historical evidence. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely incredible. Professor Magaziner is an incredible professor who taught primarily in terms of the themes of the history of the colonial encounter in Africa, and who gave such important detail and focus to all of his subjects and lectures. Reading novels for the course also encouraged me to think about the way that non-fictional realities and historical events inspire fictional books. The creative assignment at the end of the semester also gave me some practice in how to apply these concepts, when I, too, had the opportunity to write fiction based on the histories we learned about in our class. ",
            "\u00a0Great first history class and introduction to African literature. ",
            "\u00a0First of all  a LOT. It's hard to explain exactly what, since we covered so much. One thing that I think is the good marker of what I learned: when people now say something messed up about Africa or its history, I can explain why it's messed up, how the messed up idea came to be, and why, depending on what the topics is, we ourselves might have some burden to bear. Preferably I'd do this to their face. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a lot about colonial and post-colonial Africa ",
            "\u00a0This has been the best class I've taken at Yale so far (I'm a junior). Beautifully organized, brilliantly taught, I can only sing its praises. I learned about a wide swath of African history, with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Reading fiction instead of dry history articles made this a unique experience, and was ultimately successful, in my opinion, in preserving \"the human element that is the heart of history.\" In the future, when I think back on my time at Yale, on why it was worthwhile, I believe this class will be one of the first things that comes to mind. ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the history of Africa, really from colonialism onward (although there was a lecture or two that had an overview of earlier history too), which of course covered a huge variety of topics (culture, wars, international relations, development programs, decolonization, so much more). It was a good introduction to historical analysis and reading literature as historical documents. ",
            "\u00a0I gained great insight into the politics of the African continent in relation to the previous European colonizers, in relation to the pre-existing societies present on the African continent before colonialism, and also in relation to other countries around the world. ",
            "\u00a0Learned about different experiences, struggles, and resilience of African countries ",
            "\u00a0We covered 'African' histories from pre-colonial to post-colonial times, not exhaustively, but more or less chronologically and thematically. ",
            "\u00a0The history of colonialism in several different African countries, as well as the post-colonial aftermath and development of nationalist movements/backlash and how this relates to modern-day conceptions of development and human rights. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so so much. This course really changed my perspective on how the world works. Specifically I learned how to use nonfiction lectures and fiction literature in conjunction to write a history paper. ",
            "\u00a0This class was a great way to learn about the merits and challenges of using fiction as historiography. ",
            "\u00a0It is a class that teaches you very valuable questions. It is the perfect mix of knowledge and morality. ",
            "\u00a0I learned to fight many of the stereotypes I had about Africa. Also, this class helped me learn and analyze thematically instead of chronologically, which was how I previously thought about history. Finally, I learned how to use novels as historical documents. ",
            "\u00a0Broad overview of a sliver of African history (does that make sense?) In terms of skills  reading fiction for historicity (is that even a word?) ",
            "\u00a0Each lecture was a fascinating vignette about the pre/post/colonial history of different parts of Africa. Learned to reject the \"single story.\" ",
            "\u00a0This course offers an important perspective on centuries of nuanced culture and history. ",
            "\u00a0This class was exceptional.  I gained a thorough knowledge of sub-Saharan African colonial history. Additionally, I learned how to write a history paper. ",
            "\u00a0Overview of major themes in pre/postcolonial African state building, with an emphasis on the role of religion, agriculture, and colonial governance structures and postcolonial governments. Strong introduction to analyzing novels as primary and secondary historical sources. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much about African interaction and response to colonial powers. The class focuses mostly on intellectual history, which was a new way of approaching the subject for me. ",
            "\u00a0A true appreciation for the complexity of Africas history and how this history still effects the continent today. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about various countries in Africa and their histories under and after colonialism that I didn't know prior to taking this class. I learned how much there still is for me to learn! ",
            "\u00a0Critical thinking, empathy, and thoughtful writing. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to evaluate novels as historical sources and I learned about many different countries' histories in Africa. ",
            "\u00a0Good survey course of the history of peoples in Africa. ",
            "\u00a0A survey class beginning right before the \"scramble for Africa\" and ending in modern times- how people all over the continent experienced and reacted to colonialism and it's legacies over this time period. ",
            "\u00a0Often it feels like Professor Magaziner is on a serious decolonization mission, and, mostly, it is much appreciated. ",
            "\u00a0This class allowed me to reflect on how knowledge is consumed in history, and what constitutes a historical source. I actually think this class helped me develop deeper empathy through the reading of fiction, and showed me how systemic processes like colonialism don't just exist through political and social disruptures to society but actually shape modes of thought and experience that are somewhat indescribable in traditional forms of history, like ways of being, intergenerational connections, time and hope for the future. ",
            "\u00a0First and foremost, this class teaches how to analyze changes over time, and if these changes are really possible, significant, or permanent. Other history classes attempt to teach this as well, but African colonialism is an amazing and interesting point from which to attack this question. I learned how to analyze history through literature and analyze novels in a way that I hadn't before. This class also places African colonialism in a light very different from that of other history classes, placing emphasis on the culture, religion, and customs of African societies that other classes don't address. This class also taught me to better manage my reading, since it was very hard to participate in section if you hadn't done it and there was a novel of reading a week in addition to the papers and weekly discussion questions. ",
            "\u00a0I have been waiting to take this class ever since my first-year at Yale and its safe to say that it truly was worth it. Professor Magaziner is one of the most engaging lecturers I have ever been taught by but more than that, he is one of the few faculty at Yale that, simply through his lectures, shows you there is no one way to think or talk about Africa. Personally I think this is a class that everyone should take at some point in their Yale career because it is not just about Africa and all of its complexities but about Africa's role in the world and the world's role in Africa. This class has me approaching conversations about the place of the continent--past, present and future--in such a novel way with the understanding that no one experience, no one lifetime really, can represent what Africa has been, is and will be about. Take this class if you're ready to engage with that reality. 100% take it if you have even a slight interest in the African continent and its relationship to the world writ large. Do not take it if you're simply looking to learn about South Africa. You will be thoroughly disappointed. ",
            "\u00a0Learnt a lot about the history and impact of colonialism in Africa, but also how its legacy still affects the world we live in today. Challenged preconceived notions about Africa, the danger of single narratives, and how African countries differ in history, culture and outlook. ",
            "\u00a0I learned so much in this class about a history that I didn't really know anything about before. If you want a very clear-cut, traditional history class, this is not it. While we did learn history, I felt like the course was not about learning facts. Rather, it felt like an introduction to the world of African history, focusing on ideas and trends rather than getting caught up in the details. This course both expanded my knowledge and reframed how I think about African history and history more generally. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful history of colonialism in Africa and how that interacts with modern politics, development trajectories, etc!! ",
            "\u00a0I have never imagined fiction could be a useful tool in understanding the past, but in reading the literature, I realized that it could be an incredibly powerful tool for reconstructing narratives and acknowledging our inability to ever fully know any one history or culture. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me a thorough, nuanced survey of the period of colonialism throughout Africa. I learned about the political, economic, and social changes that occurred as a result of foreign intervention. I also learned how to utilize fiction as a historical source. ",
            "\u00a0great survey course of african history.\r\nas always, Magaziner taught us that history is alive. ",
            "\u00a0How to approach novels as historical sources and integrate fiction texts into the scholarship of history; a nuanced approach to African history that challenges simplified narratives; a broad understanding of the course of African history ",
            "\u00a0Began to gain a broad understanding of the history of processes of colonialism and decolonization across much of the African continent. ",
            "\u00a0using literature to approach history. narrating history. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to begin to engage with African history, and how to study colonialism and post-colonialism from African perspectives. ",
            "\u00a0I can't really begin to describe the knowledge that I gained by taking this course - there's simply too much to effectively summarize. But one thing I certainly did learn is that I have barely scratched the sruface when it comes to the history of Africa. Along the way to this discovery, I learned so much history, but I also learned about empathy, socially and temporally informed perspectives, seeing two sides of an issue, synthesizing a view of modernity with an eye to the past, and more. I developed my understanding of the discipline of history itself and its extreme complexity and near impossibility. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: D Mags is incredible. Every lecture it feels like he's just there telling you a story. He doesn't look at notes; he doesn't have bulletpoints on his powerpoints, but it is so engaging. The readings for this class are all fiction novels, which is really interesting. It makes it much harder to write a history paper, but most of the books are genuinely enjoyable to read and to discuss in section.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: This is not a comprehensive course. You won't learn about every country, and you won't learn every story. It's impossible. You will only be getting part of the picture. But that part is so important. ",
            "\u00a0This class is *almost* outstanding, but a few hurdles have made it a bit frustrating. The readings are fascinating, the lectures were eye-opening, and the workload was on the whole not that bad. However, the lectures and readings widely diverged and the paper instructions were vague and still kinda unclear. While the mandatory readings are completely based on novels, the lectures are largely historiography and argumentative without supplying enough hard historical information to ground the analysis. \r\n\r\nThen the papers -- first, the flexible structure of grading and high weight on participation means you really won't know if you're passing or failing this class until pretty close to the end. Second, contrary to the course's foundation on novels, you are expected to completely ignore literary interpretation and treat the required readings as primary sources. This means that although the novels are 100% of the readings for the class, they will form about 25% of the material for your papers and be used with complete rejection of their literary value. The combined constraints of using the novels only historically and not being allowed to use material outside of the syllabus means that your paper thesis is pretty much limited to restating or adding some new twist on an argument already made by Magaziner in class or implicitly with his selection of the syllabus readings. Long story short, this class is really great and enjoyable, but with a few adjustments to the continuity of material and assignment structure, it could be transformed into something exceptional. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Magaziner gave perhaps the best lectures I have ever had at Yale. Every single class, the content and delivery were brilliant, provocative, and haunting. It is also so fun to read and discuss novels every week. For me, it almost felt like we didn't even have homework, as reading the fiction was so enjoyable. My TA was also incredible - and section discussions were great.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Having to write the papers. Writing two 10-12 page papers is pretty unpleasant as the assignment is both unusual and difficult. Everyone in the class seemed to really struggle with this. I would suggest instead writing a few shorter response papers, instead of two 10-12 page papers putting 2-3 novels into conversation with one another. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible because of the focus that Professor Magaziner gives to his historical subjects, as well as the amount of detail that we were able to cover in the semester. I also really do think that one of the strengths of the course is the reading of novels for every section. I had never thought about this method as being a way to learn and understand history, but it became abundantly clear to me as every novel tied so well into the themes Professor Magaziner was discussing for each week. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Magaziner's very engaging lecture style. ",
            "\u00a0I think there needs to be a more traditional secondary text to go along with the lecture so that the lectures and novels can be supplemented by facts. I often felt that I didn't know which country or time period we were talking about. I think it is fair to assume that many students coming into this intro lecture course know very little about the historical context of Africa as a whole and therefore it would be helpful to have another text that would ground the course, perhaps in exchange for a few of the novels. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great class. It's rare to find a survey history course that doesn't substitute breadth for nuance. Magaziner achieved this (as in, he didn't sub breadth for nuance). ",
            "\u00a0This class is one of the strongest courses I have had the privilege of taking. What really made the course were Professor Magaziner's lectures. Beautifully organized, every lecture was a well-crafted story that balanced anecdotal evidence with deeper themes and trends that spoke to the legacy of colonialism on the African continent. The only weakness was that the workload was a bit heavy with the novel per week structure. I can't imagine excluding any of these, but perhaps briefly mentioning the place of the novel within the context of the material/why it was chosen could be helpful in lecture. The discussion questions were great too, maybe sending these out a little earlier would be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0Interesting lectures. I liked that the course was taught through fiction as well ",
            "\u00a0I wish that the midterm essay had had more direction. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are incredibly engaging: they are full of information, images, music, etc, and Professor Magaziner's execution is simply flawless. He is so very articulate, thoughtful, and well-spoken that I actively looked forward to lectures. (Beginning each lecture with music from a different African country is an added plus!) They are extremely interesting and, for me, eye-opening. The readings are a joy (fiction!) and section discussions were also thought-provoking. Truly, this course filled a huge gap in my understanding of, frankly, the world, which had a woeful lack of Africa and African history, as well as colonization/decolonization. It has changed the way I think about colonialism, countries in Africa, current political/humanitarian issues, etc. The only weakness that comes to mind is very tiny, which is that it was not so clear which weeks/books/papers were allowed for each project, and when it came time to work on papers, it was difficult to line up the supplemental reading for each week with that week's lecture numbers/books. Maybe there is a more unified way of organizing everything? ",
            "\u00a0It was a balance between the overall perceptions, which were received mainly through the novels, and also the historical debates, which were received in the substantive readings. I think the course was strong in that lectures complemented the substantive readings as well as the novels, which worked together for the purpose of having a better understanding of material when the time came to write papers. ",
            "\u00a0Great course--thoroughly enjoyed all of the wonderful novels that we read during class. Professor Magaziner is probably the best speaker I have ever had the chance to listen to, so coming to class everyday was a treat. ",
            "\u00a0Dan is an amazing lecturer and puts a lot of work into planning his classes and pushing us to think critically. TA Sam is also an excellent section leader and gives great feedback for the papers. The idea of reading fiction novels was also interesting, and while I am grateful to have the opportunity to read the literature we were given, I would have enjoyed a few more readings from scholarship. The course at times, especially during section and the assignments, often felt like more of a literature course. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly would not change a thing. Well-structured semester-wise both in terms of lecture coverage and assignments. Fantastic lectures. Interesting papers. One of the most intellectually rigorous and exploratory courses I've taken and among my favorite at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Magaziner is a huge strength. He is an amazing lecturer. One weakness is the structure of assignments: Its only two 10-page papers the entire term, and almost half of our grade is based on section participation. I think I would retained all the wonderful material we learn in lecture better if there had been only one or two short papers as well as a midterm and final exam. ",
            "\u00a0The history given in lectures was phenomenally well put together, but it was not especially well connected with the novels we read each week. That being said, the section discussions of the novels were phenomenal. ",
            "\u00a0Wonderful lectures that keep you engaged with ease and I really enjoyed the sections. Some people were frustrated with reading novels historically but I thought, done in tandem with the lectures, it was great. ",
            "\u00a0Amazing everything! A fantastic history course. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are easy to follow and presented in a very compelling way. Further, reading historical fiction/novels for the required readings was a very unique aspect of this course, but it would have been more helpful if there was more of a direct correlation between the novels and the lectures. For example, integrating the novels into the lecture would have helped me understand both aspects more fully. Additionally, the option to do a creative project for the final paper was one of my favorite parts of the class. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of work, you've got heavy readings every week -- a lot of which are not super easy to understand. The discussions around the readings and the lectures themselves are super interesting, but definitely be prepared for a LOT of reading during the week ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Magaziner, TFs (speaking for Sam Severson here), LECTURES (are incredible), material\r\nWeaknesses: Some of the novels are great works of literature, others are not, particularly. It was very clear in section when a novel had grabbed the group, and conversely very clear when a novel had been painfully dry or obtuse. There is of course the issue of teaching a class which has as one of its main themes \"the danger of the single story\"  but the class is a lecture on \"African history.\" You will have to make broad generalizations in your papers because of the closed archive. I think Magaziner and the TFs (or at least Sam) navigate this well, but it's something to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nStrengths far outweigh weaknesses take this class! ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps a somewhat more linear chronological organization? And maybe a few examples of the creative submission from the past year's final? But Professor Magaziner's class was superb, I wouldn't suggest many alterations to his course design. ",
            "\u00a0The closed archive for essays is strange and restrictive.  The ability to research outside of a select number of novels and articles would provide students with an ability to learn more and participate more in our own educational process. ",
            "\u00a0Weaknesses: the papers were frustrating, as we didnt have much to work with in terms of historical sources. And I say this as an english major. \r\n\r\nBut it is such a good class! Wow! The lectures will widen your worldview and knowledge every time. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely knowledgeable and engaging professor and TFs, use of novels as primary course texts, well-organized and engaging lectures, reasonable (albeit occasionally high) workload, interesting course assignments (especially freedom with the creative option for the second paper).\r\nWeaknesses: could have used an occasional secondary source assignment specific to the particular novel for the week (sometimes novels were based on periods/countries not covered in lectures which made finding connections in papers to be difficult). ",
            "\u00a0I really loved lecture but often times didnt really understand the readings or how I was supposed to connect them to the information covered in class. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Magaziner is incredible, every minute of his lecture is fascinating. Reading novels for a history class was thoroughly enjoyable. Cant think of anything negative ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and course materials for this course were amazing. Each lecture pushed students to think beyond the initial historical conceptions to consider all sides of the issues (well--not all sides I guess that's pretty hard, but more sides than usually are focused on). I honestly wanted more time to go over lecture material because there were no exams and sections focused on the books, but I think having papers instead of exams also allowed me to listen in a different way in class. Overall really incredible class! ",
            "\u00a0This course was great! Lectures were super interesting and the readings were fantastic. Would have maybe liked a little more feedback throughout. ",
            "\u00a0Love the novel format ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were the best ones I have had in my time at Yale so far. Using novels as our historical resources was a useful and interesting approach but a little difficult at times simply because it is not something I had ever done before. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great novels and interesting lectures. Fun assignments and section was engaging. Weaknesses: We weren't tested on what we learned in lecture so not all knowledge was retained. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures and section were both great, but I felt that they werent really that connected, and the information from lecture wasnt reinforced as much as I wouldve liked. ",
            "\u00a0This class was wonderful! Lectures were thought provoking, readings were engaging, and section was probably the best run section for a humanities class I've ever had. The only things I would suggest for improvement (and these are small) would be to consistently put names of people and places on the slides during lecture to facilitate note taking (names were on the lecture outlines but sometimes took a second for me to go find them in the terms list and lecture moved fast), and to maybe split one of the longer novels over two weeks and eliminate King Solomon's mines from the reading list. ",
            "\u00a0While the fiction novels were by and large fantastic, I feel this course would be improved by including some reading of historical literature on colonialism. Especially when covering the postcolonial period, the books felt like they pigeon-holed conversation in section, and focused on minute aspects of that mentioned in lecture. Also, I think a theme Professor Magaziner could consider for a lecture in future renditions of this course is the role of Diaspora in African histories. ",
            "\u00a0I thought a strength was the level of creativity and freedom we had in the course, partly facilitated through the selection of fiction novels, and especially in the last project. I enjoyed writing a creative project, and it actually pushed me to think more analytically and reflectively of class content and themes as a whole than a traditional history paper. I thought there was less focus on actually retaining the material of the lectures, and at times it was challenging to connect the novels directly to the lectures, although that also served as a reminder that there are many different voices in history and they can't be synthesized into a neat storyline. I did hope to have more primary sources that were more directly related to the lectures, or perhaps a quiz/review of the lecture material as one option for the first project, just because it would be helpful to have the chance to discuss the material presented in lecture. ",
            "\u00a0This class could have had more assignments that would allow you to draw more from the different novels, since I felt like I was only able to use a few of them in my writing despite having discussed many others. I also think that the supplemental readings could have been shortened and made more direct so as to make them more accessible (since it was almost impossible to read those and the novel in one week). Also the optional talks offered were amazing and I think they should be incorporated into the course more. The most obvious strength of the course was Professor Magaziner. The reviews of this course really aren't exaggerating when they say that this course will change your outlook on history and the way it is taught, and the reason for that is him. He speaks very clearly and is very engaging with the material, especially considering the time he has to work with. ",
            "\u00a0I wish the course had done a bit more to situate the assigned novels in the historical context of the lectures. While there were, of course, clear connections between the themes of the course and the themes of the novels, I often felt myself wishing I had a better grasp of where the novels fit into the specific histories discussed. ",
            "\u00a0I love the fact that the readings for this class were novels. It exposed me to so much African literature that wasn't just written by Ngugi or Achebe. However, I do wish there was a little more emphasis, especially for the midterm paper, on how really to approach and incorporate fictional narratives into our writing.  A sample paper, for instance, would have helped a lot. We had many discussions during section about historiography and what to consider authentic truth etc. but for someone for whom this is the first history class of its kind, more tangible guidance would have been helpful. Overall, though, it was one of the best classes I have taken to date. ",
            "\u00a0covers important material that most people in the class probably hadnt studied before. Good survey of large periods of African history using novels as the majority of the course material, however the assignments were frustrating because no outside research was allowed which makes it difficult to write in a responsible way about history. ",
            "\u00a0THERE ARE NO WEAKNESSES. LET ME TELL YOU. I think Magaziner did a great job having us read novels for homework that were actually engaging, gave us a look into the applications of the topics we were discussing in lecture. He's extremely vibrant and engaging in lecture. His outlines are also extremely helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures in this course were phenomenal, and I also loved reading the novels as historical evidence. The only negative aspect of the course was that I felt that we were unprepared to write the types of essays asked of us, given that we were only permitted to use the novels and a small archive of textual evidence. I felt that I had to make certain assumptions regarding how the novels fit into the larger historical context because I was not permitted to use a larger archive. I would recommend changing the nature of the papers or allowing students to use more sources. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic, with extremely focused and engaging lectures that managed to cover a great number of countries and time periods while still following a logical path. The novels were a really interesting way of conducting the readings for the course, and they complimented the lectures well. The option to do a creative project in place of the final paper was refreshing. Only real criticism would be that sometimes the ideas in lecture needed some unpacking, and the focus on discussing the novels in section meant that that didn't always happen. ",
            "\u00a0The format of this class is excellent. Lecture was fascinating every single time and section didn't feel redundant since we were talking about totally different things. And since we were reading literature, I actually did the readings and enjoyed them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: INCREDIBLE professor/lectures, incredibly thoughtful approach to these topics/histories, readings were interesting. \r\n\r\nWeakness/improvement: Because it covers so much, it's at times a little hard to follow -- maybe would be nice if they're were some type of reminder pre-class or at the beginning of class as to where we had left off with that country's history. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were amazing. I guess that perhaps they could sometimes tie to the books in a bit more of a direct way, but I really did enjoy them as historical lessons and could mostly navigate the literature with them. The books were well-chosen, even though some, such as the Beautyful Ones are Not Yet Born and Life and a Half were difficult to grasp. I think some content warnings should have been issued for some of the books depicting violent scenes of sexual assault. Still, section was incredibly engaging, and I truly looked forward to lecture each day. ",
            "\u00a0The course was fantastic. I wouldnt change a thing. The lectures are dense and engaging and the readings are perfect. ",
            "\u00a0I would like to hear more about the books in lecture, and how they relate to the overall arc of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Big strength is the use of novels! this is very engaging and gives us students a unique chance to read African authors - making their own arguments about history through historical fiction as well as making art. Magaziner lecture styles are another great strength.\r\nA weakness that is not really about this class but the context in which this class is offered is that there are not enough African studies classes. Moreover, a weakness is that there is no actual DEPARTMENT of African studies. this is also a history class - and the history department does not have enough Africanists. The fact that \"Africa/Middle East\" is ONE region that can be chosen as a geographical pathway demonstrates that the history major needs to be reformed. we need more africanists - and an african studies DEPARTMENT. we need African professors, not visiting professors. At the moment, this is one of the best African history classes offered, but yale cannot rely on one man to educate the student body about Africa. The class is very popular but I fear that students come because Magaziner is well-known to be a great lecturer, not because of genuine interest in Africa. I cannot blame students for not taking Africa seriously if Yale, the history department and the council of african studies does not either. ",
            "\u00a0This was, by far, my favorite course I have taken so far at Yale. Magaziner is an excellent lecturer who is obviously both knowledgeable and passionate about the subject material. He clearly takes his job and his students very seriously, and knows how to command the attention of a class. Attending and paying attention to lecture never felt like a chore, and I never struggled to remain engaged (the result, in large part, of Magaziner's direction). Section also, was informative and engaging; we had better discussion in section for this class than I had in some seminars. The only weakness of this class was that the novels we read weren't explicitly alluded to or connected to the lectures. However, the superb teaching of both the professor and my TF managed to breach this gap in covered material. In the future, the professor could consider tying the novels more closely into lecture, but in my opinion, the class did not suffer for a lack of this connection. Really, just an awesome, awesome class. Cried a little during the last lecture. It was just that good. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely well designed. every component  lecture, novel, discussion, paper  was perfect. \r\nAlso appreciated how the lectures didnt really have to have anything to do with the novels we were reading that week, so that the section discussions can also be a space of their own. ",
            "\u00a0The biggest strength of this course is that the readings are all novels. Engaging with literature as a historical source was immensely rewarding and made the history we were studying more personal. The professor is also incredibly invested in making the lectures as interesting and insightful as possible. ",
            "\u00a0Excellent lectures, packed with info and very fast paced but understandably, reading was fun and interesting. I wish I could have felt a little more of a link between the novels that we read and the content covered in class, but I understand that much of the challenge of the class was for us to attempt to do that ourselves. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes! The novels are very interesting and the course offers a different point of view of colonialism that I had never been exposed to before. Professor Magaziner is amazing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, absolutely. This class teaches you elements of a history everyone needs to know. I know before I took this class, I could tell you little to nothing about African history, and that's an entire continent. I'm definitely not an expert now, but it's a start. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but understand that it's NOT a literature class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! Every single person at Yale should take this class. Even if it does not relate to your major, etc., it is worth it to take it Credit D just to hear Professor Magaziner's lectures - which are perhaps the best I have ever attended at Yale. Reading the novels is also so, so fun. I had also read so little African literature before this class (as is common among Americans), so I was so grateful to be introduced to so many incredible authors and books with which I was previously unacquainted. Moreover, it is SO important to unpack and debunk Western conceptions of Africa, and understand how these have shaped and continue to shape the continent today. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Not only does the reading of novels for the course make it unique and an incredibly interesting opportunity, but I also learned so much from Professor Magaziner's lectures about the colonial encounter in Africa. It is clear that Professor Magaziner is incredibly well-versed in these topics, and I very much appreciated the opportunity to learn about them. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Magaziner is a gem. Approaching colonial history from the perspective of Africans through the novels is unique and incredibly helpful. One of my favourite classes at Yale thus far. ",
            "\u00a0I think it needs to be clearer that this is an intellectual history course. If you like that, then yes, I'd recommend this course. Reading novels each week is much easier than pages of secondary texts. I think section was sometimes a waste, perhaps the TFs could have spent half of it giving more concrete historical contexts for the novels, and they could do more than nod and say \"good point\" to whatever each student said. Overall, it was a decent history lecture, and Professor Magaziner is very charismatic. The workload is very manageable. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Truly the best lecture I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0HANDS DOWN. Easily ranks in my top 3 courses at Yale. The lectures, readings and organization of the class were stellar, and made coming to class each day a privilege. I've recommended this course to pretty much everyone I know regardless of their major. No matter where you come from or where you're going, it will make a difference in your life. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to other students. Yale doesn't offer a whole lot of African history courses, so it's important to take advantage of the few we have. This course is incredibly interesting, and even though it doesn't go very in depth into anything, it's a great starting point ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Very good survey course. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely and unreservedly recommend this course to another student, which is something I do very rarely. This course was thought-provoking in a way that will color the way I think about history and world events for the rest of my life, but it was also, just, enjoyable - lectures were super interesting and engaging, and reading the required book each week felt like more of a study break. The content was hard, but interesting and important, and for those like me who have little to no exposure to African history, there is really a unique joy (and even more so, an importance) in learning something completely outside your consciousness. I was nervous about sections as a STEM major surrounded by mostly history/english majors, but they were still interesting and useful. My only comment is that papers are HARD - you write historical papers, using novels as the main sources and supplementing only with some subset of the academic articles pre-compiled by Professor Magaziner, so it's very hard to find a good topic. It's also difficult to synthesize these disparate sources, which often cover pretty different topics/time periods, into a coherent paper, and required making a lot of generalizations. Turning in a complete draft to your TA is helpful, but even before that I'd recommend spending a long time picking out a topic that you find interesting, and for which you can build a case using the sources available. I'd often only realize what I really wanted to say at the end of writing the paper, so it was a pretty lengthy process. Also, make sure to take super detailed lecture notes, because that's one of the only other sources available to you for the paper. This is just a warning; it's still completely worth taking the course!  One of the best I've taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course. Especially for those who enjoy fictional-novel analysis and/or novel readings in general, I think this course would suit those people very well. But more broadly, anyone who wants to learn more some of the big picture themes in Africa should take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! So many great novels and discussions in class. The opportunity to do a creative assignment for the final was both very challenging and rewarding. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! You learn a great deal about a lot of histories that very few of us know. More importantly, you learn the histories very well! You will challenge both your and general notions about Africa, question the very use of the term, and learn to think carefully about how we conceive its past. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend - if there is one history class to take, this one is it. Daniel Magaziner blew me away every, single lecture - you can tell that he deeply cares about the subjects he teaches and about how he teaches them - and he is incredible at weaving together facts and narrative. Every lecture is delivered as if Magaziner secretly graduated from the school of drama. I was legitimately so excited to go to class every Monday and Wednesday and this made me remember what real learning feels like--being thrilled, excited, and deeply challenged all at once. The class covers approximately early 1800s to the present-day, mostly focusing on sub-Saharan Africa. Magaziner has so many hot takes. He also asks so many good questions. It's a lecture but he still pauses in the middle to see if anyone has questions and engages with them earnestly. His office hours felt warm and inviting and I wished I'd started going to them earlier. The class covers 10 novels, all by African authors except for one, reflecting the different subjects we were discussing as well as themes across time including gender, urbanization, religion, economic development, sovereignty/governance, and so much more. I brought up or thought of this class in nearly every other class I took. It made me think about things in more nuanced and complicated ways. Magaziner is also hilarious. PLEASE take this class. The work load is also manageable - I loved reading the novels because they were so different from readings for other classes, and there's two 10-12 page papers (one midterm, one final). The second one has a creative option where you can choose to, instead of writing a history paper, construct a piece of fiction or other interpretation. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It is one of my favorite classes Ive taken at Yale, and Im not saying that lightly. I didnt care what grade I got at all because the material was so rewarding that I could have gotten a C and not regretted taking the class at all. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend the course, but only to those who are excited about reading all the assigned materials. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It really is a phenomenal class. It is both critical and creative. Professor Magaziner is one of the best lecturers I have had. He is a performer but in the best way! (and would probably hate me saying so) ",
            "\u00a0YES. MUST TAKE THIS CLASS. If you're a history major, you cannot miss this class, and if you aren't, I would still recommend it. The lectures are incredible and section is also super fascinating. The only assignments are two papers that are not a lot of work but still really enjoyable to write. Definitely take it! ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this course, Magaziner is such a great lecturer and the subjects are very interesting. Just be prepared that this is not a gut, you're gonna have a LOT of work to do, especially with the papers! ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely!! Lectures are absolutely riveting, and Magaziner is incredible. I loved going to lecture. This is a part of the world that is by and large neglected in primary and secondary schools not to mention at Yale  so take the opportunity to learn from the best. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes. An excellent first foray into the African Studies program. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone.  The lectures were always amazing, and Prof Magaziner is incredible.  The readings were mainly good.  Everyone would be able to take something great away from this course. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely.  Magaziner was a wonderful Lecturer and was always willing to answer questions.  I loved the novels (that I actually read) in the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, take this!! Be prepared to be slightly bewildered by the two assignments, the two papers, as there is not enough info on how to use novels as historical sources. But the lectures are fantastic, and the section was quite good. The novels are generally quite good, and integrate with the lecture pretty well. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would strongly recommend this course to any Yale student, whether they are a history major or not. The professor and teaching staff are incredibly knowledgeable and passionate about the course material, and constantly available for outside-of-class meetings and discussion. The subject matter is fascinating and important for all people seeking to understand the current geopolitical climate and interrogate more traditional historiography of Africa and the 20th century world (Professor Magaziner's lectures that placed African colonialism and nationhood within an international context, including discussion of the two world wars, the Cold War, and American Pan-Africanism and diasporic identity were particularly interesting and completely recontextualized a lot of my preexisting knowledge of these time periods and intellectual movements). The use of novels is unique among history classes and very well-integrated into the class structure. A great course! ",

            "\u00a0Yes take this class! As an MB&B major I haven't taken a lot of history classes and was a bit intimidated by the pace and complexity of this class, but it was absolutely worth it and I learned a lot of things that I think are important for building a general knowledge of world history that weren't the focus of any of my previous history classes. After taking this class, I feel much more equipped to read about modern news stories taking place in Africa and have some context into which to place them and learn more about the complexities of these issues. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! This is a great class that encompasses an enormous topic with deep reflection and thoughtfulness ",
            "\u00a0Definitely would recommend this class, Professor Magaziner is amazing and if you are even marginally interested in African history or European colonialism, he will open your eyes to the subject. All of the novels were great and very entertaining, although a lot some weeks. I usually went to reading them instead of doing other work because they didn't really feel like work even though I had to get them done. The papers were also left mostly up to you and we were given a lot of feedback along the way on how they should be written/what they should focus on. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. Professor Magaziner is brilliant and passionate, and it was exactly what I have been looking for out of my Yale history classes. ",
            "\u00a0This is an amazing course. I know Magaziner's South Africa class is also a big hitter, but I was really happy that I took this. I can't even explain why you should take it-- you just should. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely, a great course! ",

The books were excellent and I enjoyed reading them. Even section was great. Hands down one of the best classes at Yale, especially if you're looking for something that will challenge and change your perspectives on how we think about the world. ",
            "\u00a0YES!!! Wonderful lecture with the most thoughtful, brilliant professor. It covers a ton of information, but does so in fascinating, relevant ways that often connect to more modern development trajectories, global politics, etc. Classwork is a bit heavy with a book a week, but I took Credit/D/Fail and still felt I got a ton out of the class! Take it! ",
            "\u00a0Yes: Be ready to throw yourself into the material, come to section, and engage with the history and the literature. I think in the moments when I and my classmates did so, it was incredibly worthwhile. ",

You learn so much history (that remains widely untaught or uncovered in many high school and even traditional college curriculums) and Magaziner has an important take on every episode we cover, so you're really pushed to consider all the facets of different issues. My TF was stellar. Important material, great class. ",
            "\u00a0Extremely necessary and good course. Highly recommend for people across the spectrum  it accommodates no matter how experienced you are with history. Don't think of studying the african continent as a niche thing that should concern only some people. The history is so much more close to you than you think. ",
