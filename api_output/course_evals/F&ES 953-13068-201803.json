Opportunity to write scope of work and navigate client management.\r\nWeaknesses: Maureen's \"business 101\" lectures were useless, and even gave us bad advice that don't match how the corporations we've worked with do their work (internships/pre-FES). Guest lectures weren't useful. Maureen's process requirements didn't match the deliverables for our client, and so we had to redo work to meet her criteria. Strength of project REALLY depends on strength and reliability of the group members. ",

The guest lecturers bring their slides and give their pre-made presentations. Perhaps they should learn about what students are tackling generally, so they can cater their presentations to those themes. ",

",

Some of the classes were interesting to me personally, so I was happy to go, but some of the classes had nothing to do with my client work and did not interest me personally. ",
            "\u00a0I had a very positive experience, but it seems that this can really vary group by group. Having midterm deliverables and bi-weekly client calls really helped move the project along. \r\n\r\nI did not like the professor's emphasis on using a one-dimensional \"readability\" program to evaluate our writing. Some words and concepts are widely known in the industry or could not have been avoided in our writing (for instance, our client's name, which has four syllables), but this lowered the overall readability score. I felt like modifying our deliverables to conform to this metric required much more effort and produced overly simplistic, unengaging writing. ",

The guest speakers were interesting and helped provide insights into their jobs which was helpful for me as someone considering going the business route. I wish my project had been geared a little bit more towards the nuts and bolts of corporate strategy, marketing, or finance, to get an idea of how the environmental initiatives we were researching fit into the business process.

The biggest weakness of the course is that you are trapped into working within the confines of the way the course is structured, which seems very outdated. ",
            "\u00a0Several of the guest lectures had overlapping material, and on the whole they did not feel necessary to the successful completion of the client project. I would recommend one fewer presentation from a consultant about their work, and a little more one-on-one meeting time with Maureen to talk about how to align with the client on project scope. \r\n\r\nCourse requires complete student self-direction.

It could be a great experience with mature, competent, trustworthy peers who prioritize the work similarly to you. We highly recommend regular team check-ins (which the MBA students and alumni of \"Fundamentals of Working with People\" would be good at leading). Those conversations about norms, expectations, etc. will help avoid last-minute disasters. You won't get a lot out of the guest lectures. ",
