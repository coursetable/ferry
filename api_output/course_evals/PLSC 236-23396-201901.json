            "\u00a0I learned about the history of political campaign journalism and how to analyze the evolution of journalism over time. ",
            "\u00a0Great look at the evolving dynamics between, well, presidential campaigns and the media. Don't expect an exhaustive history (the course focuses on a few key elections), but do expect many, many anecdotes from Shapiro about his time in the trenches. ",
            "\u00a0Learned how the relationship between the press and candidates has evolved through technological innovation and cultural change in America. The class tracked the changes between 1960 up until now. ",
            "\u00a0Really learned how to think critically comparing different presidential elections throughout history ",
            "\u00a0This class covered a lot of distance in terms of campaigns and campaign reporting  which was nice as it was covered the history of presidential reporting (from around the JFK era) to modern day reporting and those issues. Overall, I felt like I learned so much and it is so nice to be able to spend a few hours a week with Walter Shapiro, who is a gem! ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the media and being a critical consumer of the media. ",
            "\u00a0We ended up with a nice mix of students who were open to discussing their own political leanings or interpretations of events of past campaigns. It was interesting to hear such wildly different interpretations of the same event or reading. What many saw as straightforward comments or bad jokes, others found offensive. Extremely useful was the professor's first-hand experience reporting on many of the more modern campaigns discussed. "

        [
            "\u00a0The reading responses kept me accountable for doing the reading and class discussions were interesting. I think more people would have been engaged in class if there had been a no laptops ruleI would advise Prof. Shapiro to consider making this change in future courses. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: some guests are amazing (i.e. James Hohmann, whose name no one knows but is one of the most powerful people in Washington -- Google him). Readings are interesting and usually not insane, and the heavy reading weeks are 'pop politics' books.\r\nWeaknesses: class engagement wasn't great, perhaps because Shapiro isn't a 'normal' professor. Certain guests (*cough* Megyn Kelly *cough*) had a tendency to go after students personally, rather than engaging on substance. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Amazing reading and professor is incredible. I LOVED THIS CLASS SO MUCH \r\n\r\nNo weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Shapiro is definitely the strength of the course - he is so knowledgeable and kind! ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- awesome guest speakers. Great discussion on the role of media in the 2016 election\r\nWeaknesses - sometimes the discussion was redundant ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are definitely the readings (which were so interesting and also very fun [Think Chasing Hillary, Boys on the Bus, and Making of a President, 1960]. Professor Shapiro also came very prepared with discussion points every class, and is so caring and kind, as well as deeply insightful about all aspects of presidential reporting. ",
            "\u00a0Perhaps some of the course was slightly repetitious. But I really did love everything we reviewed and found class discussion to be very engrossing! ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness is its dependence on class participation. We had about half the students rarely contribute to the discussion, so others were left to carry the conversation. The readings were straightforward and generally interesting. We were lucky to have a couple of visitors from major media outlets who were able to add additional insight into current and past coverage. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if they are willing to put in the time to do the readings, which can often be long but are helpful and illuminating. Prof. Shapiro is a delight and I'm very glad I had the chance to take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but take it for the inside look at Washington (and Iowa, and New Hampshire) and not for academic rigor. Great fifth class. ",
            "\u00a0YES! One of my favorite classes at Yale its so relevant to our time today and I think very important for people to understand the changes taking place in journalism. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, awesome professor, great guest speakers, and interesting course material. ",
            "\u00a0I'd definitely recommend it. If you're interested in elections, presidents or reporting in any way  this is the class for you!! Even if you aren't, it's so nice to be able to sit with Professor Shapiro and speak with him over the semester! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Shapiro is hilarious and the best. ",
            "\u00a0Great professor, fun class. Like most seminars, it depends heavily on student participation. "
