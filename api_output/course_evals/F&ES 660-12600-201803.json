            "\u00a0The structure of a forest is determined by the physiology of individual tree growth and site conditions and especially the disturbance regime of the site. I left with a cursory understanding of the history and politics of how different logging practices are based on understandings of forest stand dynamics. ",

            "\u00a0In this course, I learned about different forest structures, management applications, and disturbance types. I also learned a different theory of succession than I had known before. \r\n\r\nI began to develop landscape-reading skills, though this class was still introductory (for me) and so I have a while to go before I can walk into a forest and read the landscape history without context.

            "\u00a0This class completely misaligned with my expectations. I came into the course hoping to learn the nuanced dynamics dictating how forest ecosystems change over time, and how to apply those learning to the challenges of the Anthropocene. Instead, this course provided an anachronistic perspective on forest management that was both misguided and irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0Perfect match. Not too easy and not too hard. ",

            "\u00a0As someone totally new to forestry, I found this course to be a weak introduction to forest stand dynamics, one of the most important areas of study in understanding forests. I was excited to learn this material but found that the information was presented in such a chaotic way that it was difficult for me to synthesize. ",
            "\u00a0I expected to learn more about the main theories and concepts of forest ecology. However, I feel that I did not pick up as much as I expected. I lost track during some of the classes because the instructor did assume us coming to the class with profound knowledge of forest ecology, which we do not have. At the end, I came out the class with so much confusion. ",
            "\u00a0This class is taught with a perspective that prioritizes management applications and forest use over conservation, carbon sequestration, community management, or recreation. That is okay, but I expected to learn about stands from those other perspectives in addition to a management/use perspective. The instructor was able to answer questions about these other perspectives, but I would have liked to see them incorporated into the course content. "

            "\u00a0This course could be improved immensely by replacing the instructor. In addition, the course needs clear learning objectives and lectures and assignments that directly relate to those outlined learning objectives. Additionally, the inclusion of modern technology and relevant and practical applications to forest management in the era of climate change would be beneficial. Lastly, instead of a written final exam, it would have been more useful for each student to present on their final paper topic and share current applications of forest stand dynamics to different geographic regions. ",
            "\u00a0This class was well rounded. Can't think of any way to improve it. ",
            "\u00a0Field trips were useful. ",
            "\u00a0The in-class instruction could mirror the textbook more. It was difficult to align the practical classwork modules with the lingo/terminology and specific regional examples that the book focused on. Without a background in forestry, this class could be very difficult. ",
            "\u00a0The following is a critique of Chadwick Oliver's course. The lecture is a weakness of the course. The material was scattered, vague, repetitive, and not logically presented. The lecture is a series of anecdotes from the professor's experience in the field accompanied by photographs he took. Not that it's a bad thing to lecture with primarily photos and no text, but due to the largely anecdotal and free-form structure of the lecture I often felt lost and there was very little to anchor my thinking. I thought that the professor was sometimes very good at understanding and answering questions from students. Some of the other readings were helpful and some of them seemed out-dated, irrelevant or had old or incomplete information. The main text for the course was more helpful in learning the material, but it also needs updating. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of this course were basically limited to the assigned readings, which were the only modern perspective in the course. This course had many weaknesses. First, Chad's lectures had very little structure or takeaways and instead were mostly a string of photos and associated anecdotes about Chad's various experiences in the field. I did not find this to be an effective teaching style, as there was no information synthesis. It is absolutely necessary to read the textbook to be able to understand what is going on in the course, and even still the lectures did not add very much to the textbook. The textbook is also over twenty years old with black and white photos, graphs that are difficult to understand, and most troubling, out of date information. Lastly, the final exam review guide and exam itself did very little to synthesize the information for me. Instead, the review guide was incredibly lengthy and repetitive with very little organization and the final exam (particularly the last section) was a confusing reflection of the chaos of information that was this class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength is that the instructor has such profound knowledge of forest ecology. He is one of the most important figures in the field so that he is aware of most of the concepts and studies related to the course. He is also the writer of the textbook so we can ask direct questions about the book. \r\n\r\nOne of the weaknesses is that the instructor has strong opinions on some of the topics. It leads to bias on a lot of the topics. He sometimes criticizes some of the perspectives of other researchers. The textbook is also very hard to follow. The language is loose and confusing. His powerpoint does not have words but some pictures of his previous researches. We are hard to refer back to what he says in classes from the slides. ",
            "\u00a0The main strength of this class is the experience of the instructor. Chad has been working in the field for decades and has a great depth of knowledge. He also has a good variety of experience, on the domestic and international levels, and he drew on those experiences in class. I found his anecdotes about forests in other countries enriching.\r\n\r\nHowever, a weakness of the class is that Chad teaches from his perspective only, even though students have different or additional interests. Chad is also using extremely old photographs/slides to illustrate his points, which were sometimes so blurry, grainy, or far away that I could not tell what was supposed to be in the photo. The textbook and other supplemental papers were provided online for students, but the papers were rarely referenced in lectures or exams. Finally, the final paper for the class is a very vague assignment. I admit I could have done a better job in asking for clarity on the prompt, but other instructors for other classes provided detailed prompts, sometimes as long as a page. \r\n\r\nI also felt that the final field trip of the class did not really enhance my learning, and I think the class only needs two field trips. Though parts of the visit to the Harvard Forest was interesting, it was not as useful as the trip to the New Haven water management land, or Yale Meyers with Craig Broderson's class.\r\n\r\nTo improve, I would suggest Chad include specific lectures on carbon sequestration, biodiversity, conservation, water management, community management, etc.; update the photos on his slides; build in discussion periods in class to bring the papers more into focus--and to keep students accountable to reading them; cut back one field trip; and to provide more clarity on what the expectations for final papers were.

            "\u00a0If you want to learn forest stand dynamics, do not take this course, especially if the current instructor is teaching it. Purchase and read the textbook on your own, consult present literature to gauge its accuracy, and ask other faculty if you have questions. It will be a much better use of your time. ",

            "\u00a0Focus on the textbook. Its imperative to understanding and having valuable conversations. This may not be only a fault of the teacher but the nature of the material, which is both incredibly general in theory but very specific in its applicability due to the regional nature of forestry. ",
            "\u00a0Attend the field trips and take notes because they help make sense of the lecture. Ask a lot of questions on the field trips. Get started on the final project early because there is no guidance in the lecture about the project and it is very open ended. Get together with other class mates to work on assignments and to study. ",
            "\u00a0It would be hard for me to recommend taking this course if Chad Oliver is still the professor. I am coming to the MF with very little prior knowledge of forestry and while I do feel as if I have a better understanding of forest stand dynamics, I wish I had audited the course and taken something else for credit. ",
            "\u00a0Be very prepared with the style of the instructor. Seek outsides resources and other readings besides the textbook. ",
            "\u00a0If the class continues as it is currently structured, I would tell students taking this class to organize a self-study schedule from the very beginning, and to work with other students in the class to break down the readings into outlines. "
