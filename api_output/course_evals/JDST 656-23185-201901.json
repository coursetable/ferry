Source sheets were a great model for this kind of class, although I would've appreciated if they were also posted online. Run like a law school class, so not much participation; more discussion might have been nice. ",

Professor David isn't the most engaging lecturer, and he mostly talks through the two-hour seminar slot, so just make sure that if you're taking the class, it's because you're really interested in the material, because you'll only enjoy it if the material is what's driving it.

But you have to take the class because you're interested in the subject matter, otherwise you'll definitely get bored really quickly. It's a very chill class -- very little work other than the readings -- so don't worry about it from that perspective. "
