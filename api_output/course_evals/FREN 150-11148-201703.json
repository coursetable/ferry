            "\u00a0Survey grammar course, everything from present, to PC and imparfait, to future, conditionnel, and subjonctif. Compared to L3 and L4, L5 is a lot more writing, with 4 writing assignments of 750-800 words each, plus shorter assignments throughout the semester. Oral skills are practiced a lot in class as well, with an emphasis on pronunciation and fluency. ",
            "\u00a0We covered a lot of excellent French novels, including Rhinoceros, Art, Boule de Suif, and Tous les matins du monde. ",
            "\u00a0I was able to develop my French speaking and writing abilities. ",
            "\u00a0I greatly improved my french vocabulary and oral speaking abilities ",
            "\u00a0I improved my reading and writing skills in French by a great extent. I got exposed to different forms of French learning materials including novels, films, short clips etc. I have enhanced my understanding towards French history and culture. ",
            "\u00a0A revision of French grammar, more vocabulary, a thorough exposure to different French literary works and films. "

        [
            "\u00a0The vocab part in the exam is ridiculous. Does not test your knowledge of the meanings if the words, just your ability to memorize. ",
            "\u00a0This course is a lot of work so it is important to stay on top of it all. ",
            "\u00a0Sometimes there was a lot of work due around the same time, but usually my professor extended dates to make it easier for us when necessary. Reading books/plays and then watching the film and comparing the two was definitely a strength of the class. Also being able to submit a corrected version of redactions because then we could learn from our initial mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: intensive writing and reading load for fast imrpovement\r\nWeakness: not enough class time for the professor to go through all materials together or to clarify some grammatical points, not enough chances for practising listening and oral ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Material is quite decent, the films and books were pretty enjoyable, shame we never really delved into any good depth for some of them.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Lots of work. "

            "\u00a0Yes I think it was perfect for reviewing french grammar while simultaneously improving language skills and learning about french culture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it might be a little demanding at the beginning but as you get used to the pace of the course, you will realize the assignments are all very useful to your learning ",
            "\u00a0Do it if you need to, the material's decent but not sure how enjoyable the course is. Whether Madame Bedoui is a good teacher for you depends on the learning style, if you like lectures she'd be great, if you like seminars maybe try someone else. "
