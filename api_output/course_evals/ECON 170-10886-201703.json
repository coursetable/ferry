It's a dynamic class that involves thinking about how underlying economic principles influence the healthcare market. There is a decent amount of just memorizing legislation and stuff though. ",

My biggest takeaways are that the most common talking points on either side of the aisle should be subject to extreme scrutiny when promising easy answers to the difficult problem of increasing costs, disparities, and middling results.

I developed my analytical policy skills much more than my econ-specific, skills, but I think the course is better for it- I am now much more able to debate and discuss healthcare with my friends and family, which seems critical because the topic is major and very impactful.

Even though the healthcare system is relatively expansive and would probably take more than 25 lectures to adequately cover it, I believe that Prof. Foreman does a great job of providing an overview of that system. Additionally, he was great at bringing in a wealth of guest speakers to lecture to provide outside perspectives on the real-world impacts of healthcare. ",

            "\u00a0This course is really fascinating and there are phenomenal guest speakers. You learn a lot about healthcare markets which is a must for premeds and also just for engaged citizens. It is very current events heavy which I found exciting (although ultimately disappointing because you realize how bad things are / are going to get). The tests are very detail-heavy though, and you have to know about all the minute tangents (not just what was emphasized) it can be kind of difficult to keep track of all these things. ",

The guest lectures were phenomenal, and I left the course with a greater appreciation for the complexity of our healthcare system as well as the different perspectives on how to begin resolving some of its biggest problems. ",

            "\u00a0Well organized but lectures were sometimes boring. Its easy to do well if you pay attention in class and study hard for the midterm/final. The essay was graded nicely. As previous reviewers have said, it would be much more effective if the TAs actually reviewed the material rather than just answering specific questions in their review sessions. Not helpful as it is now.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is barely an economics class; as an economics major, I wouldve preferred more Econ rather than poli sci. Moreover, its expected for your final paper to have a major focus on economic principles, which just doesnt make sense  considering there is literally one lecture on health care economics. ",

",
            "\u00a0There's not a lot of homework, testing etc but that puts pressure on each assignment/assessment. I think it would have been good to have a second midterm just because several people were unprepared for the level of memorization needed for the first. A second midterm would balance grades and helps students to review information before the final. ",
            "\u00a0While the slides could have been updated towards the end of the course, the readings remained relevant with more recent conversations among industry experts and not just academics. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very informative with interesting lectures. I would have appreciated a little more continuity with the Medicare lectures (they were broken up between the first and second exams / guest lecture) as this was the most confusing topic for me. I enjoyed the variety of guest lecturers! It was also great to have Professor Forman's perspective on the issues as a health care provider. ",

            "\u00a0Strength is that information is presented in a very clear presentable way. A weakness is that the grading can me very nitpicky. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Organization of the course, straightforward homework and tests, engaging lectures, interesting and self-directed final paper.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: light on economics (which could also be a strength!), harder to practice material you've learned (maybe if they add a practice exam, or equivalent before the final?) ",
            "\u00a0I thought it was well taught and informative. The physician part of the lecture got boring though. \r\n\r\nI wish we had gotten feedback on our proposal of our final paper so we had feedback before we wrote it. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Foreman does a very good job at providing the information either though his own lectures, his TFs lectures, and through the lectures of his guest speakers. There was a lot of specific information covered, and while at times that meant that the grading seemed to nitpick at the details, I believe that it was to the benefit of the course. The one issue that I had was not even in implementation or material, but rather on the review sessions, which relied on student questions and not on what might be important for the exams. If the model was flipped such that important information could be highlighted, then that might provide a better student review. ",
            "\u00a0The Professor is very knowledgeable intros field and the guest lecturers are very engaging. However, the TAs should be better utilized to aid the students in their work, not just hosting four optional Q&A sessions. ",

            "\u00a0This course could have an easie grading on exams and essays, too nitpicky ",
            "\u00a0This was a really fantastic course overall. Professor Forman's lectures are really interesting and engaging, and he seems like a genuinely kind person who wants to see his students succeed. The guest lectures were also fascinating. The main weakness I can think of was that the lecture slides were sometimes not entirely clear  a reason to go to lecture, but sometimes Professor Forman would talk quickly and it was hard to clarify what certain bullets meant. ",
            "\u00a0Great course on the economics of healthcare. Professor Forman is immensely knowledgable (he's actually an MD from the Med School) and an engaging lecturer. Amazing guest speakers including Surgeon General Murthy and several Obama-era policymakers. You'll walk away with a demystified understanding of healthcare and health insurance in the U.S. ",

            "\u00a0In general, the class was taught very well. Professor Forman's explanations were clear, he was an engaging lecturer, and the assigned readings were interesting and helpful (I'm still looking through some of the supplemental ones that I didn't get to during the semester). The one aspect of the class I would change is the final essay: I think it might have been more useful to ask students to produce an argumentative essay rather than just a literature review. Other than that, I was very happy with the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the class is very well structured and Professor Forman is a thoughtful, compelling lecturer. The class could be improved with more regular optional review sessions with the teaching fellows, as there is a lot of material covered each week, and it would be helpful to have at least one other time between the beginning of the semester and the midterm and between the midterm and final to ask questions about the material. ",
            "\u00a0I think this course would be greatly improved by having weekly mandatory discussion section to go over course material. I also think that more homework assignments would be very helpful. ",

            "\u00a0Other people probably said this too, but yeah, his slides are very long and there's a lot of memorization. Also, I felt like the final exam was too focused on 1-2 lectures (including the TA lecture) and asked very specific questions about specific laws and acts when we were told it would be more about concepts (oh well.) ",

The material could have been organized better at times but I was impressed with the detail of the course. Forman also does a good job at presenting the material in a neutral way, and handles the partisan opinions of certain students well. As far as the material goes, if you attend lecture most of the time, you will have no issue with the two exams. Other than that, workload is pretty light with a few short assignments in between and a final paper. There are also some very interesting guest speakers. Fall '17 we had a past surgeon general, a HC partner from a prominent VC firm, healthcare czar under Obama, among others.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think this is a great class for both those interested in medicine and those interested in economics and Prof. Forman is truly a valuable asset to his students.

You gain a deep understanding of the many factors at play in the American healthcare system and how the system may be improved. Professor Forman cares so deeply about teaching, and that shows in his lectures and in the thoughtfulness with which he selects the guest lecturers. He also rolls with the punches as policy issues continue to change and develop and is always willing to discuss relevant policy changes and his opinions on their potential impact. He is not blinded by partisan affiliation and really discusses the issues at face value based on their economic impact. It is a lot of material, so it is worth considering that you will be much better off if you come to lecture, pay attention, and take good notes. ",
