I now have a relatively good understanding of five behavioral economics paper and a topic within behavioral economics. On the other hand, I did not learn very much from the other students' presentations. Since we never really discussed the papers, there was little incentive to read the papers before class. In the future, I think the presentations should be maybe 10 - or even 5 - minutes long followed by a 30-minute discussion. Then the students would be forced to read the papers for each class and think critically about them. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Student presentations forced students to really engage with specific ideas and papers in the class.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: Very little professor involvement, everything was mostly self taught. The professor did organize a comprehensive syllabus. "

            "\u00a0If you are looking for an interesting gut class where you get to learn something at the same time, this is a great class. Be aware that the class is all student presentations, though. ",
            "\u00a0Would recommend. Pretty easy/light workload senior seminar. It is pretty fun and you learn interesting theories that can facilliate a more complete and nuanced view of economic models. "
