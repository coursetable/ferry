            "\u00a0Debate, critical thinking ",
            "\u00a0I learned about the importance of considering how development relates to our understanding of brain circuitry as well as the course of psychopathology. ",
            "\u00a0I learned much about the brain circuitry involved in fear acquisition and extinction as well as critical information that informs a developmental approach to psychopathology. ",
            "\u00a0It was refreshing to see that there was an entire field of research based on developmental psychopathology. The class discussions really pushed me to think in a different way about psychopathology and made me realize that there was an entire world to consider beyond just research and data. It was particularly interesting to do the debates because it really combined a variety of perspectives (especially the second one), and challenged me to think and consider a lot of elements and factors that were not just pertinent to immediate psychological data and research. ",
            "\u00a0Through the readings and in-class discussions, I feel as though I learned a great deal, both broadly and deeply, about key research questions and findings thus far in the field of developmental psychopathology. Beyond expanding my understanding of the extant literature, I believe that I also improved my ability to critically process this research and ask questions to think further. Essentially, I really appreciated the thoughtful focus on both providing meaningful content and deepening thinking processes that BJ encouraged throughout this course. ",
            "\u00a0I had next-to-no developmental psychopathology background before taking this class, so it was a huge stretch for me. Because this was a graduate class, the level of presumed knowledge was quite high, and it required a lot of thorough reading and note-taking in order to stay on-pace with BJ's lectures. She did a great job of integrating such a high volume of information into her slides in a way that was coherent. ",
            "\u00a0I have a much greater understanding of neural and biological processes that contribute to developmental changes. This course provided a great introduction to key empirical findings on brain development, especially during adolescence, and how psychiatric conditions present differently during development. I also feel comfortable exploring translational research relevant to psychiatric illness during development, which was not the case before taking this course! "

            "\u00a0Great course overall! ",
            "\u00a0I thought the papers and lectures complemented each other very well. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the readings were interesting and well-suited to the topics we discussed in class. I also enjoyed the debates and found them useful for learnings. I did think that some of the readings provided repetitive information, but otherwise felt that the class was accessible in terms of material that can be quite difficult, especially for those with less of a neuroscience-based background. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: course readings were incredibly helpful and interesting; effective emphasis on discussion & critical thinking that made the course engaging/fun; assignments were reasonable and well aligned to learning goals\r\n\r\nImprovements for next time: more structured prep time & requiring groups to share their main points for the debate beforehand so that rebuttals can be well-planned. I think this was suggested but I think making this a requirement could make the debate an even more effective learning experience (although definitely already was fun and I learned a great deal having to take one side completely) ",
            "\u00a0BJ had to cater to a lot of different types of students, as there were undergrads, me (students outside of  her area) and auditors, but she did a great job of keeping everyone engaged. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nI enjoyed the course format, namely the emphasis on class discussion and in-class debates. The debates were a fun and relatively low-stress way to synthesize the material. \r\nI thought it was helpful to take a translational approach to studying development. It was compelling to see how key findings hold in both animals and humans.\r\nI liked that similar topics/ research methods were presented several times. Though it occasionally felt redundant, overall it was very helpful for hammering home the main points. A lot of the material was complex, and I think that I remember and understand much better because the material was presented and discussed several times.  \r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nNot really a weakness, just a suggestion: I would have loved some readings exploring how what we know about the developing brain can/should/does impact societal understanding of adolescents and the legal/criminal justice system. Some class discussions veered towards this topic, but it would have been great to have particular readings on this topic and spend even more time in class discussing this. "

            "\u00a0Yes! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I thought the material was very interesting and presented clearly! ",
            "\u00a0Yes!! I was really apprehensive about taking a graduate level course as an undergrad, but this really opened my eyes up and I feel like there's an entire world of psychology that I want to explore now. It was really inspiring to work with grad students in the clinical fields who were so knowledgeable about their focus and who offered such insightful comments during the discussions and debates. You learn a lot and read a lot, but I think this was a really good class for those who want to branch out from the vanilla psychology of the department in undergrad. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! A developmental perspective to understanding risk factors, etiology, and differential treatment for psychopathology is powerful and important--engaging in this course facilitates this learning for those interested in these questions both practically and research-wise. ",
            "\u00a0I would-- I think if you really want to get an understanding of how developmental findings inform clinical research, it is a great class to do so. However, students must be prepared to do the work in order to get the most out of it. This is not a class that you can skate by in, so if that's your intention, I wouldn't recommend it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It was a very interesting and informative course. I think that I learned a lot and have a much clearer understanding of brain development during childhood and adolescence. The format of the course was conducive to learning, and BJ is a clear and engaging instructor. "
