I actually feel I have developed a core understanding of cellular biology and this course did a great job in explaining all concpets thoroughly. ",
            "\u00a0Surprisingly, an amazing course. I learned so much about cell biology. I took this as an upperclass person and I wish I had taken it during my first or second year. Cell biology is pervasive in the life sciences. So much of what we learned is found in other courses. I really gained an appreciation for how cellular systems work and operate. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to strategize in learning an incredibly large amount of information. I relied on Professor Pollard's textbook and study guides to learn the material. The lectures were helpful but the quiz material was actually much more in depth than what we covered in lecture. I think the course does a good job training us to think critically but the course's grading scheme was unnecessarily stressful. ",
            "\u00a0I learned in-depth about a wide-range of topics regarding the structures and functions of cell components. Particular foci incldued membrane physiology, protein synthesis and processing, the structure of the nucleus, and the cytoskeletal sytem. The course completes a whole tour of all major life-sustaining functions of cells and the evolutionary origin of such systems. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about cellular signaling pathways and about cells in general! The amount of knowledge you gain in this course is absurd and amazing. By far the most educational class I've taken at Yale! But I also enjoyed learning the material, even though there was SO MUCH. ",

            "\u00a0Such a dense, heavy course but learned so, so much. This requires memorization, but in a way that doesn't seem like brute memorization like so many other bio courses feel like. Everything is so connected and applicable to each other and it is so true that by the end of the course it feels like it all came a full circle. Probably my favorite bio course at Yale so far. ",

            "\u00a0I learned so much about the various aspects of the cell through this course. We really delved into cellular processes with much more detail, and this course really gave me the opportunity to understand these mechanisms and the complexities of the cell so much more fully. This course also helped me develop my skills in thinking through processes in a mechanistic way, thinking about what would happen if certain things occurred or if certain things were absent. This kind of analytical thinking really allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the material and helped me in terms of being able to solve problems and explain the hypothetical scenarios that we don't necessarily learn about in lecture. ",

One of the points they emphasized was that the class is more about learning how to approach the material rather than learning the material itselfthey describe it as learning to swim in the ocean of cell biology. I think that really rings trueyou learn a lot about cell bio, but more importantly you learn how to think about it. ",

Rather than just observing and acknowledging biological mechanisms, the course went in depth to explain exactly how they occurred from a very basic standpoint. It also taught core principles of biology that are applicable to so many different scenarios. ",

There was a lot of memorization, but Professor Pollard and the others did a great job of setting up the basic concepts so that by the end of the course everything started to come together. It was amazing to see the regulation and connections of so many cellular processes. ",

            "\u00a0The weekly quizzes and final exam format is excellent. This keeps motivation high and checks our understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0Weakness: sometimes the lectures felt rushed and overwhelming with information. \r\nStrength: even though the quizzes were challenging; I still love the way the questions are asked. They may be specific at times; however, the quizzes are not heavily memorization based, but application based. Of course, hours still need to be spent on understanding the materials, but only then will you truly be able to apply the materials to real-life situations/experiments that are tested on the quizzes. The lecture note packets provided are extremely helpful. The textbook for the class is also surprisingly helpful and concise in helping further understand what was taught in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Great organization that facilitated learning. ",
            "\u00a0The quizzes were essential to my learning in this class---I do not think I could have learned so much in such a small amount of time without the weekly quizzes. However, the grading can be a tad harsh sometimes, and even singular points on one quiz can end up being critical. I wouldn't change the format of the grading of the course, but I feel like future students would probably appreciate some more practice with thinking in the analytical, technical manner that the quizzes require. ",
            "\u00a0This course is very well organized by the professors and the study guides they provide to guide your learning are amazing. Additionally, the weekly quizzes, although pretty burdensome each week, were really nice in retrospect, as they kept you on track with the material. ",
            "\u00a0This course benefits from an excellent teaching team, and the weekly quizzes are useful in forcing you to learn material throughout the semester rather than cramming at the end. However, the lectures are long and heavy with details you won't use, making classes feel interminable at times. This could be alleviated with a few readjustments to the curriculum (e.g. cutting out \"extra\" information like evolutionary histories) and, most effectively, by making this a 3x50 min class rather than a 2x75 min class/moving it a bit later in the day. This would make following the detailed lectures much easier and engaging. In addition, some of the lectures felt as though they jumped from one topic to another with little transition, so perhaps reorganizing the topics so that lectures are more cohesive would help. Sections were very helpful (I worked with Andres), but the peer tutors were not great at explaining topics and didn't seem to know what information to emphasize. ",
            "\u00a0It's a lot of material to digest. The final felt way too specific given how much information we are asked to remember. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: Good course structure and worked like a well oiled machine. \r\n\r\nWeakness: The quiz format was a little rushed. I think I would be much more willing to take 30 min out of my evening to take a quiz in section rather than rush through ten minutes in class. It just felt like I was never able to sit on the questions and really think. The final exam felt like breath of fresh air that allowed me to take my time. (Also professors need to stop chit chatting during the quiz time. We know was have fifteen minutes! No need to announce it every week. Your yapping at the front is eating into my quiz time!!!) ",
            "\u00a0I think that the quiz questions could be a little less detail oriented and more geared toward big picture themes. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures are a selling point of this course. For a student interested in biology, the coherent and well designed lectures of the course--from all professors--makes the content digestible and the course enjoyable. The lectures help bridge the gaps between esoteric textbook content and practical applications for the content we learn. I did not feel disengaged in any of the lectures. Another strength is the quiz system--the weekly quizzes make sure that you don't get overwhelmed by mastering too much information before being tested on it. A weakness of the course might weight of the final exam--40% of the grade--which is staked on 6 questions. ",
            "\u00a0The class, by nature, was pretty dense, but the structure didn't help. Lecture was pretty boring and I often found myself dozing off. Luckily the study guides that they hand out are phenomenal and really saved my life. Coming clean, they're all I used in this course. I didn't read the book and I barely used the slides. The study guides were amazing and included all of the main concepts we needed to know. ",
            "\u00a0This course gave a very good broad overview of many aspects of cell biology such as signaling pathways, molecular motors, etc. The lectures were usually very engaging (although there were a few lectures that were dull). All in all, this course is a much better biology course than any of the introductory biology sequences. In addition, I felt like most of the quizzes were very fair and were less focused on rote memorization and more focused on logical analysis and applying your knowledge to new situations. One weakness is that sometimes, I did feel like we got too bogged down in the details in lecture when a higher level view would have been more appropriate. ",
            "\u00a0There's too much content and too fast a pace. ",
            "\u00a0I think a major weakness of this course is how much we needed to memorize out of a textbook / lecture slides every week for a quiz. As much as the professors claim the quiz questions are \"thought-based\" or whatever, I really found them to be \"did you memorize every tiny detail in this pathway?\" And I don't think that's a very useful way of teaching anything, especially biology. I also think it makes it way too easy to get burnt out with this course, as students realize it's more beneficial to cram information the night before quizzes than to actively engage with the material and become good cell bio problem solvers. I believe there is a lot of room for improvement there.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the lecturers are really fantastic and I loved learning cell bio -- on the whole, I am very happy I took this class. I just believe there is a better way to test the material. For example, maybe by including a diagram of the pathway with the names of proteins and molecules included, then have students answer thoughtful questions about manipulating the pathway. I don't think that memorizing each detail (which in the real world is pretty accessible to scientists) should be weighted as heavily as knowing how to look at a pathway and gather information from it. ",
            "\u00a0The professors are all good lecturers, and the content is interesting. Further, I think the structure of the course - with weekly quizzes instead of a midterm - helps students stay on top of the material. However, there is sometimes an overwhelming amount of detail and content, and the 75-minute lecture made it difficult to focus. In reading through summary packets, there was often a lot of detail that felt irrelevant and just served to confuse me, which in turn made it hard to prepare for the quizzes. I think instead of providing so much detail and then speeding through it, it would make more sense to go over broad concepts (and emphasize that those are the ones being tested) and then illustrate with specific examples. (While this did sometimes occur, it felt like we had to go so quickly through the specific examples that I didn't retain much information, and then was not sure whether I would be tested on it.) Also, I think the course would be better suited to a 50-minute lecture - 75 minutes meant that there was a huge amount of material in each class period, and especially because it was early in the morning, it could be hard to keep up. ",
            "\u00a0Quiz feedback is limited so its hard to deduce missed concepts, etc from them. Perhaps more feedback here would ensure fuller understanding of concepts throughout the course. ",
            "\u00a0In terms of strengths, this class really broadened and deepened my understanding of cellular biology. I learned a lot more than I was expecting to in this course, and that's due to the fact that they taught us so much material and expected us to learn it in a deeper way than how they presented the information during lectures. Through the weekly quizzes, I was forced to really learn the material each week instead of listening to lecture and forgetting about it until exams, allowing me to really learn everything we were being taught. I also thought it was nice to have 4 different professors teaching topics in their fields of expertise, because it gave us the chance to learn from people who are incredibly knowledgable about the topics we were learning during their lectures. Also, my TA Lauren was absolutely phenomenal! She was so incredibly dedicated to all of us and our learning, and she put in so much work every week for section to make sure that we would understand the material presented in lecture. \r\n\r\nIn terms of weaknesses, many of the quiz and exam questions were worded in a very strange way, so I often didn't really know what the question was asking and what kinds of answers they were expecting. So, there were many times when I didn't feel like I could show that I understood the material because the questions didn't really make sense. It seemed like the quizzes were hard to prepare for because they were written by the professors that taught the material on a particular quiz. So, the questions weren't written in a standardized way that would let us know how to prepare for them and answer them, since each professor wrote questions in a different style. I wish that the TAs or all of the professors would write each quiz, regardless of who taught the material on the quiz, so that they would have been more uniform in question style and format. I also wish that the professors would have more time for office hours instead of a single hour during the week, since it felt like they were pretty inaccessible to answer our questions if they arose after lecture. I also felt like there wasn't a lot of information in terms of class averages on the quizzes and how the class would be graded, which did cause some stress with most students because we really didn't feel like we knew where we stood in the class. ",
            "\u00a0I think the way this course is taught is great. ",
            "\u00a0As much as I disliked having weekly quizzes, it actually made it easier to keep up with the material. When it came time to the final, I actually felt like I was reviewing material I remembered studying rather than feeling like I was teaching myself material I had completely forgotten about (which is how I feel like studying for many other courses is like). Being able to drop 3 of the 12 quizzes was nice, but I wish that quizzes (60% of the grade) and the final (40% of the grade) had less weight in the final grade, possibly by adding section participation/attendance as a component to the final grade. The course was very well-organized despite being taught by several professors (which included both male and female professors!). However, it was clear the professors coordinated with each other to following the same/similar structure and teaching style making it easy to get comfortable and know what to expect throughout the course. Having study packets, slides posted on Canvas prior to class, and TA sections were very helpful and I am glad that there were many study materials provided for this course. Despite the stress of having to keep up with the material weekly, I really did learn so much coming out of it. ",

            "\u00a0This class was an incredible amount of work every week. The weekly quizzes facilitated learning but was really tough to keep up with every single week. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths of the course are the interesting material and format (weekly quizzes are much more manageable than midterms considering how much we cover). The weaknesses are that some of professors went through material extremely quickly, meaning that very little was absorbed from those lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: extremely well-organized, a lot of support, clear notes and resources, good lecturers\r\nWeaknesses: each lecture contained a lot of material, so it was difficult to keep up and understand during lecture, but that is the nature of the course/ subject ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured but the quizzes were very easy to lose a lot of points and they did not demonstrate understanding of the course. ",
            "\u00a0Everything was great. ",
            "\u00a0This class takes over your entire semester. I spent more time on this class than all of my other classes combined. However, I did learn a lot of interesting biology. ",
            "\u00a0The course is a good survey through many of the topics in cell biology, but at times I feel like the professors can do a better job of emphasizing or highlighting the important material, since there is so much to go through but not everything is tested. ",
            "\u00a0Strength: weekly quizzes force students to keep up with the high volume of information\r\nWeakness: the information volume is overwhelming ",
            "\u00a0This course was very well organized for learning since the syllabus and the professors followed a clear and consistent routine. The organization helped make for a very good learning environment. This course was very engaging since different professors lectured. Each of the lecturers was clearly passionate about what they were teaching which made me excited about what I was learning and engaged in the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0I appreciated the weekly quizzes, which forced us to stay on top of the material. The flexibility of dropping three was really nice, and allowed us to focus less on the grades and more on enjoying the content. Each lecture or set of lectures build our foundation in cell biology to ultimately piece it all together to understand the cell cycle, and I never imagined it could be so complex. I wish there was one or two assignments to allow us to get more in depth experience with a particular topic, perhaps as a paper or presentation during section. ",
            "\u00a0I do not have much criticism for this course as I felt it was extremely well organized and conducive for student learning. Some people complain about the weekly quizzes but I felt that it helped us stay on top of the information as there was a lot to learn. The lectures were well put together and the professors appeared to communicate a lot. ",
            "\u00a0I think overall this is a great class -- you gain a great understanding of biology and a great ability to think about biological problems. The weekly quizzes are a lot, but they're generally pretty fair. Towards the end of the course, however, the quizzes definitely got a lot more memorization-heavy. Also note that the sections/TAs were very inconsistent, so expectations for section participation varied considerably. ",
            "\u00a0This course asks to memorize really small details. I don't think that's an effective way to study biology. I think the quizzes are a good use of our time though. ",
            "\u00a0The only weakness of the course was the amount of material. The amount of material that had to be memorized every week was significantly large. It became a burden at times to remember everything for the weekly quizzes that happened. Besides that, the course was fantastic. With four different professors and four different teaching styles, the class was able to stay largely engaged with the material. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course is how much material you cover and how much detail you get on everything. I thought one of the weaknesses is that the experimental methods were not given enough coverage in lecture; this was problematic when it came to tests and quizzes that relied on applying these methods. The in-course support though was fantastic and I was able to keep up well due to the weekly quizzes. ",
            "\u00a0This course covers a lot of very interesting material, but it does so in a non-memorable way. I understand that the course intends to give a very large background on cell biology, but that focus on quantity over quality of teaching was visible in almost every lecture. I think the course could be improved by cutting some of the material and focusing more in detail on the most important aspects of the chapters. It honestly ends up being a lot of self-teaching and memorizing as opposed to engaging lectures and recalling. "

However, this class is a lot of work for the entire semester because of the weekly quizzes and the final that is a large portion of the grade. As long as you are aware of the work required and are willing to put in that work, the course will be a good experience because you can walk away knowing that you have gained a massive amount of knowledge in a relatively short time.

            "\u00a0Yes! This class is so well taught and the material is incredibly interesting. It was my favorite course this semester (and top 3 in general). It's a great course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to another student as long as they are fully committed to keeping up with the material and studying for the weekly quizzes. I think it is a very good idea for students to take the course after taking the intro biology sequence given how much material was taught and the fast pace at which it was taught at. As much as I disliked having weekly quizzes, it actually made it easier to keep up with the material. When it came time to the final, I actually felt like I was reviewing material I remembered studying rather than feeling like I was teaching myself material I had completely forgotten about (which is how I feel like studying for many other courses is like). Being able to drop 3 of the 12 quizzes was nice, but I wish that quizzes (60% of the grade) and the final (40% of the grade) had less weight in the final grade, possibly by adding section participation/attendance as a component to the final grade. The course was very well-organized despite being taught by several professors (which included both male and female professors!). However, it was clear the professors coordinated with each other to following the same/similar structure and teaching style making it easy to get comfortable and know what to expect throughout the course. Having study packets, slides posted on Canvas prior to class, and TA sections were very helpful and I am glad that there were many study materials provided for this course. Despite the stress of having to keep up with the material weekly, I really did learn so much coming out of it. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah - anyone interested in Biology or Medicine. This is drinking from a firehose, but it is such a cool experience and there is so much to be learned. Wow. ",
            "\u00a0Despite the workload I would recommend it. The class was well organized and was interesting. ",
            "\u00a0What's hard about this course is that the final and all the quizzes are free response, and often target very specific concepts out of the many required for each week. This course is definitely doable if you master each of the study guides each week, otherwise, it's kind of frustrating. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if youre interested in cell biology or are considering entering a field where cell biology is relevant. But be aware that the best way (in my opinion) to prepare for the quizzes is to read/take notes from the textbook and that takes a long time. ",
            "\u00a0This course was incredible. It provided such a thorough overview of cell biology and gives a solid foundation to continue in the MCDB department. I came out of the course feeling like I learned so much. ",
            "\u00a0The content is super important but the class is very difficult and I would not recommend as a course if not necessary. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Its painful but worth it ",
            "\u00a0Yes! If you have any interest in biology, I highly recommend this course. It's easily the best secondary level bio course, and the material and teaching are both fantastic. It's a hard class, and the weekly quizzes are stressful, but in my opinion it's well worth it. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend with hesitation. It was hard :( ",
            "\u00a0Yesit is one of the best biology courses Ive taken at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I would recommend this course for students committed to learning and intrigued by the inner workings of cells and organelles. You must be willing to dedicate at least a couple hours weekly to reviewing the material for the quizzes, which make up 60% of the final grade. This can be annoying sometimes, but overall it is the only way to get students to learn the material well and continuously over the course of the semester, and is actually helpful in the end. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student majoring in biology or neuroscience. The course was very time consuming but this will pay off since you develop a very good overview of cell biology that will serve as a useful base of knowledge as you go forward in studies in biology. A student not majoring in biology or a related major may feel like the time that goes into this course takes away from other coursework. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any pre-med student or student interested in understanding a wide range of cellular mechanisms and how they explain larger picture physiological phenomena. To those interested in a handful of topics, I would recommend attending a few lectures or learning it on your own. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this question another student, especially if they are majoring in MCDB. I really enjoyed learning all the material and thought the class well organized. It has been my favorite course thus far. ",
            "\u00a0I probably would, but only if you actually enjoy biology. The material is very interesting, and the professors are generally quite good. The weekly quizzes are a lot, and if you're not passionate about the material they definitely become overwhelming. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I would recommend this course for anyone that wants to have a good understanding of biology in general. This course looks at a lot of different aspects of life and is able to connect it all. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to biology majors and pre-med students because it provides an interesting perspective on biology. It gives the common in depth mechanisms that each process uses to help you understand how mitosis and such works. ",
            "\u00a0I believe every MCDB student at least should take this course- this is a true biology course and you learn from the greats! Difficult, but if you can get through this you're set for anything. The knowledge gained by the end is such a gift.\r\n. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to other students, unless you just want to have resources to teach yourself a whole lot about cell biology. I took this course after hearing that it was hard but really good. I found that it was hard but not that good, simply because I was self-teaching myself so much of the material every week and just hoping I had memorized the elements that were most important. I am someone who normally gets a lot out of lecture, but the information was overwhelming and poorly emphasized. "
