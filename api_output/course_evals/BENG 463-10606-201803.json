            "\u00a0The first half of this course was better than the second half, in that we did cover concepts about immunoengineering and understanding how to use the body's immune system to treat disease. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, I didn't learn much from this class. Lectures were often repetitive or confusing, but I guess it did give me introductory information about the immune system. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the immune system and some interesting ways to use nanotechnology to develop solutions to immune-related issues. ",
            "\u00a0This course was very ambitious in teaching us about the intersection between immunology and biomedical engineering. I appreciated the insight on techniques and current therapies for immunoengineering. ",
            "\u00a0Learned a great deal about current immunotherapies and innovations involving nanoparticulate systems and chemotherapies as well as information concerning mechanisms in the immune system like the immunological synapse or the lymph nodes. ",
            "\u00a0Some immunological knowledge ",
            "\u00a0Course focuses on immunoengineering and specifically the professor's research -- nanoparticles ",
            "\u00a0I learned the basics of the immune system but also about how to use techniques to modify its function. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more about our immune system. "

        [
            "\u00a0We didn't cover nearly enough of what we were supposed to, especially in the second half of the course. It's not a hard course to manage, but we shouldn't have had to take so much extra time outside class to cover topics that should have been covered in class. The material isn't hard to understand, but the course would have been more fulfilling if we covered everything we were supposed to, especially if it's to be a good introduction into an important field in biomedical engineering. ",
            "\u00a0There are a lot of things that could be improved about this class. The professor often showed up 20-40 minutes late if at all, and the problem sets/exam questions did not make much sense and had a lot of typos. We were not given adequate information to complete the final project and the lectures could have been much more informative. ",
            "\u00a0Strength was the topic. Really interesting ideas and topics on the syllabus. Other strength is Sean, the ta. He is absolutely amazing and makes this class run. Weakness is the professor and the fact that we didn't end up actually being taught the material well. This class has a lot of potential if it was better taught. ",
            "\u00a0Some semblance of organization would be extremely welcomed. The material taught in this class was absolutely fascinating, but personally, it was not worth taking the class. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The TA, Sean, really helped to fill in the gaps of material that we didn't quite learn/understand/get to in class. He was extremely helpful and made time for us no matter what, giving us clear feedback and helping us throughout the semester. Prof. Fahmy was also good at giving good feedback when we needed to meet with him.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: I feel like we did not cover as much material as anticipated, and the overall organization of the course was lacking. Sometimes I felt lost as to how my performance in the class was. ",
            "\u00a0The course itself has the potential to be incredibly interesting, enjoyable, and thought provoking from a research standpoint, but it suffers from a lack of organization and structured proceedings. While the material is awesome, it's simply difficult to get a lot out of the class when assignments are not regular but rather are suddenly announced, and lecture notes are often not posted. With that being said, there was an attempt to adhere to the syllabus, and the material itself was really great ",
            "\u00a0Very disorganized and really really not run the best, but professor and TA are very nice and I walked out knowing more than I started with, so overall not bad. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: topic itself is fairly interesting, incredibly good TA (Sean)\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: narrow in scope as it only addresses nanoparticles really, PROFESSOR IS INCREDIBLY DISORGANIZED ",
            "\u00a0The course and syllabus were very desorganizad, even though the material was very interesting. ",
            "\u00a0A strength was that even durig lecture the professor let us think for ourselves. The course could have been improved with a little more organization. "

            "\u00a0If you want an easy good grade for your engineering credits, you can take this class, but expect to be disappointed. The material is definitely cool but we didn't cover enough of it. ",
            "\u00a0No, I would not recommend this course. The professor does not seem invested in the class at all, the problem sets and exams make no sense, and the grading system is very unclear. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class, but only if a good ta is involved with it. Tarek does not do a great job and relies a lot on the TA. Sean is absolutely amazing and saves the class, but he is graduating, so make sure there is someone good involved. ",
            "\u00a0I value the information gained through making it through the course, but would not recommend the course until its organization is completely reworked. Otherwise, the knowledge is fascinating, but can probably be gained in far more productive ways than through this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you are truly interested in this course and are willing to put in the work during and after class. It is probably necessary to meet with the TA to make sure you're on the right track. ",
            "\u00a0It's an interesting course, but it suffers from its lack of structure. The work load is somewhat low, relatively speaking, which makes it somewhat attractive as an additional credit, and it is possible to enjoy the material while learning interesting new topics, but it is necessary to really stress the importance of remaining rigid in being proactive in getting lecture notes to be posted and whatnot. ",
            "\u00a0Very disorganized and really really not run the best, but professor and TA are very nice and I walked out knowing more than I started with, so overall not bad. ",
            "\u00a0This class was very disorganized and the TA Sean did most of the work. "
