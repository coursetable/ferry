            "\u00a0Viable career options for recent doctoral graduates, the types of skills and experience sought in these careers, and a sense of what these careers are like day-in and out . ",
            "\u00a0This course taught me professional skills such as interviewing, cover letter writing, teaching statement, and the research statement. These are essential skills in order to be successful at job placement, however they're typically not taught in a traditional class setting in a structured manner. I also gained a lot of informal professional development knowledge such as what it's like to work in a wide variety of careers through panel discussions and readings. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an understanding of many of the opportunities available for PhDs. I developed a much better understanding of the materials necessary to apply for these jobs and how to make these materials more competitive. I also improved my interviewing skills and learned much more about the phone interviewing process and how intimidating it can be and how to deal with that. "

The usefulness of these skills far exceeded my expectations as I now feel like I have some grounding for understanding how positions within academia and outside academia work and some idea of what different positions are looking for in application materials.

            "\u00a0I honestly don't have any comments for improvement, I really enjoyed this class. Great job Indy and Bill. ",
            "\u00a0Having high quality panelists to speak to was a highlight. As well as having honest discourse about careers prospects and the challenges of being a graduate student, post doc, professor, employee at an NGO, ETC ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: great all around resource for doctoral students nearing the end of their PhD, both instructors were a great resource, direct commentary about various job fields from those that work in them, incentive to get an early start on important early-career tasks e.g. research/teaching statements, small course size facilitated good discussion\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: some topics were redundant with preexisting requirements in the program (academic ethics), usefulness of readings were all over the place, but overall the course had few weaknesses within its designated scope ",
            "\u00a0Strengths are that a community is created of post-candidacy students at both FES and EEB which previously did not exist but was definitely needed. Also, professional skills are taught that are extremely necessary but previously not shared effectively with doctoral students. My one thought for improvement was that at times the written assignments were a bit confusing as to whom they should be addressed, in particular the cover letter. ",
            "\u00a0The strengths are the range of topics/readings/visitors selected and the way the application packet for each student is slowly built throughout the semester.\r\n\r\nOne way the class might be improved, or perhaps just more applicable to a broader range of students, would be to have more visitors that are less ecology focused. I recognize that this was largely dictated by the fact that both instructors are ecologically oriented, but I think the structure of this class would work well for PhD students across all disciplines at FES and could be improved with visitors with a wider range of backgrounds. \r\n\r\nInstructors provided some feedback on packet materials as each piece was completed. I would have liked to get more feedback on my research statement, and perhaps even feedback on my packet as a whole at the end of the semester. I also would have liked to have one more class after we did the interviews to hear other students' experience and key takeaways from the mock interviews. "

            "\u00a0I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this course to students in their third fourth and fifth year. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend they take this course. This is probably the most useful class I have taken as a graduate student. Indy and Bill pulled back the curtain on tasks that we all have to do but have no instruction in (ranging from writing a cover letter or teaching statement, or being a leader or mentor). ",
            "\u00a0Particularly because this is a busy time in the target audience's graduate career, just be prepared to hustle to get some of the required assignments done in time. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course to any considering it and would recommend that the student not wait until their final year to take the course. I think in retrospect, this course will have the largest impact on my graduate career and beyond and I am grateful for the insights and skills gained. ",
            "\u00a0If another PhD student were to ask me about this class I would first acknowledge that, yes, it's strange to register for a class when there are no longer class requirements associated with your degree. I think most PhD students would be concerned that the time put into taking a class at this stage would not be worth the reward. Nevertheless, I would point out that while called a \"class,\" it feels like more of a workshop designed to give PhD students an understanding of their job options and to help get a head start on creating your packet of application materials. I actually think that it's good to keep it as a \"class\" to provide impetus for students making the commitment to show up and participate throughout the semester, rather than dropping out, as might be the case if it were offered as a workshop.\r\n\r\nThe overall time commitment and workload, appropriately, feel less than a normal FES class, and the benefits to the student are enormous. I think students who decide against putting in the time in for taking this class are likely at a disadvantage at job seeking and generally competing on (and understanding) the job market. Related to this, I think it was critical to the success of later stage PhD students in the class that the instructors were very understanding when revisions for a paper in peer-review needed to take priority over deadlines for the application packet materials that comprised the homework of this class. \r\n\r\nDespite the relatively low time commitment required by the class, when I put together my job application packet at the end of the semester I was surprised at what I had accomplished, and at how it helped me feel more ready to actually submit that packet to a job ad!  Seeing all the pieces come together made me realize how intimidating it would be to sit down and write out the whole packet at once, rather than at a pace broken up nicely over a few months. \r\n\r\nFinally, I would encourage PhD students to think carefully about the time in their PhD that they decide to take this class. I think there is an argument to be made that this class is most helpful and directly applicable for people within a year or so of finishing and getting on the job market. Though, there are some points in the class where, as a PhD student, you will learn about more opportunities at Yale to take advantage of in your time remaining (such as workshops at the Center for Teaching and Learning). I understand that the class may only be offered infrequently, so perhaps that will also drive a decision on what stage of your PhD to take it. But, I would recommend: Take It! "
