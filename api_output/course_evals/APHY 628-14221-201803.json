            "\u00a0I learned that functional integral methods are extremely useful in calculating interactions. ",
            "\u00a0The course allowed me to get a deeper understanding of the renormalization group framework in statistical physics. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about the tools of the statistical mechanics of fields. In particular, I studied the renormalization group machinery and realized how to apply it to certain examples such as the Ising model and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In addition to that, I learned about the quantum phase transitions and studied in what way they are connected to phase transitions in classical statistical mechanics. "

            "\u00a0Overall, the lecture was well structured and eloquently delivered. I think the material itself was very challenging. Personally, the problem sets were also very challenging. I think for a class like this which deals with challenging subjects, easier problem sets or combination of basic and advanced problems may be more helpful to students. ",
            "\u00a0The contents of the course itself is quite systematic. \r\nThe workload of this course includes assignments only, and didn't cover all the contents.\r\nThe lecturer wrote almost everything on the blackboard, which is good. But he kind of goes too fast, and I don't have enough material to go over after class. ",
            "\u00a0Nice choice of topics. Section about XY model was especially interesting. Problem sets for the course were on a very high level and perfectly complemented the course. ",
            "\u00a0I liked a lot the way in which the course was structured. In addition to that, I found that the challenging problem sets not only reinforced the lecture materials but also allowed me to learn something new. In the future, it would be great to have a full digital version of the lecture notes. "

            "\u00a0As this course deals with a specific branch of physics and rather specific concepts, I would recommend this course to any student who is already involved in or will be involved in condensed matter physics. \r\n\r\nAs a student in experimental solid state physics group, I personally think that for experimentalists this course is a bit too theoretical. Nevertheless, this course serves important purpose of exposing students in condensed matter physics to a central concept such as renormalization group. ",
            "\u00a0I will commend it only to students with a very solid background. ",
            "\u00a0The course is very interesting if you want to study statisical mechanics at a more advanced level. The course studies stat mech of fields including course-graining of discrete systems and study of phase transitions. It can be hard to follow derivations and physical arguments as presented in class but if you are interested in the material it's a good class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, the course serves as a nice introduction to modern statistical physics. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, statistical mechanics II is a very important course for anyone who is interested in theoretical physics (especially, in condensed matter theory). "
