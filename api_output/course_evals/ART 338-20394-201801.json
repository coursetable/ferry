            "\u00a0I learned how to better communicate visually and actually make photographs that mean something. Technically, I used this class as an opportunity to learn how to use lighting gear as well as more advanced editing techniques. ",
            "\u00a0There were a lot of technical skills such as how to correct a photo using photoshop and lighting that taught in class, however, not much about how to shoot good photos through use of composition and colors. ",
            "\u00a0a much better understanding of how to use photoshop ",
            "\u00a0more advanced photoshop skills, continuous and strobe lighting, film scanning, printing techniques, really thinking about my artist intent in my work and making cohesive projects, how to function as an artist in many aspects of the title - how to continue making art after college "

            "\u00a0As opposed to the intro level class, where there were many small assignments to acclimate students to using a camera and photographing regularly, there were relatively few assignments. I see this as a major strength of the course. It allowed me to have more time to mull over ideas, find better throughlines between disparate images, and more carefully plan upcoming shoots. This was probably one of the most fulfilling art classes I have taken here so far. ",
            "\u00a0Both the strength and weakness are that the class is very exclusive, having most of the students have been taking the photography track, there's a lot of professional insight of photography, but strongly lack diversity in the subject matter and approach. ",
            "\u00a0very strong course. i enjoyed how it built upon the things learned in intro photo, but i think the \"review\" of the basics could be shortened. though different students came in with different photo background, it felt like there was so much new stuff packed into the second half of the course that i wish i could have spent more time on, whereas there were some aspects of review in the first half of the course that felt repetitive from stuff learned in intro photo. but strengths -- assignments, five obstructions was very helpful and fun. more self-driven project, which I thought was appropriate as well. "

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student who is ready to put in the work to make better photographs. The overall vibe is a lot different than the intro class -- be prepared to come up with your own ideas and artistic themes, as opposed to following a prompt. ",
            "\u00a0Not sure. It may be valuable to students who intend to stay in the photography track. But I also think photography is a bonus skill for everyone to have. ",
            "\u00a0definitely this course, especially if you've done intro digital. you go deeper into different photographic techniques -- mostly digital but also combining digital and analog. there is more independent direction for assignments and projects, and its really an opportunity to explore what about photography interests you. visits to art gallery to learn about different printing techniques, nyc museums and also looking at mfa portfolios in art library. ka-man is a fantastic professor and really willing to help out students. a small class size so there's also opportunities to learn from and build community with fellow classmates. if you enjoyed intro digital, take this course - especially if it is taught by ka-man!
