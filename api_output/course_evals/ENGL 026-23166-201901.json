            "\u00a0This was a really interesting and unique course! We covered a very wide range of texts that grappled in some way with (what is now considered) Connecticut, and what it means for writing to be grounded in or indebted to a particular place. We read obscure slave narratives, accounts from colonial New England, fiction/film about mid-twentieth century Connecticut, etc. I'm impressed that we were able to cover such expansive ground concerning both content and time in a single semester. The first assignment we did as a creative reflection on place was a lot of fun. I also gained a bit of insight into close reading and choosing my own topic for a research paper. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about written works, especially those pertaining to identity and place-making. Through classroom discussions, I was also able to develop my oration skills and better enunciate my thoughts. The several writing assignments were also highly conducive to the improvement of my writing skills. "

            "\u00a0Strengths: Professor Hickey is lovely! We read a wide range of literature, and we had the opportunity for a lot of individual attention because the class was so small. That also meant that we got to have a say in what we wanted to study and could shape the syllabus in a direction that caters to our particular interests. Even with just six of us, we all came from different backgrounds and wanted to explore different things, which brought additional diversity to the group. We also went on a ton of excursions, including the Beinecke, Sterling Manuscripts & Archives, the Pequot Museum & the Yale Farm. Weaknesses: It could be a bit difficult to strike a balance in conversation with such a small class, though this hopefully won't be an issue in future semesters. However, considering that there were only six students in this class, Professor Hickey did a wonderful job at making sure that the conversation moved without being domineering. My only real suggestion was that I think it would be interesting to read some more pieces that more explicitly talked about Yale as an institution, other than what we saw in the primary documents in Sterling. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths:\r\nProfessor was great, lead very thought-provoking discussions.\r\nSmall seminar size was also conducive to discussions.\r\nWorks of all different time periods and types of authors were read.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses:\r\nThe theme of the class is very broad -- at times, it was difficult to connect the topics we were discussing to the central idea of placemaking.

            "\u00a0Yes! I got to read a lot of literature that affects my conception of myself at Yale and the place it occupies. Professor Hickey's a joy to work with and the assignments were intellectually stimulating but not overbearing. ",
            "\u00a0This course with Prof. Hickey has been one of the most enjoyable courses that I have taken so far my freshman year. The exploration of the concept of placemaking through Connecticut history was not only eye-opening but also so relevant. I learned so much about the history of the area around Yale. A small seminar class like this was especially conducive to discussions but also field trip arrangements -- having only 6 people in the class made it much easier to schedule a trip to the Peaquot Museum that everyone was able to attend. The field trips to both the Peaquot Museum and the Yale Farm were very refreshing. The two trips lent a unique perspective of examining place and how it shapes the interactions within it that made them a highlight of the course. "
