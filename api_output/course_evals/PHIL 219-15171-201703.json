            "\u00a0I learned how Latin American political thoughts were in conversation with their European counterparts, Machiavelli and his political philosophy, Che Guevara and his early thoughts, what is populism ",
            "\u00a0I gained thoughtful insights into the themes permeating Latin American Political Thought as a whole and was encouraged to think critically about both the western canon and the concept of a Latin American canon. ",
            "\u00a0I gained knowledge of pre-Columbian Latin America, different theories of government, ways for thinking about revolution, the inception of race in Latin America, and ongoing debates in Latin American political thought. ",
            "\u00a0Connecting classic philosophical thinkers (Marx, Aristotle, Machiavelli) with contemporary racial and critical theory is a hard task but this class synthesizes them perfectly. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more than I could have ever possibly imagined about the political thought in Latin America and its relation to both indigenous origins and Western thought. I loved the discussions we had in class as well as the paper topics. The concepts were varied but built upon each other so that analysis of the different texts became easier as the course went on. ",
            "\u00a0Even though I was born and raised in South America, I had never before taken a class that dealt with South American philosophy and politics specifically. There are very few courses in the Yale Political Science department that do this, and much less in the political philosophy track. So this class was a tremendous opportunity to get a non-Western perspective on the world that was simultaneously about a part of the world that I consider home. The course itself is designed to be a bit of a survey course with a lot of reading, but I felt that we got to dive deeply into each of the thinkers and make connections between them and with Western philosophers in a way that was very challenging and rewarding. "

            "\u00a0We had a lot of readings every week so it was a lot to handle, however, having presentations to summarize each reading helped me understand each one better. The class discussions were really interesting and helped me understand more about the author's rhetoric and intention more than I would have if I had read the text on my own. \r\n\r\nWe were always behind schedule because Professor von Vacano dedicated so much time to each reading. Since we were not following the schedule, it was hard to remember what I had read to prepare for the week's reading that I did a week ago. ",
            "\u00a0This course was excellent, Professor von Vacano was always very willing to work with students and gave very clear feedback on our assignments.  He encouraged us to critically engage with the authors we were reading and provided incredibly helpful insight. ",
            "\u00a0I think this is a wonderful course. It provides a solid foundation in political theory on Latin America, and covers a range of topics. The course provides students with the strength to think about political theory in Latin America from a range of perspectives. I think the one way the course could be improved is by making a few texts assigned reading for future iterations of this course -- I am thinking of Machiavelli  as he was often mentioned in class but not all the students had read his work previously. Besides that, it might be helpful to cut back on the amount of reading each week, as there was often much more content than could be covered in the allotted time for class. ",
            "\u00a0There was a large workload and we were always behind but there was also a freedom to discuss anything from any of the readings that were compelling for us. ",
            "\u00a0While all of the reading that we did was incredibly interesting, at times it was more than 200 or so pages a week (and could even reach 400), which was a lot especially since these works were not light reading. Not that any content should be cut, but since we even ran out of time in class usually for all of the work, it might be useful to trim down on some of the extraneous authors. ",
            "\u00a0I loved the survey nature of the course and its emphasis on Socratic discussion and debate, but I wish there had been fewer readings so we didn't feel rushed to get to all of them in two hours. That being said, I'm grateful for the depth and breadth of the readings, and especially those that were by and about native and ancient communities. "

            "\u00a0It was a great class to learn about how Latin America political thoughts were formed! There were only 7 people in the course and I really felt comfortable asking questions and speaking up in section. There is a lot of reading and sometimes it's too much but when is a Social Science course not too much reading. \r\n\r\nProfessor von Vacano's teaching style facilitated discussions and understanding. We had actual disagreements in our class which was refreshing. One of my favorite courses this semester! ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to another student.  The course material was challenging but definitely manageable, and I felt a gained a lot of valuable insight into both the texts we read and their relation to European political thought as a whole. ",
            "\u00a0I would a hundred percent recommend this course to another students! Professor von Vacano is incredibly kind, and you'll learn a lot from him. You'll learn a range of things from pre-Columbian thought to 20th century revolutions in Latin America. You're exposed to a few of the fundamental, canonical works of the region, and some of its greatest philosophers. The course puts them in conversation with (and challenges the conception of) the Western canon. I would say that if you haven't taken courses in political philosophy/philosophy,  this could be a bit of a reach as von Vacano assumes a level of basic philosophy knowledge that not all students necessarily had at the beginning of the semester. The course is definitely helpful for thinking about frameworks to approach political theory in Latin America moreso than learning about Latin American history, development, etc. Definitely would recommend in the event this course-or anything else by von Vacano is taught here at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0This course was absolutely amazing and thought-provoking and I would strongly recommend to other students. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Most of the Yale courses are far too westernized, and Von Vacano does an excellent job of using the western background of the students to elucidate common themes in the Latin American work. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Everyone should take courses that deal with texts outside of the Western canon, and I think this is one of the only classes that does this intentionally. "
