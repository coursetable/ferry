            "\u00a0This layout of professor Yeazell's lectures really taught me a lot about how to formulate an argument; even when I didn't buy some of her arguments based on the content itself, I really saw how she managed to almost convince me, which was really helpful when writing the papers! I also learned how to read and analyze a big work like a novel (which I'm not used to doing, but I feel like every English major should be able to do!) and my writing improved DRASTICALLY! Seriously. The first graded paper for me wasn't great, but based on office hours, comments, etc. I learned how to really craft an argument and be deliberate in my analysis. I became a much more careful, but more convincing writer, which is awesome. ",
            "\u00a0This class is a great way to read amazing literature. Professor Yeazell's lectures were always interesting and engaging, and her enthusiasm for the material made the class all the more exciting. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think about theory in relation to novels! Really broadened my understanding of how to think about a novel. ",
            "\u00a0I'm really glad I read the books on the syllabus. I especially don't think I would have sat down and read Middlemarch on my own just because it's so long, but I'm SO glad I did for this class -- it is incredible!! ",
            "\u00a0This course gave me some new lenses for reading and thinking about novels. Mostly, I think I'll be able to read female characters in Victorian novels with a more nuanced understanding of their social position and its psychological effects. ",
            "\u00a0The course helped me see these books through various lenses as well as just increasing my knowledge of the novels. ",
            "\u00a0I gained a fuller and subtler understanding of realism and the novel form. And I read five books I've really been wanting to read. ",
            "\u00a0Deeper appreciation of Victorian Novels and the arguments they're making beneath the sometimes-cheesy plotting. Incredible close-reading insights from Professor Yeazell's lectures, as well as a greater understanding of the historical context in which the novels were written, and the scholarly arguments that have been put forward about each novel. ",
            "\u00a0A good survey knowledge of the big Victorian novels ",
            "\u00a0I got to reach a bunch of novels that I've always wanted to read! It's hard to name concrete things that I \"learned,\" but my writing and thinking definitely improved, and the lectures always helped me look at the novels in new ways. ",
            "\u00a0A overview of some of the themes and motifs at play in the genre of the Victorian Novel. ",
            "\u00a0I developed writing skills through essays and literary  analysis skills through close readings and section discussions. "

            "\u00a0One of the best things, I think, about this course is the final book! On one hand, Tess of the D'Urbervilles really bummed me out (spoiler?) but on another, I think that the course's set up really helped me understand the movement of Victorian novels through time, and how Tess really exemplifies the shift towards more modern works. I feel like one thing that really interested me, that I wish we had gotten more of, was the biography of the writers! I think that, when you're considering gender and class (and narrative form!) in the Victorian-era novels, a big piece of interest lies in how women vs men & higher class vs lower class writers represent women/men/gentility/lower class people and places, and how the reception of certain novels relates to the gender and class of those writers. I think the course might improve in exploring those ideas a bit more, or at least giving students the informational groundwork with which to do it themselves. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Yeazell is such an engaging lecturer and did an amazing job at highlighting aspects of the very long novels we read. The syllabus is great, and I think it contains just the right amount of material  not too many novels such that we didn't fully discuss them, but enough to push us to keep reading. \r\n\r\nI also really liked the optional first essay deadline and the chance to revise, because it really helped me think about my writing and what I could do to improve. ",
            "\u00a0I really, genuinely enjoyed reading the books in this course -- reading them felt leisurely in a way that's rare for an English class. I think that's partly a testament to Professor Yeazell's infectious love for Victorian novels. In her lectures, she engaged with the books as a professor but also as a reader, and left room for us to appreciate the experience of reading. I really appreciated that. As for improving the course, I think the ID's on the midterm and final were often very difficult (especially given how long each of the books were.) I also think the final carried a lot of weight towards our final grade and (just by nature of being a test) didn't really ask us to engage with the texts in a meaningful way. I would have rather had an extra paper. ",
            "\u00a0This course is well-designed. It's a lecture, which means that it's one single, coherent, well-articulated position on the subject in question, not (as with a seminar)  a weird cubism of different perspectives cobbled together. That has its advantages and its disadvantages, but I think as single perspectives go Professor Yeazell's is a very good one, and worth hearing. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very strong ",
            "\u00a0I think the amount of reading is a little unreasonable for a lecture class. Cutting one novel might be possible (my least favorite was Great Expectations). But the course feels very coherent and has clear continuity. The content is fascinating. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures (and my section discussions, thanks to an amazing TA) were the high points of the course. The readings were well-chosen, but there was too much reading week-to-week. There are two tests (midterm and final) and two papers. I found the essay questions on the tests unnecessary, since the course already had essays. I would have preferred shorter tests -- worth a smaller percentage of the overall grade -- that just consisted of passage IDs and close reading. ",
            "\u00a0The material was interesting and Professor Yeazell was a good lecturer but I felt like section was a waste of time ",
            "\u00a0The syllabus is great--every book is incredibly rich, not to mention entertaining. The lectures were always interesting. Professor Yeazell doesn't use slides or lecture notes, which can make note-taking difficult. You have to be paying attention 100% of the time, or else you lose the train of thought. But it's manageable, and the important thing isn't recording all of Professor Yeazell's thoughts, but learning how to close-read a novel and put it in historical context. ",
            "\u00a0Overall an excellent class!! My only critical feedback is that the final exam seemed unnecessarily long. It could have been the length of our midterm. The three hours of writing kind of crushed my soul. ",
            "\u00a0Analysis of readings were provided in lecture but section also offered a place for opened ended analysis. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0One doesn't tend to think of Victorian English writers as particularly diverse, but I think that this class really explores the ways that the diversity (in terms of gender and class as well as, in a more limited capacity, race) that is represented in the novels manifests itself in the narrative/language/etc. and what the impact/stakes of that manifestation were and are. If you are at all interested in representation of women or lower class people, or in novels, or in the Victorian era, or want your writing to improve, you should definitely take this class! There are a lot of readings, and the papers are tough, but you'll definitely grow and have a lot to show for your work! (Plus everyone should get to hear Yeazell lecture!) ",
            "\u00a0[I took the class in Fall 2018] \r\nReading Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, Great Expectations, Middlemarch, and Tess of the D'Urbervilles was really fun--although I admittedly had entered the class already interested in reading these books, I definitely had not read any of them before, and I had no idea what to expect with these books. Prof Yeazell's lectures were clear and easy to understand, and I left the class with a deeper appreciation for Victorian novels.\r\nThis class (again, in Fall 2018) required two essays with the opportunity to revise one of them. One of the essays had to be written on either Great Expectations or Middlemarch. I found this essay requirement very feasible.\r\nThe one disclaimer to this course is, of course, the intensity of this reading load. A lot of people (ie me) end up falling behind on the reading around midway through the semester, when the class was reading Expectations/Middlemarch. And catching up on those two books is no easy task. Do make time to read on a regular basis. These books are long. Very, very long. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great class and Professor Yeazell's lectures are so engaging and interesting. The novels are so worthwhile to read and think about. ",
            "\u00a0IF you like Victorian novels, yes. It will not make you like them though, if they're not your thing. ",
            "\u00a0If you are excited about the books, I would recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, if you love novels of this period. Otherwise not. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course ",
            "\u00a0I would. The reading is a pleasure, as long as you know how much of it you're getting yourself into. ",
            "\u00a0You should take this course if you want to read all five of the books on the syllabus, and are willing to put in the time to do so. These novels are long -- Middlemarch is over 700 pages -- so it's definitely a big commitment (though a fun one, if Victorian Novels are your thing). If you want to engage with the novels, then I'd absolutely recommend the course -- Professor Yeazell is a fantastic guide through these texts -- but if you're going to be skimming the reading the night before, I'd recommend taking a different class. ",
            "\u00a0If you need an 18th century English credit, this class is a good option ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course--but you should only take it if you're excited about doing the reading. Professor Yeazell has shortened the syllabus from previous years, so the readings are not as overwhelming as some students have said. (Plus, it's a class about novels, so your reading should always be entertaining!) But you might have to spend, say, four hours on a Saturday with Middlemarch. If that sounds fun, then DEFINITELY take this course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Great books, awesome lecturer, good TFs. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to any student interested in nineteenth century literature. "
