            "\u00a0A great dive into land use topics - a great variety from renewable energy to research municipal code - all very useful! It was a great opportunity to work closely on a land use project on a flexible schedule. ",
            "\u00a0Working with a client was very helpful. I had to manage my time carefully, have open lines of communication with the client, and constantly check in about the format of the project to make sure I was fulfilling the requirements/needs the client had. The guest lecturers were not all very useful to me in particular but I would say at least half directly contributed a skill I would utilize in the future. Hearing from practitioners teaches students in a way a textbook cant' because it shows the real life application of something. That is in valuable. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures on finding zoning information, and analyzing census data were very useful, but perhaps a class exercise around using these tools would have been effective as well. ",

I only discovered this after driving 2.5 hours to visit my client. They didn't have a clear project for me to complete, and I had to come up with something on my own, which is not what I was expecting. Jessica was helpful with coming up with a good project that was interesting to me. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of FES classes bring in regular guest speakers, but Jessica had really GREAT speakers each week. They were actually engaging at speaking/presenting, had useful things to share, and even though the class was a series of guest lectures, it still felt cohesive. I think it would've been nice to have a day or two where we spent the class discussing and debriefing without a guest, but that's all I would change. ",
            "\u00a0I think the guest speakers are great but maybe there could be more discussion. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: wide variety of projects to choose from so it caters to basically all types of students. Jessica is a great instructor. Field trips was useful and insightful. \r\n\r\nWeaknesses: the speakers were not all the best (content-wise and engagement-wise) but it could be a product of my personal interest. ",
            "\u00a0The guest lecture format is good for keeping class interesting and engaging. It helps show how varied the potential field of work is and exposes many people from outside the university to students. The once weekly class meetings felt a little short. Perhaps a longer class or two classes per week would better facilitate lectures with longer discussions afterwards or time for other class exercises. ",
            "\u00a0I imagine if you have a great client this class is great. However, if you have a bad client there's no compensating for that. Make sure clients are engaged with clear project goals for the students? I also found the classes completely boring and unhelpful. ",
            "\u00a0One strength of the course is its variety of different presenters who provide a varied picture of land use decisions in practice, but I would say that the same component is also a hindrance to the course.  There were certainly some days in which the topic was so specific (renewable energy siting, etc.) that it felt less applicable to me.  I wonder too if the course could incorporate more specific readings for homework throughout the semester, to keep an ideological flow throughout the course and ensure that students leave with more than just a cursory understanding of various disjointed land use topics.\r\n\r\nI very much appreciated the open-ended nature of the final projects, and how available Jessica was to work with students throughout the process.   That level of commitment and individualization makes every project useful for students in their professional growth. ",
            "\u00a0This is a great course. I have no suggestions for improvement. ",
            "\u00a0Predominantly focused on urban issues. Needs more non-urban focus perhaps through a sister land use clinic course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths is the freedom to conduct a project of your choosing and the regular check-ins provided by Jessica. Weakness is that some of the lectures don't always feel super relevant or necessary, depending on one's project. ",
            "\u00a0We had a lot of really interesting guest speakers that would have been great to have lunch with, like some other courses I've had were structured. The course was also a great time slot (ended at 11:50am) to allow for lunches. ",
            "\u00a0Unfortunately my project wasn't great for this course, so the strengths for me were the speakers (who were generally great and covered a lot of ground!). I understand that there are always going to be some projects that don't work out that well so no hard feelings there, but I would have appreciated the projects getting started earlier in the semester (if felt like we were a month into school before I was able to start on mine). It also would have been nice to touch base about student projects with other students before the last class presentations, I didn't know what many others were working on until then. \r\n\r\nI also didn't feel like the field trip to Stamford was worth the time. I'm sure the chilly, wet weather and transit issue made it worse, but I learned very little and it was almost 4 hours of my day at a busy time in April. ",
