            "\u00a0I like the teaching style and the way the texts are organized - I feel like sometimes there is too much information on the slides, though, and thought the lectures could be condensed because I always feel it a pity when not everything is presented in class. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of the course was in effectively introducing a niche and difficult topic to non-specialist. The approach takes by the instructor, which was largely chronological and thematic, was excellent at introducing new material. I also really enjoyed the trips to West Campus and to the YUAG which were really instructive and took advantage of Yale's resources. "

        [
            "\u00a0Yes, though I have to say the class is designed for more art history or architecture-oriented students, not for everyone, which is also not a bad thing because everyone is very knowledgable in class conversations. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this other student, either in art history or interested in Chinese literature. One of the strengths of the course was also the students from different academic backgrounds (architects, art history majors, historians), which really allowed us to approach the material from a variety of ways.
