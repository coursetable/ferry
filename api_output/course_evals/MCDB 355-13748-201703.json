            "\u00a0This class did a great job of encouraging independent research, independent thinking, and critical thinking. Additionally, it taught me a lot about developing a critical approach to research, and it allowed me to expand my horizon into an area of science I previously had not encountered. ",
            "\u00a0the central skill I acquired was the ability to effectively skim/read/absorb scientific papers ",
            "\u00a0Because of this course, I am much better equipped to read complex research articles and understand them. I learned a lot about recent scientific techniques and technologies, and I also learned how to think critically about scientific studies. ",
            "\u00a0This class was instrumental in developing the skills necessary for me to both appreciate and understand primary literature in the field. ",
            "\u00a0We delved into the specific mechanisms responsible for the development and persistence of diseases tied to the malfunctioning of cytoskeleton proteins. We learned how to break down scientific journal articles in order to extract the most important information. We learned how to read scientific writing critically. ",
            "\u00a0I gained valuable insights into how to read and critically discuss the literature within the cell biology field. The course also provided excellent opportunities to both present and write scientifically. ",
            "\u00a0This class was super interesting! We learned how to read and analyze papers deeply. Mainly, I learn A LOT of laboratory methods thats I didnt know existed. Very cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I improved my ability to analyze scientific papers, and understand the procedures and outcomes that came from the detailed experiments. I also developed my ability to discuss topics and answer questions, and gained an appreciation for the cytoskeleton and the diseases that come from manipulating it. ",
            "\u00a0I gained the skills to critically read scientific papers and thoroughly dissect the methodology and results. The course also did a great job of introducing each topic either through Dean C's or students' presentations to give good context for each cytoskeletal component. I also learned how integral the cytoskeleton is to biological functionality and disease states that can result through faulty cytoskeletal systems. ",
            "\u00a0I felt like I was finally learning to apply concepts that I'd learned from previous MCDB courses into a skillset that would be used in the real world. It also helped me to understand how to structure my own research and scientific writing. ",
            "\u00a0This course was structured perfectly! Reading the primary literature teaches more than many textbooks/memorization/exams can offer. Gained insight into types of articles that presented data well and articles with gaps; how to critique primary literature; how to synthesize primary literature into an analysis. The first course in the MCDB major that I genuinely enjoyed....MCDB should take note---more courses such as this one should be offered to students who want to delve into the primary literature. If more of the intro courses were structured in this way, my undergrad time in MCDB would have been drastically improved. "

            "\u00a0I thought the class was structured perfectly. No real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0strengths: clear guidelines, consistent workload, interesting content, good ratio of intellectual payoff to workload\r\n\r\nweaknesses: sometimes too consistent? people in the seminar fell into a comfortable status quo/lull in which not much interesting was said (beyond the content of the paper) ",
            "\u00a0The class is run very well - I particularly enjoyed the special topics in the last few weeks. ",
            "\u00a0Cytoskeleton & Disease offers a great opportunity to read and converse about the real world application of many laboratory techniques and mechanisms that lower level biology courses introduce at surface level. The syllabus includes a number of very interesting articles. Class discussion is helpful in picking those articles apart in order to take away the most important information. ",
            "\u00a0This course was chill and informative! Couldnt have asked for a better upper level MCDB elective. ",
            "\u00a0I enjoyed reading the journal article assigned every week for discussion, and doing reading responses. The topics were fairly easy to grasp once Dr. Chandhoke explained them, and she answered all of our questions with ease. I don't believe this class has a weakness. It was amazing! Would certainly take again! Just maybe not at 9:25AM haha. ",
            "\u00a0The course was well structured as a senior/upper level seminar. If you had a strong background in the MCDB sequence already, understanding the papers was relatively straight forward if you put in the time. Both the students and professor were great at maintaining a discussion and bringing up interesting questions while analyzing the papers. The course load was very manageable and a good complement to the senior thesis. The discussion style was good given that our class rarely had pauses but it was also a good change of pace when we were assigned figures and presented them after preparing for 10-15 minutes. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths - Dean C was by far one of the greatest strengths of this course! She really helped to engage all of us and try to choose papers that were interesting and applicable. She also had a sense of humor that was spot on, and she made you feel welcome in class and unafraid to say something stupid while also making sure everyone felt accountable for showing up to class prepared.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses - it is admittedly easy to merely skim the paper and get by with little engagement. However, on the days that I did prepare well, I definitely got more out of the class, so I acknowledge that we are each accountable for our own learning. One thing I think might help to engage everyone more throughout the class is if we had more small group discussion. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely fantastic course! Strengths: small class discussion, student-guided presentation of papers, variation in topics "

            "\u00a0Would definitely recommend. Dean C. is an angel! ",
            "\u00a0If you need the senior requirement, just do it. Low workload with interesting papers, plus you'll get really good at what you'll need to be good at in the future anyway  absorbing scientific content from primary literature. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. The papers we read were enjoyable and interesting, and the class discussions really helped me to understand the paper at a deeper level than in any other science course I have taken. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. Dean C. did an incredible job designing this course with the opera involved and contributed in a way that was very beneficial to discussion and understanding of the underlying material. The workload is very manageable and does help further understanding of the material. ",
            "\u00a0I woud recommend Cytoskeleton & Disease to any biology-minded student eager to dive a little bit deeper into the general biology taught in the introduction to biology sequence and other more general cell biology courses. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to people who have any interest in becoming more involved in science (graduate or medical degree). It offers a a chance to critically read, write, and discuss literature. It is also super interesting! With each discussed paper, you learn the in-depth details of a cytoskeleton component and its related pathways/proteins and then you zoom back out to see how that alters physiology in a disease state. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take this!! Dean C is an awesome teacher and you will learn a lot! This class was super interesting! We learned how to read and analyze papers deeply. Mainly, I learn A LOT of laboratory methods thats I didnt know existed. Very cool stuff. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course to another student. You read a journal article every week, and must complete the required number of reading responses. You get to learn so much about the cytoskeleton, and different diseases that come from malfunctions with the cytoskeleton. Along with the reading responses, there is a 5 page spotlight paper you get to complete at the end of the semester on any topic you want, it's awesome! You really get into deep discussions about experiments and related topics, and if anything is not clear, your classmates and professor are helpful in finding out the answer! 2 hour seminar at 9:25AM, so if you're not a morning person, arriving late could affect your attendance. But this class is so worth the time its scheduled at, and the knowledge you get out of it. Take it as your upper level (350+) MCDB credit! ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this course was a good balance of being able to apply the knowledge that we have learned from previous courses and being a bridge to our own research. The cytoskeleton is involved in so many different cell types and organ systems, so each paper is new and interesting. The focus on methodology and results and being able to understand interpret the figures was also well suited to the seminar environment and offers a lot more room for discussion and questions than most MCDB courses. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Finally a good MCDB course - I think this is maybe the 2nd or 3rd MCDB course that I actually liked, and largely bc the prof was so good. If it's Dean C teaching, TAKE IT. She is a true gem and role model for what STEM profs at Yale should be, and she makes you remember why you liked MCDB in the first place bc oh yeah, science can be fun! Who knew! The class feels more chill and less premed-competitive-y than most MCDB lecture courses can feel. Strongly recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The first MCDB course that I have genuinely enjoyed in the major. Fantastic course that I would absolutely recommend to seniors interested in cell bio. It is astonishing that it took four years to finally take a course in MCDB that was bearable--more courses in the major should be taught like this one. Highly recommend--great class discussion, student-led presentation of the weekly paper, fantastic professor "
