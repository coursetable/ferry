How to \"read\" cities, not just the policies that city governments pass-- the course mentions policy, but it's not a solely political class, it's much more interdisciplinary, which I loved. The lectures on branding (how cities market themselves) were most interesting to me. There's also a great overview of the history of urban trends and movements in the US, presented through a New Haven focus-- less \"sexy\" than the branding stuff, but super important to know, and pretty well-presented.

The course also gives a great overview of the history of New Haven and, through its lens, of cities in general, from the City Beautiful movement to urban renewal. I also learned a lot about architecture, about its symbolic and technical functions--I definitely won't ever look at Yale's buildings the same way ever again! Finally, the course touches on fascinating social dynamics (like racial relations in an urban context) and even journalism.  So overall, very interdisciplinary, as advertised. ",

The second part is a selection of guest speakers of varying quality: a few Yale profs, some city officials, and journalists and non-profit leaders. Then the profs wrap it up with a few closing lectures on what the present and future hold.\r\n\r\nThe course gave me a better sense of what the different issues are in the Modern city, especially with attention to transportation and mobility. I also really valued learning how to attend city meetings and the like for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0An excellent introduction to the historical roots and modern sociological, economic, and demographic dynamics of New Haven.  This is a great course to push students to breech the Yale bubble and truly understand the struggles and strife of the surrounding community. ",

            "\u00a0This course is a really good, not-too-demanding survey of urban studies concepts. It was phenomenal to learn more about New Haven through many different disciplinary lenses, and having guest speakers for a few weeks enhanced the course a lot. The assignments, because they were field-based, were really cool and open-ended, leaving a lot of room for student creativity and research. The lectures were mostly very engaging, and I feel like I do come away from the course with a much better understanding of urban history, politics, and culture. ",

            "\u00a0I think that the assignments and section in this class were very engaging and interesting. I think that lecture could be improved because as one of the few people who attended all classes, since the material being taught isn't tested, students don't feel the need to attend. I really enjoyed the class and the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0The volume of reading assigned is absolutely ludicrous. I tried to finish the readings for a significant part of the semester but soon found that they were a huge waste of time in that they have little substance and very little correlation to class material or grading. I think the class would profit a lot by a serious revision of the syllabus so that readings are manageable to a degree that it is actually possible to finish them and then maybe students would be more likely to actually do them. ",
            "\u00a0One of the strengths is the connection the class makes to the city and the places that we know (or don't know!) of here in New Haven. I thought the lectures were really interesting. However, as someone who has never taken any kind of urban studies, I struggled with some of the concepts in the readings. ",
            "\u00a0There needs to be some incentive to make people come to class. Midterm? Final? Quizzes or clicker participation? Lots of people just took advantage of this course, which is too bad because it's really important. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Canvas was well used and all of the course material was online. Therefore the material was easy to follow and the TAs were super nice.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: N/A ",

            "\u00a0this class is very dry and boring and in no way engages students in order to motivate them to listen to the presentations. ",
            "\u00a0This class should really have a final exam/midterm in order to increase student engagement in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Lecture attendance was low in this class, and I think there was a reason for this. I don't in any way understand how the coursework related to the topics discussed in lecture. Sometimes the lectures were very interesting. I would even have recommended that students not in the course attend the lectures on preservation and branding in the city--fascinating! As someone who's interested in philosophy, I'd love to see professor Rubin expand the one on preservation by looking at some theories about time, maybe Nietzsche's eternal return. Those lectures were what this course does best: articulate and hone in your attention in on things that on some subconscious level you knew about cities but never would have had the words for or contextual knowledge to put into words yourself. I really admire that! Also, Rubin is a much more engaging speaker than Plattus, so attendance would probably be higher if he solo-taught. Even if assignments and lectures weren't really related, The assignments weren't bad. I think the one instructing us to attend a New Haven meeting was fantastic; it forced me to interact with New Haven in a way that I typically wouldn't as a Yale student, and made the history and work that we were doing feel so RELEVANT (I attended a Redevelopment Agency Meeting). The primary source analysis was also good, and I had fun with it. I didn't actually understand the mapping assignment; I still got a good grade, and I think this assignment has promise, but I'd recommend that the professors flesh out the idea behind this assignment further and give more instruction to students about what it is. I think if I had a better understanding of the type of thing I was supposed to be doing, I would have engaged with the material more. The research paper was fine for me; if I'd spent more time on it, I think I could have grown more; I was a little disappointed that it didn't have to be on a New Haven topic, given that this is a New Haven class. HOWEVER, I think that this class would be EVEN BETTER if the final project were a required partnership/ internship relationship with a community organization; it was one of two options this year, but because the 'get out of Yale' option was more work, I'd be very surprised if anything but a small portion of the class decided to do it, which is disappointing. Make it mandatory! That would tap into what is so valuable about this course more directly than the research paper does: forcing us to look outside the Yale bubble and engage with the city we live in. I could see another option being if a student attended multiple meetings of a committee or organization and wrote about what they were doing over time, or something like that. Some last comments: I wish that we had an option to think critically and interrogate the ideas that outside speakers brought in, perhaps through section discussions. The \"headlines\" format of the last lecture was cute, but I think I would have preferred a more profound conclusion. I don't know why the first class readings talked about things like the topographical formation of New Haven--too far back. ",
            "\u00a015 pages is far too long for a final paper for a lecture course like this. 10 would have been more reasonable and interesting. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths of the course are the readings and guest lecturers that bring a lot of interest outside perspectives to the course. The readings are fascinating and I leaned a lot from them.\r\n\r\nThe weakness of the course is that the lectures could be very dull and un-engaging. the assignments didn't really have to specifically relate to any of the readings to lectures so I felt that it was easy to be less engaged in the material. ",
            "\u00a0Assignments not related to class. ",
            "\u00a0Section was often boring because of lack of student participation. My section was 80% athletes who showed up without having done the reading and who did not contribute to conversation. I would have liked a more engaged group of people to talk about the information with. \r\nThis class was really easy and really interesting. Would 100% recommend. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures weren't very engaging, but my TF made the discussion interesting. ",
            "\u00a0On paper, this class is great because it checks all of the boxes  broader theoretical explanations, case studies that are very close to home, a combination of history and sociology that should appeal to a wide variety of students. Prof. Rubin and Prof. Plattus were both extremely knowledgeable and passionate about what they were teaching, and that was a big plus. However, I found lecture relatively unengaging and was frustrated by the dip in attendance I saw throughout the semester (which made me feel like being in class wasn't important) and the fact that none of our assignments seemed to require us to pay much attention in lecture. I think having fewer assignments with a stronger correlation to our lectures, and presentations that were more exciting or grounded in more case studies, would improve the course. I also really enjoyed the guest speakers but felt that I learned more from some than others. ",
            "\u00a0The most glaring weakness of this course was that there was virtually NO discussion of race. It is impossible to talk about the city without engaging critically with race. Please, for the sake of this course's longevity, incorporate race as a central tenet of the lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The sections were this courses greatest strength. Courses like this one should be centered around discussion. Lecture was fairly boring. ",

            "\u00a0None of the readings or lectures were relevant for assignments. Some lectures felt irrelevant. ",
            "\u00a0I thought that the assignments were a great progression from readings and lectures. They were also not your typical writing assignment which made the class more interesting for me. I wish that this was a writing credit class however. \r\nI think the lectures could have been slightly more engaging or maybe more interactive, but I enjoyed going to class every Tuesday and Thursday. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were generally uninspiring, I did not anticipate the level of architecture and art involved and I had no interest in any of that. More attention being paid to the harms of urban planning would be good: these often felt relegated to the footnotes of lectures about the grand ideas of rich white men. ",
            "\u00a0There isnt a crucial link between lecture and papers. It doesnt feel like you have to go to class to do well. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Profs. Rubin and Plattus have a great deal of knowledge between them about urban planning and city history, so it was edifying to have them both teach the class. The readings were very interesting, not especially time-consuming, and I enjoyed doing them. I think it's wonderful that the course is open to New Haven residents.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: The lectures were sometimes a little bit boring  in fact, I thought that the readings were often more interesting. There also is no real incentive to attend lecture. Also, it often felt like there was no information about the assignments until just before they were due  my TF often alluded to the fact that he and his fellow TFs knew very little. Finally, I don't think the final essay should be so prompt-less and unlimited in its scope; it would have been helpful to have more guidance from the professors themselves on it. ",
            "\u00a0In the course, there were about 4 weeks that were truly interesting and engaging. The problem is that you had to keep paying attention through the first 6, which were incredibly boring. As a result, I did not get as much out of the class as I could have. ",
            "\u00a0Lectures, owing to their variety of foci and lecturers, are pretty hit-and-miss--some are fantastic, some are fine, and some are just meh. I think a more thematically cohesive semester-long arc would help mitigate this. That would means sacrificing breadth for the sake of depth, but I think that's worth it, even in a survey lecture course. Also, students had no incentive to attend lectures so many would frequently skip. There can probably be some kind of system implemented to encourage better attendance.\r\n\r\nI loved all of the assignments--doing them was both fun and deeply educational. The readings, though sometimes long, were also consistently fascinating and sometimes even mind-blowing. Those were the strongest aspects of the course: the assignments and the readings. Taking the course might be worth it just for those. ",
            "\u00a0Many people did not come to lecture ",
            "\u00a0The guest lectures were great. It gave the students an opportunity to learn from community leaders. The lectures weren't necessary to do well in the class however because we had no final or midterms. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly, this course required very little work. You could complete any assignment or contribute to any section without ever opening the readings. I wish the course pushed us a little more to engage with the material. ",
            "\u00a0Does a great job bringing in others voices to lecture which is important because community members deserve to talk for themselves. Lectures are usually engaging. Section depends on who is in the group but the TFs were engaged. ",
            "\u00a0The course was very well organized and had several guest lecturers come in to speak, which made lectures quite engaging. The sections were also well structured. The professors were easy to communicate with and were so willing to help their students in their research. ",
            "\u00a0Prof. Rubin's lectures were great and Prof. Plattus's were good. The reading list was well-chosen and nicely varied. The opportunity to do a community-based learning project was great, as were the other assignments. Some of the guest speakers (the journalists, and Papachristos) were very good.\r\n\r\nThe list of guest speakers could be chosen better. I thought Doug Hausladen and Matt Nemerson were cool to listen to but also they were kind of frustrating in their frequent disconnectedness. Elijah Anderson was great twenty years ago but his style of ethnography feels a little pass at this point. I also didn't learn that much from Alison Cunningham and would have rathered hearing from someone involved with providing low-income housing. It was surprising how few women and people of color we heard from considering the demographic makeup of the city.\r\n\r\nThe professors should provide more resources for starting community-based learning projects at the start of the term.

            "\u00a0The strengths of this class are the projects/essays - all were very interesting to research and dig into. The teaching fellows are also very strong and great at explaining the material. I sometimes felt the lecture was lacking structure, leaving me a bit lost about the material. I also wish there had been clear assignment sheets for the many papers. ",

            "\u00a0The lectures are very hard to follow. They seem unrelated to the course and it is very difficult to apply them to New Haven until the guest lectures later on in the year. Maybe I was just not well read enough to understand the language the professors were using but I really got very little from lecture. ",
            "\u00a0The teachers were both very knowledgable about the subject. ",

            "\u00a0A lot of the information given in lecture seemed irrelevant to the required assignments. The guest lectures in particular seemed random. The lectures could be more streamlined and organized so students are forced to interact with the lecture material in the assignments and papers. Section, though, was extremely connected to the lectures, but this might be dependent on the TA. Though all the information printed was interesting, the lectures, sections, and assignments could be more thoroughly connected. ",
            "\u00a0The class felt like it lacked some organization. For example, the syllabus was not finalized until November. I think some more structure would benefit the class. However, both professors were very engaged in the material, and that made lecture enjoyable. ",
            "\u00a0The lectures were mostly very engaging. It starts out slow, with colonial settlement, etc but by the time we got to City Beautiful the lectures started speeding up and getting more interesting. The great strength of the course is the guest lectures -- many city officials, journalists, academics who have studied New Haven, nonprofit employees, etc visited our class and provided much-needed experiential analysis of the city. Profs Rubin and Plattus really know their stuff, but they are definitely architecture professors, and because I don't have a great interest in architecture I preferred having lecturers from Yale Sociology, the NH Independent, the City, various nonprofits, etc come talk to us from their perspective. The class is not very demanding, which is nice because I mostly just had fun. The field projects were cool and required me to exercise my archival research skills, but were all very open-ended. I loved that so many auditors who are just city residents came to lecture every day, because it made the course feel like a community project, and provided a ton of different perspectives for the undergrads in the course.

            "\u00a0Good overview, but the lectures often lacked specificity. Would have appreciated fewer guest speakers and more analysis of specific case studies from the professors! ",
            "\u00a0The professors that lectured were great and very organized in their material. It was a very interesting class with not a crazy workload so it is a great class to take outside your major if you want to learn more about the history of New Haven. "

I struggled to take notes in lecture because there was literally nothing of importance to write down. Readings are incredibly long but also totally unnecessary as they have no correlation to your grade. This is in no way an academic class. Debate is stifled by an overwhelming leftist political spin (and I consider myself quite progressive in general) and there is no room for individual thought. I took this class because I heard that it was easy, and as far as work goes it was, but surely there must be a better way to spend a Yale credit. ",

The lectures can be really interesting, but some seem unconnected to the rest of the material, especially the guest lecturers. This is much more a class about cities rather than about New Haven. It is too easy to get by in the class without engagement, which is a shame. That being said, the material for those who choose to engage is interesting and has many applications for the future of urban planning. ",

They are not necessary or likely even correlated with course performance (in my experience).\r\n\r\nThe readings are excellent and well-chosen - they will actually teach you a lot, especially Doug Rae. Do them! (Though, again, not *necessary* for good course performance).\r\n\r\nWhat *is* necessary is section attendance and participation. My TA was great and ran some very interesting and educational sections, bringing in guest speakers, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, while I did mention lecture attendance and doing the readings aren't necessary to do well in the course, I would not say it is a gut. What *is* necessary to do well is to speak intelligently during section and to be good at a sociological style of research/writing coming into the class (think: ethnographies). They will not teach it to you/guide you, but it is expected. Essentially, if all you want is a good grade - go to section and spend a good amount of time on each of the writing assignments.\r\n\r\nOverall: not a terribly, terribly time intensive course, but it is cool/fun and I learned a lot. Would definitely recommend. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. The lectures were low-stress yet interesting. The assignments were straightforward. The class was refreshing. ",
            "\u00a0Good class to take if you are interested in New Haven specifically. Though the class does discuss urban renewal in general, it's pretty much all focused around New Haven. Your class experience will depend a lot on who you get for section. ",
            "\u00a0the class was easy material that could be found online in order to complete the assignments. due to this many students did not show up to class. ",
            "\u00a0It's a great course if you're a first or second year trying to learn about New Haven. It's also a good introduction to the urban studies program at Yale. Elihu and Alan are great professors/lecturers. This class is not very challenging however. ",
            "\u00a0Great class. Great information to know about New Haven and cities across the country. Very interesting to learn about the urban planning of cities across the country and how it changed with different events over the years. Would recommend this class. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah, overall not too hard and important stuff to learn about. Not life-changing, but Yale students definitely should think more about the space that they inhabit in this city, and this course is a good gateway to do so through an academic context. The lectures by professor Rubin are great, the lectures by Plattus are less great. You don't really have to attend lecture though, because attendance isn't part of the grade and it doesn't really help you with the assignments. The readings are also largely irrelevant to the assignments, so I didn't do most of them. ",
            "\u00a0yes ",
            "\u00a0I already knew most of the information covered from personal interest in New Haven and urban studies, as well as having taking Professor Rubin's American Architecture and Urbanism (there was a lot of overlap between the two courses). ",
            "\u00a0This was a great class. It was very informative about relevant issues occurring in today's society. It was very good at starting conversations about controversial issues and having open discussions about them. They also brought in great guest speakers. The workload is not bad at all either. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to a student that was actually going to be engaged in the material and want to learn about New Haven as a city and the challenges that comes with the city. ",
            "\u00a0No, wasn't very engaging, with tedious assignments. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to other students. It is a total gut but is incredibly interesting and important ",
            "\u00a0If anyone is interested in urban cities, or New Haven, they should definitely take the course. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to every student at Yale because I think it covers information about the city/its relation to the university that is pretty important for everyone who lives here, even if just for 4 years (and this is something that the course itself reinforced for me). I would recommend it as a 5th course. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, but as the course stands there is very little discussion of race. If you are genuinely interested in architecture and urban growth, this course is for you. This is not a logical follow-up to Barraclough's Race, Class, and Gender. ",
            "\u00a0If you like study cities and their change over time, then this is the course for you. If you're neutral on the topic like I was, this course probably won't rope you in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. Interesting course about an interesting topic that we should all learn more about. ",
            "\u00a0Don't take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I thought that this class was wonderful, and I would definitely recommend to really anyone. This class was one I randomly showed up to during the first week of class and was super engaged in the subject matter, despite it having nothing to do with my major. ",
            "\u00a0It all comes down to picking a good TA: it's a class I would highly recommend as a fifth class as long as you're going to be in a section that's better than the lectures. ",
            "\u00a0Yes. This class was well worth the two lectures each week. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It is super fun, manageable workload, and really interesting. Very open ended assignments give a ton of freedom. ",
            "\u00a0I'd recommend this course if you're looking for a not-so-work-heavy, but still interesting, window into the growth of cities. It's also a great class to take if you want to know more about New Haven. ",
            "\u00a0It's an easy 5th class if you want to learn something about New Haven. You also can really tailor it towards your interests. ",
            "\u00a0I definitely would recommend this course, but with a caveat. This is one of those classes whose worth is almost entirely dependent on your willingness to engage. If you want, you can get by doing very little, but you'll also learn little to nothing--a waste of a credit, basically. If, though, you're willing to actually attend lecture, do the readings, and dive into the assignments, you'll be surprised by just how rich the course is and how much you can get out of it. It's a wonderfully interdisciplinary course (sometimes too much), drawing upon not just urban studies but sociology, history, and architecture. As someone who had little prior exposure to the field of urban studies, I learned a lot. I loved the assignments, especially the one about mapping urban change (did you know Noah Webster worked on his famous dictionary in a house that once stood where TD currently does?) ",
            "\u00a0Definitely! You can learn a lot if you put the work in. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommend! Professors Rubin and Plattus are so passionate and knowledgable and it is a pleasure to listen to and learn from them. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! I think everyone should take this class. It was one of my favorites. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! It's an interesting class, and you can take it wherever you want on the assignments. But if you really want to gain the most knowledge about urban planning, odds are there's another class that's going to be more of an intellectual challenge. This class is not informative for someone trying to figure out what they want to study or do in the future. But if you want to take a fun, interesting, pretty easy class, this is definitely the one. ",
            "\u00a0Great class if you want a relaxed venue to learn some history of New Haven and urban studies info. ",
            "\u00a0If you are going to only take one class with Prof. Rubin, make it American Architecture and Urbanism. This class covers a lot of the same ground, but distinguishes itself with the unusual class structure of guest speakers (which were good but of varying quality) and a bit more of a political science/issues approach. I was glad I took it because the assignments were fun and I am trying to concentrate on urban studies, but I would definitely pick Rubin's other course first (he is a fantastic lecturer). ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course if you are interested in urban studies and wish to know more about New Haven/Yale's relationship with New Haven (which is definitely interesting). ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely recommended to any and ALL students - I believe the student body at large could truly benefit from greater empathy and understanding of the surrounding community in order to bridge the Yale-New Haven divide. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone who is looking to improve their knowledge of New Haven and the formation of urban spaces. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this class to another student because I think it is interesting to learn about New Haven, a city which we interact with constantly. It is interesting to hear about the ways in which Yale has contributed to its growth. ",
            "\u00a0Yeah its still really good regardless of lecture being stupid. Every student should take the time to better understand the city they live in. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, it was a great class that all should think about taking. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommmend this class to other students because of the vague nature of assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Definitely take it if you are really intrigued by the material. If not, I'd say pass on taking this class. It is not super engaging. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course. It's a great mix of History, Sociology, and Architecture. I enjoyed getting to know more about New Haven and other cities around the country. The assignments were also diverse and interesting, including attending a public meeting and documenting change on a city block over time. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to anyone seeking a course that lacks rigor and has a light workload. However, the course does not teach as much as it could. ",
            "\u00a0Very easy class, if it fills a requirement I would recommend it. The material is fairly interesting and the assignments as such aren't bad. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this as a fifth credit class. The information is interesting, but it does not require much effort or synthesis to understand and remember. Overall, I enjoyed doing the assignments because of how much freedom we were given in choosing our topics, not really because of their relationship to the class. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend New Haven and the American City because it gives you an appreciation of the city we all spend four years in. It is also very interdisciplinary, which makes it fun. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this class to anyone interested in urban issues, or who cares about the city of New Haven and the issues that we (as students) are a part of even if not actively. It's a great history lesson on New Haven, and it's a great experience to be in a lecture hall with non-Yale-affiliated students of all ages. ",
            "\u00a0Oh fasho, must take for errybody. ",
            "\u00a0Yes if you're interested in urban studies. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, It was a great course to take that was fin and interesting. The work was not very taxing either. I recommend for students if they are deciding which path for their major they want to go down, and to see if they find the material interesting. "
