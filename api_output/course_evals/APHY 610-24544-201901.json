For really making the best use of this course, one should take 2 graduate courses in quantum mechanics and maybe one introductory course in Solid State physics. In my case I had not taken these courses, and I felt I had important gaps in my knowledge on these previous subjects, which greatly hindered my engagement and learning in this course. I felt that I had to devote huge amounts of time per week in order to be able to finish my homework assignments and keep up with the pace of the class, to the point where it negatively impacted my outcome in other courses this semester.
