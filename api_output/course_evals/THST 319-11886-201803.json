            "\u00a0This class offers the opportunity for students of all levels of dance background to study and experience what it means to use the body to tell a story. The course features regular movement practice, followed by discussions about how to use opposition and transitions, among other skills such as clarity and musicality, to choreograph and dance a story. ",
            "\u00a0This is a dance class. I learned basic dance information about opposition and transitions that can be applied to every day life. ",
            "\u00a0OPPOSITION and TRANSITION! Floor barr, Horton technique ",
            "\u00a0Learned what tools are necessary to tell a story ",
            "\u00a0I learned a great deal about the control that dancers must have over their body and how that translates into technique for other performances and presentations beyond dance. We learned a great deal about the Alvin Ailey Company and how those dancers controlled their bodies in order to achieve opposition and truly deliver those beautiful and iconic dance positions and moves. I acquired a new found love and admiration for the work done by dancers, especially for the work being done at Alvin Ailey. ",
            "\u00a0I learned explored how dancers use their bodies to tell stories through the use of opposition, good transitions, and precise attention to detail. I also gained an even deeper apprecation for dancers and specifically the work of Alvin Ailey in transforming the American Dance Scene. ",
            "\u00a0Embodying Story guided me out of my comfort zone and gave me a new perspective on my body along with dance itself. I understood how my body worked and felt and became conscious of something I was previously unconscious about. Through these various methods of learning and teaching, I grew as a dancer and as a person during the semester. ",
            "\u00a0Opposition and transitions!! Not only did I learn a lot about how to move the body intentionally using opposition and transition to embodying a story through dance and body movement, but I also learned how to better connect to my own self and body to be more confident and intentional with my body in all its movement! "

            "\u00a0strengths: moving every class, getting out of my comfort zone, learning about \"Revelations\" Professor Robinson is such an expert and is so smart about her craft. I loved learning how the principles of good storytelling through dance can apply to other crafts. \r\nweaknesses: dance can be kind of gendered and I was a little nervous about being a nonbinary person in class. I do not identify as a woman, but it felt hard to bring this up. ",
            "\u00a0This class has such an incredibly well-rounded approach to the topic of storytelling and dance. The course uses readings, videos, reflections, and a visit to the Yale Center for British Art to explore the class concepts, and it also features many guest speakers and a trip to see the Alvin Ailey Company. These aspects, along with movement practice and class discussions, help teach the material well. Since the readings require only excerpts of the books assigned for the class, it would be nice to have these shorter snippets just scanned into Canvas and available as files, since it can be a burden to buy several books only to read a couple chapters from each of them. Beyond this small detail, the class is incredibly well done. ",
            "\u00a0Taking a dance class was a nice way to destress in a structured way twice a week for two hours reconnecting and developing a deeper understanding of my body. Professor Robinson is a wonderful human being who really cares  about dance and presenting dance as an accessible and useful art from. However, for our midterm paper she told us to \"not think of anything new\" and \"don't be creative\". I felt like class offered little room for new thoughts, made up of regurgitating what she wanted to hear. Assignments often felt redundant.  I was really excited for the intersections of the course with african american studies, but I don't think we learned or studied any or enough material that could qualify this course as an AFAM credit. I wanted so much more out of this course than I felt like was offered. ",
            "\u00a0I think one of the best things was having so many guests who are doing what they come to talk about and are excited to come talk to us. I was so humbled by everyone who took the time to come and am grateful that they were invited. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: Great experience; learned so much about how to tell story, not simply in dance but in many other areas of life\r\nWeakness: assignments were always given last minute ",
            "\u00a0I loved the consistency of the course and I could expect the same thing every time I stepped onto the floor. I really enjoyed the comraderie that it called for between the class. I think Ms. Robinson could do with updating her Alvin Ailey visual material, showing a little of the new and the old, but orbiting around such a fantastic company is an incredible learning tool. She has so much to say about her time there and she is constantly reflecting on her work and experience. ",
            "\u00a0I gained so much from this course through the Floor Barre exercises and discussions in class. I thought that there was a good balance between theory and practice. The only thing I think could be improved is the organization of assignments. A lot of the times it was a bit unclear to me what was expected for assignments. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: amazing teacher subject. Very interactive and she always give you her full, undivided energy and attention. Class was high energy and fun every day! She was always giving feedback during class and helping you.\r\n\r\nNo real weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0Really fabulous class -- strength in the professor (wow!!), class size, the way it is different from other classes at Yale, its floor work, etc. \r\n\r\nImprovement: writing prompts were at times a bit repetitive, but overall not really a problem! Would have also enjoyed a few more dance combinations (choreography, across the floor, etc.) as they were fun and challenging! "

            "\u00a0yes but not necessarily if you have struggled with an eating disorder. Some of the body-talk can be triggering. ",
            "\u00a0I highly recommend this course to those in Theater Studies, as the skills are extremely useful and applicable to the work of those in the major, but I would also recommend this course to anyone interested in storytelling or dance as well. The final assignment is a short performance that you choreograph for yourself, which is extremely gratifying to do regardless of dance background, because you see/feel the ways in which you grew through the course of the class. ",
            "\u00a0Yes! Professor Robinson in awesome! And I learnt a lot about how to use my body in the class. ",

            "\u00a0YES! Especially if you are looking to do creative and performance work for the rest of your life (not necessarily dance). The course is really centering and really inspiring for you to go out and present yourself and your work as best as possible. I look forward to using what I learned in class at other performances. ",
            "\u00a0I would definitely recommend this course to EVERY Yale Student!! It was an absolute honor to learn from Renee Robinson for a whole semester. Her presence alone just speaks so much as she does everything with such care, intentionality, and grace. This was one of the best classes I've taken at Yale and I'm so thankful to have had the opportunity to take it. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, this class changed my perspective on dance. It broadened my horizons and opened my eyes to a part of my world I had previously closed off. ",
            "\u00a0YES -- no matter your dance background!! Ms. Robinson is absolutely amazing and treats each student with respect, trust, confidence, and warmth! Incredible guests, wonderful opportunity to see Alvin Ailey live, and just once in a lifetime chance to work with a fabulous/celebrated dancer and human! "
