            "\u00a0Many people might cite the lack of concrete structure as a weakness, but I didn't find it to be much of a problem. Professor Scott had some general goals and topics he wanted to hit, but he left room for the students to alter this to an extent based on what we found most interesting. Using SuperCollider was really awkward and difficult at first, but it got better as you learned it and we could always go to office hours or send an email if we needed help/clarification. As students have said in the past, there were times when the instructions/goals/expectations of an assignment were rather vague, but he tried to improve this as the semester went on with some degree of success.  I suppose at times, my not knowing whether or not my assignment was good enough encouraged me to spend more time improving it. ",

            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to a student who is interested in the intersection of computer science and music. This was the reason I took the course despite very mixed course evaluations, and I found it to be really interesting. ",
            "\u00a0I would recommend this course to any student interested in computer music or music in general with programming experience. The programming language used in the course is not fantastic from a computer science perspective but fits the applications very well, so don't take it as a generic CS course. "
