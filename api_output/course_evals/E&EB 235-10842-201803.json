            "\u00a0- this is a great exploration of evolutionary medicine ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to think critically about biology. I learned how to ask questions and tackle difficult problems. I learned how to read the current biological literature, and I also learned an absolutely dazzling amount about evolutionary medicine. ",
            "\u00a0I learned more in this class than any other class I've taken at Yale (and maybe more than a few of them combined.) I learned how to quickly read scientific papers and rely and believe in myself instead of waiting for a peer or TA to explain the relevant takeaways. I also learned how to do literature searches to inform my thinking or explain tough concepts and then apply that knowledge to the bi-nightly reading responses. ",
            "\u00a0This course provided a broad and deep introduction to the evolutionary concepts relevant to medicine.  Throughout the course, it was emphasized that evolution is a basic science for medicine.  Lot's of great skills were developed in reading the scientific literature and writing a research paper in the sciences. ",
            "\u00a0The main takeaway from this class was learning how to consider questions and problems in medicine from an evolutionary perspective, which required the development of certain methods of critical thought and questioning. The reading responses and final paper made me a better writer and helped me learn how to better put my thoughts and analysis into concise words. ",
            "\u00a0I developed a much deeper knowledge about how evolution has shaped modern medical issues. "

            "\u00a0Strengths \r\n- excellent feedback and conversations with professor \r\n- professor and TF are very accessible and responsive to feedback from students and open-minded \r\n- excellent discussions and exciting and engaging material \r\n- superb organization \r\nWeaknesses \r\n- reading response work was at times too great and made it hard to work on the paper, but the professor addressed that by giving fewer questions toward the end of the semester \r\n- sometimes it's hard to tell by the wording of the questions that they are open ended. I felt that sometimes I searched for a very exact answer when there was not one, but maybe that is a me problem. Although, some indication that these questions are open-ended might be helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The course was amazing. Steve is absolutely amazing, and cares deeply about his students. ",
            "\u00a0No weaknesses I can think of. The course is structured perfectly, with just enough expected each lecture so the workload is fairly constant throughout. Even the final 20-page paper would have been well paced if anyone had actually started it when Prof. Stearns wanted us to. ",
            "\u00a0This class has so many strengths.  Steve is a great instructor, and the level of care he puts into designing the course, providing individualized detailed feedback daily, and engaging the students in class pay off big time for student learning.  Homework never feels like a chore, and class is always fascinating.  The only weakness of the course is the discussion section.  Having a discussion section in an 11-person discussion based seminar didn't really help much, and I'm not sure it was necessary to the course. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths: The format of the class (seminar-style, discussions led by students rather than the instructor) resulted in a highly interactive setting that made this course by far the most engaging I have taken so far. Professor Stearns was extremely knowledgeable about the topic and had many nice stories to tell, and every class was pretty interesting. The feedback on the reading responses was excellent (Professor Stearns and the TF read and comment on every single response the morning following submission), and the final paper was set up so that we did not fall behind on drafts. The final paper is very open-ended and allows you to write about a topic of your own choosing, which can be really rewarding.\r\n\r\nWeaknesses: none really ",

            "\u00a0I definitely recommend this course if you have any interest in medicine at all. This class is amazing, and Steve is so helpful, genuine, and engaging. This class has to be the best class I have taken in my four years at Yale. You have to put in a lot of effort, the material can be tough sometimes, and it can be intimidating at first, but over time it becomes easier for someone like me (I used to cry after every class I had to speak in), and I felt supported. I felt like I learned so much material on a fascinating subject I never even heard about.  I also learned so much from my classmates. This class has changed my perspectives on disease and medicine. I am so grateful to have had this experience. Plus, Steve is a great professor with funny stories and an interesting life. I recommend having lunch with him if you can. ",
            "\u00a0Yes.  Far and away the best class that I have taken while at Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Yes!!!! If you're remotely interested in STEM, evolution, writing, medicine, anything, you will learn immensely from this course. No one (Stearns included) will tell you it'll be easy or you'll get a good grade automatically, but if you put in the work on the reading responses you'll be so proud that it won't really matter what the final grade you get is. If you think you won't be able to commit a consistent and significant effort, though, don't waste the professor's and the class' time, since you can't come to class if you haven't done the responses, and it was very clear who was putting in work and who was not. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely take this course.  Steve is wonderful, the class is wonderful, and you will learn so so so much while having a great time. ",
            "\u00a0Yes - I would encourage anyone remotely interested in medicine/biology to take this course. The professor is extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter, and the workload (which is a bit higher than average) is well worth the effort. The bulk of the grade for this course (50%) comes from writing a lengthy final paper that is on any topic of your choice. Classes themselves are based on discussion of the material, which you are expected to know prior to class - as a result, the classes let you hear your classmates' thoughts and perspectives, which is really engaging and interesting as opposed to a simple lecture. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, I absolutely loved this class. Stearns is an engaging professor and fascinating person in general. It is a great course for those who hope to pursue an MD, MPH, or PhD after graduating. It is really challenging though and you may often find yourself spending hours on the reading responses. The final paper is a big challenge too as it is a 20 page paper. However, in spite of all of this, it was a good time. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely - Prof Stearns facilitates learning and interesting discussion, and it was a pleasure to take his course. "
