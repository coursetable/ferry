            "\u00a0Overall, the class is better than it used to be. Still a bit disorganized because time was split between 2 different locations. Also, there were several weeks where we weren't able to actually perform experiments because cells died, there weren't enough cells, or we didn't have the necessary reagents/tools to do the experiments. Another slightly weird thing was the submission of a single report for the entire group. This usually led to one person bearing the weight of the group and others being able to slack off. Also, Prof Fahmy was not present after the first 2 lectures (which really weren't relevant or useful to the rest of the course) so it was mostly taught by the TFs. ",
            "\u00a0Instructor could be MUCH more involved in the course. ",
            "\u00a0Sean and Philip were wonderful TAs who were great at instruction and execution of the labs, and they made the labs interesting and enjoyable. I really liked how hands-on the labs were and made me feel more like a biomedical engineering major instead of doing labs just to understand scientific concepts. This course really highlighted applications in the field and what actually happens in the industry. ",

            "\u00a0class was well run by the TFs, and it was great to be able to develop nanoparticles and actually characterize the response by cells, etc. it is one of the rare courses in which you see continuity through the semester. On the other hand, not too many concepts were covered. But it was good, 0.5 credit lab! ",
            "\u00a0The professor doesnt show up to any of the lectures and runs the class irresponsibly. The TAs make the course, and they did a very good job with it this semester ",
            "\u00a0Overall, the course was good - perhaps a little more direction on lab reports in general, but in the grand scope of things, the course was well run by the TAs, and it was well facilitated for learning. ",
            "\u00a0The modules are fairly interesting, however a very big weakness of the course is that the professor leading this lab never shows up. ",
            "\u00a0The TFs for this course are awesome, they provided a lot of help in lab and were really responsive when it came to the assignments. That said, the assignments weren't always clear and we didn't really get any feedback on the reports until the end of the course which made it hard to improve on any previous mistakes. ",
            "\u00a0TAs were incredibly helpful and hands on. The lectures were not as helpful. ",
            "\u00a0The best part of the class is that the curriculum seems to have been rebooted by the best TA I have ever had, Sean Bickerton. The skills I learned were super helpful and in line with where my interests lie. The biggest weakness is the absence of the professor. Sean and Phillip, the TAs, basically ran the classnot only facilitating the labs but also organization of the class and grading. I saw Prof. Fahmy thrice the entire semester. ",
            "\u00a0The only problem with this course was the timeliness of things. Prof. Fahmy was completely MIA the entire semester, save the first two lectures he delivered. The TAs were really good with running the class, so a great improvement from last year's course evaluations! It was just that everything was delayed still, posting of protocols, grading of reports, etc. ",

            "\u00a0Strengths: Sean and Philip, our TAs. Without them, this course would surely have been a disaster, as the course reviews from previous years suggest. Sean and Philip did a wonderful job designing lab modules that built off each other so that we could continually apply newly acquired knowledge. They also helped foster a supportive, collaborative environment among all the students. Weaknesses: We ran into a lot of issues with ordered equipment not arriving on time and limited space/supplies in the new classroom -- these issues will hopefully be resolved in future years. It would also been nice to get feedback on the lab reports earlier, so we could know what mistakes to correct before turning in future lab reports. ",

            "\u00a0This was overall a decent class, though the material is not particularly conducive for lab settings because they require a lot of time and days. You have to take this class as a BME major. ",
            "\u00a0The only reason this class functioned at all was because of our TA Sean, who was great and appeared to do literally everything. Professor Fahmy only showed up to two classes, and he was about half an hour late to both of those. There's not enough functioning equipment for the course to run very efficiently, so sometimes relatively basic experiments took a long time because we were waiting for pipettes or mass balances to be available. No one really knew what to expect from grading because our professor was never there and we weren't sure how involved he would end up being in the process. ",
            "\u00a0Yes, if you're a biomedical engineering student, it's a little, cool applied course. not very much work, though the instructor (fahmy) could be much more organized and involved. ",
            "\u00a0I would not recommend this course to another student. The only reason I had a decent time in this lab was because the TF knew what he was doing and singlehandedly taught the course. The modules are kind of interesting, you learn to make nanoparticles and you learn basic cell culture techniques. The labs take two weeks. There was no final, instead we had a really easy lab in which your group has to determine what your mystery nanoparticle is and then give a presentation. ",
            "\u00a0Honestly it had a really bad rep from previous years but I thought the course was pretty great. ",
            "\u00a0It's required for BME, but it's honestly the best required lab you'll do for all of Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Okay, so this class seems to have had a major curriculum reboot, courtesy of Sean Bickerton. Not sure when Sean will be leaving TAing this course, but as long as he is there and the curriculum remains largely the same, this class is fine and you do some cool stuff. You will never see Prof. Fahmy and he will not know how the TAs have even structured the class and the grading. Nanoparticles are cool and I learned a lot about them. ",
            "\u00a0It's a BME requirement... Sean and Philip were great TAs. If Sean is gone, be ready for chaos. He's TA'ed it for a couple years now, so he knows what he is doing. ",
            "\u00a0ye depending on the TAs, tarek as a prof is very meh ",
            "\u00a0I want to be very clear: this class was tolerable (and also fun at times!) because of our exceptional TAs, Sean and Philip, and because of the professor's lack of involvement. Prof. Fahmy only showed up a handful of times -- once, over an hour late without notifying us in advance -- and when he did, his jumbled lectures and frustrating instructions only served to confuse us and slow us down unnecessarily. In his absence, though, I thought the class ran very smoothly, which might justify why this year's course reviews are much better than previous years'. BME majors don't really have a choice because BENG 356L is a required course, but for other people interested in the subject material, I would only recommend it if there are competent TAs. "
