            "\u00a0I learned so much about the Middle East, petrocapitalism, imperialism, state formation, and the mechanics of marginalization. Also, I learned how to be a better writer, how to be a better researcher and historian, and how to be a more informed citizen in the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt a lot in this course about knowledge production, imperial powers and their interest in oil, the US as an empire, the use of race as a colonizing tool, state-building and social movements in the Middle East and other regions like the Niger Delta and Ecuador. I also learnt about critical ways to look at and understand Middle Eastern studies.\r\n\r\nMost importantly, I took away skills on writing well, about how to be more critical in reading the news or approaching scholarship, and to understand the importance of historicizing in understanding current events, especially through our assigned research papers. ",
            "\u00a0Though the subject matter of this course is fascinating, the most important thing I learned was how to approach history and my consumption of information. It may sound cliche to say that this course changed the way I view the world, but it is true. I now view all news sources, historical documents, academic papers, etc. through a more critical lens. ",
            "\u00a0You're going to read loads on concepts you've never engaged with before. You're going to be pushed. You're gonna learn how to use archives and to master a literature review and truly embody a historian's style of writing. If this sounds even a little interesting to you, take this class. Because it's better than you can imagine and absolutely worth the work. ",
            "\u00a0I learnt how to read efficiently and critically, and to write clearly and concisely, along with a number of research skills. I also learnt a lot about the role oil plays in our society, its intersection with governments, corporations and other institutions, and how its shapes empire. ",
            "\u00a0I learned a lot about research methods, and especially about viewing research material critically. We covered how academic history and historiography works, and learned about how oil affected the development of empires and states across the globe. ",
            "\u00a0This class really challenged my basic assumptions about oil, American foreign policy, and the relationship between the two. Prior to this class, I had never considered oil's outsized influence in the world. If I did think about it, I largely thought about it as a past influence, not a present one. Furthermore, I had never even considered the US and international institutions to be the form of third wave imperialism. This class caused me to question many of my previously held assumptions about America's role in the world and the importance of oil. ",
            "\u00a0This was the first true history class Ive ever taken. I was introduced to skills in historical methods and writing in a really robust way and I will carry those skills with me to other courses and to how I consume history and media. I did not have an understanding of historiography or how to use primary sources in good historical writing before this course, but now I have a strong introduction to them. This class provides so much insight into oil history, contemporary imperialism, and the politics of how knowledge is produced and used. Every session was intense and Professor Bsheer provided stimulating readings. I am leaving this course with a new perspective on the significance of history production to rectify and nuance previous histories or contribute to activism in this way. I am informed and inspired to keep improving my writing and motivated to act and organize against imperialist actions that have devastated so much of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I learned how to manage a heavy reading load, to participate in high level seminar discussions, and to make use of office hours. I learned about the general landscape of the oil industry as it relates to the United States and major themes surrounding the production of oil. ",
            "\u00a0The class was an extremely in-depth look into the politics surrounding oil and state formation in the Middle East. It was incredibly eye-opening since all the readings explored Western politics in a more critical lens and taught us how to be critical thinkers and writers, especially when consuming media and the news. We had so many great discussions that were helpful in improving our analyses of the texts as well as with our writing abilities and word choice. This class was my favorite by far this semester and I would strongly recommend it! ",
            "\u00a0Practice with critical/analytic reading, the ability to write a history research paper, knowledge about oil history and how oil influences global structures, and general knowledge of current events of the world. ",
            "\u00a0I developed an in-depth knowledge on the beginnings of the oil industry, its relationship to the formation of empire, and the social, political, and economic consequences of oil. It was fascinating to examine this through a global perspective of various regions around the world. In addition, I learned how to produce well written papers and read strategically. Most importantly, I learned to think critically and challenge diverse thoughts. "

        [
            "\u00a0This class is engaging, challenging, thought-provoking, and amazing. There are no weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0The course structure was great! We started from a broad overview of oil, to a theoretical interpretation of empire, to a variety of books that shed insight on the various the interplay of oil and power, the US in the Middle East, social movements, knowledge production, and even approaches to the study of the Arabian peninsula. By the end of the semester, I felt our discussions were a lot richer and nuanced.  \r\n\r\nI really appreciated how the class focused on big ideas and ways of thinking, as these are skills that we will carry throughout our four years at Yale. The research paper was also an amazing opportunity to delve into your own interests, critically engage with primary sources, and even deal with primary sources-something that is very rare for a freshman to do (someone at the writing center thought that our essay was for a senior seminar!). ",
            "\u00a0The course materials were fascinating and our class discussions probed them deeply, critically questioning each piece. Each week's readings were thematically linked and provided an excellent basis for our discussions. In our discussions, Professor Bsheer pushed us to deepen our analysis and substantially support any and all claims. This course does not have any significant weaknesses. ",
            "\u00a0You get out of this course what you put in. Often, once people selected their term papers, they would stop being invested in the readings when they didn't connect specifically to their term paper's region. That said, others didn't, and they gained much more. Professor Bsheer was always ready to push everyone in class. \r\n\r\nAlso, to address one concern I've heard, it is very possible to keep up with this Arab world-centric class even if you've never had any experience with the region. It truly is a freshman seminar in that sense, even though it is relatively rigorous. ",
            "\u00a0Strengths- Incredible professor, fascinating readings and discussions, good organization, challenging and fairly graded assignments ",
            "\u00a0It was a great course overall, with very engaging material and really fascinating discussions. The only weakness was the vast amount of reading. It was a lot to get used to in the beginning. But we quickly acclimated and the readings were very worthwhile. ",
            "\u00a0I absolutely loved this class. It was interesting, engaging, and challenging. Prof. Bsheer is a fount of knowledge. The only thing I can think of is that the students often would, instead of developing their own ideas, would just look to Prof. Bsheer for the answers. I don't know how that can be addressed, but some more intellectual curiosity on the part of the students would have been nice. ",
            "\u00a0Professor Bsheer chose outstanding readings, on the whole. I feel that the reading list was too heavy for the purposes of what for many students in the course was their first college history course. The readings were often too long, and most members of the course weren't able to get through all of them and discuss them during the classes. I think it would have been better to lighten the load and make some readings optional, so students interested in reading more would have the opportunity to read them still. ",
            "\u00a0The strength of this class has to be the level of detail in which we covered each topic and the selection of readings that Professor Bsheer chose for us during the semester. Each revealed something new and I always came to class intrigued and open to understanding oil politics in a way I hadnt before. The only warning would be that since it is such a heavy reading load, sometimes the readings were a bit difficult to manage but they were always worthwhile and insightful! ",
            "\u00a0This course was definitely worth the work put into it. It changed the way I view the world and made world conflicts/world affairs more real for me. I didn't really have a strong background of any kind of history before I came into this course so I definitely had to do a little bit of work reading up on background/different events for the readings we did, and that was helpful. Writing the paper was very rewarding. I loved listening to discussions about the readings and getting to analyze them myself - it was so shocking to me, the degree of bias present in some readings, and that knowledge is going to influence how I see things for the rest of my life. ",
            "\u00a0This was by far the most rewarding course I have taken at Yale. It was everything I hoped for in my college experience, and challenged me to go beyond my previous way of reading, writing, and thinking. The only weakness would be the workload. However, this was expected and rather served me well in staying motivated. "
        ],
        [
            "\u00a0Yes, yes, yes absolutely. This class was so amazing and if you have the opportunity, definitely take it. It is quite a lot of work with lots of readings and a few papers but you learn so much. More importantly, Professor Bsheer teaches you how to look critically at the history we have previously been taught and at the news we receive on a daily basis. ",
            "\u00a0This course is incredible. I definitely recommend it to every student, because it forces you to reconsider the ways in which you have learned about the world and history. It challenges you intellectually, makes you a better writer, and Professor Bsheer is a very engaging instructor who really helps you improve. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! Try to get into this course if you can! It does have a substantial workload, but it would truly change your perspective on the United States' role in the world, the Middle East, knowledge production, and the study of history. I always look forward to attending this class and engaging in our enriching class discussions. Our class also really bonded throughout the semester and it was sad to see it end. ",
            "\u00a0Anyone who has the chance to take this course absolutely should. It is helpful not only for history majors who will certainly develop critical skills for that discipline, but for anyone who consumes media and academia in all fields. This course develops critical thinking which everyone should be able to employ. That said, be ready to give this course the respect and effort it deserves. You must be prepared for class discussions having done the reading and begun to consider the themes it brings up. At the end of the course, you will be extremely grateful you did, because you will get out every ounce you put in, and more. ",
            "\u00a0It will be the toughest class you take your first semester. It will be the best class you take your first semester. If the topic material sounds interesting to you, apply apply apply. \r\n\r\nThis course is the reason you want to go to Yale. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely! It should be your number one seminar choice, and if you're lucky enough to get in, don't give up the opportunity! ",
            "\u00a0Yes. It was really interesting and the discussions were great. Just don't leave the final paper to the last minute. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this class. It is a perfect introductory class for first years. It calls into question so many of the narratives taught to us in high school. It is a way of almost unlearning all the deeply problematic things we learned. ",
            "\u00a0Absolutely. I am so grateful to have this class in my first semester. I hope it sets the tone for future courses, perhaps my major. ",
            "\u00a0If you are interested in learning about a gamut of issues related to global history and politics, including US foreign policy, the military industrial complex, human rights, environmental degradation, and more, I recommend this class. However, make sure that you have enough space in your schedule to complete the readings each week and be an effective contributor during discussions. If you are looking for an easy, low engagement course, this isn't the one for you. If you put the time and effort in, however, taking this class will pay extremely high dividends. ",
            "\u00a0I would highly recommend this course because it teaches you to think more critically and write with more impact and precision. It also touches on topics that are directly relevant in the world today and helps break down some of the misconceptions we have about power and politics. Overall, this is an incredible course and I would highly recommend it to anyone, even if you are not extremely interested in history or writing! ",
            "\u00a0Yes! But you will get out of it what you put in. ",
            "\u00a0I would absolutely recommend this course! I began this course with no real knowledge of the relationship between oil and empire, and I learned so much in a relatively short period of time. This course is the perfect example of what a successful liberal arts course should be like. "
